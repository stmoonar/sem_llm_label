[{"title": "Modelling Multimedia Indexing Algorithms Description for Implicit and Explicit Indexation", "abstract": "The increasing amount of multimedia data is generally indexed by algorithms which extract metadata that will be further queried by users for retrieving some desired information. Because of the heterogeneity and the diversity of these indexing algorithms, it is not suitable to execute at once all indexing algorithms. Actually, it will overload the information system and will also produce metadata that may not be used inside the system. For example, in a car park surveillance system, it is not necessary to apply to all the video sequences algorithms that detect persons. However, at a certain time someone might want to know about the persons that crossed the parking. It can happen that the multimedia information system returns an empty result to a query because the relevant algorithm for treating the content has not been identified or located. In this case, an algorithm application chain could produce the metadata that could give an answer to the query. In order to identify the right indexing tool(s) for the right resource(s), it would be useful to have a description attached to these tools. In this paper, we propose an indexing algorithm description model and show how to use such a model for determining an appropriate set of indexing algorithms (or sequences of algorithms) according to specific user needs, properties and execution contexts. Our proposal has been integrated in the LINDO project for implicitly and explicitly indexing multimedia contents."}, {"title": "Using social media advertisement data to monitor the gender gap in STEM: opportunities and challenges", "abstract": "Boosting the number of women and girls entering careers involving STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) is crucial to achieving gender equality, one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Girls and women tend to gravitate away from STEM fields at multiple stages from childhood through mid-career. The leaky pipeline is a metaphor often used to describe the loss of women in STEM and arguably other fields before reaching senior roles. Do interests expressed on social media mirror the leaky pipeline phenomenon? In this article, we collected advertisement data (reach estimates) from Facebook and Instagram disaggregated by US metros, age, gender, and interests related to STEM. We computed the Gender Gap Index (GGI) for each US metro and age group. We found that on Instagram, the GGIs for interest in Science decrease as users\u2019 age increases, suggesting that relatively there is evidence that that women, compared to men, are losing interest in STEM at older ages. In particular, we find that on Instagram, there are plausible relative trends but implausible absolute levels. Nevertheless, is this enough to conclude that online data available from Instagram mirror the leaky pipeline phenomenon? To scrutinize this, we compared the GGIs for an interest in Science with the GGIs for placebo interests unrelated to STEM. We found that the GGIs for placebo interests follow similar age patterns as the GGIs for the interest in Science across US metros. Second, we attempted to control for the time spent on the platform by computing a usage intensity gender ratio based on the difference between daily and monthly active users. This analysis showed that the usage intensity gender ratio is higher among teenagers (13\u201317 years) than other older age groups, suggesting that teenage girls are more engaged on the platform that teenage boys. We hypothesize that usage intensity differences, rather than inherent interest changes, might create the illusion of a leaky pipeline. Despite the previously demonstrated value and huge potential of social media advertisement data to study social phenomena, we conclude that there is little evidence that this novel data source can measure the decline in interest in STEM for young women in the USA."}, {"title": "Reproducible Cross-border High Performance Computing for Scientific Portals", "abstract": "To reproduce eScience, several challenges need to be solved: scientific workflows need to be automated; the involved software versions need to be provided in an unambiguous way; input data needs to be easily accessible; High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are often involved and to achieve bit-to-bit reproducibility, it might be even necessary to execute the code on a particular cluster to avoid differences caused by different HPC platforms (and unless this is a scientist's local cluster, it needs to be accessed across (administrative) borders). Preferably, to allow even inexperienced users to (re-)produce results, all should be user-friendly. While some easy-to-use web-based scientific portals support already to access HPC resources, this typically only refers to computing and data resources that are local. By the example of two community-specific portals in the fields of biodiversity and climate research, we present a solution for accessing remote HPC (and cloud) compute and data resources from scientific portals across borders, involving rigorous container-based packaging of the software version and setup automation, thus enhancing reproducibility."}]
