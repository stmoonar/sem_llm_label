            "title": "A Two-Stage Strategy for UAV-Enabled Wireless Power Transfer in Unknown Environments",
            "abstract": "Due to the outstanding merits such as mobility, high maneuverability, and flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are viable mobile power transmitters that can be rapidly deployed in geographically constrained regions. They are good candidates for supplying power to energy-limited Sensor Nodes (SNs) with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-enabled WPT system that transmits power to a set of SNs at unknown positions. A key challenge is how to efficiently gather the locations of SNs and design a power transfer scheme. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize these objectives: maximization of UAV's search efficiency, maximization of total harvested energy, minimization of UAV's flight energy consumption and maximization of UAV's energy utilization efficiency. To tackle these issues, we present a two-stage strategy that includes a UAV Motion Control (UMC) algorithm for obtaining the coordinates of SNs and a Dynamic Genetic Clustering (DGC) algorithm for power transfer via grouping SNs into clusters. First, the UMC algorithm enables the UAV to autonomously control its own motion and conduct target search missions. The objective is to make the energy-restricted UAV find as many SNs as feasible without any priori known location information. Second, the DGC algorithm is used to optimize the energy consumption of the UAV by combining a genetic clustering algorithm with a dynamic clustering strategy to maximize the amount of energy harvested by SNs and the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts.",

However, due to the dynamics of vehicles, IoV suffers from unstable communication links between vehicles, which reduces the delivery ratio of vehicle advertising. To address this challenge and progress beyond the state-of-the-art work, this letter adopts Digital Twin (DT) to construct a social relationship model of vehicles and proposes a seed determination scheme for advertising dissemination. On this basis, a Deep Q-network (DQN)-based vehicle advertising dissemination scheme is proposed to determine the updating frequency of the seeds and further improve dissemination efficiency.",

            "abstract": "With the wide application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), performing search and rescue missions autonomously in unknown environment has become an increasingly concerning issue. In this article, we propose an adaptive conversion speed Q-Learning algorithm (ACSQL). Performing UAV missions autonomously is divided into two stages: rescue mission search stage and optimal path search stage. In the first stage, a UAV can find task points as soon as possible, and the efficiency of exploration is increased by adaptively adjusting the speed of the UAV. In the second stage, to get a secure and short path, we propose a subdomain search algorithm. Based on the above two stages, we improve state space and action space in reinforcement learning, and design a composite reward function, finally obtain the path of UAV to perform multiple search and rescue missions through this algorithm. In order to solve the problems of slow training convergence and high uncertainty, we initialize the Q-table by combining detection information of UAV sensors in first stage. Simulation results show that ACSQL algorithm can realize autonomous navigation and path planning of UAV in an unknown environment. Compared with traditional action space, the learning process of UAV converges faster and more stable, and it can converge in about 30 episodes. Compared with DDPG algorithm and IDWA algorithm in different scenarios, ACSQL algorithm has the shortest path length. Finally, ACSQL algorithm is verified by UAV simulator Airsim.",

In this paper, to improve the content hit rate (CHR) and the utilization efficiency of the limited caching capacity, we put forward a caching content placement strategy by predicting the user preference and the content popularity, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are introduced into the D2D networks to provide computation offloading services to the users. A dynamic resource allocation optimization algorithm (DRAOA) is proposed to deploy UAVs and plan UAVs trajectory adaptively according to the users' task requirements.

Besides, the UAV group has the advantages in the number and functions that a single UAV does not have.

This paper, from the perspective of cooperative control and material escort of the UAV group, solves the escort problem in the UAV group cruise. Then, an autonomous cooperative flocking algorithm for heterogeneous UAV swarm (ACHF) is proposed. Firstly, the movement control factor of the escort UAV is proposed, and the escort UAV is deployed in the periphery of the transport UAV in the flocking process. Secondly, the system loss function including position and angle is proposed to make the escort UAV deployed as evenly as possible in the periphery of the transport UAV. Finally, in the case of different numbers of UAVs and different environments, the effectiveness of ACHF is supported by theoretical analysis and demonstrated by experiments. The results show that the escort UAVs can be evenly distributed in the periphery of the transport UAVs, forming a group of UAVs with autonomous cooperative capability.",

            "abstract": "A city becomes smart when society, transportation, information and communication infrastructure fuel sustainable economic growth and provide a high-quality life for humans with a wise management of natural resources.1 It is required to develop and manage a variety of innovative services that provide information to all citizens about all aspects of city life via interactive and content-based applications. Therefore, a large amount of digital media content is generated by wide aspects of life in a city, producing large volumes of communication traffic. Such a situation brings several issues, including wireless backhaul congestion, high energy consumption, and QoE satisfaction of users. To overcome these challenges, content caching is a promising solution. Benefit from the paradigm of Information-Centric Networking (ICN)2 and big data analysis, contents are effectively distributed to each caching module. Meanwhile, edge computing can also provide inspiring technology for content caching in smart cities, which can make traffic congestion be alleviated. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables the caching machine and device to choose the content that will be requested frequently soon, and select the right time to sleep, thus to reduce their energy consumption.3 Besides, to make the content caching network in smart cities more secure, the blockchain is one of the best ways to be leveraged.",

            "title": "Intelligent Content Caching Strategy in Autonomous Driving Toward 6G",
            "abstract": "The rapid development of 6G can help to bring autonomous driving closed to the reality. Drivers and passengers will have more time for work and leisure spending in the vehicles, further generating a lot of data requirements. However, edge resources from small base stations are insufficient to match the wide variety of services of the future vehicular networks. Besides, due to the high-speed nature of the vehicles, users have to switch the connections among different base stations, whereas such way will cause external latency during the data request. Therefore, it is vital to enable the local cache of vehicle users to realize the reliable autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider caching the contents in the local cache, small base station, and edge server. In practice, the request preference of some single users may be different from a whole region. To maximize the efficiency of content cache, we design a strategy that uses reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize cache schemes on different devices. The experimental results demonstrate that our strategy can enhance the cache hit ratio by 10%-20% compared with the well-known counterparts.",

            "title": "A Novel Deep Q-Learning-Based Air-Assisted Vehicular Caching Scheme for Safe Autonomous Driving",
            "abstract": "The safety driving-related content demands of vehicle users increase rapidly, especially with the development of autonomous driving. It is significantly necessary to obtain the safety-related transportation information of an area when vehicles are drove there, whether or not they are controlled by human being. However, vehicular content caching can bring issues in distributed-fashion, such as high response delay and low content response ratio because of the poor traffic condition and the obstructions of buildings. As a consequence, we adopt UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to assist the driving safety-related content caching for vehicles. Besides, since the power energy and the caching storage of UAVs are limited, it is needed to design an optimal caching scheme to guarantee the driving safety-related content demands of vehicle users as well as reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning based air-assisted vehicular caching scheme to respond to the driving safety-related content requests of vehicle users. First, a three-layered content response architecture is introduced, where an airship is leveraged to take charge of the scheduling of UAVs to improve the content response. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is built to describe the specific problem of the proposed scheme. Finally, deep Q-learning is applied to solve the multi-objective problem by learning from the history content requests of vehicle users. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of content hit ratio, response delay, being scheduling probability and packet buffering time.",
