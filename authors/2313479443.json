            "title": "Relevance Meets Diversity: A User-Centric Framework for Knowledge Exploration Through Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Providing recommendations that are both relevant and diverse is a key consideration of modern recommender systems. Optimizing both of these measures presents a fundamental trade-off, as higher diversity typically comes at the cost of relevance, resulting in lower user engagement. Existing recommendation algorithms try to resolve this trade-off by combining the two measures, relevance and diversity, into one aim and then seeking recommendations that optimize the combined objective, for a given number of items to recommend. Traditional approaches, however, do not consider the user interaction with the recommended items. In this paper, we put the user at the central stage, and build on the interplay between relevance, diversity, and user behavior. In contrast to applications where the goal is solely to maximize engagement, we focus on scenarios aiming at maximizing the total amount of knowledge encountered by the user. We use diversity as a surrogate of the amount of knowledge obtained by the user while interacting with the system, and we seek to maximize diversity. We propose a probabilistic user-behavior model in which users keep interacting with the recommender system as long as they receive relevant recommendations, but they may stop if the relevance of the recommended items drops. Thus, for a recommender system to achieve a high-diversity measure, it will need to produce recommendations that are both relevant and diverse. Finally, we propose a novel recommendation strategy that combines relevance and diversity by a copula function. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed methodology over multiple datasets, and we show that our strategy outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.

            "title": "LLASP: Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Answer Set Programming",
            "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in various natural language processing tasks, including code generation. However, while significant progress has been made in adapting LLMs to generate code for several imperative programming languages and tasks, there remains a notable gap in their application to declarative formalisms, such as Answer Set Programming (ASP). In this paper, we move a step towards exploring the capabilities of LLMs for ASP code generation. First, we perform a systematic evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs. Despite their power in terms of number of parameters, training data and computational resources, empirical results demonstrate inadequate performances in generating correct ASP programs. Therefore, we propose LLASP, a fine-tuned lightweight model specifically trained to encode fundamental ASP program patterns. To this aim, we create an ad-hoc dataset covering a wide variety of fundamental problem specifications that can be encoded in ASP. Our experiments demonstrate that the quality of ASP programs generated by LLASP is remarkable. This holds true not only when compared to the non-fine-tuned counterpart but also when compared to the majority of eager LLM candidates, particularly from a semantic perspective. All the code and data used to perform the experiments are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLASP-D86C/.",
