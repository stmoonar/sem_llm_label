            "title": "Super Resolution Graph With Conditional Normalizing Flows for Temporal Link Prediction",
            "abstract": "Temporal link prediction on dynamic graphs has attracted considerable attention. Most methods focus on the graph at each timestamp and extract features for prediction. As graphs are directly compressed into feature matrices, the important latent information at each timestamp has not been well revealed. Eventually, the acquisition of dynamic evolution-related patterns is rendered inadequately. In this paper, inspired by the process of Super-Resolution (SR), a novel deep generative model SRG (Super Resolution Graph) is proposed. We innovatively introduce the concepts of the Low-Resolution (LR) graph, which is a single adjacent matrix at a timestamp, and the High-Resolution (HR) graph, which includes the link status of surrounding snapshots. Specifically, two major aspects are considered regarding the construction of the HR graph. For edges, we endeavor to obtain an extensive information transmission description that affects the current link status. For nodes, similar to the SR process, the neighbor relationship among nodes is maintained. In this form, we could predict the link status from a new perspective: Under the supervision of the graph moving average strategy, the conditional normalizing flow effectively realizes the transformation between LR and HR graphs. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets from different applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy, one of the world's most common neurological diseases, impacts over 1% of the global population. Accurate early prediction of epileptic seizure has a great influence on epileptic patients' lives and attracted extensive attention. However, existing methods do not fully consider the complexity of multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, which is the most common measurement for epileptic seizures. In this letter, we propose a Dynamic Functional Connectivity neural Network (DynFCNet) for epileptic seizure prediction. The proposed DynFCNet can discover dynamic brain functional connections and generate dynamic functional connectivity graphs, as well as extract non-Euclidean features from multi-channel EEG signals by Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). To take Euclidean features into consideration, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as one of the branches is also employed. Further, we incorporated both intra-group loss and inter-group loss to enhance our DynFCNet. Extensive experiments were implemented on a public multi-channel EEG dataset (CHB-MIT). The results confirm that our proposal outperforms the other competitors.",

            "abstract": "Temporal link prediction on dynamic graphs is essential to various areas such as recommendation systems, social networks, and citation analysis, and thus attracts great attention in both research and industry fields. For complex graphs in real-world applications, although recent temporal link prediction methods perform well in predicting high-frequency and nearby connections, it becomes more challenging when considering low-frequency and earlier connections. In this work, we introduce a novel and elegant prediction architecture called Structure Embedded Gated Recurrent Unit (SE-GRU) neural networks, to strengthen the prediction robustness against frequency variation and occurrence delay of connections. The established SE-GRU embeds the structure for local topological characteristics to emphasize the different connection frequencies between nodes and captures the temporal dependencies to avoid losing valuable information caused by long-term changes. We realize neural network optimization considering three terms concerning reconstruction, structure, and evolution. The extensive experiments performed on three public datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of SE-GRU compared with 5 representative and state-of-the-art competitors under three evaluation metrics. The results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, by showing that the frequencies and timestamps of connections have a little-to-no negative impact on prediction accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Short-term Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (SQPF) using weather radar is an important but challenging problem as one must cope with inherent nonlinearity and spatiotemporal correlation in the data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model, named Inductive spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Networks (InstGCN), to overcome these issues in SQPF. The proposed InstGCN can learn a nonlinear mapping from historical radar reflectivity to future rainfall amounts, and extract informative spatiotemporal representations simultaneously. Specifically, we first provide a formal definition for formulating the SQPF problem from a graph perspective. Then, based on radar reflectivity and rain gauge observation, we propose a novel graph construction approach which utilizes a special elliptic structure to model the spatial dependency of precipitation area. Additionally, a new Node level Differential Block (Node-DB) is introduced to tackle the non-stationary temporal dependency. To execute inductive graph learning for unseen nodes, we design to decompose a whole graph into sub-graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets in East China and a public weather radar dataset in the south-eastern parts of France. The experimental results confirm the advantages of InstGCN compared with several state-of-the-arts.",

            "abstract": "Classification of nonprecipitation echoes of radar is an inevitable step in radar-based precipitation estimation. Among nonprecipitation echoes, clear air echoes are specifically difficult to distinguish for their similarity to precipitation echoes. This letter aims to conduct a pixelwise classification of clear air echoes for image sequences of the radar reflectivity. We propose the Static and Motion streams Network (SMNet) to simultaneously utilize the static and motion features. SMNet realizes capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics while maintaining the details of the current frame via a fusion structure and a novel training method. For feature fusion, the static and motion streams are concatenated. Then, for model training, we adopt a dynamic weight assignment strategy to further extract rich information. Finally, we validate our method on an S-band single-polarization radar in Beijing, China, from May to September 2018. The results demonstrate that the overall performance of SMNet is superior to other competitors.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and high-resolution quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) plays a crucial role in meteorology and hydrology. However, for acquiring a more accurate QPE, how to depict the complex nonlinear relationship between the radar reflectivity and the true rain rates, as well as adaptively explore the spatial dependencies of precipitation, remains extremely challenging. In this letter, we propose to incorporate the merits of graph convolutional regression networks (GCRNs) and address the aforementioned issues simultaneously in the GCRNs framework. Furthermore, in order to tolerate the variabilities of spatial correlation in the practical precipitation, we expand GCRNs with a multiconvolutional mechanism between the center node and its neighbor rain gauges. Thus, the ability to capture more complicated spatial characteristics of precipitation can be enhanced, and the phenomenon of overwhelming by the neighbor nodes can be released. Extensive experiments were implemented on 12 rainfall processes in Hangzhou, China, 2015. The experimental results confirm that our proposal consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art QPE models.",

However, generating calibrated and sharp probabilistic forecasts is challenging. In this article, a post\u2010processing approach, Mixture Probabilistic Model (MPM), is proposed to calibrate probabilistic ensemble forecasts subject to sharpness. In particular, the proposed MPM is applied to precipitation forecasting. First, the Censored and Shifted Gamma (CSG0) distribution is considered as the probability density function (PDF) for precipitation. Then, the predictive PDF of MPM is mixed by the individual PDFs which are fitted from raw ensemble members. Finally, to estimate optimal weight parameters for the mixture of individual PDFs, the Dirichlet distribution is utilized and the skills of the mixture model and individuals are both taken into consideration. The proposed MPM was tested using Innsbruck ensemble precipitation data and 6 h accumulated precipitation ensemble forecast data in east China from August to November 2017. Compared with raw forecasts and three state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art post\u2010processing approaches, MPM showed improved performance for all verification scores.
