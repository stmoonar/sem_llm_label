            "abstract": "Spectral feature differences between various materials in hyperspectral images (HSIs) allow detection of targets. In recent years, box-level hyperspectral object detection (HOD) has gained attention owing to improved spatial resolutions of HSIs. However, existing HOD methods mainly rely on spatial features and lack dedicated optimization for spectral feature extraction. Additionally, the limited high-spatial-resolution HSIs restrict their generalization capability. This paper proposes a spectral-spatial feature decoupled detector (SSFDD) to solve the above problems. First, a pixel-level detection module is proposed to decouple spectral features optimized with the dedicated loss. Meanwhile, HSIs are spectral-down-sampled to multispectral images (MSIs) for decoupled spatial features. Then, a Siamese fusion network (SFN) is designed to extract and fuse the decoupled spectral-spatial features for object detection. SBN is initialized with pre-trained models on RGB-image datasets to enhance generalization capability. Experimental results on a high-resolution HSI dataset validate the superior performance of the SSFDD.",
