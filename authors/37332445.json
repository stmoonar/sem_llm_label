            "abstract": "This paper describes our participation in the TAC-KBP 2017 Cold Start++ Knowledge Base Population task. Our SAFT system is a loosely-coupled integration of individual components processing documents in English, Spanish and Chinese. The system extracts entities, slot relations, event nuggets and arguments, performs entity linking against Freebase and event coreference, and also integrates sentiment relations extracted by external collaborators at Columbia and Cornell. The various extractions get combined, linked, deconflicted and integrated into a consistent knowledge base (one per language) for query-based evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Event extraction has become one of the most important topics in information extraction, but to date, there is very limited work on leveraging cross-lingual training to boost performance. We propose a new event extraction approach that trains on multiple languages using a combination of both language-dependent and language-independent features, with particular focus on the case where target domain training data is of very limited size. We show empirically that multilingual training can boost performance for the tasks of event trigger extraction and event argument extraction on the Chinese ACE 2005 dataset.",

            "title": "Cross-lingual Text Classification via Model Translation with Limited Dictionaries",
            "abstract": "Cross-lingual text classification (CLTC) refers to the task of classifying documents in different languages into the same taxonomy of categories. An open challenge in CLTC is to classify documents for the languages where labeled training data are not available. Existing approaches rely on the availability of either high-quality machine translation of documents (to the languages where massively training data are available), or rich bilingual dictionaries for effective translation of trained classification models (to the languages where labeled training data are lacking). This paper studies the CLTC challenge under the assumption that neither condition is met. That is, we focus on the problem of translating classification models with highly incomplete bilingual dictionaries. Specifically, we propose two new approaches that combines unsupervised word embedding in different languages, supervised mapping of embedded words across languages, and probabilistic translation of classification models. The approaches show significant performance improvement in CLTC on a benchmark corpus of Reuters news stories (RCV1/RCV2) in English, Spanish, German, French and Chinese and an internal dataset in Uzbek, compared to representative baseline methods using conventional bilingual dictionaries or highly incomplete ones.",
