            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "The availability and use of geographic information technologies and data for describing the patterns and processes operating on or near the Earth\u2019s surface have grown substantially during the past fifty years. The number of geographic information systems software packages and algorithms has also grown quickly during this period, fueled by rapid advances in computing and the explosive growth in the availability of digital data describing specific phenomena. Geographic information scientists therefore increasingly find themselves choosing between multiple software suites and algorithms to execute specific analysis, modeling, and visualization tasks in environmental applications today. This is a major challenge because it is often difficult to assess the efficacy of the candidate software platforms and algorithms when used in specific applications and study areas, which often generate different results. The subtleties and issues that characterize the field of geomorphometry are used here to document the need for (1) theoretically based software and algorithms; (2) new methods for the collection of provenance information about the data and code along with application context knowledge; and (3) new protocols for distributing this information and knowledge along with the data and code. This article discusses the progress and enduring challenges connected with these outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Earth observation imagery have traditionally been expensive, difficult to find and access, and required specialized skills and software to transform imagery into actionable information. This has limited adoption by the broader science community. Changes in cost of imagery and changes in computing technology over the last decade have enabled a new approach for how to organize, analyze, and share Earth observation imagery, broadly referred to as a data cube. The vision and promise of image data cubes is to lower these hurdles and expand the user community by making analysis ready data readily accessible and providing modern approaches to more easily analyze and visualize the data, empowering a larger community of users to improve their knowledge of place and make better informed decisions. Image data cubes are large collections of temporal, multivariate datasets typically consisting of analysis ready multispectral Earth observation data. Several flavors and variations of data cubes have emerged. To simplify access for end users we developed a flexible approach supporting multiple data cube styles, referencing images in their existing structure and storage location, enabling fast access, visualization, and analysis from a wide variety of web and desktop applications. We provide here an overview of that approach and three case studies.",

In December 2014, Esri published the initial version of the World Population Estimate (WPE) image service to ArcGIS Online. The service represents a dasymetric footprint of human settlement at 250-meter resolution. It is global and contains an estimate of the 2013 population for each populated cell. In 2016 Esri published an additional image service representing the earth\u2019s population in 2015 at 162-meter resolution. Esri\u2019s WPE is produced by combining classified land cover data indicating predominantly built-up or agricultural locations with Landsat8 Panchromatic imagery, road intersections, and known populated places. The model detects where settlement is likely to exist beyond the areas classified as predominantly built up. The result is a global dasymetric raster surface of the footprint of settlement with a score of the likelihood of human settlement for each cell of the footprint. Population data are apportioned to this settlement likelihood surface by overlaying population counts in polygons representing census enumeration units or political units representing population surveys. This paper presents the method developed at Esri for producing the estimate of settlement likelihood.",

            "abstract": "In 1964, E.H. Hammond proposed criteria for classifying and mapping physiographic regions of the United States. Hammond produced a map entitled \u201cClasses of Land Surface Form in the Forty\u2010Eight States, USA\u201d, which is regarded as a pioneering and rigorous treatment of regional physiography. Several researchers automated Hammond?s model in GIS. However, these were local or regional in application, and resulted in inadequate characterization of tablelands. We used a global 250 m DEM to produce a new characterization of global Hammond landform regions. The improved algorithm we developed for the regional landform modeling: (1) incorporated a profile parameter for the delineation of tablelands; (2) accommodated negative elevation data values; (3) allowed neighborhood analysis window (NAW) size to vary between parameters; (4) more accurately bounded plains regions; and (5) mapped landform regions as opposed to discrete landform features. The new global Hammond landform regions product builds on an existing global Hammond landform features product developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, which, while globally comprehensive, did not include tablelands, used a fixed NAW size, and essentially classified pixels rather than regions. Our algorithm also permits the disaggregation of \u201cmixed\u201d Hammond types (e.g. plains with high mountains) into their component parts.",

            "abstract": "As we contend with human impacts on the biosphere, there is rightfully a great emphasis now on community adaptation and resilience to climate change. Recent innovations in information technologies and analyses are helping communities to become more resilient. However, not often discussed in this vein is a path toward digital resilience. If mapping and information tools are to help communities, it stands to reason that they must be resilient themselves, as well as the data that they are based on. In other words, digital tools can help make communities resilient by providing data, evidence-based advice on community decisions, etc., but the resilience of the tools themselves can also be an issue. Digital resilience means that to the greatest extent possible, data and tools should be freely accessible, interchangeable, operational, of high quality, and up-to-date so that they can help give rise to the resilience of communities or other entities using them. Given the speed at which humans are altering the biosphere, the usefulness and effectiveness of these technologies must keep pace. This article reviews and recommends three fundamental digital practices, particularly from the standpoint of geospatial data and for community resilience and policy-making. These are: (1) create and implement a culture that consistently shares not only data, but workflows and use cases with the data, especially within maps and geographic information systems or GIS; (2) use maps and other visuals to tell compelling stories that many different kinds of audiences will understand and remember; and (3) be more open to different kinds of partnerships to reduce project costs, yield better results, and foster public awareness and behavioral change.",

            "abstract": "Modeling spatiotemporal phenomena can provide insight into potential behavior of simulated objects during hypothetical events. Simulation frameworks can be a useful method of modeling these scenarios, and become more flexible when developed in a fashion that facilitates automated generation of output based on variable input parameters. By connecting a simulation framework to a web-based system, a user can assign input parameters of their choosing, run a simulation, and explore the output data in a dynamic, animated, map-based context using a standard web browser. The framework described here utilizes tsunami simulation data and user input to generate a combined web-based visualization and simulation model of human response to tsunami inundation. Input parameters pertaining to human population and community of interest are provided by the user and guide automated development of a simulation model scenario of spatiotemporal human response to a hypothetical tsunami inundation event. Simulated human movement is calculated at each time step using casualty model algorithms informed by behavioral research and variables such as water depth and road networks, while a mix of server-side and client-side code renders the mapping interface and supports user interaction within the web browser. Interactive controls included in the web-based simulation viewer allow the user to manipulate the map display and query underlying data either manually by time step or interactively while animation is underway. Although modeling of human movement has inherent limitations, integration of a formal casualty model with the automated simulation framework represents a unique quantitative approach for casualty determination and simulation modeling.",

            "title": "Theory and application in a post-GISystems world",
            "abstract": "This perspectives paper uses the seminal article of Goodchild (1992) as a lens through which to review and reflect upon several longstanding issues that have influenced the field of geographic information science in the past and will continue to be important at least into the next decade. Under the category of theory, the continuing issue of \u2018tool versus science\u2019 now has implications for the defining of geographic information systems (GISs) as a profession. In turn, a brief perspective is offered on how GIS has contributed to \u2018methodological versus substantive\u2019 questions in science, leading to the understanding of how the Earth works versus how the Earth should look. Both understandings of the Earth are particularly germane to the emergence of tools and applications such as marine and coastal GIS, virtual globes, spatial cyber infrastructure, and the ethics of GIS. And in the realm of marine and coastal GIS, the example of multidimensional data structuring and scaling is used to highlight an underlying lesson of Goodchild (1992) in that theory and application are in no way mutually exclusive, and it may often be application that advances theory, rather than vice versa. Indeed, it may be this reversal that is ushering in a \u2018post-GISystems\u2019 world, where GIS is subsumed into a broader framework known simply as \u2018the web,\u2019 divorced from the desktop, but providing a new paradigm for GIS (aligned with the \u2018fourth paradigm\u2019 of Hey et al. 2009). As so much data and information will be collected spatially in a way not possible before (e.g., the \u2018big data\u2019 of global observational science), GIS will need to be both system and science to support the turn toward more place-based research across increasing scientific domains. GIS is needed also by society at large to guide the understanding of the longstanding fundamentals of geolocation, scale, proximity, distance decay, the neighborhood, the region, the territory, and more.",
