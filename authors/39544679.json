            "abstract": "The everyday consumption of household goods is a significant source of environmental pollution. The increase of online shopping affords an opportunity to provide consumers with actionable feedback on the social and environmental impact of potential purchases, at the exact moment when it is relevant. Unfortunately, consumers are inundated with ambiguous sustainability information. For example, greenwashing can make it difficult to identify environmentally friendly products. The highest-quality options, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) scores or tailored impact certificates (e.g., environmentally friendly tags), designed for assessing the environmental impact of consumption, are ineffective in the setting of online shopping. They are simply too costly to provide a feasible solution when scaled up, and often rely on data from self-interested market players. We contribute an analysis of this online environment, exploring how the dynamic between sellers and consumers surfaces claims and concerns regarding sustainable consumption. In order to better provide information to consumers, we propose a machine learning method that can discover signals of sustainability from these interactions. Our method, SustainableSignals, is a first step in scaling up the provision of sustainability cues to online consumers.",

            "abstract": "We consider after-study statistical inference for sequentially designed experiments wherein multiple units are assigned treatments for multiple time points using treatment policies that adapt over time. Our goal is to provide inference guarantees for the counterfactual mean at the smallest possible scale -- mean outcome under different treatments for each unit and each time -- with minimal assumptions on the adaptive treatment policy. Without any structural assumptions on the counterfactual means, this challenging task is infeasible due to more unknowns than observed data points. To make progress, we introduce a latent factor model over the counterfactual means that serves as a non-parametric generalization of the non-linear mixed effects model and the bilinear latent factor model considered in prior works. For estimation, we use a non-parametric method, namely a variant of nearest neighbors, and establish a non-asymptotic high probability error bound for the counterfactual mean for each unit and each time. Under regularity conditions, this bound leads to asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the counterfactual mean as the number of units and time points grows to $\\infty$ together at suitable rates. We illustrate our theory via several simulations and a case study involving data from a mobile health clinical trial HeartSteps.",

            "abstract": "We introduce and analyze an improved variant of nearest neighbors (NN) for estimation with missing data in latent factor models. We consider a matrix completion problem with missing data, where the $(i, t)$-th entry, when observed, is given by its mean $f(u_i, v_t)$ plus mean-zero noise for an unknown function $f$ and latent factors $u_i$ and $v_t$. Prior NN strategies, like unit-unit NN, for estimating the mean $f(u_i, v_t)$ relies on existence of other rows $j$ with $u_j \\approx u_i$. Similarly, time-time NN strategy relies on existence of columns $t'$ with $v_{t'} \\approx v_t$. These strategies provide poor performance respectively when similar rows or similar columns are not available. Our estimate is doubly robust to this deficit in two ways: (1) As long as there exist either good row or good column neighbors, our estimate provides a consistent estimate. (2) Furthermore, if both good row and good column neighbors exist, it provides a (near-)quadratic improvement in the non-asymptotic error and admits a significantly narrower asymptotic confidence interval when compared to both unit-unit or time-time NN.",

We present IntelligentPooling, which learns personalized policies via an adaptive, principled use of other users' data.

Recently, reinforcement learning algorithms have been found to be effective for learning the optimal context under which to provide suggestions. However, these algorithms are not necessarily designed for the constraints posed by mobile health (mHealth) settings, that they be efficient, domain-informed and computationally affordable. We propose an algorithm for providing physical activity suggestions in mHealth settings. Using domain-science, we formulate a contextual bandit algorithm which makes use of a linear mixed effects model. We then introduce a procedure to efficiently perform hyper-parameter updating, using far less computational resources than competing approaches. Not only is our approach computationally efficient, it is also easily implemented with closed form matrix algebraic updates and we show improvements over state of the art approaches both in speed and accuracy of up to 99% and 56% respectively.",

            "abstract": "To effect behavior change a successful algorithm must make high-quality decisions in real-time. For example, a mobile health (mHealth) application designed to increase physical activity must make contextually relevant suggestions to motivate users. While machine learning offers solutions for certain stylized settings, such as when batch data can be processed offline, there is a dearth of approaches which can deliver high-quality solutions under the specific constraints of mHealth. We propose an algorithm which provides users with contextualized and personalized physical activity suggestions. This algorithm is able to overcome a challenge critical to mHealth that complex models be trained efficiently. We propose a tractable streamlined empirical Bayes procedure which fits linear mixed effects models in large-data settings. Our procedure takes advantage of sparsity introduced by hierarchical random effects to efficiently learn the posterior distribution of a linear mixed effects model. A key contribution of this work is that we provide explicit updates in order to learn both fixed effects, random effects and hyper-parameter values. We demonstrate the success of this approach in a mobile health (mHealth) reinforcement learning application, a domain in which fast computations are crucial for real time interventions. Not only is our approach computationally efficient, it is also easily implemented with closed form matrix algebraic updates and we show improvements over state of the art approaches both in speed and accuracy of up to 99% and 56% respectively.",

In this work, we investigate a hybrid Massive Open Online Course for high schoolers which includes an in-person coaching component. We address the efficacy of these courses and the contribution of in-person coaching. We first analyze features of student behavior and their effect on post-test performance and then propose a novel probabilistic model for inferring student success on an AP exam post-test. Our proposed model exploits relationships between students to collectively infer student success. When these relationships are not directly observed, we formulate latent constructs to capture social dynamics of learning. By collectively inferring student success as a function of both unobserved individual characteristics and relational dynamics, we improve predictive performance by up to 6.8% over an SVM model with only observable features. We propose this general socio-behavioral modeling framework as a flexible approach for including unobserved aspects of learning in meaningful ways, in order to better understand and infer student success.",

            "abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) applications can provide users with essential and timely feedback. From physical activity suggestions, to stress-reduction techniques, mHealth can provide a wide spectrum of effective treatments. Personalizing these interventions might vastly improve their effectiveness, as individuals vary widely in their response to treatment. An optimal mHealth policy must address the question of when to intervene, even as this question is likely to differ between individuals. The high amount of noise due to the in situ delivery of mHealth interventions can cripple the learning rate when a policy only has access to a single user\u2019s data. When there is limited time to engage users, a slow learning rate can pose problems, potentially raising the risk that users leave a study. To speed up learning an optimal policy for each user, we propose learning personalized policies via intelligent use of other users\u2019 data. The proposed learning algorithm allows us to pool information from other users in a principled, adaptive manner. The algorithm combines Thompson sampling with a Bayesian random effects model for the reward function. We use the data collected from a real-world mobile health study to build a generative model and evaluate the proposed algo-rithm in comparison with two natural alternatives: learning the treatment policy separately per person and learning a single treatment policy for all people. This work is motivated by our preparations for a real-world followup study in which the proposed algorithm will be used on a subset of the participants.",

            "abstract": "Severe environmental events have extreme effects on all segments of society, including criminal activity. Extreme weather events, such as tropical storms, fires, and floods create instability in communities, and can be exploited by criminal organizations. Here we investigate the potential impact of catastrophic storms on the criminal activity of human trafficking. We propose three theories of how these catastrophic storms might impact trafficking and provide evidence for each. Researching human trafficking is made difficult by its illicit nature and the obscurity of high-quality data. Here, we analyze online advertisements for services which can be collected at scale and provide insights into traffickers' behavior. To successfully combine relevant heterogenous sources of information, as well as spatial and temporal structure, we propose a collective, probabilistic approach. We implement this approach with Probabilistic Soft Logic, a probabilistic programming framework which can flexibly model relational structure and for which inference of future locations is highly efficient. Furthermore, this framework can be used to model hidden structure, such as latent links between locations. Our proposed approach can model and predict how traffickers move. In addition, we propose a model which learns connections between locations. This model is then adapted to have knowledge of environmental events, and we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of environmental events can improve prediction of future locations. While we have validated our models on the impact of severe weather on human trafficking, we believe our models can be generalized to a variety of other settings in which environmental events impact human behavior.",

            "abstract": "Author(s): Tomkins, Sabina | Advisor(s): Getoor, Lise | Abstract: Computational techniques have much to offer in addressing questions of societal significance. Many such question can be framed as prediction problems, and approached with data-driven methods. In addition to prediction, understanding human behavior is a distinguishing goal in societally-relevant domains. In this work, I describe societally-significant problems which can be solved with a collective probabilistic approach.These problems pose many challenges to techniques which assume data independence, homogeneity and scale. In settings of societal importance, dependencies can define the data in question; from complex relationships between people, to continuity between consecutive events. Rather than being generated by single, uniform sources, data in these domains can be derived and described by heterogenous sources. Finally, though many data-driven methods depend on large amounts of observations and high-quality labels in order to guarantee quality results, in domains of critical social value it is often infeasible to gather such quantities. These challenges demand methods which can utilize data-dependencies, incorporate diverse forms of information and reason over small numbers of instances with potentially ambiguous labels.There are also many opportunities in these domains. Models concerned with societally relevant problems can draw from the knowledge established by existing academic disciplines, from the social to the natural sciences. Such knowledge can serve to inform each step of research from choosing an appropriate problem to putting results into perspective. Furthermore, there are opportunities to obtain new insights into human behavior with the abundance of data generated by virtual and online activity, and mobile and sensor networks. The scale of this data necessitates computational methods. Methods which can leverage prior knowledge and remain efficient even with large datasets can offer much in these domains.In my work I utilize a collective probabilistic approach for data-driven social good. This approach can capitalize on structure between data instances, rather than flattening it. Furthermore, it can readily incorporate domain knowledge which, especially when combined with a collective approach, is instrumental in learning from small datasets. When datasets are large, this approach leverages a class of probabilistic graphical model which offers efficient inference. Finally, this approach can be extended to model unobserved phenomena with latent-variable representations.I demonstrate the benefits of this approach in three societally-relevant domains, sustainability, education and malicious behavior. While these domains are diverse, the problems they present share several commonalities which are critical in data-driven modeling. For example, modeling data structure, from spatial relationships to social interactions, can reduce issues of sparsity and noise. Domain knowledge can also combat these issues, in addition to improving model interpretability. I show the benefits of domain knowledge in discovering sustainable products, predicting course performance and detecting cyberbullying. In both the domain of sustainability and malicious behavior, I demonstrate how to utilize spatio-temporal structure in the seemingly distinct tasks of disaggregating appliances and predicting the movements of human traffickers. In education and malicious behavior, I show how unobserved social structure is instrumental in not only modeling learning and aggression, but in interpreting these dynamics in groups. In all three domains I show how to model, represent and interpret latent structure. Thus, while making contributions to each problem setting and domain, I also contribute to the broader goal of data-driven modeling for social good.",
