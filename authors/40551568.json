            "title": "Addressing the Sustainability Issue in Smart Cities: A Comprehensive Model for Evaluating the Impacts of Electric Vehicle Diffusion",
            "abstract": "The present paper proposes a model for evaluating environmental, social, and economic impacts exerted by the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs), which is a phenomenon that can significantly affect the achievement of some of the objectives set by the Sustainable Development Agenda. The impact evaluation is carried out through the System Dynamics methodology, combined with scenario analysis. Considering the Piedmont region (Italy) as a case study, the model forecasts the impacts of EV diffusion using a simulation timeframe of 12 years and leveraging eight EV diffusion scenarios. According to the model, an increase in the number of EVs results in less air pollution and, therefore, minor public health expenditure. These cost savings can be turned into incentives for purchasing new EVs, which make the fleet increasingly greener as part of a self-reinforcing loop. Despite the fact that the model could be improved through additional research on some variables\u2019 definitions, this ex ante evaluation tool represents a valuable instrument for policy-makers. In fact, it provides a comprehensive picture of EV diffusion in view of the triple sustainability principles: System Dynamics, in particular, allows singling out causal relationships among variables, thus anticipating possible effects of planned policy actions.",

            "abstract": ". In the past years, knowledge graphs have proven to be ben-e\ufb01cial for recommender systems, e\ufb03ciently addressing paramount issues such as new items and data sparsity. At the same time, several works have recently tackled the problem of knowledge graph completion through machine learning algorithms able to learn knowledge graph embeddings. In this paper, we show that the item recommendation problem can be seen as a speci\ufb01c case of knowledge graph completion problem, where the \u201cfeedback\u201d property, which connects users to items that they like, has to be predicted. We empirically compare a set of state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings algorithms on the task of item recommendation on the Movielens 1M dataset. The results show that knowledge graph embeddings models outperform traditional collaborative \ufb01ltering baselines and that TransH obtains the best performance.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a knowledge-based decision support system (KB-DSS) to improve the preparedness of crisis situations induced by natural and technological hazards. The proposed KB-DSS aims to manage the potential cascading effects generated by a triggering hazard assessing the possible event time histories based on interconnected probabilistic simulation models. From a methodological point of view, a decision model based on two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) algorithms follows a cascading effect simulation model. This combination allows to support the decision maker in comparing a set of mitigation strategies on the basis of their expected impacts and his priorities. The algorithm is based on an ensemble approach, which combines decisions over an array of possible impact scenarios, instead of only relying on the average impact scenario. An application of the KB-DSS to the case of a possible reactivation of Nea Kameni volcano in Santorini is presented to show how the proposed architecture could be applied to a real case. The proposed methodology supports the emergency planners in making the best decisions supporting them also in the choice of the best timing for the intervention.",

            "abstract": "The shift from conventional cars to Electric Vehicles (EVs) may significantly improve air quality and consequently public health, especially if electricity is powered by renewable energy. This paper describes a System Dynamics model to estimate the environmental health impacts of alternative market scenarios for EVs diffusion in Piedmont (Italy). The scenarios account for: (a) different market shares of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and (b) different trends of EVs uptake, in accordance with official electric mobility studies. The causal relationships among the variables of this complex system generate a positive feedback loop, involving: (1) EVs uptake, (2) pollutants concentration, (3) hospital admissions, and (4) public health savings. The simulation model results in an ex-ante impact evaluation tool, which is able to perform what-if analyses of different electric mobility scenarios and to compare their 2030 projections versus a reference scenario, thus allowing a counterfactual analysis able to isolate the impacts due solely to specific actions. This study has important policy implications, since the proposed model: (a) provides an integrated and comprehensive framework that allows to account for all the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, social), (b) gives ex-ante estimates of environmental health impacts of EVs uptake according to different scenarios, and quantifies the savings derived by the reduction of public health spending, converting them in monetary incentives for EVs purchase, (c) proposes recommendations for the definition of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans of a smart city.",

The framework integrates six interoperable e-Services. We describe the core features of each e-Service and illustrate their usage in the context of four business cases: i) authoring and publishing; ii) translation and localisation; iii) cross-lingual access to data; and iv) personalised Web content recommendations.

For this purpose an evaluation framework has been developed, which includes both technological and political evaluation, and focuses on the fundamental complexities and challenges of these advanced forms of social media exploitation. It has been used for the evaluation of a pilot application of this approach for conducting a consultation campaign concerning the large scale application of a telemedicine program in Piedmont, Italy, revealing its important potential and strengths, and at the same time some notable problems and weaknesses as well.",
