            "title": "Addressing the Overfitting in Partial Domain Adaptation With Self-Training and Contrastive Learning",
            "abstract": "Partial domain adaptation (PDA) assumes that target domain class label set is a subset of that of source domain, while this problem setting is close to the actual scenario. At present, there are mainly two methods to solve the overfitting of source domain in PDA, namely the entropy minimization and the weighted self-training. However, the entropy minimization method may make the distribution prediction sharp but inaccurate for samples with relatively average prediction distribution, and cause the model to learn more error information. While the weighted self-training method will introduce erroneous noise information in the self-training process due to the existence of noise weights. Therefore, we address these issues in our work and propose self-training contrastive partial domain adaptation method (STCPDA). We present two modules to mine domain information in STCPDA. We first design self-training module based on simple samples in target domain to address the overfitting to source domain. We divide the target domain samples into simple samples with high reliability and difficult samples with low reliability, and the pseudo-labels of simple samples are selected for self-training learning. Then we construct the contrastive learning module for source and target domains. We embed contrastive learning into feature space of the two domains. By this contrastive learning module, we can fully explore the hidden information in all domain samples and make the class boundary more salient. Many experimental results on five datasets show the effectiveness and excellent classification performance of our method.",

            "abstract": "Sand-dust videos obtained in a low-light environment are characterized by low contrast, nonuniform illumination, color cast, and considerable noise. To realize sand-dust removal and brightness enhancement simultaneously, this article proposes an online low-light sand-dust video enhancement method using adaptive dynamic brightness correction and a rolling guidance filter. The proposed dual-threshold interframe detection strategy involves two methods to treat low-light sand-dust video frames. The first method involves two components: an adaptive dynamic brightness correction algorithm to correct the color deviation of the low-light video frame and improve its brightness and a rolling guidance filter combined with guided image filtering to enhance the frame details. The second method enhances the quality of the incoming frame by reducing the amount of calculation. The first frame of the video is processed using the first method. The processing method of each subsequent frame is determined according to its interframe detection value with the buffer frame. Through qualitative and quantitative comprehensive experiments on low-light sand-dust images and videos, the performance of the proposed method is compared with those of state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method for frame quality improvement achieves the best visual effect in enhancing the quality of low-light sand-dust images, as indicated by the best objective evaluation indicators. Moreover, compared with the framewise enhancement method, the video processing efficiency associated with the dual-threshold interframe detection strategy is 2.77 times higher.",

            "abstract": "Handling failures in computer vision systems that rely on deep learning models remains a challenge. While an increasing number of methods for bug identification and correction are proposed, little is known about how practitioners actually search for failures in these models. We perform an empirical study to understand the goals and needs of practitioners, the workflows and artifacts they use, and the challenges and limitations in their process. We interview 18 practitioners by probing them with a carefully crafted failure handling scenario. We observe that there is a great diversity of failure handling workflows in which cooperations are often necessary, that practitioners overlook certain types of failures and bugs, and that they generally do not rely on potentially relevant approaches and tools originally stemming from research. These insights allow to draw a list of research opportunities, such as creating a library of best practices and more representative formalisations of practitioners\u2019 goals, developing interfaces to exploit failure handling artifacts, as well as providing specialized training.",

            "abstract": "Data-imbalanced problems are present in many applications. A big gap in the number of samples in different classes induces classifiers to skew to the majority class and thus diminish the performance of learning and quality of obtained results. Most data level imbalanced learning approaches generate new samples only using the information associated with the minority samples through linearly generating or data distribution fitting. Different from these algorithms, we propose a novel oversampling method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), named OS-GAN. In this method, GAN is assigned to learn the distribution characteristics of the minority class from some selected majority samples but not random noise. As a result, samples released by the trained generator carry information of both majority and minority classes. Furthermore, the central regularization makes the distribution of all synthetic samples not restricted to the domain of the minority class, which can improve the generalization of learning models or algorithms. Experimental results reported on 14 datasets and one high-dimensional dataset show that OS-GAN outperforms 14 commonly used resampling techniques in terms of G-mean, accuracy and F1-score.",

            "abstract": "The millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication technology, which employs large-scale antenna arrays, enables inherent sensing capabilities. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can utilize channel multipath angle estimates to realize integrated sensing and communication design in 6G communication systems. However, existing works have ignored the significant overhead required by the mmWave beam management when implementing SLAM with angle estimates. This study proposes a joint beam management and SLAM design that utilizes the strong coupling between the radio map and channel multipath for simultaneous beam management, localization, and mapping. In this approach, we first propose a hierarchical sweeping and sensing service design. The path angles are estimated in the hierarchical sweeping, enabling angle-based SLAM with the aid of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to realize sensing service. Then, feature-aided tracking is proposed that utilizes prior angle information generated from the radio map and IMU. Finally, a switching module is introduced to enable flexible switching between hierarchical sweeping and feature-aided tracking. Simulations show that the proposed joint design can achieve sub-meter level localization and mapping accuracy (with an error < 0.5 m). Moreover, the beam management overhead can be reduced by approximately 40% in different wireless environments.",

            "abstract": "In order to enhance the robustness of wireless communication systems against in-band interferences, a novel receiver architecture based on realtime spectrum calculation is proposed. Concretely, this receiver relies on the received signal's spectrum value at carrier frequency in each symbol period for symbol decision, which is acquired through a series of operations in the electro-optic dual domain. Theoretical analysis illustrates that this spectrum value is time-variant which changes with the jump of the baseband waveform in transmitter, thus by judging this spectrum value for each symbol period, the source bits are correctly decoded. Moreover, since the spectrum at carrier frequency is transformed into a direct current (DC) component while the spectrums at other frequencies are transformed into alternate current (AC) components, the carrier frequency spectrum value will not be affected by interferences through a DC extracting operation, as long as the interferences do not cover the carrier frequency. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation system is constructed. Simulation results show that under different forms of in-band interference, the communication system can still work well. This method might provide a candidate for communication systems to solve the challenge of in-band interferences.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning has a distributed collaborative training mode, widely used in IoT scenarios of edge computing intelligent services. However, federated learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks, mainly backdoor attacks. Once an edge node implements a backdoor attack, the embedded backdoor mode will rapidly expand to all relevant edge nodes, which poses a considerable challenge to security-sensitive edge computing intelligent services. In the traditional edge collaborative backdoor defense method, only the cloud server is trusted by default. However, edge computing intelligent services have limited bandwidth and unstable network connections, which make it impossible for edge devices to retrain their models or update the global model. Therefore, it is crucial to detect whether the data of edge nodes are polluted in time. This paper proposes a layered defense framework for edge-computing intelligent services. At the edge, we combine the gradient rising strategy and attention self-distillation mechanism to maximize the correlation between edge device data and edge object categories and train a clean model as much as possible. On the server side, we first implement a two-layer backdoor detection mechanism to eliminate backdoor updates and use the attention self-distillation mechanism to restore the model performance. Our results show that the two-stage defense mode is more suitable for the security protection of edge computing intelligent services. It can not only weaken the effectiveness of the backdoor at the edge end but also conduct this defense at the server end, making the model more secure. The precision of our model on the main task is almost the same as that of the clean model.",

            "title": "[MASK] Insertion: a robust method for anti-adversarial attacks",
            "abstract": "Adversarial attack aims to perturb input sequences and mislead a trained model for false predictions. To enhance the model robustness, defensing methods are accordingly employed by either data augmentation (involving adversarial samples) or model enhancement (modifying the training loss and/or model architecture). In contrast to previous work, this paper revisits the masked language modeling (MLM) and presents a simple yet efficient algorithm against adversarial attacks, termed [MASK] insertion for defensing (MI4D). Specifically, MI4D simply inserts [MASK] tokens to input sequences during training and inference, maximizing the intersection of the new convex hull (MI4D creates) with the original one (the clean input forms). As neither additional adversarial samples nor the model modification is required, MI4D is as computationally efficient as traditional fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted using three benchmark datasets and four attacking methods. MI4D yields a significant improvement (on average) of the accuracy between 3.2 and 11.1 absolute points when compared with six state-of-the-art defensing baselines.",

            "title": "Few-shot segmentation with duplex network and attention augmented module",
            "abstract": "Establishing the relationship between a limited number of samples and segmented objects in diverse scenarios is the primary challenge in few-shot segmentation. However, many previous works overlooked the crucial support-query set interaction and the deeper information that needs to be explored. This oversight can lead to model failure when confronted with complex scenarios, such as ambiguous boundaries. To solve this problem, a duplex network that utilizes the suppression and focus concept is proposed to effectively suppress the background and focus on the foreground. Our network includes dynamic convolution to enhance the support-query interaction and a prototype match structure to fully extract information from support and query. The proposed model is called dynamic prototype mixture convolutional networks (DPMC). To minimize the impact of redundant information, we have incorporated a hybrid attentional module called double-layer attention augmented convolutional module (DAAConv) into DPMC. This module enables the network to concentrate more on foreground information. Our experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets suggested that DPMC and DAAConv outperform traditional prototype-based methods by up to 5\u20138% on average.",
