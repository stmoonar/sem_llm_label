            "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial in many real-world applications. To achieve accurate MTS forecasting, it is essential to simultaneously consider both intra- and inter-series relationships among time series data. However, previous work has typically modeled intra- and inter-series relationships separately and has disregarded multi-order interactions present within and between time series data, which can seriously degrade forecasting accuracy. In this article, we reexamine intra- and inter-series relationships from the perspective of mutual information and accordingly construct a comprehensive relationship learning mechanism tailored to simultaneously capture the intricate multi-order intra- and inter-series couplings. Based on the mechanism, we propose a novel deep coupling network for MTS forecasting, named DeepCN, which consists of a coupling mechanism dedicated to explicitly exploring the multi-order intra- and inter-series relationships among time series data concurrently, a coupled variable representation module aimed at encoding diverse variable patterns, and an inference module facilitating predictions through one forward step. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed DeepCN achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph clustering algorithms with autoencoder structures have recently gained popularity due to their efficient performance and low training cost. However, for existing graph autoencoder clustering algorithms based on GCN or GAT, not only do they lack good generalization ability, but also the number of clusters clustered by such autoencoder models is difficult to determine automatically. To solve this problem, we propose a new framework called Graph Clustering with Masked Autoencoders (GCMA). It employs our designed fusion autoencoder based on the graph masking method for the fusion coding of graph. It introduces our improved density-based clustering algorithm as a second decoder while decoding with multi-target reconstruction. By decoding the mask embedding, our model can capture more generalized and comprehensive knowledge. The number of clusters and clustering results can be output end-to-end while improving the generalization ability. As a nonparametric class method, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of \\textit{GCMA} over state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Recently, frequency transformation (FT) has been increasingly incorporated into deep learning models to significantly enhance state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency in time series analysis. The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations in the field are. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis.

            "abstract": "Time series forecasting has played the key role in different industrial, including finance, traffic, energy, and healthcare domains. While existing literatures have designed many sophisticated architectures based on RNNs, GNNs, or Transformers, another kind of approaches based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are proposed with simple structure, low complexity, and {superior performance}. However, most MLP-based forecasting methods suffer from the point-wise mappings and information bottleneck, which largely hinders the forecasting performance. To overcome this problem, we explore a novel direction of applying MLPs in the frequency domain for time series forecasting. We investigate the learned patterns of frequency-domain MLPs and discover their two inherent characteristic benefiting forecasting, (i) global view: frequency spectrum makes MLPs own a complete view for signals and learn global dependencies more easily, and (ii) energy compaction: frequency-domain MLPs concentrate on smaller key part of frequency components with compact signal energy. Then, we propose FreTS, a simple yet effective architecture built upon Frequency-domain MLPs for Time Series forecasting. FreTS mainly involves two stages, (i) Domain Conversion, that transforms time-domain signals into complex numbers of frequency domain; (ii) Frequency Learning, that performs our redesigned MLPs for the learning of real and imaginary part of frequency components. The above stages operated on both inter-series and intra-series scales further contribute to channel-wise and time-wise dependency learning. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world benchmarks (including 7 benchmarks for short-term forecasting and 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting) demonstrate our consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has shown great importance in numerous industries. Current state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN)-based forecasting methods usually require both graph networks (e.g., GCN) and temporal networks (e.g., LSTM) to capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal) dependencies, respectively. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks puts an extra burden on handcrafted model designs. Moreover, the separate spatial and temporal modeling naturally violates the unified spatiotemporal inter-dependencies in real world, which largely hinders the forecasting performance. To overcome these problems, we explore an interesting direction of directly applying graph networks and rethink MTS forecasting from a pure graph perspective. We first define a novel data structure, hypervariate graph, which regards each series value (regardless of variates or timestamps) as a graph node, and represents sliding windows as space-time fully-connected graphs. This perspective considers spatiotemporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates classic MTS forecasting into the predictions on hypervariate graphs. Then, we propose a novel architecture Fourier Graph Neural Network (FourierGNN) by stacking our proposed Fourier Graph Operator (FGO) to perform matrix multiplications in Fourier space. FourierGNN accommodates adequate expressiveness and achieves much lower complexity, which can effectively and efficiently accomplish the forecasting. Besides, our theoretical analysis reveals FGO's equivalence to graph convolutions in the time domain, which further verifies the validity of FourierGNN. Extensive experiments on seven datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with higher efficiency and fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting penetrates various aspects of our economy and society, whose roles become increasingly recognized. However, often MTS forecasting is unfair, not only degrading their practical benefits but even incurring potential risk. Unfair MTS forecasting may be attributed to disparities relating to advantaged and disadvantaged variables, which has rarely been studied in the MTS forecasting. In this work, we formulate the MTS fairness modeling problem as learning informative representations attending to both advantaged and disadvantaged variables. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, named <italic>FairFor</italic>, for fairness-aware MTS forecasting, i.e., <italic>fair MTS forecasting</italic>. <italic>FairFor</italic> uses adversarial learning to generate both group-irrelevant and -relevant representations for downstream forecasting. <italic>FairFor</italic> first adopts recurrent graph convolution to capture spatio-temporal variable correlations and to group variables by leveraging a spectral relaxation of the K-means objective. Then, it utilizes a novel filtering <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ \\& $</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>&</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zhang-ieq1-3323956.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> fusion module to filter group-relevant information and generate group-irrelevant representations by orthogonality regularization. The group-irrelevant and -relevant representations form highly informative representations, facilitating to share the knowledge from advantaged variables to disadvantaged variables and guarantee the fairness of forecasting. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the <italic>FairFor</italic> effectiveness for fair forecasting and significant performance improvement.",

            "abstract": "Due to the nonstationary nature, the distribution of real-world multivariate time series (MTS) changes over time, which is known as distribution drift. Most existing MTS forecasting models greatly suffer from distribution drift and degrade the forecasting performance over time. Existing methods address distribution drift via adapting to the latest arrived data or self-correcting per the meta knowledge derived from future data. Despite their great success in MTS forecasting, these methods hardly capture the intrinsic distribution changes, especially from a distributional perspective. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework temporal conditional variational autoencoder (TCVAE) to model the dynamic distributional dependencies over time between historical observations and future data in MTSs and infer the dependencies as a temporal conditional distribution to leverage latent variables. Specifically, a novel temporal Hawkes attention (THA) mechanism represents temporal factors that subsequently fed into feedforward networks to estimate the prior Gaussian distribution of latent variables. The representation of temporal factors further dynamically adjusts the structures of Transformer-based encoder and decoder to distribution changes by leveraging a gated attention mechanism (GAM). Moreover, we introduce conditional continuous normalization flow (CCNF) to transform the prior Gaussian to a complex and form-free distribution to facilitate flexible inference of the temporal conditional distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the TCVAE's superior robustness and effectiveness over the state-of-the-art MTS forecasting baselines. We further illustrate the TCVAE applicability through multifaceted case studies and visualization in real-world scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Modeling complex hierarchical and grouped feature interaction in the multivariate time series data is indispensable to comprehend the data dynamics and predicting the future condition. The implicit feature interaction and high-dimensional data make multivariate forecasting very challenging. Many existing works did not put more emphasis on exploring explicit correlation among multiple time series data, and complicated models are designed to capture long- and short-range pattern with the aid of attention mechanism. In this work, we think that pre-defined graph or general learning method is difficult due to their irregular structure. Hence, we present CATN, an end-to-end model of Cross Attentive Tree-aware Network to jointly capture the inter-series correlation and intra-series temporal pattern. We first construct a tree structure to learn hierarchical and grouped correlation and design an embedding approach that can pass dynamic message to generalize implicit but interpretable cross features among multiple time series. Next in temporal aspect, we propose a multi-level dependency learning mechanism including global&local learning and cross attention mechanism, which can combine long-range dependencies, short-range dependencies as well as cross dependencies at different time steps. The extensive experiments on different datasets from real world show the effectiveness and robustness of the method we proposed when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",
