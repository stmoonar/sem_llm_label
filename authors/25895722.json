            "abstract": "The number of applications leveraging data from sensors on smart-phones is growing. However, they tend to focus on single Apps for personal sensing rather than trying to achieve a greater good (social sensing) by addressing challenges as App interoperability and geographical distribution of devices. In this paper, we present MobileWave a framework that allows creating, composing and publishing RDF streams from smart-phones. MobileWave extends TripleWave with a publish/subscribe middleware that collects affluent RDF Streams, composes them into a swollen RDF stream and publishes it on the Web.",

            "abstract": ". Since the mid 2000s\u2019, the Linked Data principles, and the tools they inspired, became a solid foundation for a decentralized yet connected Web of Data where static (or slowly evolving) data can be shared and traversed. However, the growing popularity of (fast) streaming data is now calling for an extension of Linked Data towards a Web of Data Streams. In this paper, we identify several challenges to solve towards this vision. Moreover, we present VoIS, a Vocabulary of Interlinked Streams, and we show how it contributes in addressing such challenges",
