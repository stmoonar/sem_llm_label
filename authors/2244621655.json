            "title": "Large Language Models Enhanced Sequential Recommendation for Long-tail User and Item",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation systems (SRS) serve the purpose of predicting users' subsequent preferences based on their past interactions and have been applied across various domains such as e-commerce and social networking platforms. However, practical SRS encounters challenges due to the fact that most users engage with only a limited number of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. These challenges, termed as the long-tail user and long-tail item dilemmas, often create obstacles for traditional SRS methods. Mitigating these challenges is crucial as they can significantly impact user satisfaction and business profitability. While some research endeavors have alleviated these issues, they still grapple with issues such as seesaw or noise stemming from the scarcity of interactions. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue to address these challenges from a semantic standpoint. In this study, we introduce the Large Language Models Enhancement framework for Sequential Recommendation (LLM-ESR), which leverages semantic embeddings from LLMs to enhance SRS performance without increasing computational overhead. To combat the long-tail item challenge, we propose a dual-view modeling approach that fuses semantic information from LLMs with collaborative signals from traditional SRS. To address the long-tail user challenge, we introduce a retrieval augmented self-distillation technique to refine user preference representations by incorporating richer interaction data from similar users. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on three authentic datasets using three widely used SRS models, our proposed enhancement framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methodologies.",

            "abstract": "The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.",

            "abstract": "Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) are extensively applied across various domains to predict users' next interaction by modeling their interaction sequences. However, these systems typically grapple with the long-tail problem, where they struggle to recommend items that are less popular. This challenge results in a decline in user discovery and reduced earnings for vendors, negatively impacting the system as a whole. Large Language Model (LLM) has the potential to understand the semantic connections between items, regardless of their popularity, positioning them as a viable solution to this dilemma. In our paper, we present LLMEmb, an innovative technique that harnesses LLM to create item embeddings that bolster the performance of SRS. To align the capabilities of general-purpose LLM with the needs of the recommendation domain, we introduce a method called Supervised Contrastive Fine-Tuning (SCFT). This method involves attribute-level data augmentation and a custom contrastive loss designed to tailor LLM for enhanced recommendation performance. Moreover, we highlight the necessity of incorporating collaborative filtering signals into LLM-generated embeddings and propose Recommendation Adaptation Training (RAT) for this purpose. RAT refines the embeddings to be optimally suited for SRS. The embeddings derived from LLMEmb can be easily integrated with any SRS model, showcasing its practical utility. Extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets has shown that LLMEmb significantly improves upon current methods when applied across different SRS models.",

            "abstract": "\u2014The recent surge in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant attention in numerous domains. In order to tailor an LLM to a specific domain such as a web-based healthcare system, fine-tuning with domain knowledge is necessary. However, two issues arise during fine-tuning LLMs for medical applications. The first is the problem of task variety, where there are numerous distinct tasks in real-world medical scenarios. This diversity often results in suboptimal fine-tuning due to data imbalance and seesawing problems. Additionally, the high cost of fine-tuning can be prohibitive, impeding the application of LLMs. The large number of parameters in LLMs results in enormous time and computational consumption during fine-tuning, which is difficult to justify. To address these two issues simultaneously, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-task medical applications called MOELoRA. The framework aims to capitalize on the benefits of both MOE for multi-task learning and LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To unify MOE and LoRA, we devise multiple experts as the trainable parameters, where each expert consists of a pair of low-rank matrices to maintain a small number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we propose a task-motivated gate function for all MOELoRA layers that can regulate the contributions of each expert and generate distinct parameters for various tasks. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on a public multi-task Chinese medical dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that MOELoRA outperforms existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SRS) has become the technical foundation in many applications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the user's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems. Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation models. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As far as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to the recommendation.The implementation code is available online.",
