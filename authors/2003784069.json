            "abstract": ". The reproducibility crisis is an ongoing problem that a\ufb00ects data-driven science to a big extent. The highly connected decentral Web of Ontologies represents the backbone for semantic data and the Linked Open Data Cloud and provides terminological context information crucial for the usage and interpretation of the data, which in turn is key for the reproducibility of research results making use of it. In this paper, we identify, analyze, and quantify reproducibility issues related to capturing terminological context (e.g. caused by unavailable ontologies) and delineate the impact on the reproducibility crisis in the Linked Open Data Cloud. Our examinations are backed by a frequent and ongoing monitoring of online available vocabularies and ontologies that results in the DBpedia Archivo dataset. We also show the extent to which the reproducibility crisis can be countered with the aid of ontology archiving in DBpedia Archivo and the Linked Open Vocabularies platforms.",

            "abstract": "While the retrieval of simple facts works very well with modern search engines, the quality of results for comparative questions is rather mediocre. With the goal of developing a retrieval algorithm for finding documents containing arguments that help to answer those questions, we tried to evaluate many different approaches to both query expansion and document ranking. Our aim was to build a modular and highly configurable system that provides the necessary tools to help with evaluation-driven experimentation. The results show that we found approaches that were able to outperform the baseline. Especially simple approaches like query term counting have proven to be promising. One of the simplest approaches combining query term count and ChatNoir scores improves the NDCG by around 5% w.r.t. the baseline. However, due to the limitations of the provided rankings and the limited time frame further work remains.",

            "abstract": "DBpedia Archivo is an online ontology interface and open augmented archive, containing more than 1,400 ontologies. It uses several fully automated ontology discovery mechanisms that run each week and have turned Archivo into one of the most exhaustive, and recent ontology archives. Archivo daily checks for new ontology versions and performs automated tests to evaluate the fitness for use of an ontology. As part of a 4-star quality rating, a logical consistency check is applied. However, several ontologies contained in Archivo cause problems with current reasoner implementations when verifying consistency, leading to timeouts and other runtime failures. In this paper, we present an approach to create a collection of such challenging ontologies and report key characteristics of these ontologies, that can be easily consumed by reasoning applications in order to evaluate their performance and stability.",
