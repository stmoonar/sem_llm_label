            "abstract": "We propose a practical instant question answering (QA) system on product pages of e-commerce services, where for each user query, relevant community question answer (CQA) pairs are retrieved. User queries and CQA pairs differ significantly in language characteristics making relevance learning difficult. Our proposed transformer-based model learns a robust relevance function by jointly learning unified syntactic and semantic representations without the need for human labeled data. This is achieved by distantly supervising our model by distilling from predictions of a syntactic matching system on user queries and simultaneously training with CQA pairs. Training with CQA pairs helps our model learning semantic QA relevance and distant supervision enables learning of syntactic features as well as the nuances of user querying language. Additionally, our model encodes queries and candidate responses independently allowing offline candidate embedding generation thereby minimizing the need for real-time transformer model execution. Consequently, our framework is able to scale to large e-commerce QA traffic. Extensive evaluation on user queries shows that our framework significantly outperforms both syntactic and semantic baselines in offline as well as large scale online A/B setups of a popular e-commerce service.",

Motivated by this, here, we present a novel framework to answer both factoid and non-factoid user questions on product pages. We propose several question-answer matching models leveraging both deep learned distributional semantics and semantics imposed by a structured resource like a domain specific ontology. The proposed framework supports the use of a combination of these models and we show, through empirical evaluation, that a cascade of these models does much better in meeting the high precision requirements of such a question-answering system. Evaluation on user asked questions shows that the proposed system achieves 66% higher precision1 as compared to IDF-weighted average of word vectors baseline [1].",

            "abstract": "With the help of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects, a scene image is represented as a bag of semantics (BoS). This involves classifying image patches using the network and considering the class posterior probability vectors as locally extracted semantic descriptors. The image BoS is summarized using a Fisher vector (FV) embedding that exploits the properties of the space of these descriptors. The resulting representation is referred to as a semantic Fisher vector. Two implementations of a semantic FV are investigated. First involves modeling the BoS with a Dirichlet Mixture and computing the Fisher gradients for this model. Due to the difficulty of mixture modeling on a non-Euclidean probability simplex, this approach is shown to be unsuccessful. A second implementation is derived using the interpretation of semantic descriptors as parameters of a multinomial distribution. Like the parameters of any exponential family, these can be projected into their natural parameter space. For a CNN, this is shown equivalent to using inputs of its soft-max layer as patch descriptors. A semantic FV is then computed as a Gaussian Mixture FV in the space of these natural parameters. This representation is shown to outperform other alternatives such as FVs of features from the intermediate CNN layers or a classifier obtained by adapting (fine-tuning) the CNN. The proposed FV represents an embedding for object classification probabilities. As an image representation, therefore, it is complementary to the features obtained from a scene classification CNN. A combination of the two representations is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on MIT Indoor scenes and SUN datasets.",

            "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are now the state-of-the-art for many image and object recognition tasks, as illustrated by their performance on standard benchmarks. The success of DNNs is attributed to their ability to learn rich mid-level image representations, as opposed to hand-designed low-level features used in other image analysis methods. Typically a large dataset of unlabeled images is used for unsupervised feature learning, and then standard classifiers are trained on the features extracted from the images in a labeled set. In this paper, we show that clustering the images using the features from the DNN allows more accurate per-cluster classifiers to be learned, which improves the overall classification accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a scene recognition task.",

Unlike CCA, ml-CCA does not rely on explicit pairing between modalities, instead it uses the multi-label information to establish correspondences. This results in a discriminative subspace which is better suited for cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also present Fast ml-CCA, a computationally efficient version of ml-CCA, which is able to handle large scale datasets. We show the efficacy of our approach by conducting extensive cross-modal retrieval experiments on three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed approach achieves state of the art retrieval performance on the three datasets.",

In this paper, we design a specific framework to automatically evaluate the beauty of digital portraits.

We design a set of visual features based on portrait photography literature, and extensively analyze their relation with portrait beauty, exposing interesting findings about what makes a portrait beautiful. We find that the beauty of a portrait is linked to its artistic value, and independent from age, race and gender of the subject. We also show that a classifier trained with our features to separate beautiful portraits from non-beautiful portraits outperforms generic aesthetic classifiers.",

            "abstract": "The problem of cross-modal retrieval from multimedia repositories is considered. This problem addresses the design of retrieval systems that support queries across content modalities, for example, using an image to search for texts. A mathematical formulation is proposed, equating the design of cross-modal retrieval systems to that of isomorphic feature spaces for different content modalities. Two hypotheses are then investigated regarding the fundamental attributes of these spaces. The first is that low-level cross-modal correlations should be accounted for. The second is that the space should enable semantic abstraction. Three new solutions to the cross-modal retrieval problem are then derived from these hypotheses: correlation matching (CM), an unsupervised method which models cross-modal correlations, semantic matching (SM), a supervised technique that relies on semantic representation, and semantic correlation matching (SCM), which combines both. An extensive evaluation of retrieval performance is conducted to test the validity of the hypotheses. All approaches are shown successful for text retrieval in response to image queries and vice versa. It is concluded that both hypotheses hold, in a complementary form, although evidence in favor of the abstraction hypothesis is stronger than that for correlation.",

            "abstract": "The problem of cross-modal retrieval from multimedia repositories is considered. This problem addresses the design of retrieval systems that support queries across content modalities, for example, using an image to search for texts. A mathematical formulation is proposed, equating the design of cross-modal retrieval systems to that of isomorphic feature spaces for different content modalities. Two hypotheses are then investigated regarding the fundamental attributes of these spaces. The first is that low-level cross-modal correlations should be accounted for. The second is that the space should enable semantic abstraction. Three new solutions to the cross-modal retrieval problem are then derived from these hypotheses: correlation matching (CM), an unsupervised method which models cross-modal correlations, semantic matching (SM), a supervised technique that relies on semantic representation, and semantic correlation matching (SCM), which combines both. An extensive evaluation of retrieval performance is conducted to test the validity of the hypotheses. All approaches are shown successful for text retrieval in response to image queries and vice versa. It is concluded that both hypotheses hold, in a complementary form, although evidence in favor of the abstraction hypothesis is stronger than that for correlation.",
