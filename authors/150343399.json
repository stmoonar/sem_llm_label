            "abstract": "Goal-oriented Learning path recommendation aims to recommend learning items (concepts or exercises) step-by-step to a learner to promote the mastery level of her specific learning goals. By formulating this task as a Markov decision process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated great power. Although extensive research efforts have been made, previous methods still fail to recommend effective goal-oriented paths due to the under-utilizing of goals. Specifically, it is mainly reflected in two aspects: (1)The lack of goal planning. When learners have multiple goals with different difficulties, the previous methods can't fully utilize the difficulties and dependencies between goal learning items to plan the sequence of achieving these goals, making the path chaotic and inefficient; (2)The lack of efficiency in goal achieving. When pursuing a single goal, the path may contain learning items unrelated to the goal, which makes realizing a certain goal inefficient. To address these challenges, we present a novel Graph Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GEHRL) framework for goal-oriented learning path recommendation. The framework divides learning path recommendation into two parts: sub-goal selection(planning) and sub-goal achieving(learning item recommendation). Specifically, we employ a high-level agent as a sub-goal selector to select sub-goals for the low-level agent to achieve. The low-level agent in the framework is to recommend learning items to the learner. To make the path only contain goal-related learning items to improve the efficiency of achieving the goal, we develop a graph-based candidate selector to constrain the action space of the low-level agent based on the sub-goal and knowledge graph. We also develop test-based internal reward for low-level training so that the sparsity problem of external reward can be alleviated. Extensive experiments on three different simulators demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

            "abstract": "Extending from sequential recommendation models, in this paper, we present a novel framework named Search-based Time-Aware Recommendation (STARec), which first retrieves the historical behaviors of the given user through a search-based retriever, and then captures the user\u2019s evolving demands over time through a time-aware sequential network. We notice that the key insight of STARec is to use the feature and labels to augment the representations, and thus the effectiveness of STARec relies on the acquisition of rich browsing records of the target user and powerful representation of each browsed item and thus its performance could heavily drop regarding long-tail users and items. To this end, we extend STARec by constructing a graph upon the user-item interactions and leveraging the graph structure to enhance the representation learning. We call this extended version Search-based Time-Aware Graph-Enhanced Recommendation (STAGE). We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and STARec achieves consistent superiority. We further compare STAGE against STARec long-tail users and our results demonstrate that STAGE could outperform STARec at most cases. Results of online A/B tests show that STARec and STAGE achieve an average CTR improvement of around 6% and 1.5% in the two main item recommendation scenarios respectively.",

            "title": "Replace Scoring with Arrangement: A Contextual Set-to-Arrangement Framework for Learning-to-Rank",
            "abstract": "Learning-to-rank is a core technique in the top-N recommendation task, where an ideal ranker would be a mapping from an item set to an arrangement (a.k.a. permutation). Most existing solutions fall in the paradigm of probabilistic ranking principle (PRP), i.e., first score each item in the candidate set and then perform a sort operation to generate the top ranking list. However, these approaches neglect the contextual dependence among candidate items during individual scoring, and the sort operation is non-differentiable. To bypass the above issues, we propose Set-To-Arrangement Ranking (STARank), a new framework directly generates the permutations of the candidate items without the need for individually scoring and sort operations; and is end-to-end differentiable. As a result, STARank can operate when only the ground-truth permutations are accessible without requiring access to the ground-truth relevance scores for items. For this purpose, STARank first reads the candidate items in the context of the user browsing history, whose representations are fed into a Plackett-Luce module to arrange the given items into a list. To effectively utilize the given ground-truth permutations for supervising STARank, we leverage the internal consistency property of Plackett-Luce models to derive a computationally efficient list-wise loss. Experimental comparisons against 9 the state-of-the-art methods on 2 learning-to-rank benchmark datasets and 3 top-N real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate the superiority of STARank in terms of conventional ranking metrics. Notice that these ranking metrics do not consider the effects of the contextual dependence among the items in the list, we design a new family of simulation-based ranking metrics, where existing metrics can be regarded as special cases. STARank can consistently achieve better performance in terms of PBM and UBM simulation-based metrics.",

            "abstract": "Data science is concerned with mining data patterns from a database, which is assembled by tabular data. As the routine of machine learning, most of the previous work mining the tabular data's pattern based on a single instance. However, they neglect the similar tabular data instances that could help make the label prediction of the target data instance. Recently, some retrieval-based methods for tabular data label prediction have been proposed, which, however, treat the data as sparse vectors to perform the retrieval, which fails to make use of the semantic information of the tabular data. To address such a problem, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of dense retrieval on tabular data (DERT) to support flexible data representation learning and effective label prediction on tabular data. DERT consists of two major components: (i) the encoder that makes the tabular data as embeddings, which could be trained by flexible neural networks and auxiliary loss functions; (ii) the retrieval and prediction component, which makes use of similar rows in the table to make label prediction of the target row. We test DERT on two tasks based on five real-world datasets and experimental results show that DERT achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art and various baselines.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems trained on offline historical user behaviors are embracing conversational techniques to online query user preference. Unlike prior conversational recommendation approaches that systemically combine conversational and recommender parts through a reinforcement learning framework, we propose CORE, a new offline-training and online-checking paradigm that bridges a COnversational agent and REcommender systems via a unified uncertainty minimization framework. It can benefit any recommendation platform in a plug-and-play style. Here, CORE treats a recommender system as an offline relevance score estimator to produce an estimated relevance score for each item; while a conversational agent is regarded as an online relevance score checker to check these estimated scores in each session. We define uncertainty as the summation of unchecked relevance scores. In this regard, the conversational agent acts to minimize uncertainty via querying either attributes or items. Based on the uncertainty minimization framework, we derive the expected certainty gain of querying each attribute and item, and develop a novel online decision tree algorithm to decide what to query at each turn. Experimental results on 8 industrial datasets show that CORE could be seamlessly employed on 9 popular recommendation approaches. We further demonstrate that our conversational agent could communicate as a human if empowered by a pre-trained large language model.",

            "abstract": "Online education platforms, leveraging the internet to distribute education resources, seek to provide convenient education but often fall short in real-time communication with students. They often struggle to address the diverse obstacles students encounter throughout their learning journey. Solving the problems encountered by students poses a significant challenge for traditional deep learning models, as it requires not only a broad spectrum of subject knowledge but also the ability to understand what constitutes a student's individual difficulties. It's challenging for traditional machine learning models, as they lack the capacity to comprehend students' personalized needs. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers the possibility for resolving this issue by comprehending individual requests. Although LLMs have been successful in various fields, creating an LLM-based education system is still challenging for the wide range of educational skills required. This paper reviews the recently emerged LLM research related to educational capabilities, including mathematics, writing, programming, reasoning, and knowledge-based question answering, with the aim to explore their potential in constructing the next-generation intelligent education system. Specifically, for each capability, we focus on investigating two aspects. Firstly, we examine the current state of LLMs regarding this capability: how advanced they have become, whether they surpass human abilities, and what deficiencies might exist. Secondly, we evaluate whether the development methods for LLMs in this area are generalizable, that is, whether these methods can be applied to construct a comprehensive educational supermodel with strengths across various capabilities, rather than being effective in only a singular aspect.",

            "abstract": "Modelling the user's multiple behaviors is an essential part of modern e-commerce, whose widely adopted application is to jointly optimize click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. Most of existing methods overlook the effect of two key characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contextual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically. To this end, we develop a new multi-scale user behavior network named H ierarchical r E current R anking O n the E ntire S pace (HEROES) which incorporates the contextual information to estimate the user multiple behaviors in a multi-scale fashion. Concretely, we introduce a hierarchical framework, where the lower layer models the user's engagement behaviors while the upper layer estimates the user's satisfaction behaviors. The proposed architecture can automatically learn a suitable time scale for each layer to capture the dynamic user's behavioral patterns. Besides the architecture, we also introduce the Hawkes process to form a novel recurrent unit which can not only encode the items' features in the context but also formulate the excitation or discouragement from the user's previous behaviors. We further show that HEROES can be extended to build unbiased ranking systems through combinations with the survival analysis technique. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods. characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contex- tual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically.

            "abstract": "With the prevalence of live broadcast business nowadays, a new type of recommendation service, called live broadcast recommendation, is widely used in many mobile e-commerce Apps. Different from classical item recommendation, live broadcast recommendation is to automatically recommend user anchors instead of items considering the interactions among triple-objects (i.e., users, anchors, items) rather than binary interactions between users and items. Existing methods based on binary objects, ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning, obtain objects\u2019 embeddings by mapping from pre-existing features. Directly applying these techniques would lead to limited performance, as they are failing to encode collaborative signals among triple-objects. In this paper, we propose a novel TWo-side Interactive NetworkS (TWINS) for live broadcast recommendation. In order to fully use both static and dynamic information on user and anchor sides, we combine a product-based neural network with a recurrent neural network to learn the embedding of each object. In addition, instead of directly measuring the similarity, TWINS effectively injects the collaborative effects into the embedding process in an explicit manner by modeling interactive patterns between the user\u2019s browsing history and the anchor\u2019s broadcast history in both item and anchor aspects. Furthermore, we design a novel co-retrieval technique to select key items among massive historic records efficiently. Offline experiments on real large-scale data show the superior performance of the proposed TWINS, compared to representative methods; and further results of online experiments on Diantao App show that TWINS gains average performance improvement of around 8% on ACTR metric, 3% on UCTR metric, 3.5% on UCVR metric.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) defines the task of predicting whether students can correctly answer questions based on their historical response. Although much research has been devoted to exploiting the question information, plentiful advanced information among questions and skills hasn't been well extracted, making it challenging for previous work to perform adequately. In this paper, we demonstrate that large gains on KT can be realized by pre-training embeddings for each question on abundant side information, followed by training deep KT models on the obtained embeddings. To be specific, the side information includes question difficulty and three kinds of relations contained in a bipartite graph between questions and skills. To pre-train the question embeddings, we propose to use product-based neural networks to recover the side information. As a result, adopting the pre-trained embeddings in existing deep KT models significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three common KT datasets.",

            "abstract": "For the edge computing network, whether the end-to-end delay satisfies the delay constraint of the task is critical, especially for delay-sensitive tasks. Virtual machine (VM) migration improves the robustness of the network, whereas it also causes service downtime and increases the end-to-end delay. To study the influence of failure, migration, and recovery of VMs, we define three states for the VMs in an edge server and build a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Then, we develop a matrix-geometric method and a first passage time method to obtain the VMs timely reliability (VTR) and the end-to-end timely reliability (ETR). The numerical results are verified by simulation based on OMNeT++. Results show that VTR is a monotonic function of the migration rate and the number of VMs. However, in some cases, the increase in task VMs (TVMs) may conversely decrease VTR, since more TVMs also brings about more failures in a given time. Moreover, we find that there is a trade-off between TVMs and backup VMs (BVMs) when the total number of VMs is limited. Our findings may shed light on understanding the impact of VM migration on end-to-end delay and designing a more reliable edge computing network for delay-sensitive applications.",
