            "abstract": "Intelligent robots are a current application in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), with their trustworthiness being a topic of considerable research interest. Vulnerabilities in robot software may affect the trustworthiness of robotics. To detect these vulnerabilities in robot software, this study proposes a differential fuzz testing method. The main idea is to continuously execute test cases for different versions of software packages to detect inconsistencies among outputs and eventually discover vulnerabilities. First, test cases are generated, combining seed generation and mutation, after which the measured model of the packages in the robot visualization tool (RVIZ) is built and the generated seeds are executed. The differences among inconsistent outputs are calculated and the causes of the differences analyzed. Two evaluation metrics for the inconsistencies and seeds are presented. This method is applied to the crucial package in ROS-MoveIt!. The results show that the arm.go() of moveit_commander has joint angle overflow.",

            "title": "A Novel Method for Monitoring Tropical Cyclones' Movement Using GNSS Zenith Tropospheric Delay",
            "abstract": "Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is an important meteorological factor for predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, which can be obtained from zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) by using a conversion. A time difference of ZTD arrival (TDOZA) model was proposed to monitor the movement of tropical cyclones, and the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ERA5)-derived ZTD (ERA5-ZTD) was used to estimate the movement of tropical cyclones based on the model. The global navigation satellite system-derived ZTD and radiosonde data-derived PWV (RS-PWV) were used to test the accuracy of the ERA5-ZTD and analyze the correlation between ZTD and PWV, respectively. The statistics showed that the mean Bias, RMS and STD of the ERA5-ZTD were 6.4 mm, 17.1 mm and 16.5 mm, respectively, and the mean correlation coefficient of the ERA5-ZTD and RS-PWV was 0.951, which indicates that the ZTD can be used to predict weather events instead of PWV. Then, spatiao-temporal characteristics of ZTD during the four tropical cyclone (i.e., Merbok, ROKE, Neast and Hato) periods in 2017 were analyzed, and the result showed that the moving directions of ZTD and the tropical cyclones were consistent. Thus, the ZTD time series over the ERA5 grids around the tropical cyclones\u2019 paths were used to estimate the velocity of the tropical cyclones based on the TDOZA model, when the tropical cyclones are approaching or leaving. Compared with the result from the China Meteorological Administration, the mean absolute and relative deviations of the TDOZA model-derived velocity were 2.55 km/h and 10.0%, respectively. These results suggest that ZTD can be used as a new supplementary meteorological parameter for monitoring tropical cyclone events.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge distillation has attracted a great deal of interest recently to compress large language models. However, existing knowledge distillation methods suffer from two limitations. First, the student model simply imitates the teacher\u2019s behavior while ignoring the reasoning behind it. Second, these methods usually focus on the transfer of sophisticated model-specific knowledge but overlook data-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel attribution-driven knowledge distillation approach, which explores the token-level rationale behind the teacher model based on Integrated Gradients (IG) and transfers attribution knowledge to the student model. To enhance the knowledge transfer of model reasoning and generalization, we further explore multi-view attribution distillation on all potential decisions of the teacher. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with BERT on the GLUE benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to several state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile internet technology, extended reality (XR) applications have significantly increased. However, the ultra low latency and ultra high speed requirements of XR pose a huge challenge to wireless resource allocation. Therefore, this paper studies the dynamic resource block (RB) allocation for real-time cloud XR video transmission. Unlike existing works focusing on static RB allocation, we consider a dynamic assignment strategy appropriated for a user-moving scenario and employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Specifically, we propose and compare two DRL approaches based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) model with powerful exploration capabilities: a centralized single-SAC (S-SAC) and a distributed multi-SAC (M-SAC) method. The former treats the base station as a single agent, while the latter treats all RBs as different independent agents. Multi-agent model reduces the neural network\u2019s exponential output dimension to a linear order of magnitude. Moreover, we develop a novel reward function combining immediate and delayed rewards to solve the reward sparsity problem in DRL. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods obtain more than 50% performance gain over various benchmarks for both fixed and random video frame size scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Most of the existing research on degrees-of-freedom (DoF) with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) assume the messages are private, which may not reflect reality as the two receivers can request the same content. To overcome this limitation, we therefore consider the hybrid unicast and multicast messages. In particular, we characterize the optimal DoF region for the two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) with imperfect CSIT and hybrid messages. For the converse, we establish a three-step procedure to exploit the utmost possible relaxation. For the achievability, since the DoF region is with specific three-dimensional structure regarding antenna configurations and CSIT qualities, we verify the existence or non-existence of corner point candidates via the feature of antenna configurations and CSIT qualities categorization, and provide a hybrid message-aware rate-splitting scheme. Besides, we show that to achieve the strictly positive corner points, it is unnecessary to split the unicast messages into private and common parts. This implies adding a multicast message may mitigate the rate-splitting complexity.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Network (STANet) with bidirectional temporal difference, consisting of a Temporal Adaptive module (TA) and a Spatial Adaptive (SA) module, to sufficiently extract the crucial motion information and model the spatial pivotal appearance information from both forward and backward perspectives, respectively. Specifically, the Temporal Adaptive module uses bidirectional temporal differences to learn valuable motion trends and balance the static semantics and dynamic motion for a certain action during information fusion; while the Spatial Adaptive module uses the bidirectional temporal difference to obtain the spatio-channel attention to stress the discriminative position-relevant and semantic-relevant appearance features. Extensive experiments conducted on widely-used action recognition benchmarks UCF-101, HMDB-51, Something-Something V1, and Kinetics-400 prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) as an emerging distributed learning paradigm can effectively resolve the resource constraints and privacy issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) by featuring collaborative training at the edge devices under the premise of data localization. Nevertheless, owing to the scarce resources and the inscrutable communication fading, issues such as model damage and signal deviation will critically diminish the convergence performance and learning accuracy of FEEL. With this in mind, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently been integrated to enhance the communication quality of wireless systems by adaptively reconfiguring the signal propagation environment. To utterly release the applied potency of RIS, the configuration of phase shifts is of paramount importance, where accurate channel state information (CSI) is required. Unfortunately, the accurate instantaneous CSI is extremely challenging to be estimated. In this paper, we focus on the realistic scenario assuming only statistical CSI is known, which can be comparatively easily and accurately explored. On the other hand, considering the wireless outage caused by the random non-line-of-sight channel, we rigorously derive an explicit convergence upper bound of the RIS enabled FEEL framework with respect to the outage probability. Based on the convergence theory, a unified resource allocation problem is further established by jointly optimizing bandwidth allocation, and the RIS configuration matrix. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed design dramatically promotes the learning performance compared against the baseline solutions.",

            "abstract": "As one of the most popular and attractive frameworks for model training, federated edge learning (FEEL) presents a new paradigm, which avoids direct data transmission by collaboratively training a global learning model across multiple distributed edge devices, thus overcoming the disadvantage of centralized machine learning in resource limitations, delay constraints, and privacy issues. However, due to the heavy cost of communicating gradient among edge devices, sharing the parameters of a large-scale neural network can still be time-intensive. To alleviate this bottleneck, an efficient scheme, called SignSGD has been recently proposed, where the one-bit gradient quantization with majority vote is featured at edge devices. Nevertheless, the performance of one-bit aggregation will inevitably deteriorate due to the undesirable propagation error introduced by wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose in this work a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided one-bit communication optimization scheme under orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) to relieve the negative influence of communication error on the SignSGD-based FEEL. Specifically, a learning convergence analysis is firstly presented to quantitatively characterize the impact of wireless communication error measured by the union bound on pairwise bit error rate (BER) on the performance of SignSGD-based FEEL. Immediately, a unified communication-learning optimization problem is further formulated to jointly optimize the sub-band assignment strategy, the power allocation vector, and the RIS configuration matrix. Numerical experiments show that the proposed design achieves substantial performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "title": "Acoustic Vector Sensor Multi-Source Detection Based on Multimodal Fusion",
            "abstract": "The direction of arrival (DOA) and number of sound sources is usually estimated by short-time Fourier transform and the conjugate cross-spectrum. However, the ability of a single AVS to distinguish between multiple sources will decrease as the number of sources increases. To solve this problem, this paper presents a multimodal fusion method based on a single acoustic vector sensor (AVS). First, the output of the AVS is decomposed into multiple modes by intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD). The number of sources in each mode decreases after decomposition. Then, the DOAs and source number in each mode are estimated by density peak clustering (DPC). Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with the noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is employed to obtain the final source counting results from the DOAs of all modes. Experiments showed that the multimodal fusion method could significantly improve the ability of a single AVS to distinguish multiple sources when compared to methods without multimodal fusion.",

            "abstract": "This letter investigates joint beamforming and power optimization in a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) system for integrated passive sensing and communications techniques. Specifically, the base station (BS) with multiple antennas delivers downlink data to multiple vehicles, respectively, and a sensing receiver simultaneously utilizes the downlink data signal to sense the motion of one vehicle. The sensing receiver is deployed separately. It collects the line-of-sight (LoS) signals from the BS and the scattered signals via the target vehicle, such that the distance and velocity of the target vehicle can be detected in a passive manner. As a result, the joint downlink beamforming and power optimization at the BS would be able to maximize the weighted summation of downlink data rates, subject to constraints on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the two signals for passive sensing. In order to solve the above non-convex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal receiving beams for the data and sensing receivers given arbitrary transmission beam design, and then propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to find a sub-optimal design of transmission beams based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulations demonstrate the good performance, fast convergence and useful design insights.",
