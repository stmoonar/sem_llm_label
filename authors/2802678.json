            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

Such experiments require the availability of large amount of data (multi-terabyte order) related to the output of several climate models simulations as well as the exploitation of scientific data management tools for large-scale data analytics. More specifically, the paper discusses in detail a use case on precipitation trend analysis in terms of requirements, architectural design solution, and infrastructural implementation. The experiment has been tested and validated on CMIP5 datasets, in the context of a large scale distributed testbed across EU and US involving three ESGF sites (LLNL, ORNL, and CMCC) and one central orchestrator site (PSNC).",

The primary mission of the ACME \nproject is to build and test the next-generation Earth system model for current \nand future generations of computing systems operated by the DOE office of \nscience computing facilities, including the envisioned exascale systems \nforeseen in the early part of the next decade. As part of the underpinning \nworkflow environment, a diagnostics, model metrics, and intercomparison Python \nframework, called UVC Metrics was created to aid in testing and production \nexecution of the model. This framework builds on common methods and similar \nmetrics to accommodate and diagnose individual component models, such as \natmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice, and land ice. This paper reports on initial \nparallelization of UVC Metrics for the atmosphere model component using two \npopular frameworks: MPI and SPARK. A timing study is presented to assess the \nperformance of each method in which significant improvement was achieved for \nboth frameworks despite I/O contentions with NFS. The advantages and \ndisadvantages of each framework are also presented.",

Ensemble data sets combine spatio-temporal simulation results generated using multiple numerical models, sampled input conditions and perturbed parameters. While ensemble data sets are a powerful tool for mitigating uncertainty, they pose significant visualization and analysis challenges due to their complexity. In this article, we present Ensemble-Vis, a framework consisting of a collection of overview and statistical displays linked through a high level of interactivity. Ensemble-Vis allows scientists to gain key scientific insight into the distribution of simulation results as well as the uncertainty associated with the scientific data. In contrast to methods that present large amounts of diverse information in a single display, we argue that combining multiple linked displays yields a clearer presentation of the data and facilitates a greater level of visual data analysis. We demonstrate our framework using driving problems from climate modeling and meteorology and discuss generalizations to other fields.",

            "abstract": "Being able to incorporate, inspect, and analyze data with newly developed technologies, diagnostics, and visualizations in an easy and flexible way has been a longstanding challenge for scientists interested in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic empirical assessment of multi-model climate output. To improve research ability and productivity, these technologies and tool must be made easily available to help scientists understand and solve complex scientific climate changes. To increase productivity and ease the challenges of incorporating new tools into the hands of scientists, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) developed the Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT). CDAT is an application for developing and bringing together disparate software tools for the discovery, examination, and intercomparison of coupled multi-model climate data. By collaborating with top climate institutions, computational organizations, and other science communities, the CDAT community of developers is leading the way to provide proven data management, analysis, visualization, and diagnostics capabilities to scientists. This communitywide effort has developed CDAT into a powerful and insightful application for knowledge discovery of observed and simulation climate data. As an analysis engine in the Earth System Grid (ESG) data infrastructure, CDAT is making it possible to remotely access and analyze climate data located at multiple sites around the world.",

            "title": "Performance metrics for climate models",
            "abstract": "[1]\u00a0Objective measures of climate model performance are proposed and used to assess simulations of the 20th century, which are available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. The primary focus of this analysis is on the climatology of atmospheric fields. For each variable considered, the models are ranked according to a measure of relative error. Based on an average of the relative errors over all fields considered, some models appear to perform substantially better than others. Forming a single index of model performance, however, can be misleading in that it hides a more complex picture of the relative merits of different models. This is demonstrated by examining individual variables and showing that the relative ranking of models varies considerably from one variable to the next. A remarkable exception to this finding is that the so-called \u201cmean model\u201d consistently outperforms all other models in nearly every respect. The usefulness, limitations and robustness of the metrics defined here are evaluated 1) by examining whether the information provided by each metric is correlated in any way with the others, and 2) by determining how sensitive the metrics are to such factors as observational uncertainty, spatial scale, and the domain considered (e.g., tropics versus extra-tropics). An index that gauges the fidelity of model variability on interannual time-scales is found to be only weakly correlated with an index of the mean climate performance. This illustrates the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena since accurate simulation of one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects. Once a broad suite of metrics has been developed to characterize model performance it may become possible to identify optimal subsets for various applications.",
