            "title": "D2K: Turning Historical Data into Retrievable Knowledge for Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "A vast amount of user behavior data is constantly accumulating on today's large recommendation platforms, recording users' various interests and tastes. Preserving knowledge from the old data while new data continually arrives is a vital problem for recommender systems. Existing approaches generally seek to save the knowledge implicitly in the model parameters. However, such a parameter-centric approach lacks scalability and flexibility -- the capacity is hard to scale, and the knowledge is inflexible to utilize. Hence, in this work, we propose a framework that turns massive user behavior data to retrievable knowledge (D2K). It is a data-centric approach that is model-agnostic and easy to scale up. Different from only storing unary knowledge such as the user-side or item-side information, D2K propose to store ternary knowledge for recommendation, which is determined by the complete recommendation factors -- user, item, and context. The knowledge retrieved by target samples can be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation algorithms. Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based knowledge encoder to transform the old data into knowledge with the user-item-context cross features. A personalized knowledge adaptation unit is devised to effectively exploit the information from the knowledge base by adapting the retrieved knowledge to the target samples. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that D2K significantly outperforms existing baselines and is compatible with a major collection of recommendation algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Modeling multi-variate time-series (MVTS) data is a long-standing research subject and has found wide applications. Recently, there is a surge of interest in modeling spatial relations between variables as graphs, i.e., first learning one static graph for each dataset and then exploiting the graph structure via graph neural networks. However, as spatial relations may differ substantially across samples, building one static graph for all the samples inherently limits flexibility and severely degrades the performance in practice. To address this issue, we propose a framework for fine-grained modeling and utilization of spatial correlation between variables. By analyzing the statistical properties of real-world datasets, a universal decomposition of spatial correlation graphs is first identified. Specifically, the hidden spatial relations can be decomposed into a prior part, which applies across all the samples, and a dynamic part, which varies between samples, and building different graphs is necessary to model these relations. To better coordinate the learning of the two relational graphs, we propose a min-max learning paradigm that not only regulates the common part of different dynamic graphs but also guarantees spatial distinguishability among samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on both time-series forecasting and time-series point prediction tasks.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion model (DM) recently achieved huge success in various scenarios including offline reinforcement learning, where the diffusion planner learn to generate desired trajectories during online evaluations. However, despite the effectiveness in single-agent learning, it remains unclear how DMs can operate in multi-agent problems, where agents can hardly complete teamwork without good coordination by independently modeling each agent's trajectories. In this paper, we propose MADiff, a novel generative multi-agent learning framework to tackle this problem. MADiff is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To the best of our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, which behaves as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments show the superior performance of MADiff compared to baseline algorithms in a wide range of multi-agent learning tasks, which emphasizes the effectiveness of MADiff in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

            "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in NLP domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM).",

            "abstract": "Order execution is a fundamental task in quantitative finance, aiming at finishing acquisition or liquidation for a number of trading orders of the specific assets. Recent advance in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) provides a data-driven solution to the order execution problem. However, the existing works always optimize execution for an individual order, overlooking the practice that multiple orders are specified to execute simultaneously, resulting in suboptimality and bias. In this paper, we first present a multi-agent RL (MARL) method for multi-order execution considering practical constraints. Specifically, we treat every agent as an individual operator to trade one specific order, while keeping communicating with each other and collaborating for maximizing the overall profits. Nevertheless, the existing MARL algorithms often incorporate communication among agents by exchanging only the information of their partial observations, which is inefficient in complicated financial market. To improve collaboration, we then propose a learnable multi-round communication protocol, for the agents communicating the intended actions with each other and refining accordingly. It is optimized through a novel action value attribution method which is provably consistent with the original learning objective yet more efficient. The experiments on the data from two real-world markets have illustrated superior performance with significantly better collaboration effectiveness achieved by our method.",

            "title": "MAP: A Model-agnostic Pretraining Framework for Click-through Rate Prediction",
            "abstract": "With the widespread application of online advertising systems, click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume (e.g., billions of user click logs). The large capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to its full potential, since click signals are not sufficient enough for the model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs and learn more robust and effective representations. However, current works on this line are still preliminary and rudimentary, leaving self-supervised learning for CTR prediction still an open question. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic Pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection (RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking and predicting a small portion of input features, and we also introduce Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world million-level datasets (i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods over several strong baselines, and achieve new state-of-the-art in terms of both performance and efficiency for CTR prediction.",

            "abstract": "Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is one of the most important forms of online advertising, where an auction is hosted in real time to sell the individual ad impression. How to design an automated bidding strategy in response to the dynamic auction environment is crucial for improving user experience, protecting the interests of advertisers, and promoting the long-term development of the advertising platform. As an exciting topic in the real-world industry, it has attracted great research interest from several disciplines, most notably data science. There have been abundant studies on bidding strategy design which are based on the large volume of historical ad requests. Despite its popularity and significance, few works provide a summary for bid optimization. In this survey, we present the latest overview of the recent works to shed light on the optimization techniques where most of them are validated in practice. We first explore the optimization problem in different works, explaining how these different settings affect the bidding strategy designs. Then, some forms of bidding functions and specific optimization techniques are illustrated. Further, we specifically discuss a new trend about bidding in first-price auctions, which have gradually become popular in recent years. From this survey, both practitioners and researchers can gain insights of the challenges and future prospects of bid optimization in RTB.",

            "abstract": "Extending from sequential recommendation models, in this paper, we present a novel framework named Search-based Time-Aware Recommendation (STARec), which first retrieves the historical behaviors of the given user through a search-based retriever, and then captures the user\u2019s evolving demands over time through a time-aware sequential network. We notice that the key insight of STARec is to use the feature and labels to augment the representations, and thus the effectiveness of STARec relies on the acquisition of rich browsing records of the target user and powerful representation of each browsed item and thus its performance could heavily drop regarding long-tail users and items. To this end, we extend STARec by constructing a graph upon the user-item interactions and leveraging the graph structure to enhance the representation learning. We call this extended version Search-based Time-Aware Graph-Enhanced Recommendation (STAGE). We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and STARec achieves consistent superiority. We further compare STAGE against STARec long-tail users and our results demonstrate that STAGE could outperform STARec at most cases. Results of online A/B tests show that STARec and STAGE achieve an average CTR improvement of around 6% and 1.5% in the two main item recommendation scenarios respectively.",

            "abstract": "Although reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are regarded as promising solutions for interactive recommender systems (IRS), such solutions still face three main challenges, namely, i) time inefficiency when handling large discrete action space in IRS, ii) inability to deal with the cold-start scenarios in IRS, iii) data inefficiency during training the RL-based methods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a generic tree-structured RL framework taking both policy-based and value-based approaches into consideration. We propose to construct a balanced tree over representations of the items, such that picking an item is formulated as seeking a suitable path from the root to a leaf node in the balanced tree, which dramatically reduces the time complexity of item recommendation. Further, for cold-start scenarios where prior information of the items is unavailable, we initialize a random balanced tree as the starting point and then refine the tree structure based on the learned item representations. Besides, we also incorporate a user modeling component to explicitly model the environment, which can be utilized in the training phase to improve data efficiency. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets are conducted and demonstrate that our framework can achieve superior recommendation performance and provide time and data efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods in both warm-start and cold-start IRS scenarios.",
