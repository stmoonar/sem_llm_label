            "abstract": "Text similarity measurement is a link between basic research such as text modeling and upper-level application research of text potential information. In order to improve the accuracy of text similarity measurement, this paper proposes a semantic similarity calculation method integrating word2vec model and TF-IDF, and applies it to the density peak clustering of Chinese text data consulted by patients in online medical community. Experimental results show that the proposed similarity measurement method is superior to the traditional method. Furthermore, the study is among the first to apply the density peak clustering algorithm to online medical community, which offers a reference for how to find out user demands from medical text data in the big data environment.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Although the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise algorithm can identify clusters with arbitrary shape, there is a problem that the global parameter Eps needs to be manually set. In this paper, we propose a parameter adaptive density-based spatial clustering of application with noise by using the cuckoo search algorithm, which could solve the global optimization problem quickly. According to the cuckoo search algorithm to calculate the optimal global parameter Eps, the improved algorithm avoids human intervention in the process of clustering, and achieves clustering process automation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm in this paper can select the reasonable Eps parameter value and get the clustering results with high accuracy.",
