The aim is to identify shared notions or discrepancies to consider for qualifying AI systems. Relevant concepts are integrated into a matrix intended to help defining more precisely when and how computing tools (programs or devices) may be qualified as AI while highlighting critical features to serve a specific technical, ethical and legal assessment of challenges in AI development. Some adaptations of existing notions of AI characteristics are proposed. The matrix is a risk-based conceptual model designed to allow an empirical, flexible and scalable qualification of AI technologies in the perspective of benefit-risk assessment practices, technological monitoring and regulatory compliance: it offers a structured reflection tool for stakeholders in AI development that are engaged in responsible research and innovation.Pre-print version (achieved on May 2020)",

            "abstract": "The miniaturization of computers, coupled with a constant increase in computing power, led to the emergence of new sources of context information. We are facing a new paradigm, the Internet of Things (IoT). Today, this latter improves the quality of life in multiple areas. However, the heterogeneity of objects used in such environments makes their interoperability difficult. In addition, the observations produced by context providers (connected objects) are generated with different vocabularies and data formats. This heterogeneity of technologies in the IoT world makes it necessary to adopt generic solutions. Therefore, it is important to transform the raw data from these context producers into knowledge and information based on ontologies. The use of ontologies solves the challenges of heterogeneity and interoperability of IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a semantic IoT model that aims to overcome the semantic interoperability challenges introduced by the variety of objects potentially used in IoT systems. Furthermore, we enhanced this ontology with quality of context meta-data. These meta-data helps in dealing with imperfection and inconsistency of the collected IoT data.",

This work is conducted in collaboration with the French National Police and is based on requirements defined in a project related to videos analysis in the context of investigations. Due to the constant increasing volume of video generated by CCTV cameras, one of the investigators' goals is to reduce video analysis time. For this purpose, we propose a negative filtering approach based on quality and usability/utility metadata, enabling to eliminate video sequences that do not satisfy requirements for their analysis through automatic processing. Our approach involves a data model which is able to integrate different levels of video metadata, and an associated query mechanism. Experiments performed using the developed framework demonstrate the utility of our approach in a real-world case. Results show that our approach helps CCTV operators to significantly reduce video analysis times.",

            "abstract": "With the constant evolution of CCTV cameras deployed in major cities to ensure the citizens' security, CCTV operators have to watch a huge amount of video when they are searching for scenes, objects, or target persons. Watching or processing some video sequences can be useless for several reasons: content is unsuitable for operators' needs, unusable shooting conditions, etc. Filtering useless content can be an efficient way for operators to save time. In this paper we propose an approach for CCTV contents filtering based on contextual information in order to provide CCTV operators with video sequences of interest. The proposed approach takes into account many sources of contextual information such as: open data, social media, mobility, geolocation, and crowdsourcing. We provide an analysis of contextual information relevant for this approach. Since interoperability is one of the main problems of context-based approaches, we propose a generic data model of contextual information used in our approach in order to tackle this issue. Based on this data, we propose a framework architecture for relevant video segments recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Visual non-verbal behavior analysis (VNBA) methods mainly depend on extracting an important and essential social cue, called eye contact, for performing a wide range of analysis such as dominant person detection. Besides the major need for an automated eye-contact detection method, existing state-of-the-art methods require intrusive devices for detecting any contacts at the eye-level. Also, such methods are completely dependent on supervised learning approaches to produce eye-contact classification models, raising the need for ground truth datasets. To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, we propose a novel geometrical method to detect eye contact in natural multi-person interactions without the need of any intrusive eye-tracking device. We have experimented our method on 10 social videos, each 20 minutes long. Experiments demonstrate highly competitive efficiency with regards to classification performance, compared to the classical existing supervised eye contact detection methods.",

Researchers, developers, industries, telecommunication companies, and scientific communities have been interested in this paradigm and have proposed different solutions from different perspectives. They are mainly focused on the technical level, like performance, interoperability, integration, etc. However, whenever use cases are targeting human users, the focus must not be merely on these sides, but on human factors as well. Thus, it is essential to apply a user-centric approach allowing identification of application-specific features and understanding users needs, motivations and beliefs. This survey aims at encouraging other IoT system developers and researchers to pay attention to the relationship between people and IoT systems. We emphasize the value of adopting a user-centric vision. The goal is not to provide solutions, but rather to raise the right issues.",

This latter is an unsupervised algorithm that doesn't need any prior knowledge on the language neither the domain of the specifications.

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of vehicle re-identification using distance comparison of images in CNN latent spaces. First, we study the impact of the distance metrics, comparing performances obtained with different metrics: the minimal Euclidean distance (MED), the minimal cosine distance (MCD), and the residue of the sparse coding reconstruction (RSCR). These metrics are applied using features extracted through five different CNN architectures, namely ResNet18, AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3 and DenseNet201. We use the specific vehicle re-identification dataset VeRI to fine-tune these CNNs and evaluate results. \nIn overall, independently from the CNN used, MCD outperforms MED, commonly used in the literature. Secondly, the state-of-the-art image-to-track process (I2TP) is extended to a track-to-track process (T2TP) without using complementary metadata. Metrics are extended to measure distance between tracks, enabling the evaluation of T2TP and comparison with I2TP using the same CNN models. Results show that T2TP outperforms I2TP for MCD and RSCR. T2TP combining DenseNet201 and MCD-based metrics exhibits the best performances, outperforming the state-of-the-art I2TP models that use complementary metadata. \nFinally, our experiments highlight two main results: i) the importance of the metric choice for vehicle re-identification, and ii) T2TP improves the performances compared to I2TP, especially when coupled with MCD-based metrics.",

This paper presents a conceptual proposition consisting in developing adaptive E-learning system by incorporating egocentric network-based user profiling, an existing contribution of our research team. Actually, this contribution has been proved in the online social network context with empirical results on different social networks data (Facebook, Delicious, Twitter and DBLP). We aim to apply the existing algorithms underlying this contribution in E-learning context and present in this work a conceptual model and the construction process of learner's user profile, called \"learner profile\". The learner profile can be exploited in adaptive E-learning systems to provide different personalized/adapted services (books recommendation, personalized courses search, ...) to the learner.",

Particularly, the performance and reputation of restaurants is completely dependent on customers satisfaction as a possible metric. With the rapid growth of computer vision technologies, smart restaurants are going to leverage such technologies for indirectly measuring and quantifying customer satisfactions through analyzing videos and images without performing any direct questioner process. However, the large volume of recorded data by cameras makes the manual analysis process computationally expensive in terms of time to quantify customer satisfaction. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a design of a framework, so-called DiEvent, that integrates various components for automatically analyzing dining events. Our framework could be leveraged in different applications and researches, including cooking recipe evaluation in terms of customer satisfaction, performing sociology studies in dining events, and social interactions detection researches.",

These applications are composed of sensors that generate various and heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. Exploiting this spatio-temporal data to support video surveillance systems remains a relevant purpose for video content filtering. Since the data processed in such a context are heterogeneous (indoor and outdoor environment, various position types and reference systems, various data format), interoperability and management of these data remains a problem to be solved. In this paper, we define an approach that integrates camera location and field of view metadata, mobile objects trajectories, and metadata from video content analysis algorithms (e.g. detection and movement of mobile objects) to address problems related to processing of huge amount of data (big data) generated by CCTV systems. We propose a new generic trajectory based query in order to handle trajectory segment's heterogeneity for both environments (indoor and outdoor). The proposed data model integrate multi-source metadata and enable to handle interoperability issue of data. Our querying mechanism enable to automatically retrieve video segments that could contain relevant information for the CCTV operator (suspects, trajectories, etc.). We provide an experimental evaluation demonstrating the utility of our approach in a real-world case. Results show that the proposed approach enhances the efficiency of investigators by reducing the search space, as the operator will analyze only the relevant data, therefore he needs less time for video processing (video reviewing).",

There are many sources which may provide beneficial information to enrich the user\u2019s interests such as his/her social network for recommendation purposes. The proposed approach rests basically on predicting the reliability of the users\u2019 profiles which may contain conflictual interests. The paper aims to discuss this issue.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis approach handles conflicts by detecting the reliability of neighbors\u2019 profiles of a user. The authors consider that these profiles are dependent on one another as they may contain interests that are enriched from non-reliable profiles. The dependency relationship is determined between profiles, each of which contains interests that are structured based on k-means algorithm. This structure takes into consideration not only the evolutionary aspect of interests but also their semantic relationships.\n\n\nFindings\nThe proposed approach was validated in a social-learning context as evaluations were conducted on learners who are members of Moodle e-learning system and Delicious social network. The quality of the created interest structure is assessed. Then, the result of the profile reliability is evaluated. The obtained results are satisfactory. These results could promote recommendation systems as the selection of interests that are considered of enrichment depends on the reliability of the profiles where they are stored.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nSome specific limitations are recorded. As the quality of the created interest structure would evolve in order to improve the profile reliability result. In addition, as Delicious is used as a main data source for the learner\u2019s interest enrichment, it was necessary to obtain interests from other sources, such as e-recruitement systems.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research is among the pioneer papers to combine the semantic as well as the hierarchical structure of interests and conflict resolution based on a profile reliability approach.\n",

In consequence, detecting and matching a person or a car that appears on several videos is a key problem. Many algorithms have been introduced and nowadays, a major relative problem is to evaluate precisely and to compare these algorithms, in reference to a common ground-truth. In this paper, our goal is to introduce a new dataset for evaluating multi-view based methods. This dataset aims at paving the way for multidisciplinary approaches and applications such as 4D-scene reconstruction, object identification/tracking, audio event detection and multi-source meta-data modeling and querying. Consequently, we provide two sets of 25 synchronized videos with audio tracks, all depicting the same scene from multiple viewpoints, each set of videos following a detailed scenario consisting in comings and goings of people and cars. Every video was annotated by regularly drawing bounding boxes on every moving object with a flag indicating whether the object is fully visible or occluded, specifying its category (human or vehicle), providing visual details (for example clothes types or colors), and timestamps of its apparitions and disappearances. Audio events are also annotated by a category and timestamps.",

The problems of redundancy and inconsistency between requirements or sets of requirements impact negatively the success of final products. Manually processing these issues requires too much time and it is very costly. The main contribution of this paper is the use of k-means algorithm for a redundancy and inconsistency detection in a new context, which is Requirements Engineering context. Also, we introduce a filtering approach to eliminate \"noisy\" requirements and a preprocessing step based on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique to see the impact of this latter on the k-means results. We use Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging and noun chunking to detect technical business terms associated to the requirements documents that we analyze. We experiment this approach on real industrial datasets. The results show the efficiency of the k-means clustering algorithm, especially with the filtering and preprocessing steps. Our approach is using the software SEMIOS and will be integrated as a new functionality.",

These devices (sensors, CCTV cameras, etc.) generate a large amount of heterogeneous data, making their analysis and management difficult and very time-consuming. In the context of video-surveillance, automatic extraction of the relevant information among the mass of multi-sources information produced by these systems could significantly reduce the investigation time and facilitate their analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines data from Indoor Location Sensors and metadata from CCTV cameras to automatically retrieve relevant video segments during research of evidence accident or crime events in indoor environments. The proposed method consists in i) the reconstruction of the mobile device trajectories from indoor location sensors and ii) the identification of the CCTV cameras intersecting the reconstructed trajectories. To ensure industrial transferability, indoor location sensors data were embedded in a generic model of CCTV cameras metadata that instantiates the standard ISO 22311 (relative to digital video-surveillance contents). We provide an experimental evaluation demonstrating the utility of our approach in a real-world case. Results show that our method helps the CCTV operators to effectively retrieve the relevant video and drastically reduce the time of analysis.",

            "abstract": "The use of mobile devices and the development of geo-positioning technologies make applications that use location-based services very attractive and useful. These applications are composed of sensors that generate various and heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. Exploiting this spatio-temporal data to support video surveillance systems remains a relevant purpose for video content filtering. Since the data processed in such a context are heterogeneous (indoor and outdoor environment, various position types and reference systems, various data format), interoperability and management of these data remains a problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a new generic trajectory based query in order to handle trajectory segment's heterogeneity. for both environments (indoor and outdoor).The proposed data model integrate multi-source metadata and enable to handle interoperability issue of data. Our querying mechanism enable to automatically retrieve video segments that could contain relevant information for the CCTV operator (suspects, trajectories, etc.). To ensure industrial transferability, we have implemented the metadata dictionary of the Standard ISO 22311/IEC 79 (interoperability of CCTV systems). We provide an experimental evaluation demonstrating the utility of our approach in a real-world case. Results show that the proposed approach enhances the efficiency of investigators by reducing the search space, as the operator will analyze only the relevant data, therefore he needs less time for video processing (video reviewing).",

The problems of redundancy and inconsistency between requirements or sets of requirements impact negatively the success of final products. Manually processing these issues requires too much time and it is very costly. The main contribution of this paper is the use of k-means algorithm for a redundancy and inconsistency detection in a new context, which is Requirements Engineering context. Also, we introduce a pre-processing step based on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to see the impact of this latter to the k-means results. We use Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging and noun chunking to detect technical busi-ness terms associated to the requirements documents that we analyze. We experiment this approach on real industrial datasets. The results show the efficiency of the k-means clustering algorithm especially with the pre-processing.",

In particular, adaptive e-learning systems respond to a strong need to adapt to each learner their proposed activities based on the data stored in his/her profile (learning-style, interest, etc.). However, each system can have incomplete data as far as the learner is concerned. Hence, the exchange of the learner's profile data is extremely important in order to enhance his/her learning experience. The exchange requires a matching process so as to resolve the large number of a learner's profiles differences whether in syntax, structure or semantics. In this context, we propose a matching process to automatically detect the similarity between the profile elements. The originality of this process resides in the fact that it rests on a new semi-supervised Tri-Training algorithm which significantly improves the state of the art approaches.",

Typical research questions in this domain are related to profile building, interest\u2019s recommendation, and trending topics prediction. However, few work has been devoted to the analysis of the evolution of very short and unpredictable events, called polemics. Also, experts do not use tools coming from social network graphs analysis and classical graph theory for this analysis. In this way, this article shows that such analysis lead to a colossal amount of data collected from public social sources like Twitter. The main problem is collecting enough evidences about a non-predictable event, which requires capturing a complete history before and during the course of this event, and processing them. To cope with this problem, while waiting for an event, we captured social data without filtering it, which required more than a TB of disk space. Then, we conduct a time-related social network analysis. The first one is dedicated to the study of the evolution of the actor interactions, using time-series built from a total of 33 graph theory metrics. A Big Data pipeline allows us to validate these techniques on a complex dataset of 284 millions of tweets, analyzing 56 days of the Volkswagen scandal.",

            "abstract": "Online social networks (OSNs) have become an important source of information for a tremendous range of applications and researches. However, the high usability and accessibility of OSNs have exposed many information quality (IQ) problems which consequently decrease the performance of OSNs dependent applications. Social spammers are a particular kind of ill-intentioned users who degrade the quality of OSNs information through misusing all possible services provided by OSNs. Given the fact that Twitter is not immune towards the social spam problem, different researchers have designed various detection methods of a spam content. Ho-wever, the tweet-based detection methods are not effective for detecting a spam content because of the dynamicity and the fast evolution of spam. Moreover, the robust account-based features are costly for extraction because of the need for huge volume of data from Twitter\u2019s servers, while most other account-based features don\u2019t model the behavior of social spammers. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a design of new 10 robust behavioral account-based features for \ufb01lte-ring out spam accounts existing in large-scale Twitter \"crawled\" data collections. Our features focus on modeling the behavior of social spammers, such as the time correlation among tweets. The experimental results show that our new behavioral features are able to correctly classify the majority of social spammers (spam accounts), outperforming 75 account-based features de-signed in the literature.",

            "abstract": "The integration of social networks with mobile communication has led to the rise of a new paradigm, the mobile social network (MSN). Recently, MSN has emerged as a new hot spot of research attracting much interest from both academia and industrial sectors. For instance, MSN opens new horizon for information diffusion-based applications such as viral marketing. Thus, it is a fundamental issue to select an efficient subset of seed-nodes (i.e. initial sources) in a MSN such that targeting them initially will maximize the information diffusion to interested nodes. This paper studies the problem of identifying the best seeds through whom the information can be diffused in the network in order to maximize the content utility (i.e. a quantitative metric that determines how satisfied are the users). A multi- layer model that combines the social relationships and the mobile network in order to design an efficient information diffusion is proposed. Based on this multi-layer model, different seed selection approaches are proposed for information diffusion environment (e.g. mobile advertising) where users have heterogeneous interests for the different information generated in the network. Simulation results show the effectiveness of multi-layer based seed selection approaches comparing to a classical approach.",

            "abstract": "The popularity of social networks is mainly conditioned by the integrity and the quality of contents generated by users as well as the maintenance of users\u2019 privacy. More precisely, Twitter data (e.g. tweets) are valuable for a tremendous range of applications such as search engines and recommendation systems in which working on a high quality information is a compulsory step. However, the existence of ill-intentioned users in Twitter imposes challenges to maintain an acceptable level of data quality. Spammers are a concrete example of ill-intentioned users. Indeed, they have misused all services provided by Twitter to post spam content which consequently leads to serious problems such as polluting search results. As a natural reaction, various detection methods have been designed which inspect individual tweets or accounts for the existence of spam. In the context of large collections of Twitter users, applying these conventional methods is time consuming requiring months to filter o ut spam accounts in such collections. Moreover, Twitter community cannot apply them either randomly or sequentially on each user registered because of the dynamicity of Twitter network. Consequently, these limitations raise the need to make the detection process more systematic and faster. Complementary to the conventional detection methods, our proposal takes the collective perspective of users (or accounts) to provide a searchable information to retrieve accounts having high potential for being spam ones. We provide a design of an unsupervised automatic method to predict spammy naming patterns, as searchable information, used in naming spam accounts. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of predicting spammy naming patterns to retrieve spam accounts in terms of precision, recall, and normalized discounted cumulative gain at different ranks",

Indoor positioning raises new challenges, locating a target device requires the wireless sensors networks and other technologies.

In this context, as no global reference system similar to GPS is available, the location information issued from various systems, platforms, devices, etc. have neither standards nor common formats, and remain heterogeneous. This heterogeneity is mainly due to the different types of positions (geometric, symbolic, etc.) expressed w.r.t. various reference systems. In order to manage them in a given framework, it is necessary to homogenize the relevant (Meta) data to process the global knowledge they can give.

            "abstract": "Online social networks (OSNs) provide data valuable for a tremendous range of applications such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, the easy-to-use interactive interfaces and the low barriers of publications have exposed various information quality (IQ) problems, decreasing the quality of user-generated content (UGC) in such networks. The existence of a particular kind of ill-intentioned users, so-called social spammers, imposes challenges to maintain an acceptable level of information quality. Social spammers simply misuse all services provided by social networks to post spam contents in an automated way. As a natural reaction, various detection methods have been designed, which inspect individual posts or accounts for the existence of spam. These methods have a major limitation in exploiting the supervised learning approach in which ground truth datasets are required at building model time. Moreover, the account-based detection methods are not practical for processing \u201dcrawled\u201d large collections of social posts, requiring months to process such collections. Post-level detection methods also have another drawback in adapting the dynamic behavior of spammers robustly, because of the weakness of the features of this level in discriminating among spam and non-spam tweets. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a design of an unsupervised learning approach dedicated for detecting spam accounts (or users) existing in large collections of Twitter trending topics. More precisely, our method leverages the available simple meta-data about users and the published posts (tweets) related to a topic, as a collective heuristic information, to find any behavioral correlation among spam users acting as a spam campaign. Compared to the account-based spam detection methods, our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of predicting spam accounts (users) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure performance metrics.",

            "abstract": "Research has shown the effectiveness of inferring user interests from social neighbors, also called \"social profiling\". However, the evolution in the social profile is not widely taken into consideration. To overcome this drawback, we propose a time-aware social profiling method that considers the temporal factors of the information and the relationships between the user and his/her social neighbors. This method aims at weighting user interests in the social profile, by applying a time decay function. The temporal score of a given interest is computed by combining the temporal score of information used to extract the interests with the temporal score of individuals who share the information in the network. The experiments conducted on a co-authorship network, DBLP showed that the time-aware social profiling process applying our proposed time-aware method outperforms the existing time-agnostic social profiling process. The combinatorial analysis and the parametric study led us to observe that in the context of co-authorship network, the individual temporal score has more influence than the information temporal score. As this kind of network does not exhibit a rapid evolution of information and relationships, to obtain a relevant social profile, the information should be damped slowly.",

Although the improvement compared to the time-agnostic baseline method is still low, the experiments using a parametric study showed us the benefit of applying a time-aware social profiling process on Twitter.

In this paper, we present a method to construct such resume and illustrate our framework with current Semantic Web technologies, such as RDF and SPARQL for representing and querying semantic metadata.

            "abstract": "Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging social systems, which provides a set of distinctive posting services operating in real time. The flexibility of these services has attracted unethical individuals, so-called \"spammers\", aiming at spreading malicious, phishing, and misleading information. Unfortunately, the existence of spam results non-ignorable problems related to search and user's privacy. In the battle of fighting spam, various detection methods have been designed, which work by automating the detection process using the \"features\" concept combined with machine learning methods. However, the existing features are not effective enough to adapt spammers' tactics due to the ease of manipulation in the features. Also, the graph features are not suitable for Twitter based applications, though the high performance obtainable when applying such features. In this paper, beyond the simple statistical features such as number of hashtags and number of URLs, we examine the time property through advancing the design of some features used in the literature, and proposing new time based features. The new design of features is divided between robust advanced statistical features incorporating explicitly the time attribute, and behavioral features identifying any posting behavior pattern. The experimental results show that the new form of features is able to classify correctly the majority of spammers with an accuracy higher than 93% when using Random Forest learning algorithm, applied on a collected and annotated data-set. The results obtained outperform the accuracy of the state of the art features by about 6%, proving the significance of leveraging time in detecting spam accounts.",

This work has been developed based on requirements defined within different projects with the French National Police in a forensic goal. The video-surveillance agent inputs a query in the form of a hybrid trajectory (date, time, locations expressed with regards to different reference systems) and potentially some visual descriptions of the scene. The query processing starts with the interpretation of the hybrid trajectory and continues with a selection of a set of cameras likely to have filmed the spatial trajectory. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a definition of the hybrid trajectory query concept, trajectory that is constituted of geometrical and symbolic segments represented with regards to different reference systems (e.g., Geodesic system, road network), (2) a spatio-temporal filtering framework based on a spatio-temporal modeling of the transit network and associated cameras.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an ongoing work that aims at assisting video-protection agents in the search for particular video scenes of interest in transit network. The video-protection agent inputs a query in the form of date, time, location and a visual description of the scene. The query processing starts by selecting a set of cameras likely to have filmed the scene followed by an analysis of the video content obtained from these cameras. The main contribution of this paper is the innovative framework that is composed of: 1) a spatiotemporal filtering method based on a spatio-temporal modelling of the transit network and associated cameras, and 2) a content-based retrieval based method on visual features. The presented filtering framework is to be tested on real data acquired within a French National project in partnership with the French Interior Ministry and the French National Police. The project aims at setting up public demonstrators that will be used by researchers and commercials from the video-protection community.",

To achieve this aim, we propose to apply a time-aware method into an existing egocentric-based user profiling process, based on previous contributions of our team. The aim of this strategy is to weight user's interests according to their relevance and freshness. The time awareness weight of an interest is computed by combining the relevance of individuals in the user's egocentric network (computed by taking into account the freshness of their ties) with the information relevance (computed by taking into account its freshness). The experiments on scientific publications networks (DBLP/Mendeley) allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposition compared to the existing time-agnostic egocentric network-based user profiling process.",

            "title": "Dynamic enrichment of social users' interests",
            "abstract": "In a social context, the user is more and more an active contributor for producing social information. Then, he needs a tailored information reflecting his current needs and interests in every period of time. This aims to provide a better adaptation while accessing the information space by integrating users' interests dynamic. Indeed, users' interests may change and become \u201coutdated\u201d through time. So, an interest judged as relevant in a period of time may fluctuate in the next period of time. Moreover, analysing the classic user behaviour to deduce his current interests is a difficult task. In fact, his behaviour isn't always reflecting his real interests. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enriching the user profile in an evolutionary environment such as a social network. The enrichment takes into account: i) the social behaviour and more precisely the tagging behaviour (that reflects user's interests) and ii) the temporal information (that reflects the dynamic evolution of users' interests). Our approach focus on the concept of temperature that reflects the importance of a resource in each period of time. This concept is used to infer common interests of users tagging the same \u201cimportant\u201d resource. The originality of our approach relies on combining information tags, users and resources in a way that guarantees a better enrichment for the social user profile. Our approach has been tested and evaluated with the Delicious social database and shows interesting precision values.",

            "abstract": "Several studies demonstrate effectiveness and benefits of using user's social network information to enrich user's profile. In this context, one of our contributions [1] proposes an algorithm enabling to compute user's interests using information from egocentric network extracted communities. Therefore, mining information from a small or a sparse network remains challenging because there is not enough information to enrich a relevant user's profile. So, one of the main lock is to cope with the lack of information that is considered as an important issue to extract a relevant community and could lead to misinterpretations in the user's profile modeling process. We aim to improve the performance of [1], regarding the lack of information problem, in the case of a small and/or a sparse network. We propose to add more information (i.e. relations) into user's network before extracting the data and enriching his profile. To achieve this enrichment, we suggest using snowball sampling technique to identify and add user's distance-2 neighbors (friends of a friend) into the user's egocentric network. Our experimentation conducted in DBLP demonstrates the interest of node integration into small and sparse network. This leads to the study of link prediction that enables us to provide better performances and results compared to the existing work.",

            "abstract": "The videos recorded by video surveillance systems represent a key element in a police inquiry. Based on a spatio-temporal query specified by a victim, (e.g., the trajectory of the victim before and after the aggression) the human operators select the cameras that could contain relevant information and analyse the corresponding video contents. This task becomes cumbersome because of the huge volume of video contents and the cameras' mobility. This paper presents an approach, which assists the operator in his task and reduces the research space. We propose to model the cameras' network (fixed and mobile cameras) on top of the city's transportation network. We consider the video surveillance system as a multilayer geographic information system, where the cameras are situated into a distinct layer, which is added on top of the other layers (e.g., roads, transport) and is related to them by the location. The model is implemented in a spatio-temporal database. Our final goal is that based on a spatio-temporal query to automatically extract the list of cameras (fixed and mobile) concerned by the query. We propose to include this automatically computed relative position of the cameras as an extension of the standard ISO 22311.",

The solution core includes an ontology-based method to express the interest topics and to automatically classify them. For such textual content obtained in real-time, we propose an unsupervised text classification system based on general YAGO ontology, graph algorithms and a custom scoring method. The system shows good performance using only ontology information and the ontology structure itself. We compare our system against a SVM-based (Support Vector Machine) classic text classification approach. For determining the relevance of a specific document for a specific topic, our approach develops and compares the ontology sub graphs corresponding to the query and to the document. It leads to a high flexibility in terms of capitalizing the already classified documents when refining and changing the interest topic: a graph-based matching of the already obtained ontology-based document representation against the new query representation is enough to assess the document relevance.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of data sources has formed a classical challenge for data management. The LINDO framework is an open system that manages the indexing, storage and retrieval of multimedia contents that are distributed in different remote servers and generated in a real time basis. The main objective of this framework is to provide efficient information retrieval with minimal processing costs. This was achieved through the proposal of an efficient decentralized content indexing mechanism. When considering the pervasive and mobile access to the managed content, the need of an access control becomes essential. In this paper, we apply an access control layer on top of the LINDO architecture that manages access based on the RBAC model and realizes decision making using the XACML standard. We explore the challenges that face the system in processing access requests showing how an access denial could influence the system\u2019s usability especially when returned to a user facing an important situation. Thus, we propose to apply flexible decision making that searches for alternative resources. This operation is performed using PSQRS, a query rewriting system that aims to provide users with pervasive accessibility where they could access any needed multimedia source at anytime, anywhere and anyhow.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, Information and Communication Science and Technology have witnessed awesome advances thanks to the groundbreaking nature of new materials, calculation processes and data sources. 'Grey box' computers now only represent a small proportion of calculation resources and data sources. Indeed, more than 80% of processors are today integrated into various sophisticated devices. The number of sensors integrated into components with processing and signal transmission units has significantly increased. Each sensor is an active node in a system whose local processing capabilities make it possible to aggregate, sort and filter data or carry out more sophisticated processing. Human-computer interaction has also significantly evolved. It is no longer simply confined to the traditional 'screen, keyboard, mouse' triplet but permeates our everyday objects and activities. User Interfaces (UIs) are no more limited to graphics, neither to static contexts of use. Rather, they become multimodal and capable of adaptation to dynamic contexts of use. They migrate from one interactive space to another as long as the user moves. Whilst this vision is exciting from a usage point of view, it raises grand challenges for the engineering of such UIs. These challenges are as great as calculatory devices are powerful and therefore allow merging and mining huge databases. Anticipating and overcoming the risk of system hijacks are also part of these issues. Transparency becomes a highly valuable quality for ensuring better access to resources at all levels of the system or corporation ('virtual', 'in-network' etc.) making resources vulnerable to threats and attacks. Due to the wide range of risks, from economic intelligence to protecting personal data, it is necessary to find the right balance between ensuring data protection and transparency of access to new autonomous resources in open environments. New challenges have emerged such as those related to managing data access, ethics and the well known 'precautionary principle', 'Big data', 'Big Brother'; the list is endless. With such challenges, the growing diversity of dynamic services and of smart objects raises new issues in the design, development and execution of software applications. These applications must be able to adapt to a software and hardware infrastructure that continuously and unpredictably changes. Prime examples are applications that follow the user as he/ she moves, such as those used in mobile phones, cars, houses, etc. which provide him/ her with permanent access to services over a prolonged period of time. As such, the application must face to variations in the context of use, and nevertheless ensure its quality of service. Having simplified the distribution of software applications, middleware have now to facilitate the design of these applications by providing them with the ability to adapt. They must provide software mechanisms at runtime which guarantee the permanent adaptation of the application to a changing context of use. These challenges will therefore increase when faced with new usage in increasingly diverse, variable and unpredictable contexts of use. The present book 'Computer science and ambient intelligence: from sensors to applications' is an outcome of two CNRS 'ambient intelligence' schools organized in July of 2009 and 2011. In line with the ethos of this school, the present work aims to inform the lay reader of the challenges posed by this new field of research. Taking a holistic view, it covers various levels of abstraction, ranging from fundamental to advanced concepts and bringing together the contributions of various specialists in the field, the majority of whom have carried out their research within the school. This book features the main areas of computer science concerned with ambient intelligence (e.g. human-computer interaction, middleware, networks and information systems, etc.). It is a multidisciplinary advance with contributions coming from intelligent materials and ethics, the aim of which is to demonstrate the importance of integrated research, based on social sciences and technological advances. Such research is multi-disciplinary with the aim to mobilize and bring together expertise from each field to develop new theories. This book also pays tribute to the field's wide spectrum of applications with chapters focusing on health, transport and even tourism. The aim of the current work is not pedagogical; rather it is designed to provide a stimulating perspective to attest to the challenge of teaching within current frameworks due to the paradigm's interdisciplinary and contemporary nature and the lack of structures, platforms and generic materials. Recent initiatives such as 'FabLabs' are surely part of a response to this. We would like to warmly thank all the authors who have contributed to the creation of this book. We also sincerely hope that you have as much enjoyment reading their contributions as we have had in listening to their talks during both editions of the Ambient Intelligent school.",

            "abstract": "The field of qualitative spatial reasoning is now an active research area in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and also in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Different kinds of spatial relations play an important role in spatial reasoning, spatial analysis, and query languages for geospatial databases. GIS and image databases are often based on the description of relations between spatial regions. One kind of these relations is the topological relations, where the general description of region-region topological relations in detail is still an unsolved issue, although much effort has been done. The eight basic topological relations between two spatial regions are written without any details in the classical form of the spatial reasoning system RCC8: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ with the names of: DisConnected, Externally Connected, Partial Overlap, Tangential Proper Part, Non-Tangential Proper Part, Tangential Proper Part Inverse, Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse, and Equally. In some applications, such as GIS and satellite imagery, need to be described in detail to get new spatial information by enriching these topological relations of the RCC8 system. In order to extract all the necessary details at all possible levels and to differentiate between relations of the same kind, multi-level topological relations are introduced by using two concepts: the Separation Number and the Types of Spatial Elements (Points and Lines) of the Boundary-Boundary Intersection Spatial Set (BBISS). In this chapter, the major contribution is the definition of multi-level topological relations to enrich the RCC8 system. The authors focus their research on the four relations EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi, which",

            "abstract": "Existing works about user profile modeling always model the user as an independent entity. However, in social sciences, many works show the user's behavior as strongly influenced by his social ties and/or social interactions. These results were difficult to integrate in user profile modeling because of the problem of capturing social data about users in infor-mation systems. With the advent of the social web for example, this barrier can be broken on the Web, and we can reasonably think about enriching users' profiles from social data. In this paper we propose a technique to develop users' profiles with social data. We built profiles from textual users' activities data, and we show through visualization of temporal graphs the relevance of social ties on built profiles with an experimentation carried out on 7, 081 Facebook profiles. These results motivated the potential implementation of new profiling techniques based on users' social networks, to enrich users' profiles and solve pending problems such as 'cold start problem' in personalized or recommender systems.",

As result of our research, we located two points for reducing resource consumption: the limitation of multimedia content transfer over the network for indexing, as well as the reduction of multimedia indexing amount by employing only the most appropriate algorithms for performing indexation, only over the relevant contents. We present in this paper the solution developed in the context of the LINDO project for indexing multimedia content into a distributed system that originally address these two points by reducing as much as possible the resource consumption through (1) a distributed indexing technique that avoids multimedia transfer, (2) a flexible mechanism for selecting the indexing algorithms to be employed on each remote server, according to the multimedia content characteristics, its acquisition context and user queries history.",

            "abstract": "The increasing amount of multimedia data is generally indexed by algorithms which extract metadata that will be further queried by users for retrieving some desired information. Because of the heterogeneity and the diversity of these indexing algorithms, it is not suitable to execute at once all indexing algorithms. Actually, it will overload the information system and will also produce metadata that may not be used inside the system. For example, in a car park surveillance system, it is not necessary to apply to all the video sequences algorithms that detect persons. However, at a certain time someone might want to know about the persons that crossed the parking. It can happen that the multimedia information system returns an empty result to a query because the relevant algorithm for treating the content has not been identified or located. In this case, an algorithm application chain could produce the metadata that could give an answer to the query. In order to identify the right indexing tool(s) for the right resource(s), it would be useful to have a description attached to these tools. In this paper, we propose an indexing algorithm description model and show how to use such a model for determining an appropriate set of indexing algorithms (or sequences of algorithms) according to specific user needs, properties and execution contexts. Our proposal has been integrated in the LINDO project for implicitly and explicitly indexing multimedia contents.",

This technique extends and combines two consecrated alternative methods for structure-based indexing of textual resources: the mathematical approach of the latent semantic indexing and the linguistic-oriented WordNet-based text processing. Thus, the reason behind the good results provided by the first method becomes more transparent due to the linguistic controlled choices proposed by the second method.

These contents are indexed in order to produce some metadata that are used during the retrieval process.

A solution is the mixing of these standards and formats, but this does not ensure interoperability. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a generic metadata framework that could encapsulate the most common metadata standards.

            "abstract": "Topological relations have played important roles in spatial query, analysis and reasoning in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial databases. The topological relations between crisp, uncertain and fuzzy spatial regions based upon the 9-intersections model have been identified. The research issue of topological relations, particularly, between spatial regions with uncertainties, has gained a lot of attention during the past two decades. However, the formal representation and calculation of the topological relations between uncertain regions is still an open issue and needs to be further developed. The paper provides a theoretical framework for modeling topological relations between uncertain spatial regions based upon a new uncertain topological model called the Uncertain Intersection and Difference (UID) Model. In order to derive all topological relations between two spatial regions with uncertainties, the spatial object of type Region (A) is decomposed in four components: the Interior, the Interior\u2019s Boundary, the Object\u2019s Boundary, and the Exterior\u2019s Boundary of A. By use of this definition of spatial region with uncertainties, new 4*4-Intersection and Uncertain Intersection and Difference (UID) models are proposed as a qualitative model for the identification of all topological relations between two spatial regions with uncertainties. These two new models are compared with other models studied in the literature. 152 binary topological relations can be identified by these two models. Then, the topological complexity and distance of the 152 relations will be study in details by using the UID model. Based upon this study of topological complexity and distance, a conceptual neighborhood graph for the 152 relations can be obtained. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of these two models presented in this paper with results which can be applied for modeling GIS, geospatial databases and satellite image processing.",

The challenge of this problem concerns the big heterogeneity of the multimedia indexation algorithms and the weak semantic aspect they address. Our solution considers a generic interface for the indexation algorithms, an implementation as Web services, as well as a semantic description in terms of WSMO (Web Service Modeling Ontology) of their functionality and orchestration. Original contribution of the article concerns the idea of organizing the various multimedia metadata types into a generic structure,used to express the user queries, the algorithms' generic interface, as well as the algorithms' WSMO metadata. This approach facilitates the definition of algorithm combination rules, and enables the reduction of the multimedia retrieval task to a metadata matching process.",

            "abstract": "One of the necessary basic concepts for the spatial data analysis in GIS is to determine the spatial relations between arbitrary geographical objects. In a two-dimensional space (IR2), most existing topological models can distinguish the eight topological relations between two spatial regions A and B. These eight relations are written in the traditional form of the spatial reasoning system RCC8: DC, EC, EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP and NTPPi. Because of the complexity of topological relations between geographic regions, it is difficult for these models to describe in detail the topological relations by defining the separation number of lines and points that characterize these relations, and which is very important to enrich the spatial relations of system RCC8. To overcome the insufficiency in existing models, the extension of the Intersection and Difference (ID) model has the ability to describe in detail the topological relations of system RCC8.\n In our study, we focus our work on the four relations EC, PO, TPP and TPPi which can be described by the boundary-boundary intersection operator \u2202A\u2229\u2202B. The main contributions are these four detailed relations which are written and described in the general form ECmL, nP, kR, POmL, nP, jRI, kR, TPPmLT, nPT, kR and TPPimLT, nPT, kR. Then, we develop definitions for the generalization of these detailed relations. Finally, examples are provided to illustrate the generalization of these new detailed spatial relations.",

Moreover, the amazing progress of the web that allows sharing and accessing to any type of information has further increased this availability. However, query evaluation in spatial data is often expensive, because these data have complex structures and they are available in different formats and scales. Recently, systems have been developed to allow users to sketch what they are looking for instead of translating their requests into verbal query statements. These systems try to close the gap between user and spatial data, so the user can focus on his query rather than spending his time formulating the request. With an intention to make this process easy, the spatial data, in the database, must be reformulated to answer this new type of request. This paper presents a method for remodelling the spatial data in database in order to establish a retrieval information system by sketching.",

In order to extract all the necessary details at all levels and to differentiate between relations of the same kind, multi-level topological relations of RCC-8 are introduced by using two concepts: the Separation Number and the Types of Spatial Elements (Points and Lines) of the Boundary-Boundary Intersection Spatial Set (BBISS). These two concepts are very important to detail these relations.In our study, the major contribution is multi-level topological relations of RCC-8. We focus our work on the four relations EC, PO, TPP and TPPi which can be detailed at two additional levels. First, these four relations are written and described in general detailed forms by the concept of Separation Number. Secondly, the same relations are expressed in other general forms by the concept of Types of Spatial Elements. Finally, examples are provided to illustrate the determination of these relations presented in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Topological relations have played important roles in spatial query, analysis and reasoning in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial databases. The topological relations between crisp and fuzzy spatial objects based upon the 9- intersections topological model have been identified. However the formalization of the topological relations between fuzzy regions needs more investigation. The paper provides a theoretical framework for modelling topological relations between fuzzy regions based upon a new fuzzy topological model called the Fuzzy Intersection and Difference (FID) Model. A novel topological model is formalized based on Fuzzy Topological Space (FTS). In order to derive all fuzzy topological relations between two fuzzy spatial objects, the fuzzy spatial object (A) is decomposed in four components: the Interior, the Interior's Boundary, the Object's Boundary, and the Exterior's Boundary of A. By use of this definition of fuzzy spatial object, new 4*4-Intersection and Fuzzy Intersection and Difference (FID) models are proposed as a qualitative model for the identification of all topological relations between two simple fuzzy regions. These two new models are compared with other fuzzy models studied in the literature. Examples are provided to illustrate the use of these two models presented in this paper with results which can be applied for modeling GIS and geospatial databases.

Alongside the adoption of semantic web technologies for ontology-based modelling, our approach aims at a better relevance for recommendations by adopting a hybrid recommendation technique, combining a collaborative filtering and a content-based approach. The collaborative filtering module adopts a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in order to predict the next concept which will be focused on by the user, tracking the user navigation through an ontology instead of through the structure of a particular site. The content-based recommender module adopts a k nearest neighbours approach and exploits the similarities between the user and document modelling.",

            "title": "Post-classification and spatial reasoning: new approach to change detection for updating GIS database",
            "abstract": "Demand for up-to-date geographic data is increasing due to the fast growth of Geographic Information System (GIS). The process of updating GIS database can be subdivided into three steps. In the first step, changes of the landscape must be detected. In the second step, different data sources must be used to add further attributes. In the last step, the changes with all additional information have to be stored into a GIS database. In this paper, a new approach of change detection for updating GIS database by using remote sensing image is presented. This approach of change detection is based on post-classification comparison and spatial reasoning. Firstly, two different classification methods of satellite imagery, one of pixel-based classification and other of object-oriented classification, have been used. The already existing GIS data are used for deriving the training areas for the classification. The fusion of the results of classification methods yields a good comparison of classification to realizing the change detection between the remote sensing data and GIS data. Secondly, a qualitative approach using spatial reasoning system (Region Connection Calculus RCC8) to representing GIS data and satellite image content in addition to the quantitative information is performed. After a step of segmentation of the satellite image, the spatial reasoning system RCC8 is used to extract and identify the spatial relations (topological and orientation) between the GIS objects and the objects of the results of segmentation. The topological relation describes how the boundaries of two objects relate to each other, while the orientation relation describes where the objects are placed relative to one another. The fusion of the results of post-classification comparison and the spatial reasoning system can detect changes at the level of thematic data, geometric and spatial relations between objects in satellite image and the GIS data. Finally, the changes with all information are returned and stored into the GIS database. This approach is tested with Corine Land Cover (CLC) database and SPOT satellite images.",

For some topics that are directly implied like environment or urban areas analysis, these new data will be very important. Indeed, the arrival of these images enables a new capability and the study of a range of non-observable objects until now. Using high resolution imagery should make it possible to detect man-made features such as buildings, rivers or roads in an easier way than conventional data. This research presents and proposes an automatic system of cartographic elements extraction from space images, using very high spatial resolution images. This system can be adapted to other types of remote sensing images. This research work is focussed on the extraction of four types of cartographic elements: water areas, urban areas, wooded areas and linear features such as roads or railways. Each type of cartographic element is extracted detecting its own characteristics, using image analysis, applying a segmentation process and knowledge extraction.",

The ontology-based retrieval mechanism will investigate not only the matches with the concepts involved in a query, but also with their related concepts inside the ACM classification system; the ranking algorithm will consider the documents content as well as the user competence.",

We adapt flexible querying ideas, already used for classically structured databases, to XQuery\u2010like querying of SSD for managing users' priority and preferences, but also for tackling with the variability of SSD underlying structures. Indeed flexible querying seems to be still more useful for SSD than for classical databases, because of the potential structural heterogeneity of the former. Fuzzy sets are useful for expressing flexible requirements on attribute values and for estimating the degree of similarity of tags, or attribute labels, with elements present in the request. Priorities are introduced in the request for specifying the relative importance of elementary requirements in terms of their semantic contents, but also preferences about the location of information in the structure. The evaluation of the queries uses a qualitative scale with a finite number of levels, and retrieved pieces of SSD are rank\u2010ordered using a lexicographic vector procedure.

            "abstract": "IntroductIon The emergence of multimedia technology and the rapid growth in the number and type of multimedia assets controlled by public and private entities, as well as the expanding range of image and video documents appearing on the Web, have attracted significant research efforts in providing tools for effective retrieval and management of multimedia data. Multimedia retrieval is based on the availability of a representation scheme for multimedia content. Multimedia content descriptors may be visual features such as color, texture, shape, and spatial relationships, audio features such as cepstrum coefficients and spectral properties, textual features such as keyword counts, or multimedia semantic primitives (labeled image regions, word signatures in audio, concepts mediated by the presence of various keywords). Conventional information retrieval is based solely on text, and these approaches to textual information retrieval have been transplanted into multimedia retrieval in a variety of ways, including the representation of a multimedia document as a vector of feature values. However, \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words.\u201d Multimedia contents are much more versatile compared with text, and the amount of visual data is already enormous and still expanding very rapidly. Hoping to cope with these special characteristics of multimedia data, content-based multimedia retrieval methods have been introduced. It has been widely recognized that the family of multimedia retrieval techniques should become an integration of both low-level visual features, addressing the more detailed perceptual aspects, and high-level semantic features underlying the more general conceptual aspects of multimedia data. Although efforts have been devoted to combining these two aspects of visual data, the gap between them is still a huge barrier in front of researchers. Intuitive and heuristic approaches do not provide us with satisfactory performance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for finding and managing the latent correlation between low-level features and high-level concepts. How to bridge this gap between visual features and semantic features has been a major challenge in this research field (Smeulders, Worring, Santini, Gupta, & Jain, 2000). The different types of information that are normally associated with multimedia documents are (Grosky, 1994):",

            "abstract": "Fuzzy logic is known for providing a convenient tool for interfacing linguistic categories with numerical data and for expressing user's preference in a gradual and qualitative way. Fuzzy set methods have been already applied to the representation of flexible queries and to the modeling of uncertain pieces of information in databases systems, as well as in information retrieval. This methodology seems to be even more promising in multimedia databases which have a complex structure and from which documents have to be retrieved and selected not only from their contents, but also from \"the idea\" the user has of their appearance, through queries specified in terms of user's criteria. This paper provides a preliminary investigation of the potential applications of fuzzy logic in multimedia databases. The problem of comparing semistructured documents is first discussed. Querying issues are then more particularly emphasized. We distinguish two types of request, namely, those which can be handled within some extended version of an SQL-like language and those for which one has to elicit user's preference through examples.",

            "abstract": "The aim of our work is to develop an application to manage and exchange technical documents. The use of an object-oriented semantic data model is suitable for such multimedia document modelling. However, this model must be enriched in order to take into account extra concepts necessarly to implement hypertext funcionalities, essential in our context : indeed, the hypertext approach allows us to cope with the problems of information sharing and reuse. This leads to design a MetaModel of the hyperbase wich integrates these two complementary approaches.",

A coaxial transmission line is formed within the linear actuator to include a center conductor coaxial with the actuator and an outer conductor. A bead of ferrite or other suitable magnetically permeable material is coupled to the piston and surrounds the center conductor of the transmission line for altering impedance characteristics of the transmission line as a function of position of the piston within the cylinder. Position sensing electronics include an oscillator coupled to the transmission line for launching electromagnetic radiation, and a phase detector responsive to radiation reflected from the transmission line for determining position of the piston within the actuator cylinder.",

            "abstract": "The American Journal of Sociology, as has so often been remarked, is the oldest sociological periodical extant. As the previous editor, Peter M. Blau, pointed out in the introduction to the index for volumes 1-70, some of the renowned forefathers of the discipline were living or even early contributors during the first years of the Journal. In 1966, an index to the first seventy volumes (18951965) was published. In order to enhance the utility of the Journal for the many scholars who use it, keeping this index up to date has special importance. This additional index for volumes 71-75 follows the plan of the previous one. The codes for methodology utilized in each article and the classification under which titles have been grouped will be found on the first page of each of the sections of this index. While every effort has been made to insure consistency and appropriateness in the classifications, and to avoid omissions, it would be appreciated if any errors are called to the attention of the editorial office. From time to time, individuals have made studies of the trends of subjects dealt with in the Journal, in part for the purpose of tracing changes in the main foci of the discipline. Undoubtedly there is a pattern or trend in the materials published, even though the editors decide on whether or not to publish a manuscript, taking each case by itself (with rare exceptions). A serious analysis of trends in topics dealt with since the previous article on the subject would be of considerable use, as would additional studies (beyond the considerable number that have appeared in the American Sociologist) comparing the source of articles and the coverage of topics in this Journal with others in the field. As a small first step in that direction, we have prepared a breakdown of the types of articles published in the last five years in AJS. The categories correspond to those used in the Author Index. The breakdown is as follows:",
