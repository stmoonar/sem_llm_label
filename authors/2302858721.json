            "title": "Eighth Workshop on Human-In-the-Loop Data Analytics (HILDA)",
            "abstract": "HILDA brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and results on human-data interaction. It explores how data management and analysis can be made more effective when taking into account the people who design and build these processes as well as those who are impacted by their results. Following the past two years, we plan to continue to focus on this year's workshop on early-stage research that is promising and exciting, which includes pairing each accepted paper with a mentor. The theme for this edition of the workshop is HILDA and Large Language Models. However, the workshop is not limited to this theme and other topics are also of interest. In this summary, we describe the workshop, its main focus areas, our review and mentorship plan as well as the keynote and panel sessions.",
