            "title": "Loss Compensation in Multi-Session Recommendation Under Limited Availability",
            "abstract": "In many recommendation applications, items may have limited availability thereby causing conflict among users interested in the same items. Over time, this results in unequal user treat-ment: few users are recommended the limited items and receive preferential treatment, while the rest is left with sub-optimal recommendations, ultimately leading them to leave. In this paper, we formalize the novel problem of compensating users in multi-session recommendations under limited item availability. Our aim is to generate recommendations that not only optimize accuracy, but also compensate users over time for the loss of accuracy incurred in previous iterations. We design compensation strategies that serve users and items in different orders and accommodate various recommendation adoption models. Our algorithms are integrated into SoCRATe (System for Compensating Recommendations with Availability and Time), a framework that enables us to study loss compensation over time. Our experiments on real data demonstrate that to best compensate users for the incurred loss, traditional recommenders need to be revisited to account for item availability. Our experiments on synthetic data explore different parameters of our solution and show that it is much faster than an optimal (brute-force) compensation strategy, while achieving comparable results.",

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most notable approaches to auto-mate data exploration and several solutions have been proposed.

In this context, various data exploration operators are leveraged including traditional roll-up and drill-down operations and text-based operations. An RL agent is trained to generate the best policy according to a hand-crafted reward function. The benefit of training RL policies for specific data exploration tasks has been demonstrated more than once for exploring finding a needle in a haystack, for serendipitous galaxy exploration, for helping a customer land on a satisfactory product, for helping a conference chair build a program committee in a stepwise fashion, for summarizing large datasets, etc. With the advent of Large Language Models and their ability to reason sequentially, it has become legitimate to ask the question: would LLMs and AI planning",

With the prevalence of graph representations in real-life applications, hypothesis testing on graphs is gaining importance. In this work, we formalize node, edge, and path hypotheses on attributed graphs. We develop a sampling-based hypothesis testing framework, which can accommodate existing hypothesis-agnostic graph sampling methods.

However, the process of iteratively refining SQL queries is tedious and time consuming. We formulate the automation of personalized SQL-based data exploration as the problem of suggesting the most relevant query and accounting for user feedback at each step. We develop an end-to-end solution and a system to assist users in exploring different components of a complex database. We instantiate our solution using Multi-Armed Bandits, a category of algorithms that are suitable for interactive online learning by balancing exploration with exploitation. We design a lightweight algorithm to personalize stepwise SQL recommendations that efficiently discovers the current user preferences in coordination with that user's feedback and what other users prefer. We run extensive experiments that demonstrate the utility of our approach for large-scale data exploration.",

            "abstract": "We address demographic bias in neighborhood-learning models for collaborative filtering recommendations. Despite their superior ranking performance, these methods can learn neighborhoods that inadvertently foster discriminatory patterns. Little work exists in this area, highlighting an important research gap. A notable yet solitary effort, Balanced Neighborhood Sparse LInear Method (BNSLIM) aims at balancing neighborhood influence across different demographic groups. Yet, BNSLIM is hampered by computational inefficiency, and its rigid balancing approach often impacts accuracy. In that vein, we introduce two novel algorithms. The first, an enhancement of BNSLIM, incorporates the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize all similarities concurrently, greatly reducing training time. The second, Fairly Sparse Linear Regression (FSLR), induces controlled sparsity in neighborhoods to reveal correlations among different demographic groups, achieving comparable efficiency while being more accurate. Their performance is evaluated using standard exposure metrics alongside a new metric for user coverage disparities. Our experiments cover various applications, including a novel exploration of bias in course recommendations by teachers\u2019 country development status. Our results show the effectiveness of our algorithms in imposing fairness compared to BNSLIM and other well-known fairness approaches.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate SHEVA, a System for Hypothesis Exploration with Visual Analytics. SHEVA adopts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach to discovering statistically-sound insights from large datasets. The system addresses three longstanding challenges in Multiple Hypothesis Testing: (i) the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis by chance, (ii) the pitfall of not being representative of the input data, and (iii) the ability to navigate among many data regions while preserving the user's train of thought. To address (i) & (ii), SHEVA implements significance adjustment methods that account for data-informed properties such as coverage and novelty. To address (iii), SHEVA proposes to guide users by recommending one-sample and two-sample hypotheses in a stepwise fashion following a data hierarchy. Users may choose from a collection of pre-trained hypothesis exploration policies and let SHEVA guide them through the most significant hypotheses in the data, or intervene to override suggested hypotheses. Furthermore, SHEVA relies on data-to-visual element mappings to convey hypothesis testing results in an interpretable fashion, and allows hypothesis pipelines to be stored and retrieved later to be tested on new datasets.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention from both academia and industry due to their potential to facilitate natural language processing (NLP) and generate highquality text. Despite their benefits, however, the use of LLMs is raising concerns about the reliability of knowledge extraction. The combination of DB research and data science has advanced the state of the art in solving real-world problems, such as merchandise recommendation and hazard prevention [30]. In this discussion, we explore the challenges and opportunities related to LLMs in DB and data science research and education.",

            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",
