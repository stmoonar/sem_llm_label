            "title": "Trustworthy Recommender Systems: Foundations and Frontiers",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to provide personalized suggestions to users, helping them make effective decisions. However, recent evidence has revealed the untrustworthy aspects of advanced recommender systems, leading to harmful effects in safety-critical areas like finance and healthcare. This tutorial will offer a comprehensive overview of achieving trustworthy recommender systems. It will cover six important aspects: Safety & Robustness, Non-discrimination & Fairness, Explainability, Privacy, Environmental Well-being, and Accountability & Auditability. Each aspect will be defined and categorized, followed by a discussion of the latest research progress and notable works. Additionally, potential interactions among these aspects and future research directions for trustworthy recommender systems will be explored.",
