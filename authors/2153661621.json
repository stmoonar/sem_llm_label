            "abstract": "Understanding ncRNA-protein interaction is of critical importance to unveil ncRNAs' functions. Here, we propose an integrated package LION which comprises a new method for predicting ncRNA/lncRNA-protein interaction as well as a comprehensive strategy to meet the requirement of customisable prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms its competitors on multiple benchmark datasets. LION can also improve the performance of some widely used tools and build adaptable models for species- and tissue-specific prediction. We expect that LION will be a powerful and efficient tool for the prediction and analysis of ncRNA/lncRNA-protein interaction. The R Package LION is available on GitHub at https://github.com/HAN-Siyu/LION/.",

            "title": "TIGER: technical variation elimination for metabolomics data using ensemble learning architecture",
            "abstract": "Abstract Large metabolomics datasets inevitably contain unwanted technical variations which can obscure meaningful biological signals and affect how this information is applied to personalized healthcare. Many methods have been developed to handle unwanted variations. However, the underlying assumptions of many existing methods only hold for a few specific scenarios. Some tools remove technical variations with models trained on quality control (QC) samples which may not generalize well on subject samples. Additionally, almost none of the existing methods supports datasets with multiple types of QC samples, which greatly limits their performance and flexibility. To address these issues, a non-parametric method TIGER (Technical variation elImination with ensemble learninG architEctuRe) is developed in this study and released as an R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TIGERr). TIGER integrates the random forest algorithm into an adaptable ensemble learning architecture. Evaluation results show that TIGER outperforms four popular methods with respect to robustness and reliability on three human cohort datasets constructed with targeted or untargeted metabolomics data. Additionally, a case study aiming to identify age-associated metabolites is performed to illustrate how TIGER can be used for cross-kit adjustment in a longitudinal analysis with experimental data of three time-points generated by different analytical kits. A dynamic website is developed to help evaluate the performance of TIGER and examine the patterns revealed in our longitudinal analysis (https://han-siyu.github.io/TIGER_web/). Overall, TIGER is expected to be a powerful tool for metabolomics data analysis.",

            "title": "Deep forest ensemble learning for classification of alignments of non-coding RNA sequences based on multi-view structure representations",
            "abstract": "Abstract Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple biological processes. However, only a few ncRNAs\u2019 functions have been well studied. Given the significance of ncRNAs classification for understanding ncRNAs\u2019 functions, more and more computational methods have been introduced to improve the classification automatically and accurately. In this paper, based on a convolutional neural network and a deep forest algorithm, multi-grained cascade forest (GcForest), we propose a novel deep fusion learning framework, GcForest fusion method (GCFM), to classify alignments of ncRNA sequences for accurate clustering of ncRNAs. GCFM integrates a multi-view structure feature representation including sequence-structure alignment encoding, structure image representation and shape alignment encoding of structural subunits, enabling us to capture the potential specificity between ncRNAs. For the classification of pairwise alignment of two ncRNA sequences, the F-value of GCFM improves 6% than an existing alignment-based method. Furthermore, the clustering of ncRNA families is carried out based on the classification matrix generated from GCFM. Results suggest better performance (with 20% accuracy improved) than existing ncRNA clustering methods (RNAclust, Ensembleclust and CNNclust). Additionally, we apply GCFM to construct a phylogenetic tree of ncRNA and predict the probability of interactions between RNAs. Most ncRNAs are located correctly in the phylogenetic tree, and the prediction accuracy of RNA interaction is 90.63%. A web server (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/gcfm/) is developed to maximize its availability, and the source code and related data are available at the same URL.",
