            "abstract": "Utilizing existing methods for bias detection in machine learning (ML) models is challenging since each method: 1) explores a different ethical aspect of bias, which may result in contradictory output among the different methods; 2) provides output in a different range/scale and therefore cannot be compared with other methods; and 3) requires different input, thereby requiring a human expert\u2019s involvement to adjust each method according to the model examined. In this article, we present BENN, a novel bias estimation method that uses a pretrained unsupervised deep neural network. Given an ML model and data samples, BENN provides a bias estimation for every feature based on the examined model\u2019s predictions. We evaluated BENN using three benchmark datasets, one proprietary churn prediction model used by a European telecommunications company, and a synthetic dataset that includes both a biased feature and a fair one. BENN\u2019s results were compared with an ensemble of 21 existing bias estimation methods. The evaluation results show that BENN provides bias estimations that are aligned with those of the ensemble while offering significant advantages, including the fact that it is a generic approach (i.e., can be applied to any ML model) and does not require a domain expert.",

            "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has undergone substantial improvements since the incorporation of deep learning. However, the vulnerability of neural networks to imperceptible adversarial perturbations exposes ASR-based devices to potentially serious threats. So far, imperceptibility of audio adversarial examples has been associated with small, or inaudible perturbations. In this paper, we expand the domain of viable audio adversarial examples to include audible, but inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. We present EvolMusic, the first targeted adversarial attack based on musical note-sequences. Our musical perturbations are generated via an adaptive evolutionary approach in a black-box setting. We evaluate our attack against DeepSpeech v0.9.1 using the Fluent Speech Commands dataset.",

            "abstract": "The detection of anomalies in data is a far-reaching field of research which also applies to the field of cloud computing in several different ways: from the detection of various types of intrusions to the detection of hardware failures, many publications address how far anomaly detection methods are able to meet the specific requirements of a cloud-based network. Since there is still no comprehensive overview of this constantly growing field of research, this literature review provides a systematic evaluation of 215 publications that can be considered as representative for the last ten years of this scientific development. Our analysis identifies three main methodological areas (machine learning, deep learning, statistical approaches) and summarizes how exactly the corresponding models are applied for the detection of anomalies. Furthermore, we clarify which concrete application areas are typically addressed by anomaly detection in the context of cloud computing environments and which related public datasets are often used for evaluations. Finally, we discuss the implications of the literature review and provide directions for future research.",

            "abstract": "The detection of anomalies in cloud metrics is an important way to identify suspicious data instances that indicate a system problem such as hardware failures, performance bottlenecks or intrusions. Yet, especially in a cloud computing infrastructure where the amount and variety of services is constantly increasing, it is getting more and more challenging to monitor and maintain the system manually. Thus, it is beneficial to use machine learning to detect anomalies at least partially in an automated way. The contribution of this paper is two-folded: firstly, we evaluate three unsupervised, reconstruction-based methods for anomaly detection (PCA, Autoencoder, LSTM-Encoder-Decoder) on the Yahoo! Webscope S5 benchmark dataset. Secondly, we compare our chosen models to a widely-used density-based approach and show that our reconstruction-based approaches outperform the related work.",

            "title": "Cryptocurrency Pump and Dump Schemes: Quantification and Detection",
            "abstract": "In the past years, cryptocurrencies have received a lot of attention in popular media. Having attracted significant speculation, prices have soared in 2017, fell in 2018 and are generally known to be very volatile. However, some of the price changes have been due to organized manipulation. Traditionally known in the world of penny stocks and made illegal in most countries, pump and dump schemes are frequent in cryptocurrencies, and mostly unregulated. In this paper, we perform quantification and detection of pump and dump schemes that are coordinated through Telegram chats and executed on Binance \u2013 one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. We detail how pumps are organized on Telegram, and quantify the properties of 149 confirmed events with respect to market capitalization, trading volume, price impact and profitability. Based on this ground truth, and regular trading intervals obtained from twitter timestamps, we optimize a binary classifier in order to be able to detect additional suspicious trading activity. Our results indicate that pump and dump schemes occur frequently in cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations below $50 million, that scheme operators often organize their actions across multiple channels, that such activity tends to lead to inflated prices over longer time periods and machine learning can help to identify activity that is similar to known pump and dump schemes.",
