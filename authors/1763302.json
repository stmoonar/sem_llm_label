            "abstract": "GNNs are powerful models based on node representation learning that perform particularly well in many machine learning problems related to graphs. The major obstacle to the deployment of GNNs is mostly a problem of societal acceptability and trustworthiness, properties which require making explicit the internal functioning of such models. Here, we propose to mine activation rules in the hidden layers to understand how the GNNs perceive the world. The problem is not to discover activation rules that are individually highly discriminating for an output of the model. Instead, the challenge is to provide a small set of rules that cover all input graphs. To this end, we introduce the subjective activation pattern domain. We define an effective and principled algorithm to enumerate activations rules in each hidden layer. The proposed approach for quantifying the interest of these rules is rooted in information theory and is able to account for background knowledge on the input graph data. The activation rules can then be redescribed thanks to pattern languages involving interpretable features. We show that the activation rules provide insights on the characteristics used by the GNN to classify the graphs. Especially, this allows to identify the hidden features built by the GNN through its different layers. Also, these rules can subsequently be used for explaining GNN decisions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show highly competitive performance, with up to 200% improvement in fidelity on explaining graph classification over the SOTA methods.",

In this variant of the dial-a-ride problem (DARP), each user has a round-trip demand with one morning request and one afternoon request. The novelty of this approach is that a user's maximum ride time is shared between the two requests, creating a dependency between the morning routes and the afternoon routes. The RT-DARP is solved using the small and large neighbour-hood search (SLNS) metaheuristic and further speed up by an improved feasibility testing procedure. Results from this new formulation are compared with results from solving separately the morning and afternoon DARP. The experiments are performed on a new benchmark generated for the RT-DARP. The results from the RT-DARP always outperform the results from the separated formulation. From a managerial perspective, the RT-DARP makes it possible to improve the quality of service without changing the transportation cost.",

We also conduct a weekly pattern analysis of activity, providing insights into the geographical location of Bitcoin users and allowing us to quantify the bias of a well-known dataset for actor identification.",

            "abstract": "We consider day-ahead electricity price forecasting on the European market. In this market, participants can offer electricity for sale or purchase for a specific price by submitting overnight orders. Market operators determine the market clearing price \u2013 the price at which the amount of electricity supplied equals the amount of electricity demanded \u2013 using the Euphemia balancing algorithm. EUPHEMIA is a quadratic optimization problem that maximizes the social welfare defined as the sum of the supplier surplus and consumer surplus while ensuring a null energy balance. This mechanism deeply influences the price calculation, but has so far been little considered in electricity price forecasting algorithms. Existing models are generally based on identifying relationships between exogenous characteristics (consumption and production forecasts) and the market clearing price to be predicted. A few studies have examined the EUPHEMIA mechanism during prediction, by doing costly manual transformations on order books. In this article, we overcome this limitation by considering the pricing mechanism during model training. For this, we use a predict-and-optimize strategy with differentiable optimization. We design a fully differentiable and scalable solving method for the EUPHEMIA optimization problem and apply it on real-life data from the European Power Exchange (EPEX). We design different model architectures using our differentiable solver and empirically study the impact of taking into account the optimal calculation of prices within the training of the neural network.",

We show that contrary to them, EDEV is able to distinguish between graphs that have a typical structure with respect to a model, and those that do not.

            "abstract": "The need of predictive maintenance comes with an increasing number of incidents reported by monitoring systems and equipment/software users. In the front line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of severity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective actions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been proposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly limiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model based on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and emphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively reported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent developments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing global explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local explanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with an explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an important number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an original data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining technique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar explanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each group. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give us good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach provides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome explanation.",

            "abstract": "Community detection in multilayer networks aims to identify groups of well-connected nodes across multiple layers. While existing methods have been developed to deal with large graphs with few layers (typically less than 10), many real-world datasets are structured by transitive relationships that give rise to networks with thousands of extremely dense layers (e.g. co-citation networks, IMDb actor graphs, co-reference information network, social net- works). In addition, in these datasets the layers are often associated with textual summaries which provide important and hitherto unexploited information on the nature of the relation encoded by the layer. In this paper, we propose a new method which exploits the text associated with the layers in order to identify communities grouping together nodes connected through several semantically close layers. The method consists in embedding layer textual information in an Euclidean space, and to use it to group together, in the same community, nodes belonging to semantically close layers. To that end, we develop a pattern mining approach that extracts communities from numerical data. This approach, which mixes both symbolic and numeric techniques, is particularly well suited to identify communities in multilayer graphs. Indeed, we show that it obtains more diverse and better quality communities than those obtained by state-of-the-art competitors on datasets where ground truth is known. We also show that taking into account the semantic information improves the quality of the communities.",

Various statistical models exist, which describe this structure as the result of a combination of constraints and randomness. In this article, we introduce edge probability prequential inference, a new approach to perform model selection, which relies on probability distributions on edge ensembles. From a theoretical point of view, we show that this methodology provides a more consistent ground for statistical inference with respect to existing techniques, due to the fact that it relies on multiple realizations of the random variable. It also provides better guarantees against overfitting, by making it possible to lower the number of parameters of the model below the number of observations. Experimentally, we illustrate the benefits of this methodology in two situations: to infer the partition of a stochastic blockmodel and to identify the most relevant model for a given graph between the stochastic blockmodel and the configuration model.",

            "abstract": "Explainable AI has received a lot of attention over the past decade, with the proposal of many methods explaining black box classifiers such as neural networks. Despite the ubiquity of recommender systems in the digital world, only few researchers have attempted to explain their functioning, whereas it raises e.g., ethical issues. Indeed, recommender systems direct user choices to a large extent and their impact is important as they give access to only a small part of the range of items (e.g., products and/or services), as the submerged part of the iceberg. Consequently, they limit access to other resources. The potentially negative effects of these systems have been pointed out as phenomena like echo chambers and winner-take-all effects, because the internal logic of these systems is to likely enclose the consumer in a \"dej\u00b4 a vu\" loop. Therefore, it is crucial to provide explanations` of such recommender systems and to identify the user data that led the system to make a specific recommendation. This makes it possible to evaluate recommender systems not only regarding their efficiency (i.e., their capability to recommend an item that was actually chosen by the user), but also w.r.t. the diversity, relevance and timeliness of the active data used to make the recommendation. In this paper, we propose a deep analysis of 7 state-of-the-art models learnt on 6 datasets based on the identification of the items or the sequences of items actively used by the models. The proposed method, which is based on subgroup discovery with different pattern languages (i.e., itemsets and sequences), provides interpretable explanations of the recommendations \u2013 useful to compare different models and explain the reasons behind the recommendation to the user.",

            "abstract": "Concepts are often described in terms of positive integer-valued attributes that are organized in a hierarchy. For example, cities can be described in terms of how many places there are of various types (e.g. nightlife spots, residences, food venues), and these places are organized in a hierarchy (e.g. a Portuguese restaurant is a type of food venue). This hierarchy imposes particular constraints on the values of related attributes---e.g. there cannot be more Portuguese restaurants than food venues. Moreover, knowing that a city has many food venues makes it less surprising that it also has many Portuguese restaurants, and vice versa. In the present paper, we attempt to characterize such concepts in terms of so-called contrastive antichains: particular kinds of subsets of their attributes and their values. We address the question of when a contrastive antichain is interesting, in the sense that it concisely describes the unique aspects of the concept, and this while duly taking into account the known attribute dependencies implied by the hierarchy. Our approach is capable of accounting for previously identified contrastive antichains, making iterative mining possible. Besides the interestingness measure, we also present an algorithm that scales well in practice, and demonstrate the usefulness of the method in an extensive empirical results section.",

In this paper, we tackle the problem of local event detection from social media data. We present a method to automatically identify events by evaluating the burstiness of hashtags in a geographical area and a time interval, and at the same time integrating user feedback. We devise two algorithms to discover user-driven events. The first one relies on an exact enumeration process, while the other directly samples the space of events. In our empirical study, we provide evidence that geolocated events cannot be detected by non location-aware methods. We also show that our methods (i) outperform by a factor of two to several orders of magnitude state-of-the-art methods designed to discover geolocated events, (ii) are more robust to noise, and (iii) produce high quality events with respect to user interests.",

            "abstract": "An important goal in researching the biology of olfaction is to link the perception of smells to the chemistry of odorants. In other words, why do some odorants smell like fruits and others like flowers? While the so-called stimulus-percept issue was resolved in the field of color vision some time ago, the relationship between the chemistry and psycho-biology of odors remains unclear up to the present day. Although a series of investigations have demonstrated that this relationship exists, the descriptive and explicative aspects of the proposed models that are currently in use require greater sophistication. One reason for this is that the algorithms of current models do not consistently consider the possibility that multiple chemical rules can describe a single quality despite the fact that this is the case in reality, whereby two very different molecules can evoke a similar odor. Moreover, the available datasets are often large and heterogeneous, thus rendering the generation of multiple rules without any use of a computational approach overly complex. We considered these two issues in the present paper. First, we built a new database containing 1689 odorants characterized by physicochemical properties and olfactory qualities. Second, we developed a computational method based on a subgroup discovery algorithm that discriminated perceptual qualities of smells on the basis of physicochemical properties. Third, we ran a series of experiments on 74 distinct olfactory qualities and showed that the generation and validation of rules linking chemistry to odor perception was possible. Taken together, our findings provide significant new insights into the relationship between stimulus and percept in olfaction. In addition, by automatically extracting new knowledge linking chemistry of odorants and psychology of smells, our results provide a new computational framework of analysis enabling scientists in the field to test original hypotheses using descriptive or predictive modeling.",

Discovering patterns that accurately discriminate a class from the others is one of the most common SD tasks. Standard approaches of the literature are based on local pattern discovery, which is known to provide an overwhelmingly large number of redundant patterns. To solve this issue, pattern set mining has been proposed: instead of evaluating the quality of patterns separately, one should consider the quality of a pattern set as a whole. The goal is to provide a small pattern set that is diverse and well-discriminant to~the target class. In this work, we introduce a novel formulation of the task of diverse subgroup set discovery where both discriminative power and diversity of the subgroup set are incorporated in the same quality measure. We propose an efficient and parameter-free algorithm dubbed FSSD and based on a greedy scheme. FSSD uses several optimization strategies that enable to efficiently provide a high quality pattern set in a short amount of time.",

Most of the current techniques attempt to discover relationships between time-point events but are not practical for discovering dependencies over interval-based events. In this work, we present a new approach to mine dependencies between streams of interval-based \nevents that links two events if they occur in a similar manner, one being often followed by the other one after a certain time interval in the \ndata. The proposed method is robust to temporal variability of events and determines the most appropriate time intervals whose validity is assessed by a Chi2 test. As several intervals may redundantly describe the same dependency, the approach retrieves only the most speci c intervals with respect to a dominance relationship over temporal dependencies, and thus avoids the classical problem of pattern flooding in data mining. The TEDDY algorithm, TEmporal Dependency DiscoverY, prunes the search space while guaranteeing the discovery of all valid and signifi cant temporal dependencies. We present empirical results on simulated and real-life data to show the scalability and the robustness of our approach. The \ndependency relationships defi ne a graph that supports intelligent analysis as illustrated by two case studies: Outdoor surveillance of a building via \nvideo camera and motion sensors, and assistance for road deicing operations based on the humidity and temperature measurements at the urban \nscale. These applications demonstrate the e\u000eficiency and the e\u000bfectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Getting a labelling of vertices close to the structure of the graph has been proved to be of interest in many applications, e.g. to follow signals indexed by the vertices of the network. This question can be related to a graph labelling problem known as the cyclic bandwidth sum problem (CBSP). It consists of finding a labelling of the vertices of an undirected and unweighted graph with distinct integers such that the sum of (cyclic) difference of labels of adjacent vertices is minimized. In this paper, we introduce a new heuristic to follow the structure of the graph, by finding an approximate solution for the CBSP. Although theoretical results exist that give optimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum (CBS) for standard graphs, there are neither results for real-world complex networks, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result. Furthermore, only a few methods have been proposed to approximately solve this problem. The heuristic we propose is a two-step algorithm: the first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which follow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the Jaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the merging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a partial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the CBS. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic is shown through experiments on graphs whose optimal value of CBS is known, as well as on complex networks, where the consistency between labelling and topology is highlighted.",

We introduce the novel problem of exceptional sub-graph mining in attributed graphs and propose a complete algorithm that takes benefits from new upper bounds and pruning properties.

            "abstract": "Many systems comprising entities in interactions can be represented as graphs, whose structure gives significant insights about how these systems work. Network theory has undergone further developments, in particular in relation to detection of communities in graphs, to catch this structure. Recently, an approach has been proposed to transform a graph into a collection of signals: Using a multidimensional scaling technique on a distance matrix representing relations between vertices of the graph, points in a Euclidean space are obtained and interpreted as signals, indexed by the vertices. In this article, we propose several extensions to this approach, developing a framework to study graph structures using signal processing tools. We first extend the current methodology, enabling us to highlight connections between properties of signals and graph structures, such as communities, regularity or randomness, as well as combinations of those. A robust inverse transformation method is next described, taking into account possible changes in the signals compared to original ones. This technique uses, in addition to the relationships between the points in the Euclidean space, the energy of each signal, coding the different scales of the graph structure. These contributions open up new perspectives in the study of graphs, by enabling processing of graphs through the processing of the corresponding collection of signals, using reliable tools from signal processing. A technique of denoising of a graph by filtering of the corresponding signals is then described, suggesting considerable potential of the approach.",

In several applications, it appears that the variations of a group of attributes are often followed by some structural changes in the graph that one may assume they generate. We formalize the triggering pattern discovery problem as a method jointly rooted in sequence mining and graph analysis. We apply our approach on three real-world dynamic graphs of different natures - a co-authoring network, an airline network, and a social bookmarking system - assessing the relevancy of the triggering pattern mining approach.",

Such descriptors are of two types: 1) the vertex attributes that convey the information of the vertices themselves and 2) some topological properties used to describe the connectivity of the vertices. These descriptors are mostly of numerical or ordinal types and their similarity can be captured by quantifying their covariation. Mining topological patterns relies on frequent pattern mining and graph topology analysis to reveal the links that exist between the relation encoded by the graph and the vertex attributes. We propose three interestingness measures of topological patterns that differ by the pairs of vertices considered while evaluating up and down co-variations between vertex descriptors. An efficient algorithm that combines search and pruning strategies to look for the most relevant topological patterns is presented. Besides a classical empirical study, we report case studies on four real-life networks showing that our approach provides valuable knowledge.",

A method has been proposed to transform these graphs into a collection of signals indexed by vertices. This approach is here further explored in a number of different directions. First, the importance of a good indexing of a graph is stressed, and a solution is proposed using a node labeling algorithm which follows the structure of the graph. Second, a spectral analysis of identified signals is performed to compute features linked to graph properties such as regularity or structure in communities. Finally, these features can be tracked over time to evidence the structure evolution of the graph. As a case study, the approach is applied to a dynamic graph based on a dataset of trips made using the bike sharing system Vlov in use in Lyon, France.

It relies on a new pattern detection method that crucially needs for sophisticated post processing and visualization. A topological pattern is defined as a set of vertex attributes and topological properties (i.e., properties that characterize the role of a vertex within a graph) that strongly co-vary over the vertices of the graph. For instance, such a pattern in a co-authorship attributed graph where vertices represent authors, edges encode coauthor ship, and vertex attributes reveal the number of publications in several journals, could be \"the higher the number of publications in IEEE ICDM, the higher the closeness centrality of the vertex within the graph\". Two different ways of navigation through the topological patterns and the related graph data are provided to the end-user. We exploit graph visualization and exploration techniques from the open platform Gephi. As an illustrative scenario, we consider a co-autorship attributed graph built from DBLP digital library and a video has been produced that describe the main possibilities of the TopGraphVisualizer software.",

A careful study relying on nonstationary statistical modeling and data mining allows us to first model the time evolution of the dynamics of movements with Velo'v, that is mostly cyclostationary over the week with nonstationary evolutions over larger time-scales, and second to disentangle the spatial patterns to understand and visualize the flows of Velo'v bicycles in the city.

This type of network structure is intuitively defined as a subset of \nnodes more densely linked, when compared with the rest of the network. Such dense subgraphs gather \nindividuals sharing similar property depending on the type of relation encoded in the graph. In this \nchapter we tackle the problem of identifying communities in dynamic networks where relationships \namong entities evolve over time. Meaningful patterns in such structured data must capture the strong \ninteractions between individuals but also their temporal relationships. We propose a pattern discovery \nmethod to identify evolving patterns defined by constraints. In this paradigm, constraints are parameter- \nized by the user to drive the discovery process towards potentially interesting patterns, with the positive \nside effect of achieving a more efficient computation. In the proposed approach, dense and isolated \nsubgraphs, defined by two user-parameterized constraints, are first computed in the dynamic network \nrestricted at a given time stamp. Second, the temporal evolution of such patterns is captured by associ- \nating a temporal event types to each subgraph. We consider five basic temporal events: the formation, \ndissolution, growth, diminution and stability of subgraphs from one time stamp to the next one. We \npropose an algorithm that finds such subgraphs in a time series of graphs processed incrementally. The \nextraction is feasible thanks to efficient pruning patterns strategies. Experimental results on real-world \ndata confirm the practical feasibility of our approach.

We propose CnS-Miner algorithm which enumerates all the closed patterns of the given n-dimensional dataset in depth first manner satisfying the user specified minimum size constraints. From the given input, the CnS-Miner algorithm generates an n-ary tree and visits the tree in depth first manner. We have proposed a generalized duplicate pruning method which prunes the subtrees that generate duplicate patterns. The space complexity of our algorithm is O(D+d) where D is the n-ary dataset and d is the depth of the tree. We have experimentally compared the proposed algorithm with DataPeeler, a recently proposed algorithm for closed pattern mining from nary relations.",

            "abstract": "In high dimensional data, the general performance of traditional clustering algorithms decreases. This is partly because the similarity criterion used by these algorithms becomes inadequate in high dimensional space. Another reason is that some dimensions are likely to be irrelevant or contain noisy data, thus hiding a possible clustering. To overcome these problems, subspace clustering techniques, which can automatically find clusters in relevant subsets of dimensions, have been developed. However, due to the huge number of subspaces to consider, these techniques often lack efficiency. In this paper we propose to extend the framework of bottom up subspace clustering algorithms by integrating background knowledge and, in particular, instance-level constraints to speed up the enumeration of subspaces. We show how this new framework can be applied to both density and distance based bottom-up subspace clustering techniques. Our experiments on real datasets show that instance-level constraints cannot only increase the efficiency of the clustering process but also the accuracy of the resultant clustering.",

In social networks, such patterns can be seen as dynamic community structures, i.e., sets of individuals who strongly and repeatedly interact. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based mining approach to uncover evolving patterns. We propose to mine dense and isolated subgraphs defined by two user-parameterized constraints. The temporal evolution of such patterns is captured by associating a temporal event type to each identified subgraph. We consider five basic temporal events: The formation, dissolution, growth, diminution and stability of subgraphs from one time stamp to the next. We propose an algorithm that finds such subgraphs in a time series of graphs processed incrementally. The extraction is feasible due to efficient patterns and data pruning strategies. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on several real-world dynamic graphs and extract meaningful evolving communities.",

            "abstract": "The production of high-throughput gene expression data has generated a crucial need for bioinformatics tools to generate biologically interesting hypotheses. Whereas many tools are available for extracting global patterns, less attention has been focused on local pattern discovery. We propose here an original way to discover knowledge from gene expression data by means of the so-called formal concepts which hold in derived Boolean gene expression datasets. We first encoded the over-expression properties of genes in human cells using human SAGE data. It has given rise to a Boolean matrix from which we extracted the complete collection of formal concepts, i.e., all the largest sets of over-expressed genes associated to a largest set of biological situations in which their over-expression is observed. Complete collections of such patterns tend to be huge. Since their interpretation is a time-consuming task, we propose a new method to rapidly visualize clusters of formal concepts. This designates a reasonable number of Quasi-Synexpression-Groups (QSGs) for further analysis. The interest of our approach is illustrated using human SAGE data and interpreting one of the extracted QSGs. The assessment of its biological relevancy leads to the formulation of both previously proposed and new biological hypotheses.",

Mobile devices with wireless capabilities (mobile phones, laptops, etc.) are a typical example of evolving networks where nodes or users are spread in the environment and connections between users can only occur if they are near each others. This whois-near-whom network evolves every time users move and communication services (such as the spread of any information) will deeply rely on the mobility and on the characteristics of the underlying network. This paper presents some recent results concerning the characterization of the dynamics of complex networks through three different angles: evolution of some parameters on snapshots of the network, parameters describing the evolution itself, and intermediate approaches consisting in the study of specific phenomena or users of interest through time.",

            "abstract": "Clustering or co-clustering techniques have been proved useful in many application domains. A weakness of these techniques remains the poor support for grouping characterization. As a result, interpreting clustering results and discovering knowledge from them can be quite hard. We consider potentially large Boolean data sets which record properties of objects and we assume the availability of a bi-partition which has to be characterized by means of a symbolic description. Our generic approach exploits collections of local patterns which satisfy some user-defined constraints in the data, and a measure of the accuracy of a given local pattern as a bi-cluster characterization pattern. We consider local patterns which are bi-sets, i.e., sets of objects associated to sets of properties. Two concrete examples are formal concepts (i.e., associated closed sets) and the so-called \u03b4-bi-sets (i.e., an extension of formal concepts towards fault-tolerance). We introduce the idea of characterizing query which can be used by experts to support knowledge discovery from bi-partitions thanks to available local patterns. The added-value is illustrated on benchmark data and three real data sets: a medical data set and two gene expression data sets.",

It improves the state of the art in many application domains where transactional/boolean data are to be mined (e.g., basket analysis, WWW usage mining, gene expression data analysis). The so-called (formal) concepts are important special cases of a priori interesting bi-sets that associate closed sets on both dimensions thanks to the Galois operators. Concept mining in boolean data is tractable provided that at least one of the dimensions (number of objects or attributes) is small enough and the data is not too dense. The task is extremely hard otherwise. Furthermore, it is important to enable user-defined constraints on the desired bi-sets and use them during the extraction to increase both the efficiency and the a priori interestingness of the extracted patterns. It leads us to the design of a new algorithm, called D-Miner, for mining concepts under constraints. We provide an experimental validation on benchmark data sets. Moreover, we introduce an original data mining technique for microarray data analysis. Not only boolean expression properties of genes are recorded but also we add biological information about transcription factors. In such a context, D-Miner can be used for concept mining under constraints and outperforms the other studied algorithms. We show also that data enrichment is useful for evaluating the biological relevancy of the extracted concepts.",

We consider that being able to query efficiently both transactional data and materialized collections of sets by means of standard query language is an important step towards practical inductive databases. Indeed, data mining query languages like MINE RULE extract collections of association rules whose components are sets into relational tables. Post-processing phases often use extensively subset queries and cannot be efficiently processed by SQL servers. In this paper, we propose a new way to handle sets from relational databases. It is based on a data structure that partially encodes the inclusion relationship between sets. It is an extension of the hash group bitmap key proposed by Morzy et al. [8]. Our experiments show an interesting improvement for these useful subset queries.",

A typical impor- tant case concerns formal concept mining (i.e., maximal rectangles of true values or associated closed sets by means of the so-called Galois connec- tion). It has been applied with some success to, e.g., gene expression data analysis where objects denote biological situations and attributes denote gene expression properties. However in such real-life application domains, it turns out that the Galois association is a too strong one when considering intrinsically noisy data. It is clear that strong associations that would however accept a bounded number of exceptions would be extremely useful. We study the new pattern domain of fi=fl concepts, i.e., consistent maximal bi-sets with less than fi false values per row and less than fl false values per column. We provide a complete algorithm that computes all the fi=fl concepts based on the generation of concept unions pruned thanks to anti-monotonic constraints. An experimental validation on synthetic data is given. It illustrates that more relevant associations can be discovered in noisy data. We also discuss a practical application in molecular biology that illustrates an incomplete but quite useful extraction when all the concepts that are needed beforehand can not be discovered.",

It is useful since the added-value of transcription module discovery is very high and formal concepts can be seen as putative transcription modules. We describe our ongoing research on concept post-processing by means of classication and visualization. It has been applied to a real-life gene expression data set with a promising feedback from end-users.",

            "abstract": "One of the crucial needs in post-genomic research is to an- alyze expression matrices (e.g., SAGE and microarray data) to identify a priori interesting sets of genes, e.g., sets of genes that are frequently co-regulated. Such matrices provide expression values for given biological situations (the lines) and given genes (columns). The inductive database framework enables to support knowledge discovery processes by means of sequences of queries that concerns both data processing and pattern querying (extraction, post-processing). We provide a simple formaliza- tion of a relevant pattern domain (language of patterns, evaluation func- tions and primitive constraints) that has been proved useful for specify- ing various analysis tasks. Recent algorithmic results w.r.t. the ecient evaluation (constraint-based mining) of the so-called inductive queries are emphasized and illustrated on a 90 \u00a3 12 636 human SAGE expres- sion matrix.",

First, we use a clustering method that computes bi-partitions (a partition of examples and a related partition of attribute-value pairs). Then, we use an efficient association rule mining technique to describe the membership of examples within each cluster. We propose a technique for removing rules that are not relevant enough for the cluster characterization. An experimental validation on a real world medical data set is provided. Keywords. Conceptual clustering, association rule, characterization of clusters.",
