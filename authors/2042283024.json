            "title": "Ki-Cook: clustering multimodal cooking representations through knowledge-infused learning",
            "abstract": "Cross-modal recipe retrieval has gained prominence due to its ability to retrieve a text representation given an image representation and vice versa. Clustering these recipe representations based on similarity is essential to retrieve relevant information about unknown food images. Existing studies cluster similar recipe representations in the latent space based on class names. Due to inter-class similarity and intraclass variation, associating a recipe with a class name does not provide sufficient knowledge about recipes to determine similarity. However, recipe title, ingredients, and cooking actions provide detailed knowledge about recipes and are a better determinant of similar recipes. In this study, we utilized this additional knowledge of recipes, such as ingredients and recipe title, to identify similar recipes, emphasizing attention especially on rare ingredients. To incorporate this knowledge, we propose a knowledge-infused multimodal cooking representation learning network, Ki-Cook, built on the procedural attribute of the cooking process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to adopt a comprehensive recipe similarity determinant to identify and cluster similar recipe representations. The proposed network also incorporates ingredient images to learn multimodal cooking representation. Since the motivation for clustering similar recipes is to retrieve relevant information for an unknown food image, we evaluated the ingredient retrieval task. We performed an empirical analysis to establish that our proposed model improves the Coverage of Ground Truth by 12% and the Intersection Over Union by 10% compared to the baseline models. On average, the representations learned by our model contain an additional 15.33% of rare ingredients compared to the baseline models. Owing to this difference, our qualitative evaluation shows a 39% improvement in clustering similar recipes in the latent space compared to the baseline models, with an inter-annotator agreement of the Fleiss kappa score of 0.35.",

            "abstract": "The development of the fashion industry has increased the demand for customised and meticulously designed clothes. This poses a challenge to fashion designers who need to create novel clothing designs based on the requirements specified by the customers. This work presents a generative adversarial network (GAN) based text-to-image synthesis model for fabricating intricate Indian apparel designs. We introduce an architecture that strategically combines multiple trained GAN models for a streamlined text-to-image generation. Existing fashion datasets with elaborate image descriptions cater to western fashion only. We have extracted traditional Indian images like kurtis, kurtas, etc., and then combined with an existing dataset to create an Indian Fashion dataset of around 16000 images with their corresponding text descriptions. On carrying out elaborate testing on our dataset we have achieved good visual results that can capture the details given in the text descriptions.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning-based innovations, particularly GANs, have recently shown great success in fashion modelling for various use cases such as pose and face generation. A famous work, FashionGAN[1], can generate images with modified clothing as per natural language description and uses the DeepFashion dataset, which primarily contains clothing styles of the Western countries. Currently, no dataset caters to Indian style and clothing. Hence, we present a dataset of 12k images and descriptions pertaining to the Indian culture as well as a baseline approach with this work. Deep learning-based innovations in the Indian Fashion context are a relatively new area of research, and we hope our work will be a starting point for other researchers.

Recent studies for automating the task of translating natural language text to SQL query are not robust to queries having multi-table dependencies.
