            "abstract": "While the term Metaverse was first coined by the author Neal Stephenson in 1992 in his science fiction novel \u201cSnow Crash\u201d, today the vision of an integrated virtual world is becoming a reality across different sectors[1]. Applications in gaming and consumer products are gaining traction, industrial metaverse applications are, still in their early stages of development with one of the challenges being interoperability across various metaverse development platforms and existing software tools. In this work we propose the use of a knowledge graph based semantic data exchange layer, the Metaverse Knowledge Graph, to enable seamless transfer of information across platforms. We discuss how this approach addresses the challenge of interoperability and leads to better interactivity and synchronization across tools.",

            "title": "Demystifying the Data Need of ML-surrogates for CFD Simulations",
            "abstract": "Computational \ufb02uid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a critical tool in various engineering applications, often require signi\ufb01cant time and compute power to predict \ufb02ow properties. The high computational cost associated with CFD simulations signi\ufb01cantly restricts the scope of design space explo- ration and limits their use in planning and operational control. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) based sur- rogate models have been proposed as a computationally ef-\ufb01cient tool to accelerate CFD simulations. However, a lack of clarity about CFD data requirements often challenges the widespread adoption of ML-based surrogates among design engineers and CFD practitioners. In this work, we propose an ML-based surrogate model to predict the temperature dis- tribution inside the cabin of a passenger vehicle under various operating conditions and use it to demonstrate the trade- off between prediction performance and training dataset size. Our results show that the prediction accuracy is high and sta- ble even when the training size is gradually reduced from 2000 to 200. The ML-based surrogates also reduce the com- pute time from \u223c 30 minutes to around \u223c 9 milliseconds. Moreover, even when only 50 CFD simulations are used for training, the temperature trend (e.g., locations of hot/cold re-gions) predicted by the ML-surrogate matches quite well with the results from CFD simulations.",

            "abstract": "Transformer layers, which use an alternating pattern of multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers, provide an effective tool for a variety of machine learning problems. As the transformer layers use residual connections to avoid the problem of vanishing gradients, they can be viewed as the numerical integration of a differential equation. In this extended abstract, we build upon this connection and propose a modification of the internal architecture of a transformer layer. The proposed model places the multi-head attention sublayer and the MLP sublayer parallel to each other. Our experiments show that this simple modification improves the performance of transformer networks in multiple tasks. Moreover, for the image classification task, we show that using neural ODE solvers with a sophisticated integration scheme further improves performance.",

This requires that a metaverse offers a real-time virtual representation of the physical world with its entities, relationships, events, states, processes, and activities. According to the Gartner forecast report, the metaverse is among the top five emerging trends and technologies. Gartner predicts that by 2026 25% of people will spend at least one hour every day in the metaverse and 30% of organizations will have products and services developed for metaverse platforms.2 The metaverse is in an early developmental stage but has a considerable promise of occupying prominent space in the next phase of the Internet.",

            "abstract": "Incompressible fluid flow around a cylinder is one of the classical problems in fluid-dynamics with strong relevance with many real-world engineering problems, for example, design of offshore structures or design of a pin-fin heat exchanger. Thus learning a high-accuracy surrogate for this problem can demonstrate the efficacy of a novel machine learning approach. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture for learning the relationship between simulation output and the underlying geometry and boundary conditions. In addition to using a physics-based regularization term, the proposed approach also exploits the underlying physics to learn a set of Fourier features, i.e. frequency and phase offset parameters, and then use them for predicting flow velocity and pressure over the spatio-temporal domain. We demonstrate this approach by predicting simulation results over out of range time interval and for novel design conditions. Our results show that incorporation of Fourier features improves the generalization performance over both temporal domain and design space.",
