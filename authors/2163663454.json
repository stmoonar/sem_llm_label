            "abstract": "In this paper, we first define information loss that occurs in the hypergraph expansion and then propose a novel framework, named MILEAGE, to evaluate hypergraph expansion methods by measuring their degree of information loss. MILEAGE employs the following four steps: (1) expanding a hypergraph; (2) performing the unsupervised representation learning on the expanded graph; (3) reconstructing a hypergraph based on vector representations obtained; and (4) measuring MILEAGE-score (i.e., mileage) by comparing the reconstructed and the original hypergraphs. To demonstrate the usefulness of MILEAGE, we conduct experiments via downstream tasks on three levels (i.e., node, hyperedge, and hypergraph): node classification, hyperedge prediction, and hypergraph classification on eight real-world hypergraph datasets. Through the extensive experiments, we observe that information loss through hypergraph expansion has a negative impact on downstream tasks and MILEAGE can effectively evaluate hypergraph expansion methods through the information loss and recommend a new method that resolves the problems of existing ones.",

            "abstract": "To recommend the points of interest (POIs) that a user would check-in next, most deep-learning (DL)-based existing studies have employed random negative (RN) sampling during model training. In this paper, we claim and validate that, as the training proceeds, such an RN sampling in reality performs as sampling easy negative (EN) POIs (i.e., EN sampling) that a user was highly unlikely to check-in at her check-in time point. Furthermore, we verify that EN sampling is more disadvantageous in improving the accuracy than sampling hard negative (HN) POIs (i.e., HN sampling) that a user was highly likely to check-in. To address this limitation, we present the novel concept of the Degree of Positiveness (DoP), which can be formulated by two factors: (i) the degree to which a POI has the characteristics preferred by a user; (ii) the geographical distance between a user and a POI. Then, we propose a new model-training scheme based on HN sampling by using DoP. Using real-world datasets (i.e., NYC, TKY, and Brightkite), we demonstrate that all the state-of-the-art models trained by our scheme showed dramatic improvements in accuracy by up to about 82.8%.",

            "abstract": "The goal of directed network embedding is to represent the nodes in a given directed network as embeddings that preserve the asymmetric relationships between nodes. While a number of directed network embedding methods have been proposed, we empirically show that the existing methods lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities against degree-related distributional shifts. To mitigate this problem, we propose ODIN (Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding), a new directed NE method where we model multiple factors in the formation of directed edges. Then, for each node, ODIN learns multiple embeddings, each of which preserves its corresponding factor, by disentangling interest factors and biases related to in- and out-degrees of nodes. Our experiments on four real-world directed networks demonstrate that disentangling multiple factors enables ODIN to yield out-of-distribution generalized embeddings that are consistently effective under various degrees of shifts in degree distributions. Specifically, ODIN universally outperforms 9 state-of-the-art competitors in 2 LP tasks on 4 real-world datasets under both identical distribution (ID) and non-ID settings.

We validate our claim via extensive experiments; we also demonstrate the dramatic improvement of recommendation accuracy in five existing state-of-the-art models up to 82.1% by simply ignoring the impression log.

Although these methods are known to besuperior to the single-vector ones (i.e., providing asingle latent vector per node), wepoint out their three drawbacks as inability to preserve asymmetry on NU-paths, inability to preserve global nodes similarity, and impairing in/out-degree distributions. To address these, we first proposeCRW, anovel similarity measure for graphs that considers contributions ofboth in-links and out-links in similarity computation,without ignoring their directions. Then, we proposeELTRA, aneffective double-vector embedding method to preserve asymmetric information in directed graphs. ELTRA computesasymmetry preserving proximity scores (AP-scores) by employing CRW in which the contribution of out-links and in-links in similarity computation isupgraded anddowngraded, respectively. Then, for every node u, ELTRA selects its top-tclosest nodes based on AP-scores andconforms theranks of their corresponding target vectors w.r.t u's source vector in the embedding space to theiroriginal ranks.

            "abstract": "As the number of TV shows increases, designing recommendation systems to provide users with their favorable TV shows becomes more important. In a TV show domain, watching a TV show (i.e., giving implicit feedback to the show) among the TV shows broadcast at the same time frame implies that the currently watching show is the winner in the competition with others (i.e., losers). However, in previous studies, such a notion of limited competitions has not been considered in estimating the user\u2019s preferences for TV shows. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation framework to take this new notion into account based on pair-wise models. Our framework is composed of the following ideas: (i) identify winners and losers by determining pairs of competing TV shows; (ii) learn the pairs of competing TV shows based on the confidence for the pair-wise preference between the winner and the loser; (iii) recommend the most favorable TV shows by considering the time factors with respect to users and TV shows. Using a real-world TV show dataset, our experimental results show that our proposed framework consistently improves the accuracy of recommendation by up to 38%, compared with the best state-of-the-art method. The code and datasets of our framework are available in an external link (https://github.com/hongkyun-bae/tvshow_rs).",

To this end, we propose a novel framework, named as LATTE, to pre-train each core module in CRS (i.e., the recommendation and the conversation module) through abundant external data. For the recommendation module, we pre-train the recommendation module to comprehensively understand the relationships between items and their various features by leveraging both multi-reviews and a knowledge graph. For pre-training the conversation module, we create the synthetic dialogs, which contain responses providing the explanation relevant to the dialog context by using all the items' features and dialog templates. Through extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets, we demonstrate that LATTE exhibits (1) the effectiveness of each module in LATTE, (2) the superiority over 7 state-of-the art methods, and (3) the interpretations based on visualization.",

            "abstract": "The political stance prediction for news articles has been widely studied to mitigate the echo chamber effect \u2013 people fall into their thoughts and reinforce their pre-existing beliefs. The previous works for the political stance problem focus on (1) identifying political factors that could reflect the political stance of a news article and (2) capturing those factors effectively. Despite their empirical successes, they are not sufficiently justified in terms of how effective their identified factors are in the political stance prediction. Motivated by this, in this work, we conduct a user study to investigate important factors in political stance prediction, and observe that the context and tone of a news article (implicit) and external knowledge for real-world entities appearing in the article (explicit) are important in determining its political stance. Based on this observation, we propose a novel knowledge-aware approach to political stance prediction (KHAN), employing (1) hierarchical attention networks (HAN) to learn the relationships among words and sentences in three different levels and (2) knowledge encoding (KE) to incorporate external knowledge for real-world entities into the process of political stance prediction. Also, to take into account the subtle and important difference between opposite political stances, we build two independent political knowledge graphs (KG) (i.e., KG-lib and KG-con) by ourselves and learn to fuse the different political knowledge. Through extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of KHAN in terms of (1) accuracy, (2) efficiency, and (3) effectiveness.",
