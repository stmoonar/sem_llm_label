            "title": "Rating Distribution Calibration for Selection Bias Mitigation in Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Real-world recommendation datasets have been shown to be subject to selection bias, which can challenge recommendation models to learn real preferences of users, so as to make accurate recommendations. Existing approaches to mitigate selection bias, such as data imputation and inverse propensity score, are sensitive to the quality of the additional imputation or propensity estimation models. To break these limitations, in this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework, i.e., Rating Distribution Calibration (RDC), to tackle selection bias without introducing additional models. In addition to the original training objective, we introduce a rating distribution calibration loss. It aims to correct the predicted rating distribution of biased users by taking advantage of that of their similar unbiased users. We empirically evaluate RDC on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset. The experimental results show that RDC outperforms the original model as well as the state-of-the-art debiasing approaches by a significant margin.",

            "title": "PROPN: Personalized Probabilistic Strategic Parameter Optimization in Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Real-world recommender systems usually consist of two phases. Predictive models in Phase I provide accurate predictions of users' actions on items, and Phase II is to aggregate the predictions withstrategic parameters to make final recommendations, which aim to meet multiple business goals, such as maximizing users' like rate and average engagement time. Though it is important to generate accurate predictions in Phase I, it is also crucial to optimize the strategic parameters in Phase II. Conventional solutions include manually tunning, Bayesian optimization, contextual multi-armed bandit optimization, etc. However, these methods either produce universal strategic parameters for all the users or focus on a deterministic solution, which leads to an undesirable performance. In this paper, we propose a personalized probabilistic solution for strategic parameter optimization. We first formulate the personalized probabilistic optimizing problem and compare its solution with deterministic and context-free solutions theoretically to show its superiority. We then introduce a novel Personalized pRObabilistic strategic parameter optimizing Policy Network (PROPN) to solve the problem. PROPN follows reinforcement learning architecture where a neural network serves as an agent that dynamically adjusts the distributions of strategic parameters for each user. We evaluate our model under the streaming recommendation setting on two public real-world datasets. The results show that our framework outperforms representative baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Practical large-scale recommender systems usually contain thousands of feature fields from users, items, contextual information, and their interactions. Most of them empirically allocate a unified dimension to all feature fields, which is memory inefficient. Thus it is highly desired to assign various embedding dimensions to different feature fields according to their importance and predictability. Due to the large amounts of feature fields and the nuanced relationship between embedding dimensions with feature distributions and neural network architectures, manually allocating embedding dimensions in practical recommender systems can be challenging. To this end, we propose an AutoML-based framework (AutoDim) in this paper, which can automatically select dimensions for different feature fields in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we first proposed an end-to-end differentiable framework that can calculate the weights over various dimensions in a soft and continuous manner for feature fields, and an AutoML-based optimization algorithm; then, we derive a hard and discrete embedding component architecture according to the maximal weights and retrain the whole recommender framework. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of AutoDim.",

            "abstract": "Learning-based approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), have indicated superiority over rule-based approaches in complex urban autonomous driving environments, showing great potential to make intelligent decisions. However, current RL and IL approaches still have their own drawbacks, such as low data efficiency for RL and poor generalization capability for IL. In light of this, this paper proposes a novel learning-based method that combines deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning from expert demonstrations, which is applied to longitudinal vehicle motion control in autonomous driving scenarios. Our proposed method employs the soft actor-critic structure and modifies the learning process of the policy network to incorporate both the goals of maximizing reward and imitating the expert. Moreover, an adaptive prioritized experience replay is designed to sample experience from both the agent\u2019s self-exploration and expert demonstration, in order to improve sample efficiency. The proposed method is validated in a simulated urban roundabout scenario and compared with various prevailing RL and IL baseline approaches. The results manifest that the proposed method has a faster training speed, as well as better performance in navigating safely and time-efficiently.",

It is evident from recent researches that different embedding sizes are highly desired for different users/items according to their frequency. However, manually selecting embedding sizes in recommender systems can be very challenging due to a large number of users/items and the dynamic nature of their frequency. Thus, in this paper, we propose an AutoML based end-to-end framework (AutoEmb), enabling various embedding dimensions according to the frequency in an automated and dynamic manner.

            "abstract": "Dialogue systems play an increasingly important role in various aspects of our daily life. It is evident from recent research that dialogue systems trained on human conversation data are biased. In particular, they can produce responses that reflect people's gender prejudice. Many debiasing methods have been developed for various NLP tasks, such as word embedding. However, they are not directly applicable to dialogue systems because they are likely to force dialogue models to generate similar responses for different genders. This greatly degrades the diversity of the generated responses and immensely hurts the performance of the dialogue models. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework Debiased-Chat to train dialogue models free from gender bias while keeping their performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world conversation datasets show that our framework significantly reduces gender bias in dialogue models while maintaining the response quality. The implementation of the proposed framework is released.",

            "abstract": "The success of deep learning notoriously requires larger amounts of costly annotated data. This has led to the development of self-supervised learning (SSL) that aims to alleviate this limitation by creating domain specific pretext tasks on unlabeled data. Simultaneously, there are increasing interests in generalizing deep learning to the graph domain in the form of graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs can naturally utilize unlabeled nodes through the simple neighborhood aggregation that is unable to thoroughly make use of unlabeled nodes. Thus, we seek to harness SSL for GNNs to fully exploit the unlabeled data. Different from data instances in the image and text domains, nodes in graphs present unique structure information and they are inherently linked indicating not independent and identically distributed (or i.i.d.). Such complexity is a double-edged sword for SSL on graphs. On the one hand, it determines that it is challenging to adopt solutions from the image and text domains to graphs and dedicated efforts are desired. On the other hand, it provides rich information that enables us to build SSL from a variety of perspectives. Thus, in this paper, we first deepen our understandings on when, why, and which strategies of SSL work with GNNs by empirically studying numerous basic SSL pretext tasks on graphs. Inspired by deep insights from the empirical studies, we propose a new direction SelfTask to build advanced pretext tasks that are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets.

However, due to their inherent opaqueness, some recently raised concerns about using neural models are starting to be taken seriously. In fact, intentional or unintentional behaviors could lead to a dialogue system to generate inappropriate responses. Thus, in this paper, we investigate whether we can learn to craft input sentences that result in a black-box neural dialogue model being manipulated into having its outputs contain target words or match target sentences. We propose a reinforcement learning based model that can generate such desired inputs automatically. Extensive experiments on a popular well-trained state-of-the-art neural dialogue model show that our method can successfully seek out desired inputs that lead to the target outputs in a considerable portion of cases. Consequently, our work reveals the potential of neural dialogue models to be manipulated, which inspires and opens the door towards developing strategies to defend them.",

            "title": "Automated Embedding Size Search in Deep Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Deep recommender systems have achieved promising performance on real-world recommendation tasks. They typically represent users and items in a low-dimensional embedding space and then feed the embeddings into the following deep network structures for prediction. Traditional deep recommender models often adopt uniform and fixed embedding sizes for all the users and items. However, such design is not optimal in terms of not only the recommendation performance and but also the space complexity. In this paper, we propose to dynamically search the embedding sizes for different users and items and introduce a novel embedding size adjustment policy network (ESAPN). ESAPN serves as an automated reinforcement learning agent to adaptively search appropriate embedding sizes for users and items. Different from existing works, our model performs hard selection on different embedding sizes, which leads to a more accurate selection and decreases the storage space. We evaluate our model under the streaming setting on two real-world benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms representative baselines. Moreover, our framework is demonstrated to be robust to the cold-start problem and reduce memory consumption by around 40%-90%. The implementation of the model is released.",
