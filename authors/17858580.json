            "abstract": "\n Answer Set Programming with Quantifiers ASP(Q) extends Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for declarative and modular modeling of problems from the entire polynomial hierarchy. The first implementation of ASP(Q), called QASP, was based on a translation to Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) with the aim of exploiting the well-developed and mature QBF-solving technology. However, the implementation of the QBF encoding employed in qasp is very general and might produce formulas that are hard to evaluate for existing QBF solvers because of the large number of symbols and subclauses. In this paper, we present a new implementation that builds on the ideas of QASP and features both a more efficient encoding procedure and new optimized encodings of ASP(Q) programs in QBF. The new encodings produce smaller formulas (in terms of the number of quantifiers, variables, and clauses) and result in a more efficient evaluation process. An algorithm selection strategy automatically combines several QBF-solving back-ends to further increase performance. An experimental analysis, conducted on known benchmarks, shows that the new system outperforms QASP.",

Over the years, many modeling languages have been proposed for process model specification, with different expressiveness, features, and computational properties.\n\nWe propose a new logic-based declarative formalism, called Constraint Formulae, to compose process specifications, expressed in heterogeneous process modeling languages, without altering their original semantics. We formalize common process mining tasks for Constraint Formulae, study their computational properties, and provide an implementation in Answer Set Programming.",

To avoid such issues, it is crucial to devise artificial intelligence models that can effectively predict failures. Predictive maintenance current approaches have several limitations that can be overcome by exploiting hybrid approaches such as Neuro-Symbolic techniques. Neuro-symbolic models combine neural methods with symbolic ones leading to improvements in efficiency, robustness, and explainability. In this work, we propose to exploit hybrid approaches by investigating their advantage over classic predictive maintenance approaches",

In particular, assessing the compliance of a product with the relative schematic is a time-consuming and prone-to-error process. In this paper, we address this problem in a specific industrial scenario. In particular, we define a Neuro-Symbolic approach for automating the compliance verification of the electrical control panels. Our approach is based on the combination of Deep Learning techniques with Answer Set Programming (ASP), and allows for identifying possible anomalies and errors in the final product even when a very limited amount of training data is available. The experiments conducted on a real test case provided by an Italian Company operating in electrical control panel production demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Question Answering over Knowledge Bases (KBQA) proposes to solve this problem by allowing users to pose questions in natural language to extract the desired information from the KBs, ab-stracting them from any technical complexity. In this context, the QALD challenges propose to evaluate and encourage the development of KBQA systems. In this paper, we describe sparql-qa , a system for question answering over KBs that have been submitted to the QALD-10 challenge. Our method uses Neural Machine Translation and Named Entity Recognition tasks that complement each other to create SPARQL queries.

            "abstract": "Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-known declarative AI formalism developed in the area of logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning. Modern ASP systems are based on the ground&solve approach. Although effective in industrial and academic applications ground&solve ASP systems are still unable to handle some classes of programs because of the so-called grounding bottleneck problem. Compilation of ASP programs demonstrated to be an effective technique for overcoming the grounding bottleneck. In the paper titled \u201cCompilation of Aggregates in ASP Systems\u201d, which we presented in the Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2022), the first compilation-based approach for ASP programs that contain aggregates has been presented. In this paper, we outline the benefits of compiling ASP programs and mention possible developments in this line of research.",
