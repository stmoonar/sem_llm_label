            "abstract": "Learning expressive stochastic policies instead of deterministic ones has been proposed to achieve better stability, sample complexity, and robustness. Notably, in Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBMs, which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions (e.g., Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose Stein Soft Actor-Critic (S$^2$AC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. Specifically, S$^2$AC uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. We derive a closed-form expression of the entropy of such policies. Our formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that S$^2$AC yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark.

            "abstract": "In recent years, the AI community has witnessed an exciting acceleration in innovation across foundation models, deep learning, new AI applications across numerous verticals, and more. In addition, AI innovations driven by both academic and industry research labs have rapidly been adopted by big tech companies and startups to deliver value-differentiated products and services. For many machine learning researchers looking at commercializing their work, one of the frequently wondered questions is - \"How do I kickstart a startup that can commercialize my research innovations?\". For many ML practitioners in the KDD community, there is always curiosity on how big tech and startups take AI research and innovations, and scale it to be used by millions of users. This interactive workshop aims to achieve two goals: First, the workshop will bring together invited AI thought leaders working in academia, big tech as well as startups to share their perspective on the next big AI ideas that will change the world, and deliver impact. Second, the workshop will invite startup founders (from both academia and industry) to share their journey of acquiring customers, building a team, pitching for initial funding, and commercializing their research into successful enterprises",

            "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have advanced rapidly in recent years, leading to significant progress in pre-trained and fine-tuned large-scale AI models. For example, in the natural language processing domain, the traditional \"pre-train, fine-tune\" paradigm is shifting towards the \"pre-train, prompt, and predict\" paradigm, which has achieved great success on many tasks across different application domains such as ChatGPT/BARD for Conversational AI and P5 for a unified recommendation system. Moreover, there has been a growing interest in models that combine vision and language modalities (vision-language models) which are applied to tasks like Visual Captioning/Generation. Considering the recent technological revolution, it is essential to emphasize these paradigm shifts and highlight the paradigms with the potential to solve different tasks. We thus provide a platform for academic and industrial researchers to showcase their latest work, share research ideas, discuss various challenges, and identify areas where further research is needed in pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompt-learning methods for large-scale AI models. We foster the development of a strong research community focused on solving challenges related to large-scale AI models, providing superior and impactful strategies that can change people's lives in the future.",

            "abstract": "In the current digital world, web search engines and recommendation systems are continuously evolving, opening up new potential challenges every day which require more sophisticated and efficient data mining and machine learning solutions to satisfy the needs of sellers and consumers as well as marketers. The quality of search and recommendation systems impacts customer retention, time on site, and sales volume. For instance, with often sparse conversion rates, highly personalized contents, heterogeneous digital sources, more rigorous and effective models are required to be developed by research engineers and data scientists. At the same time, deep learning has started to show great impact in many industrial applications which are capable of processing complicated, large-scale and real-time data. Deep learning not only provides more opportunities to increase conversion rates and improve revenue through a positive customer experience, but also provides customers with personalized contents along with their personal shopping journey. Due to this rapid growth of the digital world, there is a need to bring professionals together from both academic research and the industry to solve real-world problems. This workshop fosters the development of a strong research community focused on solving deep learning based large-scale web search, personalized search, recommendation and ranking relevance problems that provide superior digital experience to all users.",

Expanding upon our previous work on product matching and category mapping from textual descriptions using transformer based models, we propose a weighted multi-modal approach for product matching by using both images and text within the training and matching process. We integrate both transformer and ResNet architectures into the siamese network to generate fine-tuned product embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed weighted multi-modal approach comparing with single-modal approaches. The experiments show our proposed approach outperforms single-modal approaches.",

            "abstract": "We developed a novel multiobjective markdown system and deployed it across many merchandising units at Walmart. The objectives of this system are to (1) clear the stores\u2019 excess inventory by a specified date, (2) improve revenue by minimizing the discounts needed to clear shelves, and (3) reduce the substantial cost to relabel merchandise in the stores. The underlying mathematical approach uses techniques such as deep reinforcement learning, simulation, and optimization to determine the optimal (marked-down) price. Starting in 2019, after six months of extensive testing, we implemented the new approach across all Walmart stores in the United States. The result was a high-performance model with a price-adjustment policy tailored to each store. Walmart increased its sell-through rate (i.e., the number of units sold during the markdown period divided by its inventory at the beginning of the markdown) by 21% and reduced its costs by 7%. Benefits that Walmart accrues include demographics-based store personalization, reductions in operating costs with limited numbers of price adjustments, and a dynamic time window for markdowns.",

            "abstract": "As the world's largest retailer, Walmart's core mission is to save people money so they can live better. We call the strategy we use to accomplish this goal our Every Day Low Price strategy. By keeping operational expenses as low as possible, we can continually apply a downward pressure on our prices, in turn increasing the amount of traffic, and ultimately, sales within our stores. In this paper, we apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Operations Research techniques for forecasting and optimization to build a new price recommendation system, which improves our ability to generate price recommendations accurately and automatically. Comprised of a demand forecasting step, two optimizations, and causal inference analysis, our system was evaluated in the form of forecast backtests and live pricing experiments, both of which suggested that our approach was more effective than the current rule-based pricing system.",
