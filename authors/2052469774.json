            "abstract": "Offline policy evaluation (OPE) aims to accurately estimate the performance of a hypothetical policy using only historical data, which has drawn increasing attention in a wide range of applications including recommender systems and personalized medicine. With the presence of rising granularity of consumer data, many industries started exploring larger action candidate spaces to support more precise personalized action. While inverse propensity score (IPS) is a standard OPE estimator, it suffers from more severe variance issues with increasing action spaces. To address this issue, we theoretically prove that the estimation variance can be reduced by merging actions into groups while the distinction among these action effects on the outcome can induce extra bias. Motivated by these, we propose a novel IPS estimator with outcome-oriented action Grouping (GroupIPS), which leverages a Lipschitz regularized network to measure the distance of action effects in the embedding space and merges nearest action neighbors. This strategy enables more robust estimation by achieving smaller variances while inducing minor additional bias. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the explosive increase of information facilitates the massive knowledge graphs, which in turn increase burden of people to understand and leverage the regularity behind these superficial facts. Therefore, the metaknowledge, defined as the knowledge about knowledge, is proposed to identify complex processes of knowledge production and consumption. Unfortunately, even though the current correlation-based rule mining methods in knowledge graph distill the rule-formed metaknowledge, they can not explain the processes of knowledge production. In this paper, we focus on capturing the metaknowledge with causality which is generally regarded as one of the most promising techniques to reveal the interactions between components in the complex system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to interpret the knowledge graph from the causal perspective. For this purpose, we propose a causal metaknowledge method for link prediction, which achieves entity-level link prediction by discovering concept-level topological causality. Specifically, we first formalize causal metaknowledge as causal rule, following the form of logical rule. Then, we transform the relational data into propositional data to learn the causal relationships between topological structures. And an efficient algorithm for discovering local causal relationships is proposed using the d -seperation criterion. Eventually, the causal rules generated based on the mined relationships are used for link prediction. Both simulation-based and real data-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially under the Out-of-Distribution(OoD) settings.",

Clu-US maps the uncertain data tuples to the grid space which could store and update the summary information of stream. The uncertainty of data is taken into account for calculating the probability center of a grid. Then, the distance between the probability centers of two adjacent grids is adopted for measuring whether they are \"close enough\" in grids merging process. Furthermore, a dynamic outlier deletion mechanism is developed to improve clustering performance. The experimental results show that Clu-US outperforms other algorithms in terms of clustering quality and speed.",
