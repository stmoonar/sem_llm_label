            "title": "HiSEP-Q: A Highly Scalable and Efficient Quantum Control Processor for Superconducting Qubits",
            "abstract": "Quantum computing promises an effective way to solve targeted problems that are classically intractable. Among them, quantum computers built with superconducting qubits are considered one of the most advanced technologies, but they suffer from short coherence times. This can get exaggerated when they are controlled directly by general-purpose host machines, which in turn leads to the loss of quantum information. To mitigate this, we need quantum control processors (QCPs) positioned between quantum processing units (QPUs) and host machines to reduce latencies. However, existing QCPs are built on top of designs with no or inefficient scalability, requiring a large number of instructions when scaling to more qubits. In addition, interactions between current QCPs and host machines require frequent data transmissions and offline computations to obtain final results from hundreds of repeated executions, which limits the performance of quantum computers.In this paper, we propose a QCP \u2014 called HiSEP-Q \u2014 featuring a novel quantum instruction set architecture (QISA) and its microarchitecture implementation. For efficient control, we utilize mixed-type addressing modes and mixed-length instructions in HiSEP-Q, which provides an efficient way to concurrently address more than 100 qubits. Further, for efficient read-out and analysis, we develop a novel onboard accumulation and sorting unit, which eliminates the data transmission of raw data between the QCPs and host machines and enables real-time result processing. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposed QISA achieves at least 62% and 28% improvements in encoding efficiency with real and synthetic quantum circuits, respectively. We also validate the microarchitecture on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which exhibits low power and resource consumption, even as the number of qubits scales to 100. Both hardware and ISA evaluations demonstrate that HiSEP-Q features high scalability and efficiency toward the number of controlled qubits.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "title": "Exploiting Reduced Precision for GPU-based Time Series Mining",
            "abstract": "The mining of multi-dimensional time series is a crucial step in gaining insights into data obtained from physical systems and from monitoring infrastructures. A widely accepted approach for this challenge is the matrix profile, which, however, is computationally very expensive. It relies on calculating large correlation matrices coupled with sort operations across all dimensions of the data, as well as on performing inclusive scans. All of these steps are inherently data parallel and can, therefore, benefit from execution on GPUs, and even more so from horizontal scaling on multiple GPUs. In addition, the nature of the matrix profile calculation allows the exploitation of reduced precision on GPUs. This offers further improvements to enable the analysis of ever growing data sets in real-world scenarios. Based on these motivations, we introduce the first parallel algorithm for multi-dimensional matrix profile on multiple GPUs exploiting reduced precision modes and provide a highly opti-mized implementation using novel optimization techniques. On one NVIDIA A100 GPU, our implementation achieves a 54x performance improvement in comparison to an optimized single-node execution on a state-of-the-art CPU-based implementation relying on double-precision computation and an additional factor of 1.4x when switching to reduced precision while maintaining sufficient accuracy. We study the accuracy and performance trade-offs for our proposed algorithm in detail and present synthetic and real-world case studies to demonstrate how the reduced precision improves the performance, while accomplishing sufficiently accurate results.",
