            "abstract": "Many industrial sectors rely on well-trained employees that are able to operate complex machinery. In this work, we demonstrate an AI-powered immersive assistance system that supports users in performing complex tasks in industrial environments. Specifically, our system leverages a VR environment that resembles a juice mixer setup. This digital twin of a physical setup simulates complex industrial machinery used to mix preparations or liquids (e.g., similar to the pharmaceutical industry) and includes various containers, sensors, pumps, and flow controllers. This setup demonstrates our system's capabilities in a controlled environment while acting as a proof-of-concept for broader industrial applications. The core components of our multimodal AI assistant are a large language model and a speech-to-text model that process a video and audio recording of an expert performing the task in a VR environment. The video and speech input extracted from the expert's video enables it to provide step-by-step guidance to support users in executing complex tasks. This demonstration showcases the potential of our AI-powered assistant to reduce cognitive load, increase productivity, and enhance safety in industrial environments.",

To do that, we present Uptrendz, a multi-domain recommendation platform that can be customized to provide real-time recommendations in an API-centric way. We demonstrate (i) how to set up a real-time movie recommender using the popular MovieLens-100k dataset, and (ii) how to simultaneously support multiple application domains based on the use-case of recommendations in entrepreneurial start-up founding. For that, we differentiate between domains on the item- and system-level.

            "abstract": "By providing personalized suggestions to users, recommender systems have become essential to numerous online platforms. Collaborative filtering, particularly graph-based approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have demonstrated great results in terms of recommendation accuracy. However, accuracy may not always be the most important criterion for evaluating recommender systems' performance, since beyond-accuracy aspects such as recommendation diversity, serendipity, and fairness can strongly influence user engagement and satisfaction. This review paper focuses on addressing these dimensions in GNN-based recommender systems, going beyond the conventional accuracy-centric perspective. We begin by reviewing recent developments in approaches that improve not only the accuracy-diversity trade-off but also promote serendipity, and fairness in GNN-based recommender systems. We discuss different stages of model development including data preprocessing, graph construction, embedding initialization, propagation layers, embedding fusion, score computation, and training methodologies. Furthermore, we present a look into the practical difficulties encountered in assuring diversity, serendipity, and fairness, while retaining high accuracy. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for developing more robust GNN-based recommender systems that go beyond the unidimensional perspective of focusing solely on accuracy. This review aims to provide researchers and practitioners with an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted issues that arise when designing GNN-based recommender systems, setting our work apart by offering a comprehensive exploration of beyond-accuracy dimensions.",

            "abstract": "Recent work has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on graph data. Common attack approaches are typically informed, i.e. they have access to information about node attributes such as labels and feature vectors. In this work, we study adversarial attacks that are uninformed, where an attacker only has access to the graph structure, but no information about node attributes. Here the attacker aims to exploit structural knowledge and assumptions, which GNN models make about graph data. In particular, literature has shown that structural node centrality and similarity have a strong influence on learning with GNNs. Therefore, we study the impact of centrality and similarity on adversarial attacks on GNNs. We demonstrate that attackers can exploit this information to decrease the performance of GNNs by focusing on injecting links between nodes of low similarity and, surprisingly, low centrality. We show that structure-based uninformed attacks can approach the performance of informed attacks, while being computationally more efficient. With our paper, we present a new attack strategy on GNNs that we refer to as Structack. Structack can successfully manipulate the performance of GNNs with very limited information while operating under tight computational constraints. Our work contributes towards building more robust machine learning approaches on graphs.",

            "abstract": "Homophily describes the phenomenon that similarity breeds connection, i.e., individuals tend to form ties with other people who are similar to themselves in some aspect(s). The similarity in music taste can undoubtedly influence who we make friends with and shape our social circles. In this paper, we study homophily in an online music platform Last.fm regarding user preferences towards listening to mainstream (M), novel (N), or diverse (D) content. Furthermore, we draw comparisons with homophily based on listening profiles derived from artists users have listened to in the past, i.e., artist profiles. Finally, we explore the utility of users' artist profiles as well as features describing M, N, and D for the task of link prediction. Our study reveals that: (i) users with a friendship connection share similar music taste based on their artist profiles; (ii) on average, a measure of how diverse is the music two users listen to is a stronger predictor of friendship than measures of their preferences towards mainstream or novel content, i.e., homophily is stronger for D than for M and N; (iii) some user groups such as high-novelty-seekers (explorers) exhibit strong homophily, but lower than average artist profile similarity; (iv) using M, N and D achieves comparable results on link prediction accuracy compared with using artist profiles, but the combination of features yields the best accuracy results, and (v) using combined features does not add value if graph-based features such as common neighbors are available, making M, N, and D features primarily useful in a cold-start user recommendation setting for users with few friendship connections. The insights from this study will inform future work on social context-aware music recommendation, user modeling, and link prediction.",

            "title": "Design Implications for Explanations: A Case Study on Supporting Reflective Assessment of Potentially Misleading Videos",
            "abstract": "Online videos have become a prevalent means for people to acquire information. Videos, however, are often polarized, misleading, or contain topics on which people have different, contradictory views. In this work, we introduce natural language explanations to stimulate more deliberate reasoning about videos and raise users\u2019 awareness of potentially deceiving or biased information. With these explanations, we aim to support users in actively deciding and reflecting on the usefulness of the videos. We generate the explanations through an end-to-end pipeline that extracts reflection triggers so users receive additional information to the video based on its source, covered topics, communicated emotions, and sentiment. In a between-subjects user study, we examine the effect of showing the explanations for videos on three controversial topics. Besides, we assess the users\u2019 alignment with the video\u2019s message and how strong their belief is about the topic. Our results indicate that respondents\u2019 alignment with the video\u2019s message is critical to evaluate the video\u2019s usefulness. Overall, the explanations were found to be useful and of high quality. While the explanations do not influence the perceived usefulness of the videos compared to only seeing the video, people with an extreme negative alignment with a video\u2019s message perceived it as less useful (with or without explanations) and felt more confident in their assessment. We relate our findings to cognitive dissonance since users seem to be less receptive to explanations when the video\u2019s message strongly challenges their beliefs. Given these findings, we provide a set of design implications for explanations grounded in theories on reducing cognitive dissonance in light of raising awareness about online deception.",

            "abstract": "User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches to create recommender systems. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of regular equivalence applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used for selecting k-nearest neighbors used for item recommendation. Two vertices in a network are regularly equivalent if their neighbors are themselves equivalent and by using the iterative approach of calculating regular equivalence, we can study the impact of strong and weak ties on item recommendation. We evaluate our approach on cold-start users on a dataset crawled from Epinions and find that by using weak ties in addition to strong ties, we can improve the performance of a trust-based recommender in terms of recommendation accuracy.",

            "abstract": "User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches to create recommender systems. This approach is based on finding the most relevant k users from whose rating history we can extract items to recommend. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of regular equivalence applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used to select the k-nearest neighbors for recommending items. We evaluate our approach on Epinions and we find that we can outperform related methods for tackling cold-start users in terms of recommendation accuracy.",
