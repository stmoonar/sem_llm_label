            "abstract": "Lipid molecules such as cholesterol interact with the surface of integral membrane proteins (IMP) in a mode different from drug-like molecules in a protein binding pocket. These differences are due to the lipid molecule\u2019s shape, the membrane\u2019s hydrophobic environment, and the lipid\u2019s orientation in the membrane. We can use the recent increase in experimental structures in complex with cholesterol to understand protein-cholesterol interactions. We developed the RosettaCholesterol protocol consisting of (1) a prediction phase using an energy grid to sample and score native-like binding poses and (2) a specificity filter to calculate the likelihood that a cholesterol interaction site may be specific. We used a multi-pronged benchmark (self-dock, flip-dock, cross-dock, and global-dock) of protein-cholesterol complexes to validate our method. RosettaCholesterol improved sampling and scoring of native poses over the standard RosettaLigand baseline method in 91% of cases and performs better regardless of benchmark complexity. On the \u03b22AR, our method found one likely-specific site, which is described in the literature. The RosettaCholesterol protocol quantifies cholesterol binding site specificity. Our approach provides a starting point for high-throughput modeling and prediction of cholesterol binding sites for further experimental validation.",

            "abstract": "Antibody epitope mapping of viral proteins plays a vital role in understanding immune system mechanisms of protection. In the case of class I viral fusion proteins, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and protein stabilization techniques have highlighted the importance of cryptic or \u2018alternative\u2019 conformations that expose epitopes targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies. Thorough epitope mapping of such metastable conformations is difficult but is critical for understanding sites of vulnerability in class I fusion proteins that occur as transient conformational states during viral attachment and fusion. We introduce a novel method Accelerated class I fusion protein Epitope Mapping (AxIEM) that accounts for fusion protein flexibility to improve out-of-sample prediction of discontinuous antibody epitopes. Harnessing data from previous experimental epitope mapping efforts of several class I fusion proteins, we demonstrate that accuracy of epitope prediction depends on residue environment and allows for the prediction of conformation-dependent antibody target residues. We also show that AxIEM can identify common epitopes and provide structural insights for the development and rational design of vaccines.",

            "abstract": "In computer-aided drug discovery, quantitative structure activity relation models are trained to predict biological activity from chemical structure. Despite the recent success of applying graph neural network to this task, important chemical information such as molecular chirality is ignored. To fill this crucial gap, we propose Molecular-Kernel Graph Neural Network (MolKGNN) for molecular representation learning, which features SE(3)-/conformation invariance, chiralityawareness, and interpretability. For our MolKGNN, we first design a molecular graph convolution to capture the chemical pattern by comparing the atom\u2019s similarity with the learnable molecular kernels. Furthermore, we propagate the similarity score to capture the higher-order chemical pattern. To assess the method, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with nine well-curated datasets spanning numerous important drug targets that feature realistic high class imbalance and it demonstrates the superiority of MolKGNN over other GNNs in CADD. Meanwhile, the learned kernels identify patterns that agree with domain knowledge, confirming the pragmatic interpretability of this approach.

            "abstract": "The use of unnatural fluorogenic molecules widely expands the pallet of available genetically encoded fluorescent imaging tools through the design of fluorogen activating proteins (FAPs). While there is already a handful of such probes available, each of them went through laborious cycles of in vitro screening and selection. Computational modeling approaches are evolving incredibly fast right now and are demonstrating great results in many applications, including de novo protein design. It suggests that the easier task of fine-tuning the fluorogen-binding properties of an already functional protein in silico should be readily achievable. To test this hypothesis, we used Rosetta for computational ligand docking followed by protein binding pocket redesign to further improve the previously described FAP DiB1 that is capable of binding to a BODIPY-like dye M739. Despite an inaccurate initial docking of the chromophore, the incorporated mutations nevertheless improved multiple photophysical parameters as well as the overall performance of the tag. The designed protein, DiB-RM, shows higher brightness, localization precision, and apparent photostability in protein-PAINT super-resolution imaging compared to its parental variant DiB1. Moreover, DiB-RM can be cleaved to obtain an efficient split system with enhanced performance compared to a parental DiB-split system. The possible reasons for the inaccurate ligand binding pose prediction and its consequence on the outcome of the design experiment are further discussed.",

We demonstrate that BCL-AffinityNet is one of the top performing score functions on the comparative assessment of score functions 2016 affinity prediction and affinity ranking tasks. We also demonstrate that BCL-AffinityNet performs well on the CSAR-NRC HiQ I and II test sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BCL-DockANNScore is competitive with multiple state-of-the-art methods on the docking power and screening power tasks. Finally, we show how our models can be decomposed into human-interpretable pharmacophore maps to aid in hit/lead optimization.

            "abstract": "We describe an approach for integrating distance restraints from Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy into Rosetta with the purpose of modeling alternative protein conformations from an initial experimental structure. Fundamental to this approach is a multilateration algorithm that harnesses sets of interconnected spin label pairs to identify optimal rotamer ensembles at each residue that fit the DEER decay in the time domain. Benchmarked relative to data analysis packages, the algorithm yields comparable distance distributions with the advantage that fitting the DEER decay and rotamer ensemble optimization are coupled. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the protonation-dependent transition of the multidrug transporter PfMATE to an inward facing conformation with a deviation to the experimental structure of less than 2\u00c5 C\u03b1 RMSD. By decreasing spin label rotamer entropy, this approach engenders more accurate Rosetta models that are also more closely clustered, thus setting the stage for more robust modeling of protein conformational changes.",

            "abstract": "Computational protein design has the ambitious goal of crafting novel proteins that address challenges in biology and medicine. To overcome these challenges, the computational protein modeling suite Rosetta has been tailored to address various protein design tasks. Recently, statistical methods have been developed that identify correlated mutations between residues in a multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins. These subtle inter-dependencies in the occupancy of residue positions throughout evolution are crucial for protein function, but we found that three current Rosetta design approaches fail to recover these co-evolutionary couplings. Thus, we developed the Rosetta method ResCue (residue-coupling enhanced) that leverages co-evolutionary information to favor sequences which recapitulate correlated mutations, as observed in nature. To assess the protocols via recapitulation designs, we compiled a benchmark of ten proteins each represented by two, structurally diverse states. We could demonstrate that ResCue designed sequences with an average sequence recovery rate of 70%, whereas three other protocols reached not more than 50%, on average. Our approach had higher recovery rates also for functionally important residues, which were studied in detail. This improvement has only a minor negative effect on the fitness of the designed sequences as assessed by Rosetta energy. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that informing protocols with co-evolutionary signals helps to design stable and native-like proteins that are compatible with the different conformational states required for a complex function.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental and computational protein structure determination have provided access to high-quality structures for most human proteins and mutants thereof. However, linking changes in structure in protein mutants to functional impact remains an active area of method development. If successful, such methods can ultimately assist physicians in taking appropriate treatment decisions. This work presents three artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive models that classify four key functional parameters of KCNQ1 variants as normal or dysfunctional using PSSM-based evolutionary and/or biophysical descriptors. Recent advances in predicting protein structure and variant properties with artificial intelligence (AI) rely heavily on the availability of evolutionary features and thus fail to directly assess the biophysical underpinnings of a change in structure and/or function. The central goal of this work was to develop an ANN model based on structure and physiochemical properties of KCNQ1 potassium channels that performs comparably or better than algorithms using only on PSSM-based evolutionary features. These biophysical features highlight the structure-function relationships that govern protein stability, function, and regulation. The input sensitivity algorithm incorporates the roles of hydrophobicity, polarizability, and functional densities on key functional parameters of the KCNQ1 channel. Inclusion of the biophysical features outperforms exclusive use of PSSM-based evolutionary features in predicting activation voltage dependence and deactivation time. As AI is increasing applied to problems in biology, biophysical understanding will be critical with respect to \u2018explainable AI\u2019, i.e., understanding the relation of sequence, structure, and function of proteins. Our model is available at www.kcnq1predict.org. Author summary Heartbeat is maintained by electrical impulses generated by ion-conducting channel proteins in the heart such as the KCNQ1 potassium channel. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 can lead to channel loss-of-function and predisposition to fatal life-threatening irregularities of heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Machine learning methods that can predict the outcome of a mutation on KCNQ1 structure and function would be of great value in helping to assess the risk of a heart rhythm disorder. Recently, machine learning has made great progress in predicting the structures of proteins from their sequences. However, there are limited studies that link the effect of a mutation and change in protein structure with its function. This work presents the development of neural network models designed to predict mutation-induced changes in KCNQ1 functional parameters such as peak current density and voltage dependence of activation. We compare the predictive ability of features extracted from sequence, structure, and physicochemical properties of KCNQ1. Moreover, input sensitivity analysis connects biophysical features with specific functional parameters that provides insight into underlying molecular mechanisms for KCNQ1 channels. The best performing neural network model is publicly available as a webserver, called Q1VarPredBio, that delivers predictions about the functional phenotype of KCNQ1 variants.",

            "abstract": "Rosetta is a computational software suite containing algorithms for a wide variety of macromolecular structure prediction and design tasks including small molecule protocols commonly used in drug discovery or enzyme design. Here, we benchmark RosettaLigand score functions and protocols in comparison to results of other software recently published in the Comparative Assessment of Score Functions (CASF-2016). The CASF-2016 benchmark covers a wide variety of tests including scoring and ranking multiple compounds against a target, ligand docking of a small molecule to a target, and virtual screening to extract binders from a compound library. Direct comparison to the score functions provided by CASF-2016 results shows that the original RosettaLigand score function ranks among the top software for scoring, ranking, docking and screening tests. Most notably, the RosettaLigand score function ranked 2/34 among other report score functions in CASF-2016. We additionally perform a ligand docking test with full sampling to mimic typical use cases. Despite improved performance of newer score functions in canonical protein structure prediction and design, we demonstrate here that more recent Rosetta score functions have reduced performance across all small molecule benchmarks. The tests described here have also been uploaded to the Rosetta scientific benchmarking server and will be run weekly to track performance as the code is continually being developed.",

            "abstract": "In building a new drug design mode for the popular citizen scientist game Foldit, we focus on creating an easy-to-use and intuitive interface to confer complex scientific concepts to citizen scientist players. We hypothesize that to be efficient in the hands of citizen scientists such an interface will look different from well-established drug-design software used by experts. We used the relaxed think-aloud method to compare citizen and expert scientists working with our prototype interface for Foldit Drug Design Mode (FDDM). First, we tested if the two groups are providing different feedback when it comes to the usability of the prototype interface. Second, we investigated how the difference between the two groups might inform a new game design. As expected, the results confirm that experienced scientists differ from citizen scientists in engaging their background knowledge when interacting with the game. We then provided a prioritization list of background knowledge employed by the expert scientists to derive design suggestions for FDDM.",
