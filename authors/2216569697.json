            "title": "QPSeeker: An Efficient Neural Planner combining both data and queries through Variational Inference",
            "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have been applied on many aspects of the query optimization process, such as cardinality estimation and query execution time prediction, but very few tackle multiple aspects of the optimizer at the same time or combine both the underlying data and a query workload. QPSeeker takes a step towards a neural database planner, encapsulating the information of the data and the given workload to learn the distributions of cardinalities, costs and execution times of the query plan space. At inference, when a query is submitted to the database, QPSeeker uses its learned cost model and traverses the query plan space using Monte Carlo Tree Search to provide an execution plan for the query",

            "title": "Natural Language Data Interfaces: From Keyword Search to ChatGPT, are we there yet?",
            "abstract": "Enabling users to query data in a relational database using natural language has long been considered the holy grail of the database community. Towards this direction, there has been an increasing research focus on Natural Language Data Interfaces that allow users to pose queries in natural language and translate these queries to the underlying database query language. Several approaches have emerged especially due to the recent advances in deep neural networks. Despite this blooming, not only these systems are very complicated and difficult to understand, but they have yet to deliver their promise of enabling users to use natural language to access data easily. Hence, they have failed to see widespread adoption. A question naturally arises: is natural language access to data going to be the elusive holy grail of databases? We hope not. With the aim of fostering research on these open issues, in this position paper, we discuss (currently unmet) requirements for effective natural language data exploration and highlight promising research directions. Finally, we describe how to rethink the text-to-SQL problem and how this should be realized as an integral capability of a DBMS for the realization of a system that fully supports natural language queries over data.",
