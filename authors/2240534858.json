            "title": "POTEC: Off-Policy Learning for Large Action Spaces via Two-Stage Policy Decomposition",
            "abstract": "We study off-policy learning (OPL) of contextual bandit policies in large discrete action spaces where existing methods -- most of which rely crucially on reward-regression models or importance-weighted policy gradients -- fail due to excessive bias or variance. To overcome these issues in OPL, we propose a novel two-stage algorithm, called Policy Optimization via Two-Stage Policy Decomposition (POTEC). It leverages clustering in the action space and learns two different policies via policy- and regression-based approaches, respectively. In particular, we derive a novel low-variance gradient estimator that enables to learn a first-stage policy for cluster selection efficiently via a policy-based approach. To select a specific action within the cluster sampled by the first-stage policy, POTEC uses a second-stage policy derived from a regression-based approach within each cluster. We show that a local correctness condition, which only requires that the regression model preserves the relative expected reward differences of the actions within each cluster, ensures that our policy-gradient estimator is unbiased and the second-stage policy is optimal. We also show that POTEC provides a strict generalization of policy- and regression-based approaches and their associated assumptions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POTEC provides substantial improvements in OPL effectiveness particularly in large and structured action spaces.",

            "abstract": "Cities with strong local music scenes enjoy many social and economic benefits. To this end, we are interested in developing a locally-focused artist and event recommendation system called Localify.org that supports and promotes local music scenes. In this demo paper, we describe both the overall system architecture as well as our core recommendation algorithm. This algorithm uses artist-artist similarity information, as opposed to user-artist preference information, to bootstrap recommendation while we grow the number of users. The overall design of Localify was chosen based on the fact that local artists tend to be relatively obscure and reside in the long tail of the artist popularity distribution. We discuss the role of popularity bias and how we attempt to ameliorate it in the context of local music recommendation.",

            "title": "CONSEQUENCES \u2014 The 2nd Workshop on Causality, Counterfactuals and Sequential Decision-Making for Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems make algorithmic decisions about what will be shown to whom, billions of times every day across the web. These decisions have consequences that can often be far-reaching. Indeed, users that are exposed to certain items, might be convinced to explore interests that are novel to them. At the same time, exposure is often linked to economic incentives for the item producer, which platform-level metrics will be impacted by as well. Feedback loops in existing systems also imply that algorithmic decisions made by the model itself, have an impact on the data future model iterations will be trained and evaluated on. The literature on the intersection of recommender systems, and causal or counterfactual inference, is often focused on short-term, user-focused metrics. Nevertheless, as algorithmic consequences influence many stakeholders, it is our belief that a broader holistic view of the problem can lead to an improved understanding of these systems that touch upon many people\u2019s daily lives. The 2nd edition of the CONSEQUENCES workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in this research topic, and wish to help shape its future.",
