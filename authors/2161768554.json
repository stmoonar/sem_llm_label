However, the scarcity of studies in this domain prompts our focus on shedding light in this area. Employing Crunchbase data, our study delves into the global network of company acquisitions using diverse network analysis techniques. Our findings unveil an acquisition network characterized by a primarily sparse structure comprising localized dense connections. We reveal a prevalent tendency among organizations to acquire companies within their own country and industry. Furthermore, our temporal analysis indicates a growth in network communities over time, accompanied by a trend toward a sparser network. Through centrality metrics computation in the cross-city acquisition network, we identify New York, London, and San Francisco as pivotal and central hubs in the global economic landscape. Finally, we show that the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany are predominant countries in international acquisitions.",

Furthermore, we show that the country, region, city, and category of the companies can affect the formation of acquisition relationships between them. Our temporal analysis indicates a growth in the number of weakly connected components of the network over time, accompanied by a trend toward a sparser network. Through centrality metrics computation in the cross-city acquisition network, we identify New York, London, and San Francisco as pivotal and central hubs in the global economic landscape.

The insights from our research assist policymakers in crafting better regulations to foster global economic growth, and aid businesses in deciding which startups to acquire and which markets to target for expansion.",

            "abstract": "Employing various strategies to catch interest in using online app stores has become a common trend in recent decades. One of the dominant factors in determining the success of online businesses in this area is whether they have information about users' demographic features such as gender or age. In this study, we try to detect these features based on the lists of installed applications, installed games, and searched queries collected from an Iranian mobile application store. For this goal, we use a wide range of machine learning techniques to identify which model has the highest performance in these classification and regression tasks. Our findings show that we can detect genders with a balanced accuracy of 0.76. We also achieve 10.02 as the RMSE for age predictions and the ROC AUC of 0.81 in determining users' age groups.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, computer science (CS) has emerged as a dominant force in numerous research areas both within and beyond its own discipline. However, despite its significant impact on scholarly space, only a limited number of studies have been conducted to analyze the research trends and relationships within computer science. In this study, we collected information on fields and subfields from over 2,000 research articles published in the 2022 proceedings of the top Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conferences spanning various research fields. Through a network approach, we investigated the interconnections between CS fields and subfields to evaluate their interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity. Our findings indicate that computing methodologies and privacy and security stand out as the most interdisciplinary fields, while human-centered computing exhibits the highest frequency among the papers. Furthermore, we discovered that machine learning emerges as the most interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subfield within computer science. These results offer valuable insights for universities seeking to foster interdisciplinary research opportunities for their students.",

In addition to partiality patterns, we discuss the relations between gender/nationality diversity and the scienti\ufb01c achievements of research teams.

            "abstract": "After completing their undergraduate studies, many computer science (CS) students apply for competitive graduate programs in North America. Their long-term goal is often to be hired by one of the big five tech companies or to become a faculty member. Therefore, being aware of the role of admission criteria may help them choose the best path towards their goals. In this paper, we analyze the influence of students' previous universities on their chances of being accepted to prestigious North American universities and returning to academia as professors in the future. Our findings demonstrate that the ranking of their prior universities is a significant factor in achieving their goals. We then illustrate that there is a bias in the undergraduate institutions of students admitted to the top 25 computer science programs. Finally, we employ machine learning models to forecast the success of professors at these universities. We achieved an RMSE of 7.85 for this prediction task.",

            "title": "Gender Gaps in Online Social Connectivity, Promotion and Relocation Reports on LinkedIn",
            "abstract": "Online professional social networking platforms provide opportunities to expand networks strategically for job opportunities and career advancement. A large body of research shows that women\u2019s offline networks are less advantageous than men\u2019s. How online platforms such as LinkedIn may reflect or reproduce gendered networking behaviours, or how online social connectivity may affect outcomes differentially by gender is not well understood. This paper analyses aggregate, anonymised data from almost 10 million LinkedIn users in the UK and US information technology (IT) sector collected from the site\u2019s advertising platform to explore how being connected to Big Tech companies (\u2018social connectivity\u2019) varies by gender, and how gender, age, seniority and social connectivity shape the propensity to report job promotions or relocations. Consistent with previous studies, we find there are fewer women compared to men on LinkedIn in IT. Furthermore, female users are less likely to be connected to Big Tech companies than men. However, when we further analyse recent promotion or relocation reports, we find women are more likely than men to have reported a recent promotion at work, suggesting high-achieving women may be self-selecting onto LinkedIn. Even among this positively selected group, though, we find men are more likely to report a recent relocation. Social connectivity emerges as a significant predictor of promotion and relocation reports, with an interaction effect between gender and social connectivity indicating the payoffs to social connectivity for promotion and relocation reports are larger for women. This suggests that online networking has the potential for larger impacts for women, who experience greater disadvantage in traditional networking contexts, and calls for further research to understand differential impacts of online networking for socially disadvantaged groups.",
