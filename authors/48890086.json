            "abstract": "We present the second version of the Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT-v2), an open-source task-oriented conversational system for composing generative neural models. OAT-v2 is a scalable and flexible assistant platform supporting multiple domains and modalities of user interaction. It splits processing a user utterance into modular system components, including submodules such as action code generation, multimodal content retrieval, and knowledge-augmented response generation. Developed over multiple years of the Alexa TaskBot challenge, OAT-v2 is a proven system that enables scalable and robust experimentation in experimental and real-world deployment. OAT-v2 provides open models and software for research and commercial applications to enable the future of multimodal virtual assistants across diverse applications and types of rich interaction.",

            "title": "GRILLBot In Practice: Lessons and Tradeoffs Deploying Large Language Models for Adaptable Conversational Task Assistants",
            "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of building real-world multimodal assistants for complex real-world tasks. We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.",

            "abstract": "In this work we propose a set of new automatic text augmentations that leverage Large Language Models from song metadata to improve on music information retrieval tasks. Compared to recent works, our proposed methods leverage large language models and copyright-free corpora from web sources, enabling us to release the knowledge sources collected. We show how combining these representations with the audio signal provides a 21% relative improvement on five of six datasets on genre classification, emotion recognition and music tagging, achieving state-of-the-art in three (GTZAN, FMA-Small and Deezer). We demonstrate the benefit of injecting external knowledge sources by comparing them withintrinsic text representation methods that rely only on the sample's information.",

Interactions in CIS are primarily based on natural language dialogue, while they may include other types of interactions, such as click, touch, and body gestures. CIS recently attracted significant attention and advancements continue to be made. This tutorial follows the content of the recent Conversational Information Seeking book authored by several of the tutorial presenters. The tutorial aims to be an introduction to CIS for newcomers to CIS in addition to the recent advanced topics and state-of-the-art approaches for students and researchers with moderate knowledge of the topic. A significant part of the tutorial is dedicated to hands-on experiences based on toolkits developed by the presenters for conversational passage retrieval and multi-modal task-oriented dialogues. The outcomes of this tutorial include theoretical and practical knowledge, including a forum to meet researchers interested in CIS.",

GRILLBot curates and leverages web information extraction to build coverage over a broad range of tasks for which a user can receive guidance. To represent each task, we propose TaskGraphs as a dynamic graph unifying steps, requirements, and curated domain knowledge enabling contextual question answering, and detailed explanations. Multi-modal elements play a key role in GRILLBot both helping the user navigate through the task and enriching the experience with helpful videos and images that are automatically linked throughout the task. We leverage a contextual neural semantic parser to enable flexible navigation when interacting with the system by jointly encoding stateful information with the conversation history. GRILLBot enables dynamic and adaptable task planning and assistance for complex tasks by combining elements of task representations that incorporate text and structure, combined with neural models for search, question answering, and dialogue state management. GRILLBot competed in the Alexa prize TaskBot Challenge as one of the finalists.",

            "abstract": "Tools capable of automatic code generation have the potential to augment programmer's capabilities. While straightforward code retrieval is incorporated into many IDEs, an emerging area is explicit code generation. Code generation is currently approached as a Machine Translation task, with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based encoder-decoder architectures trained on code-description pairs. In this work we introduce and study modern Transformer architectures for this task. We further propose a new model called the Relevance Transformer that incorporates external knowledge using pseudo-relevance feedback. The Relevance Transformer biases the decoding process to be similar to existing retrieved code while enforcing diversity. We perform experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets for code generation including Django, Hearthstone, and CoNaLa. The results show improvements over state-of-the-art methods based on BLEU evaluation. The Relevance Transformer model shows the potential of Transformer-based architectures for code generation and introduces a method of incorporating pseudo-relevance feedback during inference.",

            "abstract": ". Answer Sentence Selection (ASS) is one of the steps typically involved in Question Answering, a hard task for natural language processing since full solutions would require both natural language understanding and world knowledge. We present a new approach to tackle ASS, based on a Cross-Attentive Convolutional Neural Network. The approach was designed for competing in the Fujitsu AI-NLP challenge Fujitsu [4], which evaluates systems on their performance on the SelQA [7] dataset. This dataset was created on purpose as a benchmark to stress the ability of systems to go beyond simple word co-occurrence criteria. Our submission achieved the top score in the challenge.",
