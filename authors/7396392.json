            "title": "A Novel Method to Design Steerable Differential Beamformer Using Linear Acoustics Vector Sensor Array",
            "abstract": "Differential beamforming techniques have gained significant attention due to their frequency-independent beampatterns, applicability for small apertures, and super-directivity. It is commonly known that the main lobe of a beam pattern based on a linear array is typically aligned with the end-fire direction. However, in some application scenarios, aligning the main lobe in the end-fire direction may not meet the actual requirements. This article focuses on studying the steering problem of differential beamformers based on linear acoustics vector sensor arrays (LAVSs). We propose a steerable differential beamformer for LAVSs, which addresses the problem of non-steerable beam patterns of linear arrays. Our approach involves approximating the beam pattern using a series expansion of the weighted steering vector to achieve frequency-independent differential directivity. The major contributions of this article include, but are not limited to, the following: First, we derive the first-order to third-order differential directivity based on the acoustics vector sensor (AVS) signal model, and obtain the weights of the corresponding channels using the least squares method. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of the steering differential beamformer, demonstrating that the maximum directivity factor (DF) is a function of the steering angle. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Although traditional subspace direction of arrival (DOA) algorithms enable super-resolution, the algorithm performance declines sharply when the number of sources is incorrectly estimated. This article proposes a new DOA estimation method as an optimization problem similar to the conventional minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) that fully considers the eigenvalues ranking problem. After a mathematical derivation, a concise DOA estimation expression is given based on the mapping between eigenvalues. As the algorithm considers the relative ranking of eigenvalues, the number of sources is not required for DOA estimations. Therefore, the performance of the algorithm does not degrade due to incorrect estimations in the number of sources. To enhance the algorithm performance, this article analyzes the reasons for the formation of pseudo peaks based on the eigenvalues and gives the corresponding boundary conditions. Based on the analysis of white noise, in order to overcome the influence of color noise, this article gives a way to deal with color noise. Finally, the theory of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulation experiments, and its performance is demonstrated through comparative experiments with MUSIC under white and color noise.",

            "abstract": "The equivalent source method is widely applied to study structural acoustic radiation in an underwater environment. However, there is still uncertainty in arranging the equivalent source, and the current mainstream configuration method needs a large number of equivalent sources, limiting its practical applicability. In this paper, an equivalent source configuration method that is simple, effective, and easy to implement, and which based on a tradeoff between the ill condition of the transfer matrix and the adequacy of the simulated structure\u2019s radiated sound field, is proposed. The optimization method can derive the appropriate positions and quantity of monopole equivalent sources simultaneously. The method does not yield an optimal solution in a strict mathematical sense but provides satisfactory results compared with those obtained by uniformly distributed equivalent sources. Numerical simulation results showed that the optimization method derives accurate sound field calculation results with a relatively small number of equivalent sources, significantly reducing the number of subsequent calculations needed. Finally, the experiments conducted with a cylindrical shell structure verified the validity and practicality of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we design a small-sized bi-cone acoustic vector-sensor array (BCAVSA) and propose a frequency invariant beamforming method for the BCAVSA, inspired by the Ormia ochracea\u2019s coupling ears and harmonic nesting. First, we design a BCAVSA using several sets of cylindrical acoustic vector-sensor arrays (AVSAs), which are used as a guide to construct the constant beamwidth beamformer. Due to the mechanical coupling system of the Ormia ochracea\u2019s two ears, the phase and amplitude differences of acoustic signals at the bilateral tympanal membranes are magnified. To obtain a virtual BCAVSA with larger interelement distances, we then extend the coupling magnified system into the BCAVSA by deriving the expression of the coupling magnified matrix for the BCAVSA and providing the selecting method of coupled parameters for fitting the underwater signal frequency. Finally, the frequency invariant beamforming method is developed to acquire the constant beamwidth pattern in the three-dimensional plane by deriving several sets of the frequency weighted coefficients for the different cylindrical AVSAs. Simulation results show that this method achieves a narrower mainlobe width compared to the original BCAVSA. This method has lower sidelobes and a narrower mainlobe width compared to the coupling magnified bi-cone pressure sensor array.",

            "abstract": "In the scenario of ambient noise, the noise powers received by the pressure and velocity components in an underwater acoustic vector sensor (AVS) array are unequal. This paper proves when using the MUSIC method, this inequality causes virtual sources and thus increases the rank of the signal subspace. This fact dramatically degrades the DOA estimation performance of the MUSIC method. Then, an augmented subspace (AS) MUSIC method is proposed to take account of the virtual sources, by augmenting the number of the virtual sources into the signal subspace. Simulation results demonstrate in the case of a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the performance of the AS MUSIC method and the MUSIC method is similar. However, in the case of a low SNR, the AS MUSIC method is superior to the MUSIC method in terms of spatial spectrum, estimation accuracy, and resolution. Experimental results further verify the superiority of the AS MUSIC method over the MUSIC method.",

            "abstract": "Spherical microphone arrays have been paid increasing attention for their ability to locate a sound source with arbitrary incident angle in three-dimensional space. Low-frequency sound sources are usually located by using spherical near-field acoustic holography. The reconstruction surface and holography surface are conformal surfaces in the conventional sound field transformation based on generalized Fourier transform. When the sound source is on the cylindrical surface, it is difficult to locate by using spherical surface conformal transform. The non-conformal sound field transformation by making a transfer matrix based on spherical harmonic wave decomposition is proposed in this paper, which can achieve the transformation of a spherical surface into a cylindrical surface by using spherical array data. The theoretical expressions of the proposed method are deduced, and the performance of the method is simulated. Moreover, the experiment of sound source localization by using a spherical array with randomly and uniformly distributed elements is carried out. Results show that the non-conformal surface sound field transformation from a spherical surface to a cylindrical surface is realized by using the proposed method. The localization deviation is around 0.01 m, and the resolution is around 0.3 m. The application of the spherical array is extended, and the localization ability of the spherical array is improved.",

            "abstract": "The low-frequency characteristic line spectrum contains significant information about underwater targets, which makes both its detection and control a hot topic of research. Attempts to suppress the characteristic line spectrum by active control strategy are greatly influenced by the tracking effect of the instantaneous information of the line spectrum, and have to deal with two specific technical problems in underwater applications. Firstly, the instability of the line spectrum; and, secondly, uncertain compensation of time delay, which is closely related to hydrological parameters. In order to cope with these problems, a tracking control strategy was proposed. This idea is based on biorthogonal demodulation, by smoothing phase-difference and cross-correlation time-delay estimation. This makes it possible to track the phase and frequency information of a signal. Secondly, the performance of the tracking algorithm for several typical models of signals under additive Gaussian white noise environment was simulated, and the accuracy of the tracked instantaneous information was given. Thirdly, the factors influencing the performance of the algorithm are discussed and the measures to improve accuracy are introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy was confirmed through the validation of the measured data obtained by an experiment.",

            "abstract": "A vector hydrophone co-locating and simultaneously measures pressure and particle, which obtains more entire information of acoustic field than pressure hydrophone, so that to render the more methods of signal processing. Bispectrum is a kind of high order spectrum analysis method, which impose a lot of information that two order statistics can't obtian. In this paper, the algorithms of bispectrum was researched based on vector hydrophone to obtain the feature of acoustic signals. Bispectrum of particle velocity and cross-bispectrum of pressure and particle velocity were analyzed. Different methods were used to compress the information measured of bispectrum and cross-bispectrum to get the signal feature quickly and effectively. The experiment was carried on based on theoretical research, and the bispectrum and cross-bispectrum were used to extract the features of radiation noise of two kinds of acoustic targets, and the pressure and vector features were obtiand. The researched results showed that Gaussia...",
