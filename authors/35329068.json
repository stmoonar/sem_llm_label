            "title": "Assessing Scientific Research Papers with Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "In recent decades, the growing scale of scientific research has led to numerous novel findings. Reproducing these findings is the foundation of future research. However, due to the complexity of experiments, manually assessing scientific research is laborious and time-intensive, especially in social and behavioral sciences. Although increasing reproducibility studies have garnered increased attention in the research community, there is still a lack of systematic ways for evaluating scientific research at scale. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards automatically assessing scientific publications by constructing a knowledge graph (KG) that captures a holistic view of the research contributions. Specifically, during the KG construction, we combine information from two different perspectives: micro-level features that capture knowledge from published articles such as sample sizes, effect sizes, and experimental models, and macro-level features that comprise relationships between entities such as authorship and reference information. We then learn low-dimensional representations using language models and knowledge graph embeddings for entities (nodes in KGs), which are further used for the assessments. A comprehensive set of experiments on two benchmark datasets shows the usefulness of leveraging KGs for scoring scientific research.",

            "title": "Retrieving Complex Tables with Multi-Granular Graph Representation Learning",
            "abstract": "The task of natural language table retrieval (NLTR) seeks to retrieve semantically relevant tables based on natural language queries. Existing learning systems for this task often treat tables as plain text based on the assumption that tables are structured as dataframes. However, tables can have complex layouts which indicate diverse dependencies between subtable structures, such as nested headers. As a result, queries may refer to different spans of relevant content that is distributed across these structures. Moreover, such systems fail to generalize to novel scenarios beyond those seen in the training set. Prior methods are still distant from a generalizable solution to the NLTR problem, as they fall short in handling complex table layouts or queries over multiple granularities. To address these issues, we propose Graph-based Table Retrieval (GTR), a generalizable NLTR framework with multi-granular graph representation learning. In our framework, a table is first converted into a tabular graph, with cell nodes, row nodes and column nodes to capture content at different granularities. Then the tabular graph is input to a Graph Transformer model that can capture both table cell content and the layout structures. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of the model, we further incorporate a self-supervised pre-training task based on graph-context matching. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that our method leads to significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art systems. Further experiments demonstrate promising performance of our method on cross-dataset generalization, and enhanced capability of handling complex tables and fulfilling diverse query intents.",

            "abstract": "\n \n The weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP) is a powerful mathematical framework for combinatorial optimization. The branch and bound search paradigm is very successful in solving the WCSP but critically depends on the ordering in which variables are instantiated. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for dynamic variable ordering for solving the WCSP. This framework is inspired by regression decision tree learning. Variables are ordered dynamically based on samples of random assignments of values to variables as well as their corresponding total weights. Within this framework, we propose four variable ordering heuristics (sdr, inv-sdr, rr and inv-rr). We compare them with many other state-of-the-art dynamic variable ordering heuristics, and show that sdr and rr outperform them on many real-world and random benchmark instances.\n \n",

            "abstract": "\n \n In this paper, we formalize and study the Moving Agents in Formation (MAiF) problem, that combines the tasks of finding short collision-free paths for multiple agents and keeping them in close adherence to a desired formation. Previous work includes controller-based algorithms, swarm-based algorithms, and potential-field-based algorithms. They usually focus on only one or the other of these tasks, solve the problem greedily without systematic search, and thus generate costly solutions or even fail to find solutions in congested environment. In this paper, we develop a two-phase search algorithm, called SWARM-MAPF, whose first phase is inspired by swarm-based algorithms (in open regions) and whose second phase is inspired by multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) algorithms (in congested regions). In the first phase, SWARM-MAPF selects a leader among the agents and finds a path for it that is sufficiently far away from the obstacles so that the other agents can preserve the desired formation around it. It also identifies the critical segments of the leader's path where the other agents cannot preserve the desired formation and the refinement of which has thus to be delegated to the second phase. In the second phase, SWARM-MAPF refines these segments. Theoretically, we prove that SWARM-MAPF is complete. Empirically, we show that SWARM-MAPF scales well and is able to find close-to-optimal solutions.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Tables of data are used to record vast amounts of socioeconomic, scientific, and governmental information. Although humans create tables using underlying organizational principles, unfortunately AI systems struggle to understand the contents of these tables. This paper introduces an end-to-end system for table understanding, the process of capturing the relational structure of data in tables. We introduce models that identify cell types, group these cells into blocks of data that serve a similar functional role, and predict the relationships between these blocks. We introduce a hybrid, neuro-symbolic approach, combining embedded representations learned from thousands of tables with probabilistic constraints that capture regularities in how humans organize tables. Our neuro-symbolic model is better able to capture positional invariants of headers and enforce homogeneity of data types. One limitation in this research area is the lack of rich datasets for evaluating end-to-end table understanding, so we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprised of 431 diverse tables from data.gov. The evaluation results show that our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance on cell type classification, block identification, and relationship prediction, improving over prior efforts by up to 7% of macro F1 score.",

            "abstract": "Tables are a widely-used format for data curation. The diversity of domains, layouts, and content of tables makes knowledge extraction challenging. Understanding table layouts is an important step for automatically harvesting knowledge from tabular data. Since table cells are spatially organized into regions, correctly identifying such regions and inferring their functional roles, referred to as functional block detection, is a critical part of understanding table layouts. Earlier functional block detection approaches fail to leverage spatial relationships and higher-level structure, either depending on cell-level predictions or relying on data types as signals for identifying blocks. In this paper, we introduce a flexible functional block detection method by applying agglomerative clustering techniques which merge smaller blocks into larger blocks using two merging strategies. Our proposed method uses cell embeddings with a customized dissimilarity function which utilizes local and margin distances, as well as block coherence metrics to capture cell, block, and table scoped features. Given the diversity of tables in real-world corpora, we also introduce a sampling-based approach for automatically tuning distance thresholds for each table. Experimental results show that our method improves over the earlier state-of-the-art method in terms of several evaluation metrics.",

            "abstract": "Tables provide valuable knowledge that can be used to verify textual statements. While a number of works have considered table-based fact verification, direct alignments of tabular data with tokens in textual statements are rarely available. Moreover, training a generalized fact verification model requires abundant labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a novel system to address these problems. Inspired by counterfactual causality, our system identifies token-level salience in the statement with probing-based salience estimation. Salience estimation allows enhanced learning of fact verification from two perspectives. From one perspective, our system conducts masked salient token prediction to enhance the model for alignment and reasoning between the table and the statement. From the other perspective, our system applies salience-aware data augmentation to generate a more diverse set of training instances by replacing non-salient terms. Experimental results on TabFact show the effective improvement by the proposed salience-aware learning techniques, leading to the new SOTA performance on the benchmark.

            "abstract": "Many kinds of algorithms have been developed for solving the weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP) , a combinatorial optimization problem that frequently appears in AI. Unfortunately, its NP-hardness prohibits the existence of an algorithm for solving it that is universally ef\ufb01cient on classical computers. Therefore, a peek into quantum computers may be imperative for solving the WCSP ef\ufb01ciently. In this paper, we focus on a speci\ufb01c type of quantum computer, called the quantum annealer , which approximately solves quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. We propose the \ufb01rst three hybrid quantum-classical algorithms (HQCAs) for the WCSP: one speci\ufb01cally for the binary Boolean WCSP and the other two for the general WCSP. We experimentally show that the HQCA based on simple polynomial reformulation works well on the binary Boolean WCSP, but the HQCA based on the constraint composite graph works best on the general WCSP.",

            "title": "Learning Collaborative Agents with Rule Guidance for Knowledge Graph Reasoning",
            "abstract": "Walk-based models have shown their unique advantages in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning by achieving state-of-the-art performance while allowing for explicit visualization of the decision sequence. However, the sparse reward signals offered by the KG during a traversal are often insufficient to guide a sophisticated reinforcement learning (RL) model. An alternate approach to KG reasoning is using traditional symbolic methods (e.g., rule induction), which achieve high precision without learning but are hard to generalize due to the limitation of symbolic representation. In this paper, we propose to fuse these two paradigms to get the best of both worlds. Our method leverages high-quality rules generated by symbolic-based methods to provide reward supervision for walk-based agents. Due to the structure of symbolic rules with their entity variables, we can separate our walk-based agent into two sub-agents thus allowing for additional efficiency. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that walk-based models can benefit from rule guidance significantly.",
