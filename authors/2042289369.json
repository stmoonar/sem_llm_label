            "abstract": "Modern graph representation learning works mostly under the assumption of dealing with regularly sampled temporal graph snapshots, which is far from realistic, e.g., social networks and physical systems are characterized by continuous dynamics and sporadic observations. To address this limitation, we introduce the Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation (TG-ODE) framework, which learns both the temporal and spatial dynamics from graph streams where the intervals between observations are not regularly spaced. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that TG-ODE can achieve state-of-the-art performance in irregular graph stream tasks.",

            "abstract": "A common problem in Message-Passing Neural Networks is oversquashing -- the limited ability to facilitate effective information flow between distant nodes. Oversquashing is attributed to the exponential decay in information transmission as node distances increase. This paper introduces a novel perspective to address oversquashing, leveraging properties of global and local non-dissipativity, that enable the maintenance of a constant information flow rate. Namely, we present SWAN, a uniquely parameterized model GNN with antisymmetry both in space and weight domains, as a means to obtain non-dissipativity. Our theoretical analysis asserts that by achieving these properties, SWAN offers an enhanced ability to transmit information over extended distances. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that emphasize long-range interactions validate the theoretical understanding of SWAN, and its ability to mitigate oversquashing.",

This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow. Motivated by this, we introduce (port-)Hamiltonian Deep Graph Networks, a novel framework that models neural information flow in graphs by building on the laws of conservation of Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time. Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our port-Hamiltonian scheme in pushing simple graph convolutional architectures to state-of-the-art performance in long-range benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "Deep Graph Networks (DGNs) currently dominate the research landscape of learning from graphs, due to their efficiency and ability to implement an adaptive message-passing scheme between the nodes. However, DGNs are typically limited in their ability to propagate and preserve long-term dependencies between nodes, i.e., they suffer from the over-squashing phenomena. This reduces their effectiveness, since predictive problems may require to capture interactions at different, and possibly large, radii in order to be effectively solved. In this work, we present Anti-Symmetric Deep Graph Networks (A-DGNs), a framework for stable and non-dissipative DGN design, conceived through the lens of ordinary differential equations. We give theoretical proof that our method is stable and non-dissipative, leading to two key results: long-range information between nodes is preserved, and no gradient vanishing or explosion occurs in training. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that A-DGN yields to improved performance and enables to learn effectively even when dozens of layers are used.",

            "title": "Controlling astrocyte-mediated synaptic pruning signals for schizophrenia drug repurposing with deep graph networks",
            "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder, leading to both physical and social morbidity. Worldwide 1% of the population is struggling with the disease, with 100,000 new cases annually only in the United States. Despite its importance, the goal of finding effective treatments for schizophrenia remains a challenging task, and previous work conducted expensive large-scale phenotypic screens. This work investigates the benefits of Machine Learning for graphs to optimize drug phenotypic screens and predict compounds that mitigate abnormal brain reduction induced by excessive glial phagocytic activity in schizophrenia subjects. Given a compound and its concentration as input, we propose a method that predicts a score associated with three possible compound effects, i.e., reduce, increase, or not influence phagocytosis. We leverage a high-throughput screening to prove experimentally that our method achieves good generalization capabilities. The screening involves 2218 compounds at five different concentrations. Then, we analyze the usability of our approach in a practical setting, i.e., prioritizing the selection of compounds in the SWEETLEAD library. We provide a list of 64 compounds from the library that have the most potential clinical utility for glial phagocytosis mitigation. Lastly, we propose a novel approach to computationally validate their utility as possible therapies for schizophrenia. Author summary Phagocytosis is a fundamental biological process to protect biological organisms from exogenous infectious particles as well as to preserve equilibrium and efficiency of the host by removing its unwanted cells. A dysregulation of the phagocytic activity can lead to severe consequences for the host. In this study, we focus on a recent theory that relates an excessive phagocytic activity in brain cells, and a consequent abnormal reduction in brain volume, to the development of schizophrenia. Our working hypothesis is that pharmaceutical compounds that can reduce excessive of phagocytic activity might prove effective as a schizophrenia treatment. Rather than attempting to develop ex-novo such a chemical compound, we rely on a more cost-effective and efficient approach that seeks candidate therapies in a set of approved chemical compounds. To achieve this, we train a machine learning model capable of predicting, with good accuracy, the ability of a molecular compound to increase or decrease phagocytosis in the target brain cells. Our approach leverages learning models capable of directly processing the molecular graph of the compound, leading to the identification of 64 candidate drugs of potential clinical utility.",

            "abstract": "With high drug attrition, interaction network methods are increasingly attractive as quick and inexpensive methods for prediction of drug safety and efficacy effects when a drug pathway is unknown. However, these methods suffer from high false positive rates for selecting drug phenotypic effects, their performance is often no better than random (AUROC ~0.5), and this limits the use of network methods in regulatory and industrial decision making. In contrast to many network engineering approaches that apply mathematical thresholds to discover phenotype associations, we hypothesized that interaction networks associated with true positive drug phenotypes are context specific. We tested this hypothesis on 16 designated medical event (DMEs) phenotypes which are a subset of adverse events that are of upmost concern to FDA review using a novel data set extracted from drug labels. We demonstrated that context-specific interactions (CSIs) distinguished true from false positive DMEs with an 50% improvement over non-context-specific approaches (AUROC 0.77 compared to 0.51). By reducing false positives, CSI analysis has the potential to advance network techniques to influence decision making in regulatory and industry settings. Author summary Drugs bind proteins that interact with multiple downstream proteins and these protein networks are responsible for drug efficacy and safety. Protein interaction network methods predict drug effects aggregating information about proteins around drug-binding protein targets. However, many frameworks exist for identifying proteins relevant to a drug\u2019s effect. We consider three frameworks for selecting these proteins and show increased performance from a context-specific approach on selecting proteins relevant to severe drug side effects. The context-specific approach leverages the idea that the proteins responsible for a drug side effect are specific to each side-effect. By discovering the relevant proteins, we can better understand downstream effects of drugs and better anticipate drug side effects for new drugs in development. Further, we focus on designated medical events, a subset of the most severe drug side-effects that are high priority for regulatory review.",
