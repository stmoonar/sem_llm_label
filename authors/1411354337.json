            "title": "Towards human in the loop based query rewriting for exploring datasets",
            "abstract": "Data exploration promotes a new querying philosophy that grad-ually converges into queries that can be used to exploit raw data collections according to data explorers (i.e., users) expectations. Data exploration aims to guide the understanding of data collections with different rawness degree and define the type of questions that can be asked on top of them, often through interactive exploration processes. This paper introduces a human-guided data exploration approach defining exploration operations that result in different types of factual and analytic queries. Our first results include a proposal of query morphing and queries as answers strategies. This paper describes an experiment setting used for testing the data exploration techniques.",

            "abstract": "In the current scenario of COVID-19 pandemic when people around the world are facing restrictions in their daily life activities, there is a rapid growth in the number of people relying on the internet. Billions of people are using social media platforms such as Twitter for sharing COVID-19 related news, information and thoughts which re\ufb02ect their perception and opinion about the pandemic. Analysis of tweets for identifying mis-information and emotion analysis can generate valuable insights. We present CMTA: a multilingual COVID-19 related tweet analysis model.In our work, we propose a deep learning model for multilingual tweet misinformation and emotion detection and classi\ufb01cation. CMTS uses multilingual BERT for extracting features from multilingual textual data, which is then categorised into speci\ufb01c emotion and misinformation class. Classi\ufb01cation is done by a Dense-CNN model trained on tweets manually annotated into emotion(8 classes) and mis-information(5 classes). We also present an analysis of multilingual tweets from April to June month showing the distribution of public emotion and misinformation spread across different languages.",

            "abstract": "We present GroupTravel, a framework that generates cus-tomized travel packages (TPs) for a group of individuals. GroupTravel implements different consensus functions proposed in group recommendation to reach agreement among members. Given a group whose members provide a travel query, GroupTravel returns k Composite Items (CIs) of Points Of Interest (POIs) that are valid, representative, cohesive and personalized. Validity is achieved by satisfying the query expressed by the group. Representativity ensures good coverage of a city. Cohesiveness reflects geographic proximity of POIs forming a CI. Personalization is achieved by choosing POIs that best match the travel preferences of group members. Additionally, group members can interact with generated TPs to customize them. With extensive synthetic experiments and user studies, we examine the benefit of personalization and the impact of different group consensus on user satisfaction. We also show that providing the ability to interact with TPs and reflecting that in the consensus yields better TPs.",
