            "abstract": "While digital transformation brings broad positive impacts, its rapid propagation varies across territories, accentuating disparities not only in the social and organisational contexts but even in industrial sectors. Acknowledging this digital divide, the HUMAD workshop aimed to reshape industrial and digital landscapes for equity and accessibility, specifically emphasising the pivotal role of user modelling and artificial intelligence. Discussions centred on personalised user modelling and holistic, human-centred approaches tailored for an industrial context. The workshop explored applications in critical sectors, including smart cities, tourism, industrial production, healthcare, education, and well-being, focusing on delivering quality digital interactions and services tuned to industrial and human-centric needs. The objective was to elevate the quality of digital interactions and services, ensuring a more uniform and inclusive distribution of the benefits of industrial digital transformation. Beyond immediate concerns, HUMAD delved into user modelling\u2019s potential to drive growth in disadvantaged territories. By comprehending the unique challenges these regions face, the aim was to cultivate sustainable solutions within an industrial framework. In the light of the above, we invited contributions that navigate the intricacies of user modelling, proposing innovative strategies to reduce disparities and develop a more equitable, human-centric digital future.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.",

            "abstract": "Online platforms have become the primary means for travellers to search, compare, and book accommodations for their trips. Consequently, online platforms and revenue managers must acquire a comprehensive comprehension of these dynamics to formulate a competitive and appealing offerings. Recent advancements in natural language processing, specifically through the development of large language models, have demonstrated significant progress in capturing the intricate nuances of human language. On the other hand, knowledge graphs have emerged as potent instruments for representing and organizing structured information. Nevertheless, effectively integrating these two powerful technologies remains an ongoing challenge. This paper presents an innovative deep learning methodology that combines large language models with domain-specific knowledge graphs for classification of tourism offers. The main objective of our system is to assist revenue managers in the following two fundamental dimensions: (i) comprehending the market positioning of their accommodation offerings, taking into consideration factors such as accommodation price and availability, together with user reviews and demand, and (ii) optimizing presentations and characteristics of the offerings themselves, with the intention of improving their overall appeal. For this purpose, we developed a domain knowledge graph covering a variety of information about accommodations and implemented targeted feature engineering techniques to enhance the information representation within a large language model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a comparative analysis against alternative methods on four datasets about accommodation offers in London. The proposed solution obtained excellent results, significantly outperforming alternative methods.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs). A SLR is a rigorous and organised methodology that assesses and integrates prior research on a given topic. Numerous tools have been developed to assist and partially automate the SLR process. The increasing role of AI in this field shows great potential in providing more effective support for researchers, moving towards the semi-automatic creation of literature reviews. Our study focuses on how AI techniques are applied in the semi-automation of SLRs, specifically in the screening and extraction phases. We examine 21 leading SLR tools using a framework that combines 23 traditional features with 11 AI features. We also analyse 11 recent tools that leverage large language models for searching the literature and assisting academic writing. Finally, the paper discusses current trends in the field, outlines key research challenges, and suggests directions for future research. We highlight three primary research challenges: integrating advanced AI solutions, such as large language models and knowledge graphs, improving usability, and developing a standardised evaluation framework. We also propose best practices to ensure more robust evaluations in terms of performance, usability, and transparency. Overall, this review offers a detailed overview of AI-enhanced SLR tools for researchers and practitioners, providing a foundation for the development of next-generation AI solutions in this field.",

At the same time, (big-) data has become the \u201cnew oil\u201d of this century and Knowledge Graphs are emerging as the most natural way to collect, refine, and structure this heterogeneous information. In this paper, we present a methodology for semi-automatic generating a Tourism Knowledge Graph (TKG), which can be used for supporting a variety of intelligent services in this space, and a new ontology for modelling this domain, the Tourism Analytics Ontology (TAO). Our approach processes and integrates data from Booking.com, Airbnb, DBpedia, and GeoNames. Due to its modular structure, it can be easily extended to include new data sources or to apply new enrichment and refinement functions. We report a comprehensive evaluation of the functional, logical, and structural dimensions of TKG and TAO.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, chatbots have become mainstream solutions adopted in a variety of domains for automatizing communication at scale. In the same period, knowledge graphs have attracted significant attention from business and academia as robust and scalable representations of information. In the scientific and academic research domain, they are increasingly used to illustrate the relevant actors (e.g., researchers, institutions), documents (e.g., articles, patents), entities (e.g., concepts, innovations), and other related information. Following the same direction, this paper describes how to integrate conversational agents with knowledge graphs focused on the scholarly domain, a.k.a. Scientific Knowledge Graphs. On top of the proposed architecture, we developed AIDA-Bot, a simple chatbot that leverages a large-scale knowledge graph of scholarly data. AIDA-Bot can answer natural language questions about scientific articles, research concepts, researchers, institutions, and research venues. We have developed four prototypes of AIDA-Bot on Alexa products, web browsers, Telegram clients, and humanoid robots. We performed a user study evaluation with 15 domain experts showing a high level of interest and engagement with the proposed agent.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between the composition of a research team and the potential impact of their research papers is crucial as it can steer the development of new science policies for improving the research enterprise. Numerous studies assess how the characteristics and diversity of research teams can influence their performance across several dimensions: ethnicity, internationality, size, and others. In this paper, we explore the impact of diversity in terms of the authors\u2019 expertise. To this purpose, we retrieved 114K papers in the field of Computer Science and analysed how the diversity of research fields within a research team relates to the number of citations their papers received in the upcoming 5 years. The results show that two different metrics we defined, reflecting the diversity of expertise, are significantly associated with the number of citations. This suggests that, at least in Computer Science, diversity of expertise is key to scientific impact.",

            "abstract": "The use of transformer-based models like BERT for natural language processing has achieved remarkable performance across multiple domains. However, these models face challenges when dealing with very specialized domains, such as scientific literature. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of knowledge injection strategies for transformers in the scientific domain, evaluating four distinct methods for injecting external knowledge into transformers. We assess these strategies in a single-label multi-class classification task involving scientific papers. For this, we develop a public benchmark based on 12k scientific papers from the AIDA knowledge graph, categorized into three fields. We utilize the Computer Science Ontology as our external knowledge source. Our findings indicate that most proposed knowledge injection techniques outperform the BERT baseline.",
