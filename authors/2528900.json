            "title": "Federated Experiment Design under Distributed Differential Privacy",
            "abstract": "Experiment design has a rich history dating back over a century and has found many critical applications across various fields since then. The use and collection of users' data in experiments often involve sensitive personal information, so additional measures to protect individual privacy are required during data collection, storage, and usage. In this work, we focus on the rigorous protection of users' privacy (under the notion of differential privacy (DP)) while minimizing the trust toward service providers. Specifically, we consider the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) under DP, while only allowing the analyst to collect population-level statistics via secure aggregation, a distributed protocol enabling a service provider to aggregate information without accessing individual data. Although a vital component in modern A/B testing workflows, private distributed experimentation has not previously been studied. To achieve DP, we design local privatization mechanisms that are compatible with secure aggregation and analyze the utility, in terms of the width of confidence intervals, both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. We show how these mechanisms can be scaled up to handle the very large number of participants commonly found in practice. In addition, when introducing DP noise, it is imperative to cleverly split privacy budgets to estimate both the mean and variance of the outcomes and carefully calibrate the confidence intervals according to the DP noise. Last, we present comprehensive experimental evaluations of our proposed schemes and show the privacy-utility trade-offs in experiment design.",

            "abstract": "Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has received extensive attention in the domain of computer vision, leading to development of promising approaches such as FixMatch. In scenarios where training data is decentralized and resides on client devices, SSL must be integrated with privacy-aware training techniques such as Federated Learning. We consider the problem of federated image classi\ufb01cation and study the performance and privacy challenges with existing federated SSL (FSSL) approaches. Firstly, we note that even state-of-the-art FSSL algorithms can trivially compromise client privacy and other real-world constraints such as client statelessness and communication cost. Secondly, we observe that it is challenging to integrate EMA (Exponential Moving Average) updates into the federated setting, which comes at a trade-off between performance and communication cost. We propose a novel approach FedSwitch , that improves privacy as well as generalization performance through Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates. FedSwitch utilizes a federated semi-supervised teacher-student EMA framework with two features - local teacher adaptation and adaptive switching between teacher and student for pseudo-label generation . Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on federated image classi\ufb01cation, can be adapted to real-world constraints, and achieves good generalization performance with minimal communication cost overhead.",

            "abstract": "Federated Computation is an emerging area that seeks to provide stronger privacy for user data, by performing large scale, distributed computations where the data remains in the hands of users. Only the necessary summary information is shared, and additional security and privacy tools can be employed to provide strong guarantees of secrecy. The most prominent application of federated computation is in training machine learning models (federated learning), but many additional applications are emerging, more broadly relevant to data management and querying data. This tutorial gives an overview of federated computation models and algorithms. It includes an introduction to security and privacy techniques and guarantees, and shows how they can be applied to solve a variety of distributed computations providing statistics and insights to distributed data. It also discusses the issues that arise when implementing systems to support federated computation, and open problems for future research.",

            "abstract": "We consider the federated frequency estimation problem, where each user holds a private item $X_i$ from a size-$d$ domain and a server aims to estimate the empirical frequency (i.e., histogram) of $n$ items with $n \\ll d$. Without any security and privacy considerations, each user can communicate its item to the server by using $\\log d$ bits. A naive application of secure aggregation protocols would, however, require $d\\log n$ bits per user. Can we reduce the communication needed for secure aggregation, and does security come with a fundamental cost in communication? In this paper, we develop an information-theoretic model for secure aggregation that allows us to characterize the fundamental cost of security and privacy in terms of communication. We show that with security (and without privacy) $\\Omega\\left( n \\log d \\right)$ bits per user are necessary and sufficient to allow the server to compute the frequency distribution. This is significantly smaller than the $d\\log n$ bits per user needed by the naive scheme, but significantly higher than the $\\log d$ bits per user needed without security. To achieve differential privacy, we construct a linear scheme based on a noisy sketch which locally perturbs the data and does not require a trusted server (a.k.a. distributed differential privacy). We analyze this scheme under $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ loss. By using our information-theoretic framework, we show that the scheme achieves the optimal accuracy-privacy trade-off with optimal communication cost, while matching the performance in the centralized case where data is stored in the central server.",

In this paper, we show how a strong $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee can be achieved for the fundamental problem of histogram generation in a federated setting, via a highly practical sampling-based procedure that does not add noise to disclosed data. Given the ubiquity of sampling in practice, we thus obtain a DP guarantee almost for free, avoid over-estimating histogram counts, and allow easy reasoning about how privacy guarantees may obscure minorities and outliers. Using such histograms, related problems such as heavy hitters and quantiles can be answered with provable error and privacy guarantees. Experimental results show that our sample-and-threshold approach is accurate and scalable.",

Opacus is designed for simplicity, flexibility, and speed. It provides a simple and user-friendly API, and enables machine learning practitioners to make a training pipeline private by adding as little as two lines to their code. It supports a wide variety of layers, including multi-head attention, convolution, LSTM, GRU (and generic RNN), and embedding, right out of the box and provides the means for supporting other user-defined layers. Opacus computes batched per-sample gradients, providing higher efficiency compared to the traditional\"micro batch\"approach. In this paper we present Opacus, detail the principles that drove its implementation and unique features, and benchmark it against other frameworks for training models with differential privacy as well as standard PyTorch.",

Second, we present a detailed definition of comprehension\u2014a \u201cTemplate of Understanding\u201d\u2014for a widely useful class of texts, namely short narratives.

People communicate and share content with each other via phones .now where does this content go ? right, in our phone's memory but what happens when you run out of space ? right, you use an external memory facility but what's next when the card is full and you don't have the luxury of a laptop around you and you just can't delete all the data you have in the name of memories .

Two problems limiting the success of collaboration in MOOCs are the lack of support for team formation and structured collaboration support. Lack of support and strategies for team formation prevents teams from being set up for success from the beginning. Lack of structured support during synchronous collaboration has been demonstrated to produce signi\ufb01cantly less learning than supported collaboration. This paper describes a deliberation based team formation approach and a scripted collaboration framework for MOOCs aimed at addressing these problems under the um-brella of DANCE 1 whose overarching focus is the enhancement of team-based MOOCs.
