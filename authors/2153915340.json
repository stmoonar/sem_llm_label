            "title": "Leveraging GPT-4 for Food Effect Summarization to Enhance Product-Specific Guidance Development via Iterative Prompting",
            "abstract": "Food effect summarization from New Drug Application (NDA) is an essential component of product-specific guidance (PSG) development and assessment, which provides the basis of recommendations for fasting and fed bioequivalence studies to guide the pharmaceutical industry for developing generic drug products. However, manual summarization of food effect from extensive drug application review documents is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop automated methods to generate food effect summary. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have demonstrated great potential in improving the effectiveness of automated text summarization, but its ability with regard to the accuracy in summarizing food effect for PSG assessment remains unclear. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach,iterative prompting, which allows one to interact with ChatGPT or GPT-4 more effectively and efficiently through multi-turn interaction. Specifically, we propose a three-turn iterative prompting approach to food effect summarization in which the keyword-focused and length-controlled prompts are respectively provided in consecutive turns to refine the quality of the generated summary. We conduct a series of extensive evaluations, ranging from automated metrics to FDA professionals and even evaluation by GPT-4, on 100 NDA review documents selected over the past five years. We observe that the summary quality is progressively improved throughout the iterative prompting process. Moreover, we find that GPT-4 performs better than ChatGPT, as evaluated by FDA professionals (43% vs. 12%) and GPT-4 (64% vs. 35%). Importantly, all the FDA professionals unanimously rated that 85% of the summaries generated by GPT-4 are factually consistent with the golden reference summary, a finding further supported by GPT-4 rating of 72% consistency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a great potential for GPT-4 to draft food effect summaries that could be reviewed by FDA professionals, thereby improving the efficiency of the PSG assessment cycle and promoting generic drug product development.",

            "abstract": "Human prescription drug labeling contains a summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug and includes the Prescribing Information, FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guides, Patient Package Inserts and/or Instructions for Use), and/or carton and container labeling. Drug labeling contains critical information about drug products, such as pharmacokinetics and adverse events. Automatic information extraction from drug labels may facilitate finding the adverse reaction of the drugs or finding the interaction of one drug with another drug. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques, especially recently developed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), have exhibited exceptional merits in text-based information extraction. A common paradigm in training BERT is to pretrain the model on large unlabeled generic language corpora, so that the model learns the distribution of the words in the language, and then fine-tune on a downstream task. In this paper, first, we show the uniqueness of language used in drug labels, which therefore cannot be optimally handled by other BERT models. Then, we present the developed PharmBERT, which is a BERT model specifically pretrained on the drug labels (publicly available at Hugging Face). We demonstrate that our model outperforms the vanilla BERT, ClinicalBERT and BioBERT in multiple NLP tasks in the drug label domain. Moreover, how the domain-specific pretraining has contributed to the superior performance of PharmBERT is demonstrated by analyzing different layers of PharmBERT, and more insight into how it understands different linguistic aspects of the data is gained.",

Such class imbalance poses a major challenge for modern deep learning, even with the typical class-balanced approaches such as re-sampling and re-weighting. In this work, we introduced a simple training strategy, namely pre-finetuning, as a new intermediate training stage in between the pretrained model and finetuning. We leveraged the idea of data augmentation to learn an initial representation that better fits the imbalanced distribution of the domain task during the pre-finetuning stage. We tested our method on manually contrived imbalanced datasets (both two-class and multi-class) and the FDA drug labeling dataset for ADME (i",

            "abstract": "Towards the objectives of the UnitedStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generic drug science and research program, it is of vital importance in developing product-specific guidances (PSGs) with recommendations that can facilitate and guide generic product development. To generate a PSG, the assessor needs to retrieve supportive information about the drug product of interest, including from the drug labeling, which contain comprehensive information about drug products and instructions to physicians on how to use the products for treatment. Currently, although there are many drug labeling data resources, none of them including those developed by the FDA (e.g., Drugs@FDA) can cover all the FDA-approved drug products. Furthermore, these resources, housed in various locations, are often in forms that are not compatible or interoperable with each other. Therefore, there is a great demand for retrieving useful information from a large number of textual documents from different data resources to support an effective PSG development. To meet the needs, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline by integrating multiple disparate publicly available data resources to extract drug product information with minimal human intervention. We provided a case study for identifying food effect information to illustrate how a machine learning model is employed to achieve accurate paragraph labeling. We showed that the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is able to outperform the traditional machine learning techniques, setting a new state-of-the-art for labelling food effect paragraphs from drug labeling and approved drug products datasets.",
