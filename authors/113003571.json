            "title": "Fairlearn: A toolkit for assessing and improving fairness in AI",
            "abstract": "We introduce Fairlearn, an open source toolkit that empowers data scientists and developers to assess and improve the fairness of their AI systems. Fairlearn has two components: an interactive visualization dashboard and unfairness mitigation algorithms. These components are designed to help with navigating trade-offs between fairness and model performance. We emphasize that prioritizing fairness in AI systems is a sociotechnical challenge. Because there are many complex sources of unfairness\u2014some societal and some technical\u2014it is not possible to fully \u201cdebias\u201d a system or to guarantee fairness; the goal is to mitigate fairness-related harms as much as possible. As Fairlearn grows to include additional fairness metrics, unfairness mitigation algorithms, and visualization capabilities, we hope that it will be shaped by a diverse community of stakeholders, ranging from data scientists, developers, and business decision makers to the people whose lives may be affected by the predictions of AI systems.",
