            "abstract": "In this work we will show that language models with less than one billion parameters can be used to translate natural language to SPARQL queries after fine-tuning. Using three different datasets ranging from academic to real world, we identify prerequisites that the training data must fulfill in order for the training to be successful. The goal is to empower users of semantic web technology to use AI assistance with affordable commodity hardware, making them more resilient against external factors.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate RDF mapping language (RML) files in the RDF turtle format as a key step towards self-configuring RDF knowledge graph construction pipelines. Our case study involves mapping a subset of the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) in JSON format given a target Movie ontology (selection of DBpedia Ontology OWL statements). We define and compute several scores to assess both the generated mapping files and the resulting graph using a manually created reference. Our findings demonstrate the promising potential of the state-of-the-art commercial LLMs in a zero-shot scenario.",

            "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offers significant synergistic potential for knowledge-driven applications. One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach. We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion. With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.",

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at a rapid pace, with significant improvements at natural language processing and coding tasks. Yet, their ability to work with formal languages representing data, specifically within the realm of knowledge graph engineering, remains under-investigated. To evaluate the proficiency of various LLMs, we created a set of five tasks that probe their ability to parse, understand, analyze, and create knowledge graphs serialized in Turtle syntax. These tasks, each embodying distinct degrees of complexity and being able to scale with the size of the problem, have been integrated into our automated evaluation system, the LLM-KG-Bench. The evaluation encompassed four commercially available LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 1.3, and Claude 2.0, as well as two freely accessible offline models, GPT4All Vicuna and GPT4All Falcon 13B. This analysis offers an in-depth understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of LLMs in relation to their application within RDF knowledge graph engineering workflows utilizing Turtle representation. While our findings show that the latest commercial models outperform their forerunners in terms of proficiency with the Turtle language, they also reveal an apparent weakness. These models fall short when it comes to adhering strictly to the output formatting constraints, a crucial requirement in this context.",

We introduce a benchmarking framework focused on knowledge graph engineering (KGE) accompanied by three challenges addressing syntax and error correction, facts extraction and dataset generation. We show that while being a useful tool, LLMs are yet unfit to assist in knowledge graph generation with zero-shot prompting. Consequently, our LLM-KG-Bench framework provides automatic evaluation and storage of LLM responses as well as statistical data and visualization tools to support tracking of prompt engineering and model performance.",

Unlike the traditional web, Linked Data lacks a driving infrastructure to enhance accessibility, leading to negative impacts on data consumers, adoption, and the creation of large-scale infrastructures. We investigate challenges posed by issues such as link rot, unparseable content, downtime, and timeouts that hinder effective access to Linked Data. The study involves a novel Linked Data client that logs debugging information, providing insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of accessing Linked Data. The research also includes discussions on the methods and approach taken, IRI identity mismatch handling, crawling results, and Linked Data parsing statistics. Through extensive analysis of HTTP response status codes and accessibility issues, the paper quantifies common problems but also proposes methods for enhancing Linked Data accessibility in order to retrieve consistent sub-graphs from the Data Web.",

The highly connected decentral Web of Ontologies represents the backbone for semantic data and the Linked Open Data Cloud and provides terminological context information crucial for the usage and interpretation of the data, which in turn is key for the reproducibility of research results making use of it. In this paper, we identify, analyze, and quantify reproducibility issues related to capturing terminological context (e.g. caused by unavailable ontologies) and delineate the impact on the reproducibility crisis in the Linked Open Data Cloud. Our examinations are backed by a frequent and ongoing monitoring of online available vocabularies and ontologies that results in the DBpedia Archivo dataset. We also show the extent to which the reproducibility crisis can be countered with the aid of ontology archiving in DBpedia Archivo and the Linked Open Vocabularies platforms.",

This paper addresses one of the largest and most complex data curation work\ufb02ows in existence: Wikipedia and Wikidata, with a high number of users and curators adding factual information from exter-nal sources via a non-systematic Wiki work\ufb02ow to Wikipedia\u2019s infoboxes and Wikidata items. We present high-level analyses of the current state, the challenges and limitations in this work\ufb02ow and supplement it with a quantitative and semantic analysis of the resulting data spaces by deploying DBpedia\u2019s integration and extraction capabilities. Based on an analysis of millions of references from Wikipedia infoboxes in di\ufb00erent languages, we can \ufb01nd the most important sources which can be used to enrich other knowledge bases with information of better quality. An initial tool is presented, the GlobalFactSync browser, as a prototype to discuss further measures to develop a more systematic approach for data curation in the WikiVerse.",

FAIR publishing and retrieval of Linked Data is still rather a FAIRytale than reality, for users and machines. In this paper, we give an overview on four major approaches that tackle individual challenges of FAIR data and present our vision of a FAIR Linked Data backbone. We propose 1) DBpedia Databus - a flexible, heavily automatable dataset management and publishing platform based on DataID metadata; that is extended by 2) the novel Databus Mods architecture which allows for flexible, unified, community-specific metadata extensions and (search/annotation) overlay systems; 3) DBpedia Archivo an archiving solution for unified handling and improvement of FAIRness for ontologies on publisher and consumer side; as well as 4) the DBpedia Global ID management and lookup services to cluster and discover equivalent entities and properties",
