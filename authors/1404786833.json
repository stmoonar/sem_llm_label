            "title": "Novel Approach for Curbing Unfair Energy Consumption and Biased Model in Federated Edge Learning",
            "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have recently shown interest in deploying federated learning for enhanced privacy preservation in wireless edge networks. In such settings, resource-constrained user equipment (UE) often experiences unfair energy consumption and performance degradation of machine learning models due to data heterogeneity and constrained computation and communication resources. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to reduce energy consumption, including scheduling a subset of UEs to undertake learning tasks based on their energy budgets. However, these approaches are inherently unfair as the frequently selected UEs rapidly deplete their energy and are rendered inaccessible. Furthermore, the server may be unable to capture the incongruent data distribution, resulting in a biased model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that addresses those challenges, considering the historical participation of the UEs to ensure that all the training data of the UEs are incorporated into the global model. Specifically, using Jain\u2019s fairness index, we formulate the overall optimization problem, decompose it into two sub-problems, and iteratively solve the sub-problems. Towards this end, we partition the optimization variables into two-blocks; one on the server-side and another on the UEs\u2019 side. The server-side algorithm aims to balance energy usage and learning performance, while the client-side algorithm seeks to optimize CPU frequency and transmit power. Extensive experiments using two realistic datasets, FEMNIST and CIFAR-10, indicate that the proposed algorithms minimize overall energy while curbing unfair energy consumption between the UEs, accelerating convergence rates, and significantly enhancing local accuracy for all UEs.",

Our approach tackles complexities in hierarchical wireless networks by clustering clients based on data distribution similarities and assigning specialized models to each cluster. These complexities include slower convergence and mismatched model allocation due to hierarchical model aggregation and client selection. The proposed framework features a two-phase client selection and a two-level model aggregation scheme. It ensures fairness and effective participation using greedy and round-robin methods.

            "abstract": "Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks are considered to provide effective and efficient solutions for disaster management. However, the limited size of end-user devices comes with the limitation of battery lives and computational capacities. Therefore, offloading, energy consumption, and computational efficiency are significant challenges for uninterrupted communication in UAV-assisted MEC networks. This article considers a UAV-assisted MEC network with energy harvesting (EH). To achieve this, we mathematically formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to maximize the computational efficiency of UAV-assisted MEC networks with EH under disaster situations. A power-splitting architecture splits the source power for communication and EH. We jointly optimize user association, transmission power of user equipment (UE), task offloading time, and UAV\u2019s optimal location. To solve this optimization problem, we divide it into three stages. In the first stage, we adopt $k$ -means clustering to determine the optimal locations of the UAVs. In the second stage, we determine user association. In the third stage, we determine the optimal power of UE and offloading time using the optimal UAV location from the first stage and the user association indicator from the second stage, followed by linearization and the use of the interior-point method to solve the resulting linear optimization problem. Simulation results for offloading, no-offloading, offloading-EH, and no-offloading-EH scenarios are presented with a varying number of UAVs and UEs. The results show the proposed EH solution\u2019s effectiveness in offloading scenarios compared to no-offloading scenarios in terms of computational efficiency, bits computed, and energy consumption.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in emergency-response applications, including wireless power transfer (WPT) and data collection from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in disaster-affected areas. UAVs are more attractive than traditional techniques due to their maneuverability, flexibility, and low deployment costs. However, using UAVs for such critical tasks comes with challenges, including limited resources, energy constraints, and the need to complete missions within strict time frames. IoT devices in disaster areas have limited resources (e.g., computation, energy), so they depend on the UAVs\u2019 resources to accomplish vital missions. To address these resource problems in a disaster scenario, we propose a meta-reinforcement learning (RL)-based energy harvesting (EH) framework. Our system model considers a swarm of UAVs that navigate an area, providing wireless power and collecting data from IoT devices on the ground. The primary objective is to enhance the quality of service for strategic locations while allowing UAVs to dynamically join and leave the swarm (e.g., for recharging). In this context, we formulate the problem as a non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem aimed at maximizing the total EH IoT devices and determining the optimal trajectory paths for UAVs while adhering to the constraints related to the maximum time duration, the UAVs\u2019 maximum energy consumption, and the minimum data rate to achieve a reliable transmission. Due to the complexity of the problem, the combinatorial nature of the formulated problem, and the difficulty of obtaining the optimal solution using conventional optimization problems, we propose a lightweight meta-RL solution capable of solving the problem by learning the system dynamics. We conducted extensive simulations and compared our approach with two state-of-the-art models using traditional RL algorithms represented by a deep Q-network algorithm, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and one greedy solution. Our simulation results show that the proposed Meta-RL algorithm can outperform the IoT EH of the DQN, PSO algorithm, and the greedy solution by 25%, 32%, and 45%, respectively. The results of our simulations also demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the competitive solutions in terms of efficiently covering strategic locations with a high satisfaction rate and high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates robust defenses against sophisticated cyber threats. A significant challenge arises when EVs intentionally provide false information to gain higher charging priority, potentially causing grid instability. While various approaches have been proposed in existing literature to address this issue, they often overlook the possibility of attackers using advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or other complex deep learning methods to achieve such attacks. In response to this, this paper introduces a hierarchical adversarial framework using DRL (HADRL), which effectively detects stealthy cyberattacks on EV charging stations, especially those leading to denial of charging. Our approach includes a dual approach, where the first scheme leverages DRL to develop advanced and stealthy attack methods that can bypass basic intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we implement a DRL-based scheme within the IDS at EV charging stations, aiming to detect and counter these sophisticated attacks. This scheme is trained with datasets created from the first scheme, resulting in a robust and efficient IDS. We evaluated the effectiveness of our framework against the recent literature approaches, and the results show that our IDS can accurately detect deceptive EVs with a low false alarm rate, even when confronted with attacks not represented in the training dataset.",

However, this promise cannot be realized as long as apprehensions regarding the discretion of confidential data are satisfied among the masses. In an attempt to secure the confidence of users, the notion of informed consent is taken to new echelons in this article.

            "abstract": "Edge-enabled Industrial Internet of Things (E-IIoT) has gained massive attention as a new type of IIoT for hosting emerging low-latency applications. However, due to device variations and complex communication environments, the edge servers and channel information are usually uncertain which poses significant challenges to the computational capacities in practical E-IIoT networks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a risk-sensitive task offloading scheme for the practical E-IIoT networks. Firstly, a distributed robust offloading optimization problem is formulated by jointly considering the high latency risks caused by network uncertainty and the average latency of the system. Then, by characterizing the latency risk as the conditional value, the formulated problem is transformed into a distributed robust mean conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) optimization problem. Further, we use a fuzzy set to capture the uncertainty of the first and second-order statistical information of the system to overcome the computational difficulties of the problem, and a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method is employed to transform the mean-CVaR optimization problem into a computable semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. Finally, an improved DRO-based task offloading algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal decision under uncertain E-IIoT networks. The simulation results show that the proposed offloading scheme not only improves the reliability in computation but also reduces the high latency risks. Therefore, our proposed model is more suitable for practical E-IIoT networks.",

            "abstract": "Clustered Federated Multi-task Learning (CFL) has gained considerable attention as an effective strategy for over-coming statistical challenges, particularly when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across multiple users. However, much of the existing research on CFL operates under the unrealistic premise that devices have access to accurate ground-truth labels. This assumption becomes especially problematic in, especially hierarchical wireless networks (HWNs), where edge networks contain a large amount of unlabeled data, resulting in slower convergence rates and increased processing times-particularly when dealing with two layers of model aggregation. To address these issues, we introduce a novel frame-work-Clustered Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (CFSL), designed for more realistic HWN scenarios. Our approach leverages a best-performing specialized model algorithm, wherein each device is assigned a specialized model that is highly adept at generating accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, even when the data stems from diverse environments. We validate the efficacy of CFSL through extensive experiments, comparing it with existing methods highlighted in recent literature. Our numerical results demonstrate that CFSL significantly improves upon key metrics such as testing accuracy, labeling accuracy, and labeling latency under varying proportions of labeled and unlabeled data while also accommodating the non-IID nature of the data and the unique characteristics of wireless edge networks.",
