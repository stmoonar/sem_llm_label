            "title": "Look before You Leap: Dual Logical Verification for Knowledge-based Visual Question Generation",
            "abstract": "Knowledge-based Visual Question Generation aims to generate visual questions with outside knowledge other than the image. Existing approaches are answer-aware, which incorporate answers into the question-generation process. However, these methods just focus on leveraging the semantics of inputs to propose questions, ignoring the logical coherence among generated questions (Q), images (V), answers (A), and corresponding acquired outside knowledge (K). It results in generating many non-expected questions with low quality, lacking insight and diversity, and some of them are even without any corresponding answer. To address this issue, we inject logical verification into the processes of knowledge acquisition and question generation, which is defined as LV\u02c62-Net. Through checking the logical structure among V, A, K, ground-truth and generated Q twice in the whole KB-VQG procedure, LV\u02c62-Net can propose diverse and insightful knowledge-based visual questions. And experimental results on two commonly used datasets demonstrate the superiority of LV\u02c62-Net. Our code will be released to the public soon.",

            "title": "AoM: Detecting Aspect-oriented Information for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis",
            "abstract": "Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to extract aspects from text-image pairs and recognize their sentiments. Existing methods make great efforts to align the whole image to corresponding aspects. However, different regions of the image may relate to different aspects in the same sentence, and coarsely establishing image-aspect alignment will introduce noise to aspect-based sentiment analysis (i.e., visual noise). Besides, the sentiment of a specific aspect can also be interfered by descriptions of other aspects (i.e., textual noise). Considering the aforementioned noises, this paper proposes an Aspect-oriented Method (AoM) to detect aspect-relevant semantic and sentiment information. Specifically, an aspect-aware attention module is designed to simultaneously select textual tokens and image blocks that are semantically related to the aspects. To accurately aggregate sentiment information, we explicitly introduce sentiment embedding into AoM, and use a graph convolutional network to model the vision-text and text-text interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AoM to existing methods. The source code is publicly released at https://github.com/SilyRab/AoM.",

            "abstract": "Fuzzing is a popular way to look for vulnerabilities. But it takes a long time to test because fuzzing is based on generating massive random inputs. Therefore, we introduce a novel system IfCut (If Branch Cutting Based Fuzzing System). First, IfCut can split the complex source code into several new programs with the If-Else Branch Cutting Module; as a result, the execution paths of a single fuzzy test object are simplified. Then Constraints Satisfies Test Cases Generating Module are used to generate initial input of a fuzzy tool named AFL. Finally, AFL fuzz the new programs in parallel. With If Branch Cutting Module and Constraints Satisfies Test Cases Generating Module, the serial dependence among producing fuzzing inputs decreases. Generally, IfCut can speed up improving code coverage rate, thus improve the efficiency of fuzzing. Also, we provide a website with visualized user interfaces to use the system directly without local configuration.",
