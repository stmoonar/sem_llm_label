            "title": "Recommendation Fairness in Social Networks Over Time",
            "abstract": "In social recommender systems, it is crucial that the recommendation models provide equitable visibility for different demographic groups, such as gender or race. Most existing research has addressed this problem by only studying individual static snapshots of networks that typically change over time. To address this gap, we study the evolution of recommendation fairness over time and its relation to dynamic network properties. We examine three real-world dynamic networks by evaluating the fairness of six recommendation algorithms and analyzing the association between fairness and network properties over time. We further study how interventions on network properties influence fairness by examining counterfactual scenarios with alternative evolution outcomes and differing network properties. Our results on empirical datasets suggest that recommendation fairness improves over time, regardless of the recommendation method. We also find that two network properties, minority ratio, and homophily ratio, exhibit stable correlations with fairness over time. Our counterfactual study further suggests that an extreme homophily ratio potentially contributes to unfair recommendations even with a balanced minority ratio. Our work provides insights into the evolution of fairness within dynamic networks in social science. We believe that our findings will help system operators and policymakers to better comprehend the implications of temporal changes and interventions targeting fairness in social networks.",

            "abstract": "Hawkes processes with exponential kernels are a ubiquitous tool for modeling and predicting event times. However, estimating their decay parameter is challenging, and there is a remarkable variability among decay parameter estimates. Moreover, this variability increases substantially in cases of a small number of realizations of the process or due to sudden changes to a system under study, for example, in the presence of exogenous shocks. In this work, we demonstrate that these estimation difficulties relate to the noisy, non-convex shape of the Hawkes process\u2019 log-likelihood as a function of the decay. To address uncertainty in the estimates, we propose to use a Bayesian approach to learn more about likely decay values. We show that our approach alleviates the decay estimation problem across a range of experiments with synthetic and real-world data. With our work, we support researchers and practitioners in their applications of Hawkes processes in general and in their interpretation of Hawkes process parameters in particular.",

            "abstract": "We present evidence for the existence and effectiveness of adversarial attacks on graph neural networks (GNNs) that aim to degrade fairness. These attacks can disadvantage a particular subgroup of nodes in GNN-based node classification, where nodes of the underlying network have sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. We conduct qualitative and experimental analyses explaining how adversarial link injection impairs the fairness of GNN predictions. For example, an attacker can compromise the fairness of GNN-based node classification by injecting adversarial links between nodes belonging to opposite subgroups and opposite class labels. Our experiments on empirical datasets demonstrate that adversarial fairness attacks can significantly degrade the fairness of GNN predictions (attacks are effective) with a low perturbation rate (attacks are efficient) and without a significant drop in accuracy (attacks are deceptive). This work demonstrates the vulnerability of GNN models to adversarial fairness attacks. We hope our findings raise awareness about this issue in our community and lay a foundation for the future development of GNN models that are more robust to such attacks.",

            "abstract": "In contrast to basic items such as movies, books, and songs, configurable items consist of individual subcomponents that can be combined following a predefined set of constraints. Due to the increasing size and complexity of configurable items (e.g., cars and software), a simple enumeration of all possible configurations in terms of a product catalog is not possible. Configuration systems try to identify a solution (configuration) that takes into account both, the preferences of the user and a set of constraints that defines in which way individual subcomponents are allowed to be combined. Due to time limitations, cognitive overloads, and missing domain knowledge, configurator users are in many cases not able to completely specify their preferences with regard to all relevant component properties. As a consequence, recommendation technologies need to be integrated into configurators that are able to predict the relevance of individual components for the current user. In this paper, we show how the determination of configurations can be supported by neural network based recommendation. This approach helps to predict user-relevant item properties using historical interaction data. In this context, we introduce a semantic regularization approach that helps to take into account configuration constraints within the scope of neural network learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach on the basis of an evaluation in an industrial configuration scenario (high-voltage switchgear configuration).",

            "abstract": "Recent work has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on graph data. Common attack approaches are typically informed, i.e. they have access to information about node attributes such as labels and feature vectors. In this work, we study adversarial attacks that are uninformed, where an attacker only has access to the graph structure, but no information about node attributes. Here the attacker aims to exploit structural knowledge and assumptions, which GNN models make about graph data. In particular, literature has shown that structural node centrality and similarity have a strong influence on learning with GNNs. Therefore, we study the impact of centrality and similarity on adversarial attacks on GNNs. We demonstrate that attackers can exploit this information to decrease the performance of GNNs by focusing on injecting links between nodes of low similarity and, surprisingly, low centrality. We show that structure-based uninformed attacks can approach the performance of informed attacks, while being computationally more efficient. With our paper, we present a new attack strategy on GNNs that we refer to as Structack. Structack can successfully manipulate the performance of GNNs with very limited information while operating under tight computational constraints. Our work contributes towards building more robust machine learning approaches on graphs.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been applied to improve numerous processes, such as inventory management in retail stores. However, automatic localization of RFID-tagged goods in stores is still a challenging problem. To address this issue, we equip fixtures (e.g., shelves) with reference tags and use data we collect during RFID-based stocktakes to map articles to fixtures. Knowing the location of goods enables the implementation of several practical applications, such as automated Money Mapping (i.e., a heat map of sales across fixtures). Specifically, we conduct controlled lab experiments and a case-study in two fashion retail stores to evaluate our article-to-fixture prediction approaches. The approaches are based on calculating distances between read event time series using DTW, and clustering of read events using DBSCAN. We find that, read events collected during RFID-based stocktakes can be used to assign articles to fixtures with an accuracy of more than 90%. Additionally, we conduct a pilot to investigate the challenges related to the integration of such a localization system in the day-to-day business of retail stores. Hence, in this paper we present an exploratory venture into novel and practical RFID-based applications in fashion retails stores, beyond the scope of stock management.",

            "abstract": "As a tool for capturing irregular temporal dependencies (rather than resorting to binning temporal observations to construct time series), Hawkes processes with exponential decay have seen widespread adoption across many application domains, such as predicting the occurrence time of the next earthquake or stock market spike. However, practical applications of Hawkes processes face a noteworthy challenge: There is substantial and often unquantified variance in decay parameter estimations, especially in the case of a small number of observations or when the dynamics behind the observed data suddenly change. We empirically study the cause of these practical challenges and we develop an approach to surface and thereby mitigate them. In particular, our inspections of the Hawkes process likelihood function uncover the properties of the uncertainty when fitting the decay parameter. We thus propose to explicitly capture this uncertainty within a Bayesian framework. With a series of experiments with synthetic and real-world data from domains such as \u201cclassical\u201d earthquake modeling or the manifestation of collective emotions on Twitter, we demonstrate that our proposed approach helps to quantify uncertainty and thereby to understand and fit Hawkes processes in practice.",
