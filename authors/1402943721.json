            "title": "Identifying Shopping Intent in Product QA for Proactive Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart devices allowing users to instantly access information via voice questions. While extensive research has been conducted in question answering for voice search, little attention has been paid on how to enable proactive recommendations from a voice assistant to its users. This is a highly challenging problem that often leads to user friction, mainly due to recommendations provided to the users at the wrong time. We focus on the domain of e-commerce, namely in identifying Shopping Product Questions (SPQs), where the user asking a product-related question may have an underlying shopping need. Identifying a user's shopping need allows voice assistants to enhance shopping experience by determining when to provide recommendations, such as product or deal recommendations, or proactive shopping actions recommendation. Identifying SPQs is a challenging problem and cannot be done from question text alone, and thus requires to infer latent user behavior patterns inferred from user's past shopping history. We propose features that capture the user's latent shopping behavior from their purchase history, and combine them using a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach is able to identify SPQs with a high score of F1=0.91. Furthermore, based on an online evaluation with real voice assistant users, we identify SPQs in real-time and recommend shopping actions to users to add the queried product into their shopping list. We demonstrate that we are able to accurately identify SPQs, as indicated by the significantly higher rate of added products to users' shopping lists when being prompted after SPQs vs random PQs.",

            "abstract": "Being able to measure the success of online shopping interactions is crucial in order to evaluate and optimize the performance of e-commerce systems. It is especially challenging in the domain of voice shopping, typically supported by voice-based AI assistants. Unlike Web shopping, which offers a rich amount of behavioral signals such as clicks, in voice shopping a non-negligible amount of shopping interactions frequently ends without any immediate explicit or implicit user behavioral signal. Moreover, users may start their journey using a voice-enabled device, but complete it elsewhere, for example on their smartphone mobile app or a Web browser. We explore the challenge of measuring successful interactions in voice product search based on users\u2019 behavior, and propose a medium-term reward metric named Extended ConVersion (ECVR). ECVR extends the notion of conversion beyond the usual purchase action, which serves as an undisputed measure of success in e-commerce. More specifically, it also captures purchase actions that occur at a later stage during a same shopping journey, and possibly on different channel than the one on which the interaction started. In this paper, we formally define the ECVR metric, describe multiple ways of evaluating the quality of a metric, and use these to explore different parameters for ECVR. After selecting the most appropriate parameters, we show that a ranking system optimized for ECVR, set up with these parameters, leads to improvements in long-term engagement and revenue, without compromising immediate conversion gains.",

            "title": "External Evaluation of Ranking Models under Extreme Position-Bias",
            "abstract": "Implicit feedback from users behavior is a natural and scalable source for training and evaluating ranking models in human-interactive systems. However, inherent biases such as the position bias are key obstacles to its effective usage. This is further accentuated in cases of extreme bias, where behavioral feedback can be collected exclusively on the top ranked result. In fact, in such cases, state-of-art debiasing methods cannot be applied. A prominent use case of extreme position bias is the voice shopping medium, where only a small amount of information can be presented to the user during a single interaction, resulting in user behavioral signals that are almost exclusively limited to the top offer. There is no way to know how the user would have reacted to a different offer than the top one he was actually exposed to. Thus, any new ranker we wish to evaluate with respect to a behavioral metric, requires online experimentation. We propose a novel approach, based on anexternal estimator model, for accurately predicting offline the performance of a new ranker. The accuracy of our solution is proven theoretically, as well as demonstrated by a line of experiments. In these experiments, we focus on the use case of purchase prediction, and show that our estimator can accurately predict offline the purchase rate of different rankers over a segment of voice shopping traffic. Our prediction is validated online, as being compared to the actual performance obtained by each ranker when being exposed to users.",

            "abstract": "Virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Home, and Microsoft's Cortana, are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives and successfully help users in various daily tasks, such as making phone calls or playing music. Yet, they still struggle with playful utterances, which are not meant to be interpreted literally. Examples include jokes or absurd requests or questions such as,\"Are you afraid of the dark?\",\"Who let the dogs out?\", or\"Order a zillion gummy bears\". Today, virtual assistants often return irrelevant answers to such utterances, except for hard-coded ones addressed by canned replies. To address the challenge of automatically detecting playful utterances, we first characterize the different types of playful human-virtual assistant interaction. We introduce a taxonomy of playful requests rooted in theories of humor and refined by analyzing real-world traffic from Alexa. We then focus on one node, personification, where users refer to the virtual assistant as a person (\"What do you do for fun?\"). Our conjecture is that understanding such utterances will improve user experience with virtual assistants. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz user study and showed that endowing virtual assistant s with the ability to identify humorous opportunities indeed has the potential to increase user satisfaction. We hope this work will contribute to the understanding of the landscape of the problem and inspire novel ideas and techniques towards the vision of giving virtual assistants a sense of humor.",

            "abstract": "Learning a ranking model in product search involves satisfying many requirements such as maximizing the relevance of retrieved products with respect to the user query, as well as maximizing the purchase likelihood of these products. Multi-Objective Ranking Optimization (MORO) is the task of learning a ranking model from training examples while optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously. Label aggregation is a popular solution approach for multi-objective optimization, which reduces the problem into a single objective optimization problem, by aggregating the multiple labels of the training examples, related to the different objectives, to a single label. In this work we explore several label aggregation methods for MORO in product search. We propose a novel stochastic label aggregation method which randomly selects a label per training example according to a given distribution over the labels. We provide a theoretical proof showing that stochastic label aggregation is superior to alternative aggregation approaches, in the sense that any optimal solution of the MORO problem can be generated by a proper parameter setting of the stochastic aggregation process. We experiment on three different datasets: two from the voice product search domain, and one publicly available dataset from the Web product search domain. We demonstrate empirically over these three datasets that MORO with stochastic label aggregation provides a family of ranking models that fully dominates the set of MORO models built using deterministic label aggregation.",

Looking at users' behavior in product search, supported by a digital voice assistant, we have observed an interesting phenomenon where users purchase or engage with search results that are objectively judged irrelevant to their queries. In this work, we analyze and characterize this phenomenon. We provide several hypotheses as to the reasons behind it, including users' personalized preferences, the product's popularity, the product's indirect relation with the query, the user's tolerance level, the query intent, and the product price. We address each hypothesis by conducting thorough data analyses and offer some insights with respect to users' purchase and engagement behavior with seemingly irrelevant results. We conclude with a discussion on how this analysis can be used to improve voice product search services.",

Our solution builds on an advanced structural clustering technique previously presented by some of the authors of this work. The heart of our solution is an offline process that leverages the structural mail-specific characteristics of the clustering, and automatically creates extraction rules that are later applied online for each new arriving message. We provide of a full description of our process, which has been productized in Yahoo mail backend. We complete our work with large-scale experiments carried over real Yahoo mail traffic, and evaluate the performance of our automatic extraction method.",

            "abstract": "The constant growth of machine-generated mail, which today consists of more than 90% of non-spam mail traffic, is a major contributor toinformation overload in email, where users become overwhelmed with a flood of messages from commercial entities. A large part of this traffic is often junk mail that the user would prefer not to receive. Surprisingly, nearly 95% of this traffic is in fact solicited by the users themselves in the form of subscriptions to mailing services. These subscriptions are many times unintentional. Although unsubscription option from such services is enforced by commercial laws, it is hardly actually used by users. We perform a large scale study ofunsubscribable traffic, namely, messages that provide unsubscription option to users. We consider users behavior over such traffic in Yahoo Web mail service, and demonstrate a significant gap between users low interest in this traffic, and their lack of active behavior in decreasing its load. We conjecture that the cause of this gap is the lack of an efficient and easily accessible mechanism that would help users to unsubscribe. We validate our conjecture with an online large scale experiment, where we provide users with a novel mail feature for managing unsubscribable traffic, based on personalized recommendations. The experiment demonstrates the imminent need that exists for such a mechanism.",
