            "abstract": "Aiming at a better understanding of the search goals in the user search sessions, recent query recommender systems explicitly model the reformulations of queries, which hopes to estimate the intents behind these reformulations and thus benefit the next-query recommendation. However, in real-world e-commercial search scenarios, user intents are much more complicated and may evolve dynamically. Existing methods merely consider trivial reformulation intents from semantic aspects and fail to model dynamic reformulation intent flows in search sessions, leading to sub-optimal capacities to recommend desired queries. To deal with these limitations, we first explicitly define six types of query reformulation intents according to the desired products of two consecutive queries. We then apply two self-attentive encoders on top of two pre-trained large language models to learn the transition dynamics from semantic query and intent reformulation sequences, respectively. We develop an intent-aware query decoder to utilize the predicted intents for suggesting the next queries. We instantiate such a framework with an Intent-aware Variational AutoEncoder (IVAE) under deployment at Amazon. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world e-commercial datasets from Amazon and one public dataset from BestBuy. Specifically, IVAE improves the Recall@15 by 25.44% and 60.47% on two Amazon datasets and 13.91% on BestBuy, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "We study the problem of optimizing ranking metrics with unbiased and robust causal estimation for recommender systems. A user may click/purchase an item regardless of whether the item is recommended or not. Thus, it is important to estimate the causal effect of recommendation and rank items higher with a larger causal effect. However, most existing works focused on improving the accuracy of recommendations, which usually have large bias and variance. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a general and theoretically rigorous framework for causal recommender systems, which enables unbiased evaluation and learning for the ranking metrics with confounding bias. We first propose a robust estimator for unbiased ranking evaluation and theoretically show that this estimator has a smaller bias and variance. We then propose a deep variational information bottleneck (IB) approach to exploit the sufficiency of the propensity score for estimation adjustment and better generalization. We also provide the learning bound and develop an unbiased learning algorithm to optimize the causal metric. Results on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our evaluation and learning algorithms significantly outperform existing methods.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have made rapid developments in the recent years. Due to their great ability in modeling graph-structured data, GNNs are vastly used in various applications, including high-stakes scenarios such as financial analysis, traffic predictions, and drug discovery. Despite their great potential in benefiting humans in the real world, recent study shows that GNNs can leak private information, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, can inherit and magnify societal bias from training data and lack interpretability, which have risk of causing unintentional harm to the users and society. For example, existing works demonstrate that attackers can fool the GNNs to give the outcome they desire with unnoticeable perturbation on training graph. GNNs trained on social networks may embed the discrimination in their decision process, strengthening the undesirable societal bias. Consequently, trust-worthy GNNs in various aspects are emerging to prevent the harm from GNN models and increase the users\u2019 trust in GNNs. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of GNNs in the computational aspects of privacy, robustness, fairness, and explainability. For each aspect, we give the taxonomy of the related methods and formulate the general frameworks for the multiple categories of trustworthy GNNs. We also discuss the future research directions of each aspect and connections between these aspects to help achieve trustworthiness.",

            "abstract": "A software vulnerability could be exploited without any visible symptoms. When no source code is available, although such silent program executions could cause very serious damage, the general problem of analyzing silent yet harmful executions is still an open problem. In this work, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) assisted data flow analysis method for spotting silent buffer overflows in execution traces. The new method combines a novel graph structure (denoted DFG+) beyond data-flow graphs, a tool to extract {\\tt DFG+} from execution traces, and a modified Relational Graph Convolutional Network as the GNN model to be trained. The evaluation results show that a well-trained model can be used to analyze vulnerabilities in execution traces (of previously-unseen programs) without support of any source code. Our model achieves 94.39\\% accuracy on the test data and successfully locates 29 out of 30 real-world silent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Leveraging deep learning, the proposed method is, to our best knowledge, the first general-purpose analysis method for silent buffer overflows. It is also the first method to spot silent buffer overflows in global variables, stack variables, or heap variables without crossing the boundary of allocated chunks.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Social media provides a platform for seeking information from a large user base. Information seeking in social media, however, occurs simultaneously with users expressing their viewpoints by making statements. Rhetorical questions have the form of a question but serve the function of a statement and might mislead platforms assisting information seeking in social media. It becomes difficult to identify rhetorical questions as they are not syntactically different from other questions. In this paper, we develop a framework to identify rhetorical questions by modeling the motivations of the users to post them. We focus on one motivation of the users drawing from linguistic theories, to implicitly convey a message. We develop a framework from this motivation to identify rhetorical questions in social media and evaluate the framework using questions posted on Twitter. This is the first framework to model the motivations for posting rhetorical questions to identify them on social media platforms.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Many real-world applications, e.g., healthcare, present multi-variate time series prediction problems. In such settings, in addition to the predictive accuracy of the models, model transparency and explainability are paramount. We consider the problem of building explainable classifiers from multi-variate time series data. A key criterion to understand such predictive models involves elucidating and quantifying the contribution of time varying input variables to the classification. Hence, we introduce a novel, modular, convolution-based feature extraction and attention mechanism that simultaneously identifies the variables as well as time intervals which determine the classifier output. We present results of extensive experiments with several benchmark data sets that show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on multi-variate time series classification task. The results of our case studies demonstrate that the variables and time intervals identified by the proposed method make sense relative to available domain knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools in representation learning for graphs. However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to carefully-crafted perturbations, called adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks can easily fool GNNs in making predictions for downstream tasks. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised increasing concerns for applying GNNs in safety-critical applications. Therefore, developing robust algorithms to defend adversarial attacks is of great significance. A natural idea to defend adversarial attacks is to clean the perturbed graph. It is evident that real-world graphs share some intrinsic properties. For example, many real-world graphs are low-rank and sparse, and the features of two adjacent nodes tend to be similar. In fact, we find that adversarial attacks are likely to violate these graph properties. Therefore, in this paper, we explore these properties to defend adversarial attacks on graphs. In particular, we propose a general framework Pro-GNN, which can jointly learn a structural graph and a robust graph neural network model from the perturbed graph guided by these properties. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, even when the graph is heavily perturbed. We release the implementation of Pro-GNN to our DeepRobust repository for adversarial attacks and defenses. The specific experimental settings to reproduce our results can be found in https://github.com/ChandlerBang/Pro-GNN.",

            "title": "Investigating and Mitigating Degree-Related Biases in Graph Convoltuional Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) show promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs, thus become favorable comparing with other approaches. Despite the remarkable success of GCNs, it is difficult to train GCNs with insufficient supervision. When labeled data are limited, the performance of GCNs becomes unsatisfying for low-degree nodes. While some prior work analyze successes and failures of GCNs on the entire model level, profiling GCNs on individual node level is still underexplored. In this paper, we analyze GCNs in regard to the node degree distribution. From empirical observation to theoretical proof, we confirm that GCNs are biased towards nodes with larger degrees with higher accuracy on them, even if high-degree nodes are underrepresented in most graphs. We further develop a novel Self-Supervised-Learning Degree-Specific GCN (SL-DSGCN) that mitigate the degree-related biases of GCNs from model and data aspects. Firstly, we propose a degree-specific GCN layer that captures both discrepancies and similarities of nodes with different degrees, which reduces the inner model-aspect biases of GCNs caused by sharing the same parameters with all nodes. Secondly, we design a self-supervised-learning algorithm that creates pseudo labels with uncertainty scores on unlabeled nodes with a Bayesian neural network. Pseudo labels increase the chance of connecting to labeled neighbors for low-degree nodes, thus reducing the biases of GCNs from the data perspective. Uncertainty scores are further exploited to weight pseudo labels dynamically in the stochastic gradient descent for SL-DSGCN. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show SL-DSGCN not only outperforms state-of-the-art self-training/self-supervised-learning GCN methods, but also improves GCN accuracy dramatically for low-degree nodes.",
