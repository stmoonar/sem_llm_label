            "title": "Semantic Foundations of Seraph Continuous Graph Query Language",
            "abstract": "The scientific community has been studying graph data models for decades. Their high expressiveness and elasticity led the scientific community to design a variety of graph data models and graph query languages, and the practitioners to use them to model real-world cases and extract useful information. Recently, property graphs and, in particular, Cypher 9 (the first open version of the well-known Neo4j Inc.'s language) are gaining popularity. Practitioners find Cypher useful and applicable in many scenarios. However, we are living in a streaming world where data continuously flows. A growing number of Cypher's users show interest in continuously querying graph data to act in a timely fashion. Indeed, Cypher lacks the features for dealing with streams of (graph) data and continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, an extension of Cypher, as a first attempt to introduce streaming features in the context of property graph query languages. Specifically, we define Seraph semantics, we propose a first version of Seraph syntax, and we discuss the potential impacts from a user perspective.",

            "title": "Supporting an Expert-centric Process of New Product Introduction With Statistical Machine Learning",
            "abstract": "Industries that sell products with short-term or seasonal life cycles must regularly introduce new products. Forecasting the demand for New Product Introduction (NPI) can be challenging due to the fluctuations of many factors such as trend, seasonality, or other external and unpredictable phenomena (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). Traditionally, NPI is an expertcentric process. This paper presents a study on automating the forecast of NPI demands using statistical Machine Learning (namely, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost). We show how to overcome shortcomings of the traditional data preparation that underpins the manual process. Moreover, we illustrate the role of cross-validation techniques for the hyper-parameter tuning and the validation of the models. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that statistical Machine Learning can forecast NPI demand better than experts.",
