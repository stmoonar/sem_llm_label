            "abstract": "The explosive growth of end devices that generate massive amounts of data requires close-proximity computing resources for processing at the network\u2019s edge. Having geographic distributions and limited resources of edge nodes or servers opens several doors for attackers to exploit them primarily to the detriment of deployed services; one of the recent attacks is Very Short Intermittent Distributed Denial of Services (VSI-DDoS). Deep learning-based models have been developed to detect and mitigate such attacks but cause the degrading quality of models due to covariate shifts when deployed in real-world environments. Therefore, we propose a new approach, called MetaVSID, to detect VSI-DDoS attacks in edge clouds using meta-reinforcement learning followed by ensemble learning to increase the robustness of the model in detecting VSI-DDoS attacks early. The proposed model can capture dynamic patterns of VSI-DDoS attacks, from which it identifies manipulated services and increase service availability when covariate shifts at deployment time. We carry out extensive experiments to validate the MetaVSID using both testbed and benchmark datasets. Via the meta-reinforced downsampling process, the proposed method improves sample efficiency, leading to cost-effective policies. Moreover, the optimized policies are generalized to adapt to dynamic changes in the training distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that MetaVSID stably achieves better performance in multiple evaluation settings with the difference from baseline models from 1.5% to 7.5% in terms of AUC for both VSI-DDoS and DDoS detection, especially under covariate shift settings.",

            "abstract": "Accessibility of research data is critical for advances in many research fields, but textual data often cannot be shared due to the personal and sensitive information which it contains, e.g names or political opinions. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) suggests pseudonymization as a solution to secure open access to research data, but we need to learn more about pseudonymization as an approach before adopting it for manipulation of research data. This paper outlines a research agenda within pseudonymization, namely need of studies into the effects of pseudonymization on unstructured data in relation to e.g. readability and language assessment, as well as the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a way of protecting writer identity, while also exploring different ways of developing context-sensitive algorithms for detection, labelling and replacement of personal information in unstructured data. The recently granted project on pseudonymization \u2018Grandma Karl is 27 years old\u20191 addresses exactly those challenges.1.https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/projects/mormor-karl",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a vital part of our daily lives, enabling interconnectedness between various devices and systems. As the amount of data generated by IoT devices and systems continues to increase immensely, privacy and security concerns have emerged as a significant challenge for researchers and enterprises. Although we are aware of how much data IoT devices will generate per day, there is a lack of knowledge of how the collected data will be used. The privacy risks associated with data collection raise individual concerns in the IoT ecosystem. For instance, when sensitive personal information is exposed due to weak security practices, it can result in identity theft, financial fraud, or other types of cybercrime. The misuse of IoT devices also puts someone susceptible to physical risks, such as a compromised medical device leading to health complications. In this paper, we introduce the definition of the next-gen IoT Ecosystem and its relations to Big Data as well as investigate privacy and security risks associated with IoT ecosystems, identify the gaps in current privacy and security practices, and present technical solutions to tackle these problems. We aim to identify challenges and raise awareness about developing secure and privacy-preserving IoT systems in the era of Big Data.",

Nevertheless, existing methods are susceptible to covariate shifts due to background noises, human voice variations, and data selection biases leading to severe performance degradation in real-world scenarios. Hence, we propose a non-invasive framework that contrastively learns personalization from sound waves as a pre-train and predicts latent-spaced profile features through semi-supervised learning. It allows all subjects from various distributions (e.g., regionality, gender, age) to benefit from personalized predictions for robust voice pathology in a privacy-fulfilled manner. We extensively evaluate the framework on four real-world respiratory illnesses datasets, including Coswara, COUGHVID, ICBHI, and our private dataset - ASound under multiple covariate shift settings (i.e., cross-dataset), improving up to 4.12% in overall performance.",

            "title": "Optimized and Adaptive Federated Learning for Straggler-Resilient Device Selection",
            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has evolved as a promising distributed learning paradigm in which data samples are disseminated over massively connected devices in an IID (Identical and Independent Distribution) or non-IID manner. FL follows a collaborative training approach where each device uses local training data to train local models, and the server generates a global model by combining the local model's parameters. However, FL is vulnerable to system heterogeneity when local devices have varying computational, storage, and communication capabilities over time. The presence of stragglers or low-performing devices in the learning process severely impacts the scalability of FL algorithms and significantly delays convergence. To mitigate this problem, we propose Fed-MOODS, a Multi-Objective Optimization-based Device Selection approach to reduce the effect of stragglers in the FL process. The primary criteria for optimization are to maximize: (i) the availability of the processing capacity of each device, (ii) the availability of the memory in devices, and (iii) the bandwidth capacity of the participating devices. The multi-objective optimization prioritizes devices from fast to slow. The approach involves faster devices in early global rounds and gradually incorporating slower devices from the Pareto fronts to improve the model's accuracy. The overall training time of Fed-MOODS is 1.8\u00d7 and 1.48\u00d7 faster than the baseline model (FedAvg) with random device selection for MNIST and FMNIST non-IID data, respectively. Fed-MOODS is extensively evaluated under multiple experimental settings, and the results show that Fed-MOODS has significantly improved model's convergence and performance. Fed-MOODS maintains fairness in the prioritized participation of devices and the model for both IID and non-IID settings.",

            "abstract": "Edge-driven software applications often deployed as online services in the cloud-to-edge continuum lack significant protection for services and infrastructures against emerging cyberattacks. Very-Short Intermittent Distributed Denial of Service (VSI-DDoS) attack is one of the biggest factors for diminishing the Quality of Services (QoS) and Quality of Experiences (QoE) for users on edge. Unlike conventional DDoS attacks, these attacks live for a very short time (on the order of a few milliseconds) in the traffic to deceive users with a legitimate service experience. To provide protection, we propose a novel and efficient approach for detecting VSI-DDoS attacks using reinforced transformer learning that mitigates the tail latency and service availability problems in edge clouds. In the presence of attacks, the users\u2019 demand for availing ultra-low latency and high throughput services deployed on the edge, can never be met. Moreover, these attacks send very-short intermittent requests towards the target services that enforce longer delays in users\u2019 responses. The assimilation of transformer with deep reinforcement learning accelerates detection performance under adverse conditions by adapting the dynamic and the most discernible patterns of attacks (e.g., multiplicative temporal dependency, attack dynamism). The extensive experiments with testbed and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable, effective, and efficient for detecting VSI-DDoS attacks in edge clouds. The results outperform state-of-the-art methods with $0.9\\%-3.2\\%$ higher accuracy in both datasets.",

We motivate this setting with an application in contextual programmatic advertising, a type of content placement on news pages that does not exploit personal information about visitors but relies on the availability of a high-quality clustering computed on the basis of a small number of labeled samples. To enable text clustering with little training data, Cformer leverages the teacher-student architecture of Meta Pseudo Labels. In addition to unlabeled data, Cformer uses a small amount of labeled data to describe the clusters aimed at. Our experimental results confirm that the performance of the proposed model improves the state-of-the-art if a reasonable amount of labeled data is available. The models are comparatively small and suitable for deployment in constrained environments with limited computing resources. The source code is available at https://github.com/Aha6988/Cformer",
