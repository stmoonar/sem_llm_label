            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in their ability to interact proficiently with humans. Subsequently, their potential use as artificial confederates and surrogates in sociological experiments involving conversation is an exciting prospect. But how viable is this idea? This paper endeavors to test the limits of current-day LLMs with a pre-registered study integrating real people with LLM agents acting as people. The study focuses on debate-based opinion consensus formation in three environments: humans only, agents and humans, and agents only. Our goal is to understand how LLM agents influence humans, and how capable they are in debating like humans. We find that LLMs can blend in and facilitate human productivity but are less convincing in debate, with their behavior ultimately deviating from human's. We elucidate these primary failings and anticipate that LLMs must evolve further before being viable debaters.",

            "title": "Dynamics of Ideological Biases of Social Media Users",
            "abstract": "Humanity for centuries has perfected skills of interpersonal interactions and evolved patterns that enable people to detect lies and deceiving behavior of others in face-to-face settings. Unprecedented growth of people's access to mobile phones and social media raises an important question: How does this new technology influence people's interactions and support the use of traditional patterns? In this article, we answer this question for homophily-driven patterns in social media. In our previous studies, we found that, on a university campus, changes in student opinions were driven by the desire to hold popular opinions. Here, we demonstrate that the evolution of online platform-wide opinion groups is driven by the same desire. We focus on two social media: Twitter and Parler, on which we tracked the political biases of their users. On Parler, an initially stable group of Right-biased users evolved into a permanent Right-leaning echo chamber dominating weaker, transient groups of members with opposing political biases. In contrast, on Twitter, the initial presence of two large opposing bias groups led to the evolution of a bimodal bias distribution, with a high degree of polarization. We capture the movement of users from the initial to final bias groups during the tracking period. We also show that user choices are influenced by side-effects of homophily. Users entering the platform attempt to find a sufficiently large group whose members hold political biases within the range sufficiently close to their own. If successful, they stabilize their biases and become permanent members of the group. Otherwise, they leave the platform. We believe that the dynamics of users' behavior uncovered in this article create a foundation for technical solutions supporting social groups on social media and socially aware networks.",

            "abstract": "In social sciences, simulating opinion dynamics to study the ways in which the interplay between homophily and influence leads to the formation of echo chambers is of great importance. Given the wide variety of empirical systems involving the grouping of communities based upon local attribute consensus, simulating and analyzing such dynamics is highly relevant in many other fields as well. As such, in this paper we investigate echo chambers by implementing a unique social game in which we spawn in a large number of agents, each assigned one of the two opinions on an issue and a finite amount of influence in the form of a game currency. Agents attempt to have an opinion that is a majority at the end of the game, to obtain a reward also paid in the game currency. At the beginning of each round, a randomly selected agent is selected, referred to as a speaker. The second agent is selected in the radius of speaker influence (which is a set subset of the speaker\u2019s neighbors) to interact with the speaker as a listener. In this interaction, the speaker proposes a payoff in the game currency from their personal influence budget to persuade the listener to hold the speaker\u2019s opinion in future rounds until chosen listener again. The listener can either choose to accept or reject this payoff to hold the speaker\u2019s opinion for future rounds. The listener\u2019s choice is informed only by their estimate of global majority opinion through a limited view of the opinions of their neighboring agents. We show that the influence game leads to the formation of \u201decho chambers,\u201d or homogeneous clusters of opinions. We also investigate various scenarios to disrupt the creation of such echo chambers, including the introduction of resource disparity between agents with different opinions, initially preferentially assigning opinions to agents, and the introduction of committed agents, who never change their initial opinion.",

            "abstract": "Relationships between people constantly evolve, altering interpersonal behavior and defining social groups. Relationships between nodes in social networks can be represented by a tie strength, often empirically assessed using surveys. While this is effective for taking static snapshots of relationships, such methods are difficult to scale to dynamic networks. In this paper, we propose a system that allows for the continuous approximation of relationships as they evolve over time. We evaluate this system using the NetSense study, which provides comprehensive communication records of students at the University of Notre Dame over the course of four years. These records are complemented by semesterly ego network surveys, which provide discrete samples over time of each participant's true social tie strength with others. We develop a pair of powerful machine learning models (complemented by a suite of baselines extracted from past works) that learn from these surveys to interpret the communications records as signals. These signals represent dynamic tie strengths, accurately recording the evolution of relationships between the individuals in our social networks. With these evolving tie values, we are able to make several empirically derived observations which we compare to past works.",

            "abstract": "The paper describes a methodology for simulating online social media activities that occur in response to external events. A large number of social media simulators model information diffusion on online social networks. However, information cascades do not originate in vacuum. Rather, they often originate as a reaction to events external to the online medium. Thus, to predict activity on the social medium, one must investigate the relation between external stimuli and online social responses. The paper presents a simulation pipeline that features stimulus/response models describing how social systems react to external events of relevance to them. Two case studies are presented to test the fidelity of different models. One investigates online responses to events in the Venezuela election crisis. The other investigates online responses to developments of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). These case studies indicate that simple macroscopic stimulus/response models can accurately predict aggregate online trends.",

            "abstract": "Online social media provides massive open-ended platforms for users of a wide variety of backgrounds, interests, and beliefs to interact and debate, facilitating countless discussions across a myriad of subjects. With numerous unique voices being lent to the ever-growing information stream, it is essential to consider how the types of conversations that result from a social media post represent the post itself. We hypothesize that the biases and predispositions of users cause them to react to different topics in different ways not necessarily entirely intended by the sender. In this paper, we introduce a set of unique features that capture patterns of discourse, allowing us to empirically explore the relationship between a topic and the conversations it induces. Utilizing \u201cmicroscopic\u201d trends to describe \u201cmacroscopic\u201d phenomena, we set a paradigm for analyzing information dissemination through the user reactions that arise from a topic, eliminating the need to analyze the involved text of the discussions. Using a Reddit dataset, we find that our features not only enable classifiers to accurately distinguish between content genre, but also can identify more subtle semantic differences in content under a single topic as well as isolating outliers whose subject matter is substantially different from the norm.",

In particular, the concept of matching entities across networks has grown in significance in the world of social science as communicative networks such as social media have expanded in scale and popularity. With the advent of big data, there is a growing need to provide analysis on graphs of massive scale. However, with millions of nodes and billions of edges, the idea of alignment between a myriad of graphs of similar scale using features extracted from potentially sparse or incomplete datasets becomes daunting. In this paper we will propose a solution to the issue of large-scale alignments in the form of a multi-step pipeline. Within this pipeline we introduce scalable feature extraction for robust temporal attributes, accompanied by novel and efficient clustering algorithms in order to find groupings of similar nodes across graphs. The features and their clusters are fed into a versatile alignment stage that accurately identifies partner nodes among millions of possible matches. Our results show that the pipeline can process large data sets, achieving efficient runtimes within the memory constraints.",

Furthermore, we integrate those patterns into large-scale agent-based models to simulate the activity of users in the involved datasets to validate predictive accuracy. Following simulations reveal that incorporating clustering features based on time-based behavior into agent-based models not only result in a significant decrease in computational overhead, but also result in predictive accuracy comparable to the baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Online social media provides massive open-ended platforms for users of a wide variety of backgrounds, interests, and beliefs to interact and debate, facilitating countless information cascades across many subjects. With numerous unique voices being lent to the ever-growing information stream, it is essential to consider the question: how do the many types of conversations within an information cascade characterize the process as a whole? In this paper we analyze the underlying features of the dynamics of communication, and use those features to explain the inherent properties of the encompassing information cascade. Utilizing \"microscopic\" trends to describe \"macroscopic\" phenomena, we set a paradigm for analyzing information dissemination through the individual user interactions that sprout from a source topic, instead of trying to interpret the emergent patterns themselves. This paradigm yields a set of unique tools for a myriad of application in the field of information cascade analysis: from topic classification of sources to time-series forecasting. We use these tools in a 88-million-row dataset for Reddit to show their conceptual effectiveness and accuracy when compared to the ground truth.",

            "title": "A PREDICTIVE SELF-CONFIGURING SIMULATOR FOR ONLINE MEDIA",
            "abstract": "This paper describes the design, implementation, and early experiences with a novel agent-based simulator of online media streams, developed under DARPA\u2019s SocialSim Program to extract and predict trends in information dissemination on online media. A hallmark of the simulator is its self-configuring property. Instead of requiring initial set-up, the input to the simulator constitutes data traces collected from the medium to be simulated. The simulator automatically learns from the data such elements as the number of agents involved, the number of objects involved, and the rate of introduction of new agents and objects. It also develops behavior models of simulated agents and objects, and their dependencies. These models are then used to run simulations allowing for future extrapolations and \"what if\" analyses. Results are presented on using this system to simulate GitHub transactions. They show good performance in terms of both simulation accuracy and overhead.",
