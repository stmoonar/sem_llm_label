            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-hop reasoning has become an interpretable way for knowledge graph reasoning owing to its persuasive explanations for the predicted results, but the reasoning performance of these methods drops significantly over few-shot relations (only contain few triplets). To address this problem, recent studies introduce meta-learning into RL-based reasoning methods. However, the performance of these studies is still limited due to the following points: (1) the overall reasoning accuracy is impaired due to the low reasoning accuracies over some hard relations; (2) the reasoning process becomes laborious and ineffective owing to the existence of noisy data; (3) the generalizability is negatively affected due to the lack of knowledge-sharing. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel model HMLS consisting of two modules HHML (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Meta-reinforcement Learning) and HHS (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Sampling). Specifically, HHML contains the following two components: (1) a hardness-aware RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by training hardness-aware batches and reducing noise; (2) a knowledge-sharing meta-learning adapts to few-shot relations by exploiting common features in the hierarchical relation structure. The other module HHS generates hardness-aware batches from relation and relation-cluster levels. The experimental results demonstrate that this work notably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in few-shot scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Inductive link prediction (ILP) is to predict links for unseen entities in emerging knowledge graphs (KGs), considering the evolving nature of KGs. A more challenging scenario is that emerging KGs consist of only unseen entities without any edge connected to original KGs, called as disconnected emerging KGs (DEKGs). Existing studies for DEKGs only focus on predicting enclosing links, i.e., predicting links inside the emerging KG. The bridging links, which carry the evolutionary information from the original KG to DEKG, have not been investigated by previous work so far. To fill in the gap, we propose a novel model entitled DEKG-ILP (Disconnected Emerging Knowledge Graph Oriented Inductive Link Prediction) that consists of the following two components. (1) The module CLRM (Contrastive Learning-based Relation-specific Feature Modeling) is developed to extract global relation-based semantic features that are shared between original KGs and DEKGs with a novel sampling strategy. (2) The module GSM (GNN-based Subgraph Modeling) is proposed to extract the local subgraph topological information around each link in KGs. The extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DEKG-ILP has obvious performance improvements compared with state-of-the-art methods for both enclosing and bridging link prediction.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to leverage students' learning histories to estimate their mastery levels on a set of pre-defined skills, based on which the corresponding future performance can be accurately predicted. As an important way of providing personalized experience for online education, KT has gained increased attention in recent years. In practice, a student's learning history comprises answers to sets of massed questions, each known as a session, rather than merely being a sequence of independent answers. Theoretically, within and across these sessions, students' learning dynamics can be very different. Therefore, how to effectively model the dynamics of students' knowledge states within and across the sessions is crucial for handling the KT problem. Most existing KT models treat student's learning records as a single continuing sequence, without capturing the sessional shift of students' knowledge state. To address the above issue, we propose a novel hierarchical transformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an interaction(-level) encoder to capture the knowledge a student acquires within a session, and a session(-level) encoder to summarise acquired knowledge across the past sessions. To predict an interaction in the current session, a knowledge retriever integrates the summarised past-session knowledge with the previous interactions' information into proper knowledge representations. These representations are then used to compute the student's current knowledge state. Additionally, to model the student's long-term forgetting behaviour across the sessions, a power-law-decay attention mechanism is designed and deployed in the session encoder, allowing it to emphasize more on the recent sessions. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HiTSKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets compared with six state-of-the-art KT models.",

However, the natural incompleteness has significantly hindered the applications of MKGs. To tackle the problem, existing studies employ the embedding-based reasoning models to infer the missing knowledge after fusing the multi-modal features. However, the reasoning performance of these methods is limited due to the following problems: (1) ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex reasoning ability as well as inability to conduct the multi-hop reasoning which is able to infer more missing knowledge. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel model entitled MMKGR (Multi-hop Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Reasoning). Specifically, the model contains the following two components: (1) a unified gate-attention network which is designed to generate effective multi-modal complementary features through sufficient attention interaction and noise reduction; (2) a complementary feature-aware reinforcement learning method which is proposed to predict missing elements by performing the multi-hop reasoning process, based on the features obtained in component (1). The experimental results demonstrate that MMKGR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the MKG reasoning task.",

            "abstract": "Bundle recommendation offers promotions of bundled items instead of a single one, which is a common strategy for sales revenue increase and latent customer mining. Due to the scarcity of user-bundle interactions, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-bundle interactions and take user-item interactions into account. Existing studies consider user-item interactions by sharing model parameters or learning representation in a multi-task manner or modeling representation based on graph neural network. However, such methods ignore the mutual influence between user preferences for items and bundles. Moreover, they fail to analyse the intentions behind users' purchase behaviors, which can be utilized to make better bundle recommendation. To overcome the drawbacks of existing studies, we propose a novel model IHBR (Intention-oriented Hierarchical Bundle Recommendation with Preference Transfer). Specifically, we consider the co-purchase and co-occurrence information within items for modeling intention-oriented hierarchical representations. Furthermore, we provide a new perspective to exploit mutual influence between user preferences for items and bundles. The experimental results obtained on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Predicting (1) when the next hospital admission occurs and (2) what will happen in the next admission about a patient by mining electronic health record (EHR) data can provide granular readmission predictions to assist clinical decision making. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and point process models are usually employed in modelling temporal sequential data. Simple RNN models assume that sequences of hospital visits follow strict causal dependencies between consecutive visits. However, in the real-world, a patient may have multiple co-existing chronic medical conditions, i.e., multimorbidity, which results in a cascade of visits where a non-immediate historical visit can be most influential to the next visit. Although a point process (e.g., Hawkes process) is able to model a cascade temporal relationship, it strongly relies on a prior generative process assumption. We propose a novel model, MEDCAS, to address these challenges. MEDCAS combines the strengths of RNN-based models and point processes by integrating point processes in modelling visit types and time gaps into an attention-based sequence-to-sequence learning model, which is able to capture the temporal cascade relationships. To supplement the patients with short visit sequences, a structural modelling technique with graph-based methods is used to construct the markers of the point process in MEDCAS. Extensive experiments on three real-world EHR datasets have been performed and the results demonstrate that \\texttt{MEDCAS} outperforms state-of-the-art models in both tasks.",

            "abstract": "Author Name Disambiguation (AND) has received more attention recently, accompanied by the increase of academic publications. To tackle the AND problem, existing studies have proposed many approaches based on different types of information, such as raw document feature (e.g., co-author, title, and keywords), fusion feature (e.g., a hybrid publication embedding based on raw document feature), local structural information (e.g., a publication's neighborhood information on a graph), and global structural information (e.g., the interactive information between a node and others on a graph). However, there has been no work taking all the above-mentioned information into account for the AND problem so far. To fill the gap, we propose a novel framework namely MFAND (Multiple Features Driven Author Name Disambiguation). Specifically, we first employ the raw document and fusion feature to construct six similarity graphs for each author name to be disambiguated. Next, the global and local structural information extracted from these graphs is fed into a novel encoder called R3JG, which integrates and reconstructs the above-mentioned four types of information associated with an author, with the goal of learning the latent information to enhance the generalization ability of the MFAND. Then, the integrated and reconstructed information is fed into a binary classification model for disambiguation. Note that, several pruning strategies are applied before the information extraction to remove noise effectively. Finally, our proposed framework is investigated on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that MFAND performs better than all state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding aims to encode both entities and relations into a continuous vector space. Most existing methods require that all entities should be observed during training while ignoring the evolving nature of KG. Major recent efforts on this issue embed new entities by aggregating neighborhood information from existing entities and relations with Graph Neural Network (GNN). However, these methods rely on the neighbors seen during training and suffer from the embedding of new entities with insufficient triplets or triplets with the unseen-to-unseen form. To relieve this problem, we propose a two-stage learning model referred as Hyper-Relation Feature Learning Network (HRFN) for effective out-of-knowledge-base embedding. For the first stage, HRFN learns pre-representations for emerging entities using hyper-relation features meta-learned from the training set. A novel feature aggregating network that involves an entity-centered Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a relation-centered GCN is proposed to aggregate information from both new entities themselves and their neighbors. For stage two, a transductive learning network is employed to learn finer-grained embeddings based on above-mentioned pre-representations of new entities. Experimental results on the link prediction task demonstrate the superiority of our model. Further analysis is also done to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of pre-representing emerging entities with the hyper-relation feature.",

            "abstract": "Sequential user behavior modeling plays a crucial role in online user-oriented services, such as product purchasing, news feed consumption, and online advertising. The performance of sequential modeling heavily depends on the scale and quality of historical behaviors. However, the number of user behaviors inherently follows a long-tailed distribution, which has been seldom explored. In this work, we argue that focusing on tail users could bring more benefits and address the long tails issue by learning transferrable parameters from both optimization and feature perspectives. Specifically, we propose a gradient alignment optimizer and adopt an adversarial training scheme to facilitate knowledge transfer from the head to the tail. Such methods can also deal with the cold-start problem of new users. Moreover, it could be directly adaptive to various well-established sequential models. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets verify the superiority of our framework compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "title": "Social Boosted Recommendation With Folded Bipartite Network Embedding",
            "abstract": "With the prevalence of online social platforms, social recommendation has emerged as a promising direction that leverages the social network among users to enhance recommendation performance. However, the available social relations among users are usually extremely sparse and noisy, which may lead to inferior recommendation performance. To alleviate this problem, this paper novelly exploits the implicit higher-order social influence and dependencies among users to enhance social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method for general bipartite graphs, which defines inter-class message passing between explicit relations and intra-class message passing between implicit higher-order relations via a novel sequential modelling paradigm. Inspired by recent advances in self-attention-based sequential modelling, the proposed model features a self-attentive representation learning mechanism for implicit user-user relations. Moreover, this paper also explores the inductive embedding learning for social recommendation problems to improve the recommendation performance in cold-start settings. The proposed inductive learning paradigm for social recommendation enables embedding inference for those cold-start users and items (unseen during training) as long as they are linked to existing nodes in the original network. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method and suggest that higher-order implicit relationship among users is beneficial to improving social recommendation.",
