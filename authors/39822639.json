            "abstract": "Network alignment is the task of identifying topologically and semantically similar nodes across (two) different networks. It plays an important role in various applications ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatic network interactions. However, existing alignment models either cannot handle large-scale graphs or fail to leverage different types of network information or modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end alignment framework that can leverage different modalities to compare and align network nodes in an efficient way. In order to exploit the richness of the network context, our model constructs multiple embeddings for each node, each of which captures one modality or type of network information. We then design a late-fusion mechanism to combine the learned embeddings based on the importance of the underlying information. Our fusion mechanism allows our model to be adapted to various types of structure of the input network. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, while being robust against various noise factors.",

            "abstract": "IoT devices are increasingly present, both in the industry and in consumer markets, but their security remains weak, which leads to an unprecedented number of attacks against them. In order to reduce the attack surface, one approach is to analyze the binary code of these devices to early detect whether they contain potential security vulnerabilities. More specifically, knowing some vulnerable function, we can determine whether the firmware of an IoT device contains some security flaw by searching for this function. However, searching for similar vulnerable functions is in general challenging due to the fact that the source code is often not openly available and that it can be compiled for different architectures, using different compilers and compilation settings. In order to handle these varying settings, we can compare the similarity between the graph embeddings derived from the binary functions. In this paper, inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, we propose a new method \u2013 GESS (graph embeddings for similarity search) \u2013 to derive graph embeddings, and we compare it with various state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical evaluation shows that GESS reaches an AUC of 0.979, thereby outperforming the best known approach. Furthermore, for a fixed low false positive rate, GESS provides a true positive rate (or recall) about 36% higher than the best previous approach. Finally, for a large search space, GESS provides a recall between 50% and 60% higher than the best previous approach.",

            "abstract": "Graph embedding aims at learning a vector-based representation of vertices that incorporates the structure of the graph. This representation then enables inference of graph properties. Existing graph embedding techniques, however, do not scale well to large graphs. While several techniques to scale graph embedding using compute clusters have been proposed, they require continuous communication between the compute nodes and cannot handle node failure. We therefore propose a framework for scalable and robust graph embedding based on the MapReduce model, which can distribute any existing embedding technique. Our method splits a graph into subgraphs to learn their embeddings in isolation and subsequently reconciles the embedding spaces derived for the subgraphs. We realize this idea through a novel distributed graph decomposition algorithm. In addition, we show how to implement our framework in Spark to enable efficient learning of effective embeddings. Experimental results illustrate that our approach scales well, while largely maintaining the embedding quality.",

While the problem of subgraph isomorphism search has received considerable attention for the static setting of a single query, or a batch thereof, existing approaches do not scale to a dynamic setting of a continuous stream of queries. In this paper, we address the scalability challenges induced by a stream of subgraph isomorphism queries by caching and re-use of previous results. We first present a novel subgraph index based on graph embeddings that serves as the foundation for efficient stream processing. It enables not only effective caching and re-use of results, but also speeds-up traditional algorithms for subgraph isomorphism in case of cache misses. Moreover, we propose cache management policies that incorporate notions of reusability of query results.

Traditional IR systems are limited to homogeneous queries that define the information to retrieve by a single modality. Support for heterogeneous queries that combine different modalities has been proposed recently. Yet, existing approaches for heterogeneous querying are computationally expensive, as they require several passes over the data to construct a query answer.In this paper, we propose an IR system that overcomes the computational challenges imposed by heterogeneous queries by adopting graph embeddings. Specifically, we propose graph-based models in which both, data and queries, incorporate information of different modalities. Then, we show how either representation is transformed into a graph embedding in the same space, capturing relations between information of different modalities. By grounding query processing in graph embeddings, we enable processing of heterogeneous queries with a single pass over the data representation.

            "abstract": "Graph embedding aims at learning a vector-based representation of vertices that incorporates the structure of the graph. This representation then enables inference of graph properties. Existing graph embedding techniques, however, do not scale well to large graphs. We therefore propose a framework for parallel computation of a graph embedding using a cluster of compute nodes with resource constraints. We show how to distribute any existing embedding technique by first splitting a graph for any given set of constrained compute nodes and then reconciling the embedding spaces derived for these subgraphs. We also propose a new way to evaluate the quality of graph embeddings that is independent of a specific inference task. Based thereon, we give a formal bound on the difference between the embeddings derived by centralised and parallel computation. Experimental results illustrate that our approach for parallel computation scales well, while largely maintaining the embedding quality.",

            "title": "Multimodal Classification for Analysing Social Media",
            "abstract": "Classification of social media data is an important approach in understanding user behavior on the Web. Although information on social media can be of different modalities such as texts, images, audio or videos, traditional approaches in classification usually leverage only one prominent modality. Techniques that are able to leverage multiple modalities are often complex and susceptible to the absence of some modalities. In this paper, we present simple models that combine information from different modalities to classify social media content and are able to handle the above problems with existing techniques. Our models combine information from different modalities using a pooling layer and an auxiliary learning task is used to learn a common feature space. We demonstrate the performance of our models and their robustness to the missing of some modalities in the emotion classification domain. Our approaches, although being simple, can not only achieve significantly higher accuracies than traditional fusion approaches but also have comparable results when only one modality is available.",
