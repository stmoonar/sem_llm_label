            "abstract": "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) established the Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) program to assist researchers with analyzing the growing body of genome sequence and other omics-related data. In this report, we describe the merger of the PAThosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC), the Influenza Research Database (IRD) and the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) BRCs to form the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) https://www.bv-brc.org/. The combined BV-BRC leverages the functionality of the bacterial and viral resources to provide a unified data model, enhanced web-based visualization and analysis tools, bioinformatics services, and a powerful suite of command line tools that benefit the bacterial and viral research communities.",

            "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nFlow cytometry (FCM) and transcription profiling are the two widely used assays in translational immunology research. However, there is no data integration pipeline for analyzing these two types of assays together with experiment variables for biomarker inference. Current FCM data analysis mainly relies on subjective manual gating analysis, which is difficult to be directly integrated with other automated computational methods. Existing deconvolutional analysis of bulk transcriptomics relies on predefined marker genes in the transcriptomics data, which are unavailable for novel cell types and does not utilize the FCM data that provide canonical phenotypic definitions of the cell types.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe developed a novel analytics pipeline - FastMix - for computational immunology, which integrates flow cytometry, bulk transcriptomics, and clinical covariates for identifying cell type-specific gene expression signatures and biomarker genes. FastMix addresses the \"large p, small n\" problem in the gene expression and flow cytometry integration analysis via a linear mixed effects model (LMER) for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Its novel moment-based estimator not only reduces bias in parameter estimation but also is more efficient than iterative optimization. The FastMix pipeline also includes a cutting-edge flow cytometry data analysis method - DAFi - for identifying cell populations of interest and their characteristics. Simulation studies showed that FastMix produced smaller type I/II errors than competing methods. Validation using real data of two vaccine studies showed that FastMix identified a consistent set of signature genes as in independent single cell RNA-seq analysis, producing additional interesting findings.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nSource code of FastMix is publicly available at https://github.com/terrysun0302/FastMix.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary text and data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis to perform a comprehensive study of transcriptomic cell types in the human middle temporal gyrus and primary motor cortex, we have identified a highly diverse set of excitatory and inhibitory neuron types in healthy brain specimens (e.g., PMID: 31435019]. Using these data, we have developed an explainable machine learning method, NS-Forest [PMID: 34088715], to identify a minimum sets of marker genes that define each cell type identified and used these marker gene sets for the semantic representation of this knowledge in biomedical ontologies. NS-Forest marker gene identification also serves as a feature selection step that has been incorporated into a statistical graph-based framework using the FR-Match algorithm[PMID: 332494 for comparing and matching transcriptomic data clusters for novel cell type discovery. The complete characterization of the cell type diversity of healthy human brain will serve as a foundation for understanding the cellular determinants of neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and other brain disorders.",

            "abstract": "Single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is emerging as an essential tool to unravel the phenotypic heterogeneity of cells in complex biological systems. While computational methods for scRNAseq cell type clustering have advanced, the ability to integrate datasets to identify common and novel cell types across experiments remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a cluster-to-cluster cell type matching method \u2013 FR-Match \u2013 that utilizes supervised feature selection for dimensionality reduction and incorporates shared information among cells to determine whether two cell type clusters share the same underlying multivariate gene expression distribution. FR-Match is benchmarked with existing cell-to-cell and cell-to-cluster cell type matching methods using both simulated and real scRNAseq data. FR-Match proved to be a stringent method that produced fewer erroneous matches of distinct cell subtypes and had the unique ability to identify novel cell phenotypes in new datasets. In silico validation demonstrated that the proposed workflow is the only self-contained algorithm that was robust to increasing numbers of true negatives (i.e. non-represented cell types). FR-Match was applied to two human brain scRNAseq datasets sampled from cortical layer 1 and full thickness middle temporal gyrus. When mapping cell types identified in specimens isolated from these overlapping human brain regions, FR-Match precisely recapitulated the laminar characteristics of matched cell type clusters, reflecting their distinct neuroanatomical distributions. An R package and Shiny application are provided at https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/FRmatch for users to interactively explore and match scRNAseq cell type clusters with complementary visualization tools.",

            "abstract": "High\u2010throughput single\u2010cell cytometry technologies have significantly improved our understanding of cellular phenotypes to support translational research and the clinical diagnosis of hematological and immunological diseases. However, subjective and ad hoc manual gating analysis does not adequately handle the increasing volume and heterogeneity of cytometry data for optimal diagnosis. Prior work has shown that machine learning can be applied to classify cytometry samples effectively. However, many of the machine learning classification results are either difficult to interpret without using characteristics of cell populations to make the classification, or suboptimal due to the use of inaccurate cell population characteristics derived from gating boundaries. To date, little has been done to optimize both the gating boundaries and the diagnostic accuracy simultaneously. In this work, we describe a fully discriminative machine learning approach that can simultaneously learn feature representations (e.g., combinations of coordinates of gating boundaries) and classifier parameters for optimizing clinical diagnosis from cytometry measurements. The approach starts from an initial gating position and then refines the position of the gating boundaries by gradient descent until a set of globally\u2010optimized gates across different samples are achieved. The learning procedure is constrained by regularization terms encoding domain knowledge that encourage the algorithm to seek interpretable results. We evaluate the proposed approach using both simulated and real data, producing classification results on par with those generated via human expertise, in terms of both the positions of the gating boundaries and the diagnostic accuracy. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

The recent advent of single cell transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing is producing \u201cbig data\u201d, enabling the identification of novel human cell types at an unprecedented rate. In this review, we summarize recent work characterizing cell types in the human central nervous and immune systems using single cell and single nuclei RNA sequencing, and discuss the implications that these discoveries are having on the representation of cell types in the reference Cell Ontology (CL). We propose a method based on random forest machine learning for identifying sets of necessary and sufficient marker genes that can be used to assemble consistent and reproducible cell type definitions for incorporation into the CL. The representation of defined cell type classes and their relationships in the CL using this strategy will make the cell type classes findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), allowing the CL to serve as a reference knowledgebase of information about the role that distinct cellular phenotypes play in human health and disease.",

            "abstract": "Computational methods for identification of cell populations from polychromatic flow cytometry data are changing the paradigm of cytometry bioinformatics. Data clustering is the most common computational approach to unsupervised identification of cell populations from multidimensional cytometry data. However, interpretation of the identified data clusters is labor\u2010intensive. Certain types of user\u2010defined cell populations are also difficult to identify by fully automated data clustering analysis. Both are roadblocks before a cytometry lab can adopt the data clustering approach for cell population identification in routine use. We found that combining recursive data filtering and clustering with constraints converted from the user manual gating strategy can effectively address these two issues. We named this new approach DAFi: Directed Automated Filtering and Identification of cell populations. Design of DAFi preserves the data\u2010driven characteristics of unsupervised clustering for identifying novel cell subsets, but also makes the results interpretable to experimental scientists through mapping and merging the multidimensional data clusters into the user\u2010defined two\u2010dimensional gating hierarchy. The recursive data filtering process in DAFi helped identify small data clusters which are otherwise difficult to resolve by a single run of the data clustering method due to the statistical interference of the irrelevant major clusters. Our experiment results showed that the proportions of the cell populations identified by DAFi, while being consistent with those by expert centralized manual gating, have smaller technical variances across samples than those from individual manual gating analysis and the nonrecursive data clustering analysis. Compared with manual gating segregation, DAFi\u2010identified cell populations avoided the abrupt cut\u2010offs on the boundaries. DAFi has been implemented to be used with multiple data clustering methods including K\u2010means, FLOCK, FlowSOM, and the ClusterR package. For cell population identification, DAFi supports multiple options including clustering, bisecting, slope\u2010based gating, and reversed filtering to meet various autogating needs from different scientific use cases. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry",

            "abstract": "Cytometry is an important single cell analysis technology in furthering our understanding of cellular biological processes and in supporting clinical diagnoses across a variety hematological and immunological conditions. Current data analysis workflows for cytometry data rely on a manual process called gating to classify cells into canonical types. This dependence on human annotation significantly limits the rate, reproducibility, and scope of cytometry\u2019s use in both biological research and clinical practice. We develop a novel Bayesian approach for automated gating that classifies cells into different types by combining cell-level marker measurements with an informative prior. The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of biologically-meaningful prior information that captures the domain expertise of human experts. The inference algorithm results in a hierarchically-structured classification of individual cells in a manner that mimics the tree-structured recursive process of manual gating, making the results readily interpretable. The approach can be extended in a natural fashion to handle data from multiple different samples by the incorporation of random effects in the Bayesian model. The proposed approach is evaluated using mass cytometry data, on the problems of unsupervised cell classification and supervised clinical diagnosis, illustrating the benefits of both incorporating prior knowledge and sharing information across multiple samples.",
