            "abstract": "The discovery of causal relationships from high-dimensional data is a major open problem in bioinformatics. Machine learning and feature attribution models have shown great promise in this context but lack causal interpretation. Here, we show that a popular feature attribution model estimates a causal quantity reflecting the influence of one variable on another, under certain assumptions. We leverage this insight to implement a new tool, CIMLA, for discovering condition-dependent changes in causal relationships. We then use CIMLA to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data sets, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods. Finally, we employ CIMLA to analyze a previously published single-cell RNA-seq data set collected from subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), discovering several potential regulators of AD.",

            "abstract": "Motivation A common but critical task in genomic data analysis is finding features that separate and thereby help explain differences between two classes of biological objects, e.g., genes that explain the differences between healthy and diseased patients. As lower-cost, high-throughput experimental methods greatly increase the number of samples that are assayed as objects for analysis, computational methods are needed to quickly provide insights into high-dimensional datasets with tens of thousands of objects and features. Results We develop an interactive exploration tool called Genvisage that rapidly discovers the most discriminative feature pairs that best separate two classes in a dataset, and displays the corresponding visualizations. Since quickly finding top feature pairs is computationally challenging, especially when the numbers of objects and features are large, we propose a suite of optimizations to make Genvisage more responsive and demonstrate that our optimizations lead to a 400X speedup over competitive baselines for multiple biological data sets. With this speedup, Genvisage enables the exploration of more large-scale datasets and alternate hypotheses in an interactive and interpretable fashion. We apply Genvisage to uncover pairs of genes whose transcriptomic responses significantly discriminate treatments of several chemotherapy drugs.

            "abstract": "Prediction of clinical drug response (CDR) of cancer patients, based on their clinical and molecular profiles obtained prior to administration of the drug, can play a significant role in individualized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to address this issue, but training them requires data from a large number of patients treated with each drug, limiting their feasibility. While large databases of drug response and molecular profiles of preclinical in-vitro cancer cell lines (CCLs) exist for many drugs, it is unclear whether preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of real patients. We designed a systematic approach to evaluate how well different algorithms, trained on gene expression and drug response of CCLs, can predict CDR of patients. Using data from two large databases, we evaluated various linear and non-linear algorithms, some of which utilized information on gene interactions. Then, we developed a new algorithm called TG-LASSO that explicitly integrates information on samples\u2019 tissue of origin with gene expression profiles to improve prediction performance. Our results showed that regularized regression methods provide significantly accurate prediction. However, including the network information or common methods of including information on the tissue of origin did not improve the results. On the other hand, TG-LASSO improved the predictions and distinguished resistant and sensitive patients for 7 out of 13 drugs. Additionally, TG-LASSO identified genes associated with the drug response, including known targets and pathways involved in the drugs\u2019 mechanism of action. Moreover, genes identified by TG-LASSO for multiple drugs in a tissue were associated with patient survival. In summary, our analysis suggests that preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of patients and identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and survival. AUTHOR SUMMARY Cancer is among the leading causes of death globally and perdition of the drug response of patients to different treatments based on their clinical and molecular profiles can enable individualized cancer medicine. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to play a significant role in this task; but, these algorithms are designed based the premise that a large number of labeled training samples are available, and these samples are accurate representation of the profiles of real tumors. However, due to ethical and technical reasons, it is not possible to screen humans for many drugs, significantly limiting the size of training data. To overcome this data scarcity problem, machine learning models can be trained using large databases of preclinical samples (e.g. cancer cell line cultures). However, due to the major differences between preclinical samples and real tumors, it is unclear how accurately such preclinical-to-clinical computational models can predict the clinical drug response of cancer patients. Here, first we systematically evaluate a variety of different linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms for this particular task using two large databases of preclinical (GDSC) and tumor samples (TCGA). Then, we present a novel method called TG-LASSO that utilizes a new approach for explicitly incorporating the tissue of origin of samples in the prediction task. Our results show that TG-LASSO outperforms all other algorithms and can accurately distinguish resistant and sensitive patients for the majority of the tested drugs. Follow-up analysis reveal that this method can also identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity in each cancer type.",

SERGIO is capable of simulating any number of cell types in steady-state or cells differentiating to multiple fates according to a provided trajectory, reporting both unspliced and spliced transcript counts in single-cells. We show that data sets generated by SERGIO are comparable with experimental data in terms of multiple statistical measures.

We present here a supervised learning algorithm for gene set analysis, called \u2018GeneSet MAPR\u2019, that for the first time explicitly considers the patterns of direct as well as indirect relationships present in the network to quantify gene-gene similarities and then report shared properties of the gene set.

When applied to the set of response-associated genes from a triple negative breast cancer study, GeneSet MAPR uncovers gene families such as claudins, kallikreins, and collagen type alpha chains related to patient\u2019s response to treatment, and which are not uncovered with traditional analysis.",

Such experiments are often chosen based on the biologist\u2019s intuition, from several testable hypotheses. We pursue the goal of making this process systematic by using ideas from information theory to reason about experiments in gene regulation, in the hope of ultimately enabling rigorous experiment design strategies. For this, we make use of a state-of-the-art mathematical model of gene expression, which provides a way to formalize our current knowledge of cis- as well as trans-regulatory mechanisms of a gene. Ambiguities in such knowledge can be expressed as uncertainties in the model, which we capture formally by building an ensemble of plausible models that fit the existing data and defining a probability distribution over the ensemble. We then characterize the impact of a new experiment on our understanding of the gene\u2019s regulation based on how the ensemble of plausible models and its probability distribution changes when challenged with results from that experiment. This allows us to assess the \u2018value\u2019 of the experiment retroactively as the reduction in entropy of the distribution (information gain) resulting from the experiment\u2019s results. We fully formalize this novel approach to reasoning about gene regulation experiments and use it to evaluate a variety of perturbation experiments on two developmental genes of D. melanogaster. We also provide objective and \u2018biologist-friendly\u2019 descriptions of the information gained from each such experiment. The rigorously defined information theoretic approaches presented here can be used in the future to formulate systematic strategies for experiment design pertaining to studies of gene regulatory mechanisms. Author summary In-depth studies of gene regulatory mechanisms employ a variety of experimental approaches such as identifying a gene\u2019s enhancer(s) and testing its variants through reporter assays, followed by transcription factor mis-expression or knockouts, site mutagenesis, etc. The biologist is often faced with the challenging problem of selecting the ideal next experiment to perform so that its results provide novel mechanistic insights, and has to rely on their intuition about what is currently known on the topic and which experiments may add to that knowledge. We seek to make this intuition-based process more systematic, by borrowing ideas from the mature statistical field of experiment design. Towards this goal, we use the language of mathematical models to formally describe what is known about a gene\u2019s regulatory mechanisms, and how an experiment\u2019s results enhance that knowledge. We use information theoretic ideas to assign a \u2018value\u2019 to an experiment as well as explain objectively what is learned from that experiment. We demonstrate use of this novel approach on two extensively studied developmental genes in fruitfly. We expect our work to lead to systematic strategies for selecting the most informative experiments in a study of gene regulation.",

            "abstract": "Motivation Several large\u2010scale efforts have been made to collect gene expression signatures from a variety of biological conditions, such as response of cell lines to treatment with drugs, or tumor samples with different characteristics. These gene signature collections are utilized through bioinformatics tools for \u2018signature matching', whereby a researcher studying an expression profile can identify previously cataloged biological conditions most related to their profile. Signature matching tools typically retrieve from the collection the signature that has highest similarity to the user\u2010provided profile. Alternatively, classification models may be applied where each biological condition in the signature collection is a class label; however, such models are trained on the collection of available signatures and may not generalize to the novel cellular context or cell line of the researcher's expression profile. Results We present an advanced multi\u2010way classification algorithm for signature matching, called SigMat, that is trained on a large signature collection from a well\u2010studied cellular context, but can also classify signatures from other cell types by relying on an additional, small collection of signatures representing the target cell type. It uses these \u2018tuning data' to learn two additional parameters that help adapt its predictions for other cellular contexts. SigMat outperforms other similarity scores and classification methods in identifying the correct label of a query expression profile from as many as 244 or 500 candidate classes (drug treatments) cataloged by the LINCS L1000 project. SigMat retains its high accuracy in cross\u2010cell line applications even when the amount of tuning data is severely limited. Availability and implementation SigMat is available on GitHub at https://github.com/JinfengXiao/SigMat.",

            "abstract": "Literature search is critical for any scientific research. Different from Web or general domain search, a large portion of queries in scientific literature search are entity-set queries, that is, multiple entities of possibly different types. Entity-set queries reflect user's need for finding documents that contain multiple entities and reveal inter-entity relationships and thus pose non-trivial challenges to existing search algorithms that model each entity separately. However, entity-set queries are usually sparse (i.e., not so repetitive), which makes ineffective many supervised ranking models that rely heavily on associated click history. To address these challenges, we introduce SetRank, an unsupervised ranking framework that models inter-entity relationships and captures entity type information. Furthermore, we develop a novel unsupervised model selection algorithm, based on the technique of weighted rank aggregation, to automatically choose the parameter settings in SetRank without resorting to a labeled validation set. We evaluate our proposed unsupervised approach using datasets from TREC Genomics Tracks and Semantic Scholar's query log. The experiments demonstrate that SetRank significantly outperforms the baseline unsupervised models, especially on entity-set queries, and our model selection algorithm effectively chooses suitable parameter settings.",

            "abstract": "Basal gene expression levels have been shown to be predictive of cellular response to cytotoxic treatments. However, such analyses do not fully reveal complex genotype-phenotype relationships, which are partly encoded in highly interconnected molecular networks. Biological pathways provide a complementary way of understanding drug response variation among individuals. In this study, we integrate chemosensitivity data from a recent pharmacogenomics study with basal gene expression data from the CCLE project and prior knowledge of molecular networks to identify specific pathways mediating chemical response. We first develop a computational method called PACER, which ranks pathways for enrichment in a given set of genes using a novel network embedding method. It examines known relationships among genes as encoded in a molecular network along with gene memberships of all pathways to determine a vector representation of each gene and pathway in the same low-dimensional vector space. The relevance of a pathway to the given gene set is then captured by the similarity between the pathway vector and gene vectors. To apply this approach to chemosensitivity data, we identify genes with basal expression levels in a panel of cell lines that are correlated with cytotoxic response to a compound, and then rank pathways for relevance to these response-correlated genes using PACER. Extensive evaluation of this approach on benchmarks constructed from databases of compound target genes, compound chemical structure, as well as large collections of drug response signatures demonstrates its advantages in identifying compound-pathway associations, compared to existing statistical methods of pathway enrichment analysis. The associations identified by PACER can serve as testable hypotheses about chemosensitivity pathways and help further study the mechanism of action of specific cytotoxic drugs. More broadly, PACER represents a novel technique of identifying enriched properties of any gene set of interest while also taking into account networks of known gene-gene relationships and interactions.",
