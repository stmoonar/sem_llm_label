            "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach for calculating star camera attitudes, which can calculate calibration parameters and attitude information simultaneously, in situations where precise camera calibration results are unknown, is proposed. This algorithm combines the calibration and attitude determination processes, achieving significantly improved performance as a result. Experiments using 1500 star images from different sky regions show that, compared with the traditional method that separates calibration and attitude determination, the proposed algorithm not only exhibits more precise and stable results, but also shows improved tolerance for the star mismatching which is inevitable in star sensor data process technology.",

            "title": "Large-Scale Planar Block Adjustment of GaoFen1 WFV Images Covering Most of Mainland China",
            "abstract": "GaoFen1 is the first high-resolution earth observation satellite built in China, and carries four wide field-of-view (WFV) cameras to achieve large-scale monitoring and mapping. However, the unstable attitude measurement accuracy of the satellite generally imparts low geopositioning accuracy and inconsistent geometric error in overlapping areas of WFV images. A feasible and effective large-scale planar block adjustment (PBA) method is presented that corrects the geometric errors of the vast WFV images integrally, further improving the geometric accuracy of these images. In addition, whether ground control points (GCPs) are needed, and the effect of different numbers of GCPs on PBA accuracy is also investigated. Two key technologies are used in this paper. First, a universal PBA error equation based on the virtual control points is presented to allow PBA with or without GCPs. Second, an adjustment method aided by a digital elevation model is adopted to overcome the weak convergence geometry among WFV images, further ensuring stable estimation of PBA. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by 664 WFV images covering most of mainland China. The satisfactory experimental results indicate that the method presented herein is reasonable and effective, but that a certain number of GCPs is needed to ensure the accuracy of large-scale PBA results for WFV images.",

            "abstract": "Superresolution (SR) is an important compensatory mean for geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites because of their low spatial resolution caused by orbital height. The multiple-image SR (MISR) methods generally have better reconstruction effects than single-image SR (SISR) methods. However, MISR methods require multiple images of the same place, which are susceptible to geometric distortion and radiation differences. Gaofen-4 (GF-4) is a GEO satellite equipped with a visible-light and near-infrared (VNIR) sensor and provides images with five bands. Based on the similarity of spatial information between different bands, this paper proposes an SISR method suitable for GF-4 VNIR images. The radiation differences are eliminated by extracting texture images. The high-resolution (HR) texture image is reconstructed by projections onto convex sets. The final SR result is fused by HR texture image and upsampled VNIR image. Tested by real GF-4 data, the reconstructed results of this method have better sharpness and more abundant information than comparable methods.",

            "abstract": "To increase the field of view (FOV), combining multiple time-delayed and integrated charge-coupled devices (TDI-CCD) into the camera and the pushbroom imaging modality are traditionally used with high-resolution optical satellites. It is becoming increasingly labor- and cost-intensive to build and maintain a calibration field with high resolution and broad coverage. This paper introduces a simple and feasible on-orbit geometric self-calibration approach for high-resolution multi-TDI-CCD optical satellites based on three-view stereoscopic images. With the aid of the a priori geometric constraint of tie points in the triple-overlap regions of stereoscopic images, as well as tie points between adjacent single TDI-CCD images (STIs), high accuracy calibration of all TDI-CCD detectors can be achieved using a small number of absolute ground control points (GCPs) covering the selected primary STI. This method greatly reduces the demand on the calibration field and thus is more time-, effort- and cost-effective. Experimental results indicated that the proposed self-calibration approach is effective for increasing the relative internal accuracy without the limitations associated with using a traditional reference calibration field, which could have great significance for future super-high-resolution optical satellites.",

The GaoFen3 (GF3) remote sensing satellite is the first C-band multipolarization SAR satellite with a resolution of 1 m in China and plays an important role in commercial exploitation and scientific research. This letter performs a comprehensive analysis of the geometric accuracy for GF3 stereo pair orientation. By analyzing the orientation error sources, it is proven that the affine transformation model in image space can effectively compensate the unmodeled errors in GF3 imagery. Based on the rational polynomial coefficient model, the integrated orientation model for the GF3 stereo pair is presented here. Moreover, the model parameters and weight determination are further studied to analyze the influence of weight matrixes on geometric accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed integrated orientation model can be effectively used for the GF3 stereo pair. The GCPs, convergent angle, and weight setting are the key factors influencing the geometric accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Scene classification, aiming to identify the land-cover categories of remotely sensed image patches, is now a fundamental task in the remote sensing image analysis field. Deep-learning-model-based algorithms are widely applied in scene classification and achieve remarkable performance, but these high-level methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Consequently in this paper, we introduce a knowledge distillation framework, currently a mainstream model compression method, into remote sensing scene classification to improve the performance of smaller and shallower network models. Our knowledge distillation training method makes the high-temperature softmax output of a small and shallow student model match the large and deep teacher model. In our experiments, we evaluate knowledge distillation training method for remote sensing scene classification on four public datasets: AID dataset, UCMerced dataset, NWPU-RESISC dataset, and EuroSAT dataset. Results show that our proposed training method was effective and increased overall accuracy (3% in AID experiments, 5% in UCMerced experiments, 1% in NWPU-RESISC and EuroSAT experiments) for small and shallow models. We further explored the performance of the student model on small and unbalanced datasets. Our findings indicate that knowledge distillation can improve the performance of small network models on datasets with lower spatial resolution images, numerous categories, as well as fewer training samples.",

            "abstract": "Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites, the first civilian high resolution optical operational constellation in China, have Earth observation capabilities with panchromatic/multispectral imaging at 2/8 m resolution. Satellite jitter, the fluctuation of satellite points, has a negative influence on the geometric quality of high-resolution optical satellite imagery. This paper presents an improved jitter detection method based on parallax observation of multispectral sensors for Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites, which can eliminate the effect of the relative internal error induced by lens distortion, and accurately estimate the parameters of satellite jitter. The relative internal error is estimated by polynomial modelling and removed from the original parallax image generated by pixel-to-pixel image matching between two bands of images. The accurate relative time-varying error and absolute distortion caused by satellite jitter could be estimated by using the sine function. Three datasets of multispectral images captured by Gaofen-1 02/03/04 satellites were used to conduct the experiments. The results show that the relative system errors in both the across- and along-track directions can be modelled with a quadratic polynomial, and satellite jitter with a frequency of 1.1\u20131.2 Hz in the across-track direction was detected for the first time. The amplitude of the jitter differed in the three datasets. The largest amplitude, from satellite 04, is 1.3 pixels. The smallest amplitude, from satellite 02, is 0.077 pixels. The reliability and accuracy of the detection results were verified by using two groups of band combinations and ortho-images with a 1 m resolution. The comparison results show that the detection accuracy is improved by approximately 30% using the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Image segmentation is the foundation of object-based image analysis, and many researchers have sought optimal segmentation results. The initial image oversegmentation and the optimal segmentation scale are two vital factors in high spatial resolution remote sensing image segmentation. With respect to these two issues, a novel image segmentation method combining superpixels with a minimum spanning tree is proposed in this paper. First, the image is oversegmented using a simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to obtain superpixels. Then, the superpixels are clustered by regionalization with a dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning (REDCAP) algorithm using the initial number of segments, and the local variance (LV) and the rate of LV change (ROC-LV) indicator diagrams corresponding to the number of segments are obtained. The suitable number of image segments is determined according to the LV and ROC-LV indicator diagrams corresponding to the number of segments. Finally, the superpixels are reclustered using the REDCAP algorithm based on the suitable number of image segments to obtain the image segmentation result. Through two sets of experiments, the proposed method is compared with two other segmentation algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the others and obtains good image segmentation results.",

            "abstract": "With the successful launch of GaoFen4 (GF4), on-orbit high accuracy geometric calibration for the high-resolution geostationary optical satellite will be a new research topic. With the improvement in the geometric resolution from geostationary orbit, it will become more and more difficult to meet the requirements of both high geometric resolution and large coverage for the available reference data. The purpose of this paper is to explore a new self-calibration mode for GF4 and future high-resolution geostationary optical area array cameras based on the fewest ground control points (GCPs). To overcome the problems of overparameterization, strong correlation and lower significance of the traditional rigorous imaging model, the simplified physical internal model is proposed, and its effectiveness in describing and compensating for the camera internal distortion is verified. Based on the simplified physical internal model, the self-calibration method based on two GCPs and evenly distributed tie points of two images is proposed for the high accuracy estimation of the calibration parameters. The GCPs can be used to provide the absolute geographical constraints for scale information, and the tie points can be used to provide the global constraints for optimum estimation. After calibration, the internal distortion is well compensated, and the positioning accuracy with relatively few GCPs is shown to be better than 1.0 pixels for both the panchromatic and near-infrared sensor and the intermediate infrared sensor. This paper will provide a new usable concept and approach for the future higher resolution geostationary area array optical camera to overcome the stringent requirements of both high resolution and a large area of reference data for the traditional calibration method.",
