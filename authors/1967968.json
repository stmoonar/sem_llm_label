            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nHealthcare providers and organizations occasionally use electronic messages to provide information to patients. There is insufficient data on whether patients actually read the emails they receive. In this study, we aimed to assess the cooperation of patients in reading multiple information pages sent over 6\u00a0months from their diabetologist via email.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAdults with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes received via email, once every 2\u00a0weeks for 6\u00a0months, a message containing information and tips on how to improve diabetes control through lifestyle choices. The information was provided in a format that required the recipient to actively click on a \"read more\" tab in order to reveal the entire text. Each email contained a short questionnaire requesting a response. Analysis compared the effect of patient variables on co-operation with reading the emails and answering the questionnaires.\n\n\nMAIN FINDINGS\n45 patients completed the study, 53.3% of them read 66-100% of the emails, 17.8% read 34-65% of the emails and only 26.7% read less than 33% of the emails. Women answered more questionnaires than men did. Answering a questionnaire on nutrition or medications correlated with reading the following email sent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that most patients do indeed read a significant portion of emails sent by their physician. Email could be an effective means of sharing information and improving patient engagement with treatment.",

            "abstract": "Multimorbidity, the coexistence of two or more health conditions, has become more prevalent as mortality rates in many countries have declined and their populations have aged. Multimorbidity presents significant difficulties for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), particularly in cases where recommendations from relevant clinical guidelines offer conflicting advice. A number of research groups are developing computer-interpretable guideline (CIG) modeling formalisms that integrate recommendations from multiple Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for knowledge-based multimorbidity decision support. In this paper we describe work towards the development of a framework for comparing the different approaches to multimorbidity CIG-based clinical decision support (MGCDS). We present (1) a set of features for MGCDS, which were derived using a literature review and evaluated by physicians using a survey, and (2) a set of benchmarking case studies, which illustrate the clinical application of these features. This work represents the first necessary step in a broader research program aimed at the development of a benchmark framework that allows for standardized and comparable MGCDS evaluations, which will facilitate the assessment of functionalities of MGCDS, as well as highlight important gaps in the state-of-the-art. We also outline our future work on developing the framework, specifically, (3) a standard for reporting MGCDS solutions for the benchmark case studies, and (4) criteria for evaluating these MGCDS solutions. We plan to conduct a large-scale comparison study of existing MGCDS based on the comparative framework.",

            "title": "Evaluation of a Bi-Directional Methodology for Automated Assessment of Compliance to Continuous Application of Clinical Guidelines, in the Type 2 Diabetes-Management Domain",
            "abstract": "Evidence-based recommendations are often published in the form of clinical guidelines and protocols, as documents intended to be used by clinicians to provide the state of the art care. However, as demonstrated repeatedly in multiple clinical domains, clinicians often do not sufficiently adhere to the guidelines in a manner sensitive to the context of each patient. Such gaps are important to detect; fast, large-scale detection might lead to specific adjustments, usually of the clinicians\u2019 management patterns, but possibly of the guidelines themselves. In this study, we evaluated the DiscovErr system, in which we had implemented a new methodology for assessment of compliance to continuous implementation of clinical guidelines. This new methodology is based on a bi-directional search from the objective of the guideline to the longitudinal multivariate patient data, and vice versa. The evaluation of DiscovErr was performed in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, by comparing its performance to a panel of three clinicians, two experts in diabetes-patient management and a senior family practitioner highly experienced in diabetes treatment. The system and the three experts commented on the management of 10 patients who were randomly selected before the evaluation from a database containing longitudinal records of 2,000 type 2 diabetes patients. On average, each patient record spanned 5.23 years; the overall data of the selected patients included 1,584 time-oriented medical transactions (laboratory tests or medication administrations). We assessed the correctness (i.e. precision) and completeness (i.e. recall or coverage) of the comments provided by the DiscovErr system relative to the gold-standard comments of the clinicians. After providing their own comments regarding the therapy provided by the original physician treating the patient (typically, a general practitioner), the clinical experts assessed both the correctness and the importance of each of the DiscovErr system comments. The completeness of the system was computed by comparing its comments to the ones made by each of the experts or by their majority. The DiscovErr system provided 279 comments. The three experts made a total of 181 different unique comments. The completeness of the DiscovErr system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98% when compared to comments made by all three experts. A total of 172 comments were evaluated by the experts for correctness and importance: all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments (by selecting at random three of the patient records). The correctness of the system was 81% when compared to comments that were judged as correct by both of the diabetes experts, and 91% when compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. Regarding the importance of the system comments, 89% of the comments were judged as important (versus less important) by both experts, 8% were judged as important by one of the two experts, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. When we computed completeness and correctness scores based on all the comments made by the human experts, augmented by system comments that were validated, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, if it were considered as an additional, fourth expert, the DiscovErr system would have ranked first in completeness and second in correctness (when computing these measures also for the human experts, using a majority consensus of opinions as the gold standard). We conclude that systems such as DiscovErr can be effectively used to provide medical critique and assess the quality of continuous guideline-based care of large numbers of patients.",

            "title": "Analyzing Medical Research Results Based on Synthetic Data and Their Relation to Real Data Results: Systematic Comparison From Five Observational Studies",
            "abstract": "Background Privacy restrictions limit access to protected patient-derived health information for research purposes. Consequently, data anonymization is required to allow researchers data access for initial analysis before granting institutional review board approval. A system installed and activated at our institution enables synthetic data generation that mimics data from real electronic medical records, wherein only fictitious patients are listed. Objective This paper aimed to validate the results obtained when analyzing synthetic structured data for medical research. A comprehensive validation process concerning meaningful clinical questions and various types of data was conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of statistical estimates derived from synthetic patient data. Methods A cross-hospital project was conducted to validate results obtained from synthetic data produced for five contemporary studies on various topics. For each study, results derived from synthetic data were compared with those based on real data. In addition, repeatedly generated synthetic datasets were used to estimate the bias and stability of results obtained from synthetic data. Results This study demonstrated that results derived from synthetic data were predictive of results from real data. When the number of patients was large relative to the number of variables used, highly accurate and strongly consistent results were observed between synthetic and real data. For studies based on smaller populations that accounted for confounders and modifiers by multivariate models, predictions were of moderate accuracy, yet clear trends were correctly observed. Conclusions The use of synthetic structured data provides a close estimate to real data results and is thus a powerful tool in shaping research hypotheses and accessing estimated analyses, without risking patient privacy. Synthetic data enable broad access to data (eg, for out-of-organization researchers), and rapid, safe, and repeatable analysis of data in hospitals or other health organizations where patient privacy is a primary value.",

            "abstract": "Background Regular physical activity is known to be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, most of the people who have diabetes lead a sedentary lifestyle. Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback. Objective The aim of this study was to help type 2 diabetes patients increase the level of their physical activity. Methods We provided 27 sedentary type 2 diabetes patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent short message service messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning algorithm so as to improve each participant\u2019s compliance with the activity regimen. The algorithm was compared with a static policy for sending messages and weekly reminders. Results Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the learning algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, whereas the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the learning algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) compared with control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise. Conclusions Mobile phone apps coupled with a learning algorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. This algorithm can be used in large populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control. Our results can be expanded to other areas where computer-led health coaching of humans may have a positive impact.
