            "title": "Context Consistency Regularization for Label Sparsity in Time Series",
            "abstract": "Labels are typically sparse in real-world time series due to the high annotation cost. Recently, consistency regularization techniques have been used to generate artificial labels from unlabeled augmented instances. To fully exploit the sequential characteristic of time series in consistency regularization, we propose a novel method of data augmentation called context-attached augmentation , which adds preceding and succeeding instances to a target instance to form its augmented instance. Unlike the existing augmentation techniques that modify a target instance by directly perturbing its attributes, the context-attached augmentation generates instances augmented with varying contexts while maintaining the target instance. Based on our augmentation method, we propose a context consistency regularization framework, which first adds different contexts to a target instance sampled from a given time series and then shares unitary reliability-based cross-window labels across the augmented instances to maintain consistency. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art consistency regularization frameworks through comprehensive experiments on real-world time-series datasets.",

            "title": "Adaptive Model Pooling for Online Deep Anomaly Detection from a Complex Evolving Data Stream",
            "abstract": "Online anomaly detection from a data stream is critical for the safety and security of many applications but is facing severe challenges due to complex and evolving data streams from IoT devices and cloud-based infrastructures. Unfortunately, existing approaches fall too short for these challenges; online anomaly detection methods bear the burden of handling the complexity while offline deep anomaly detection methods suffer from the evolving data distribution. This paper presents a framework for online deep anomaly detection, ARCUS, which can be instantiated with any autoencoder-based deep anomaly detection methods. It handles the complex and evolving data streams using an adaptive model pooling approach with two novel techniques: concept-driven inference and drift-aware model pool update; the former detects anomalies with a combination of models most appropriate for the complexity, and the latter adapts the model pool dynamically to fit the evolving data streams. In comprehensive experiments with ten data sets which are both high-dimensional and concept-drifted, ARCUS improved the anomaly detection accuracy of the streaming variants of state-of-the-art autoencoder-based methods and that of the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods by up to 22% and 37%, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Once a cardiac alarm is triggered in the intensive care unit (ICU), accurately classifying whether the alarm is true of false is of critical importance. Incorrect classification may lead to patient's death if the alarm is true or to disruption in patient care if false. There has been a body of research, as signified by the 2015 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge; due accomplishments have been made in the relevant computational technology, and yet the highest accuracy known thus far is in the mid-80% range (85%). Our work achieved much higher accuracy and, additionally, very early classification almost at the onset of an arrhythmia alarm, by utilizing state of the art deep learning methods. The machine learning model used is a Residual Network (ResNet) and a Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) connected in tandem. Using the Phy-sioNet dataset of 750 recorded ECG segments published with the Challenge, our method performed the classification with 96% accuracy in 0.52 seconds from the onset of an alarm on average over all test ECG segments.",
