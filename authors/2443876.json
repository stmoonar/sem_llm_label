            "abstract": "Interrupted sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ) is an advanced coherent jamming with both suppression and deception effects. Effective countermeasures have been proposed, but most of these methods only consider ISRJ suppression in the case of single jamming or multiple jammings with the same parameters. In this article, we propose a space\u2013time complex modulation (STCM) technique based on colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar to cope with the threat of multiple ISRJs with different parameters. The STCM refers to encoding the carrier frequency of the signal transmitted by each array element and randomly encoding the initial phase of each pulse emitted by each array element. This modulation method can separate the ISRJ mixed with the target in the transmitting angular frequency-range (TAFR) spectrum. Using this characteristic, we study the waveform parameter design criterion for the sufficient separation of targets and ISRJs. Moreover, the detailed STCM-MIMO waveform processing method is developed for ISRJ suppression. Simulation results are provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed modulation method in ISRJ separation and the significant advantage of the proposed ISRJ suppression method over existing methods in the presence of multiple jammings.",

            "abstract": "In the face of smart and varied jamming, intelligent radar anti-jamming technologies are urgently needed. Due to the variety of radar electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCMs), it is necessary to efficiently optimize ECCMs in the high-dimensional knowledge base to ensure that the radar achieves the optimal anti-jamming effect. Therefore, an intelligent radar anti-jamming decision-making method based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) (DDPG-MADDPG) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, by establishing a typical working scenario of radar and jamming, we designed the intelligent radar anti-jamming decision-making model, and the anti-jamming decision-making process was formulated. Then, aiming at different jamming modes, we designed the anti-jamming improvement factor and the correlation matrix of jamming and ECCM. They were used to evaluate the jamming suppression performance of ECCMs and to provide feedback for the decision-making algorithm. The decision-making constraints and four different decision-making objectives were designed to verify the performance of the decision-making algorithm. Finally, we designed a DDPG-MADDPG algorithm to generate the anti-jamming strategy. The simulation results showed that the proposed method has excellent robustness and generalization performance. At the same time, it has a shorter convergence time and higher anti-jamming decision making accuracy.",

            "title": "Multi-Label Radar Compound Jamming Signal Recognition Using Complex-Valued CNN with Jamming Class Representation Fusion",
            "abstract": "In the complex battlefield electromagnetic environment, multiple jamming signals can enter the radar receiver simultaneously due to the development of jammers and modulation technology. The received compound jamming signals aggravate the difficulty of recognition and subsequent counter-countermeasure. In the face of strong overlapping signals and unseen jamming signal combinations, the performance of existing recognition methods usually seriously degrades. In this paper, an end-to-end multi-label classification framework combining a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) and jamming class representations is proposed to automatically recognize the jamming signal components of compound jamming signals. A basic multi-label CV-CNN (ML-CV-CNN) is first designed to directly process time\u2013domain complex signals and fully retain jamming signal information. Then, the jamming class representations are generated using prototype clustering implemented by learning vector quantization, and they are fused with the ML-CV-CNN using class decoupling implemented by the attention mechanism to construct a multi-label class representation CV-CNN (ML-CR-CV-CNN), which can better learn the class-related features required for recognition. Finally, an adaptive threshold calibration is adopted to obtain optimal recognition results by multi-threshold discrimination. Simulation results verify that the proposed method has superior recognition performance, which is reflected in the strong robustness to the varying jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) and power ratio, faster convergence speed with high JNRs, and better generalization for unseen jamming signal combinations.",

First, the system geometry and the signal model of the moving target for the distributed shipborne HFHSSWR are formulated, and then the azimuth resolution improvement principle is derived. Second, based on the developed signal model, we propose an azimuth resolution improvement algorithm, which can obtain the synthetic azimuth bandwidth and an improved resolution using sub-band combination. Finally, a target parameters inversion method is introduced to estimate the target velocity vector and the target azimuth, by solving the equations regarding the target geometry and echo signal parameters numerically. The simulations are performed to verify the proposed algorithms. The results indicate that the distributed synthetic aperture techniques effectively improve the azimuth resolution of this radar, and can obtain the target velocity vector and the high-precision estimation of the target azimuth.",

            "abstract": "Jamming is a big threat to the survival of a radar system. Therefore, the recognition of radar jamming signal type is a part of radar countermeasure. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown their effectiveness in radar signal processing, including jamming signal recognition. However, most of existing CNN methods do not regard radar jamming as a complex value signal. In this study, a complex-valued CNN (CV-CNN) is investigated to fully explore the inherent characteristics of a radar jamming signal, and we find that we can obtain better recognition accuracy using this method compared with a real-valued CNN (RV-CNN). CV-CNNs contain more parameters, which need more inference time. To reduce the parameter redundancy and speed up the recognition time, a fast CV-CNN (F-CV-CNN), which is based on pruning, is proposed for radar jamming signal fast recognition. The experimental results show that the CV-CNN and F-CV-CNN methods obtain good recognition performance in terms of accuracy and speed. The proposed methods open a new window for future research, which shows a huge potential of CV-CNN-based methods for radar signal processing.",

Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have shown their powerfulness in signal processing.

The proposed method consists of three subnetworks (i.e., 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and fusion network). 1D-CNN is used to extract deep features of original radar jamming signal. Meanwhile, in order to extract the time-frequency features, short time Fourier transform (STFT) is applied to jamming signal to obtain time-frequency spectrograms. Then, 2D-CNN is used to extract deep time-frequency features, which are useful for further features fusion processing. Fusion network is used to deeply fuse the extracted features of the aforementioned CNNs and softmax is used to finish the task of radar jamming signal classification. In addition, in order to alleviate the problem of overfitting and improve the generalization ability of proposed model, soft label smoothing is proposed. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method provides competitive results in term of classification accuracy.",

However, due to the complex radio paths, the sea clutter spectrum spread severely and exhibit a complex signature. In this paper, a space-time adaptive processing (STAP) based on the Gabor wavelet filter to extract the sea clutter space-time distribution is proposed to suppress the broadened sea clutter. The proposed method involves three steps. First, the two-dimensional Gabor wavelet transform is applied to the Angle-Doppler(AD) spectrum to extract the sea clutter component by using the adaptive threshold method. Second, the remaining component besides the sea clutter in the extracted results is eliminated by using the template convolution and connected component labeling method. Third, the clutter covariance matrix is estimated based on the segmentation region of the sea clutter. According to the experimental results, the proposed method can obtain a more accurate estimation of the broadened sea clutter space-time distribution and achieve better suppression performance.",

Their method was based on a recently proposed adaptive beamforming technique for large-scale arrays. In this beamforming technique, a sparse sub-array having much smaller number of antenna elements is first selected from the original physical array to perform digital sampling, and then the beamforming coefficients for the original full array are calculated by using only the digital samples from the selected sub-array. In their robust method, they calculate the diagonal loading level automatically by using the spatial-matched method. Then, the steering vector of the desired signal is estimated by maximising the beamformer output power under a constraint that the estimated steering vector does not converge to any of the interference steering vectorsor their linear combinations. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against covariance matrix mismatch and steering vector error.",
