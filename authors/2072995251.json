            "title": "Amazon-M2: A Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset for Recommendation and Text Generation",
            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

            "title": "Towards a Semantic-enabled Agent-oriented Distributed Clinical Decision Model",
            "abstract": "In a distributed Clinical Decision Support environment, a decision model is usually defined and coupled with a group of decision rules that together drive the decision support process. These can then be applied to patient-specific data to provide customised clinical advices. Being useful and able to deliver improved clinical service, such systems are often closed and thus lead to the difficulties in keeping aligned with up-to-date best evidences, interoperating with local Electronic Health Records (EHRs) systems, and advising in multi-disciplinary decisions whereas disparate participants work towards the same decision goals. In this paper, a semantic-enabled agent-oriented distributed clinical decision model is proposed. Group decisions are modelled as goal trees, which can be managed altogether and later chosen, decomposed and distributed to appropriate decision participants. Individual decisions are modelled in the form of RDF-based argumentation rules, which can be universally interpreted by a Rule Engine (RE) against the local EHRs. An Interactive Decision Interface Engine (IDIE) is developed to guide local decisions step by step and a Choreographer Agent (CA) synthetizes decisions among a collaborative group in a distributed environment. Ultimately, specialists can easily maintain decision knowledge in open and shared triple stores, and decision makers can better understand and investigate decision recommendation rationale using knowledge graphs that are intimately integrated within their decision-making environment. We demonstrate the idea with a case study of triple assessment of breast cancer.",

            "title": "A Semantic-based Multi-agent Dynamic Interaction Model",
            "abstract": "Due to the autonomy of agents and their ability to perceive the environment, multi-agent systems have been widely used in many fields. The design of multi-agent systems requires the support of interactive models. The traditional multi-agent interaction model has certain feasibility in solving specific tasks. However, in a distributed environment, a relatively static multi-agent interaction model is not sufficient to support a dynamically changing interaction process. Frequent data interactions will also consume resources of multi-agent systems, thereby reducing agent performance. In this study, we propose a semantic-based multiagent dynamic interaction model (MADIM). MADIM uses semantic ontology to map the objects in the interaction model, and defines the interaction protocol through the rule description language. This model is attached with dynamically configurable semantic templates and interaction rule base. We added a reusable dynamic resolution engine component to MADIM to provide dynamic resolution services for the semantic information in the model. MADIM supports dynamic interactive behavior and has good interoperability and interpretability. Our model provides a flexible solution to the multi-agent interaction process. Finally, we verified the feasibility of the model design scheme through a simple example.",
