            "abstract": "Data on the web is naturally unindexed and decentralized. Centralizing web data, especially personal data, raises ethical and legal concerns. Yet, compared to centralized query approaches, decentralization-friendly alternatives such as Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) are significantly less performant and understood. The two main difficulties of LTQP are the lack of apriori information about data sources and the high number of HTTP requests. Exploring decentralized-friendly ways to document unindexed networks of data sources could lead to solutions to alleviate those difficulties. RDF data shapes are widely used to validate linked data documents, therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate their potential for LTQP optimization. In our work, we built an early version of a source selection algorithm for LTQP using RDF data shape mappings with linked data documents and measured its performance in a realistic setup. In this article, we present our algorithm and early results, thus, opening opportunities for further research for shape-based optimization of link traversal queries. Our initial experiments show that with little maintenance and work from the server, our method can reduce up to 80% the execution time and 97% the number of links traversed during realistic queries. Given our early results and the descriptive power of RDF data shapes it would be worthwhile to investigate non-heuristic-based query planning using RDF shapes.",

            "title": "ConSolid: A federated ecosystem for heterogeneous multi-stakeholder projects",
            "abstract": ". In many industries, multiple parties collaborate on a larger project. At the same time, each of those stakeholders participates in multiple independent projects simultaneously. A double patchwork can thus be identified, with a many-to-many relationship between actors and collaborative projects. One key example is the construction industry, where every project is unique, involving specialists for many subdomains, ranging from the architectural design over technical installations to geospatial information, governmental regulation and sometimes even historical research. A digital representation of this process and its outcomes requires semantic interoperability between these subdomains, which however often work with heterogeneous and unstructured data. In this paper we propose to address this double patchwork via a decentralized ecosystem for multi-stakeholder, multi-industry collaborations dealing with heterogeneous information snippets. At its core, this ecosystem, called ConSolid, builds upon the Solid specifications for Web decentralization, but extends these both on a (meta)data pattern level and on microservice level. To increase the robustness of data allocation and filtering, we identify the need to go beyond Solid\u2019s current LDP-inspired interfaces to a Solid Pod and introduce the concept of metadata-generated \u2018virtual views\u2019, to be generated using an access-controlled SPARQL interface to a Pod. A recursive, scalable way to discover multi-vault aggregations is proposed, along with data patterns for connecting and aligning heterogeneous (RDF and non-RDF) resources across vaults in a mediatype-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the use and benefits of the ecosystem using minimal running examples, concluding with the setup of an example use case from the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry.",

            "abstract": "In many use cases, policies governing data access need to take time into account: for example, in logistics, the location of a delivery vehicle may only be exposed by a recipient for the duration of their delivery. The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) standard, a commonly used policy expressing language, does not support this type of dynamicity. Addressing these use cases requires support to express time-dependent constraints within policy languages, to enforce them in a continuous manner. We created a continuous, interoperable, and modular usage control enforcement framework for dynamic usage control policies, and extended ODRL to support dynamic values in a deterministic manner. This paper details the validation of our solution within a logistics use case. We show that, with a minimal change to ODRL, support for time-dependent constraints can be achieved. This work can provide the ODRL working group with the necessary input that will increase its adoption in domains that depend on time-dependent policies.",

            "abstract": "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a fundamental technology in the Semantic Web, enabling the representation and interchange of structured data. However, RDF lacks the capability to express negated statements in a generic way. As a result, exchanging negative information on a Web scale is thus far restricted to specific cases and predefined statements. The ability to negate (virtually) any RDF statement allows for a comprehensive way to refute, deny or otherwise invalidate claims on a Web scale. Via an intermediate step of a diagrammatic approach to logical expressions called Peirce graphs, we introduce RDF Surfaces, an extension of RDF that incorporates the concept of classic negation, known from first-order logic. Overall, RDF Surfaces provides an abstract, visual approach to negation within the Semantic Web, offering a more general and widely applicable approach than previous attempts at incorporating negation. Aside from a (traditional) programmatic syntax, RDF Surfaces can also be represented visually by means of diagrams inspired by Peirce graphs. We demonstrate negation via RDF Surfaces and how to reason upon it in illustrative use cases drawn from the domains of academic publishing and eHealth. We hope this vision paper attracts new implementers and opens the discussion to its formal specification.",

            "abstract": "Solid is a set of specifications to describe a decentral Web protocol that enables Personal Data Spaces, empowering individuals to keep control of their personal data, stored in decentralized personal online data stores called Pods. Here, Verifiable Credentials (VC) are a type of data of particular interest, as they allow for cryptographically secure and verifiable digital credentials, which can be used for access and identity management, and also tie into different European Data strategy use cases. However, although the use of VCs within Solid is increasingly receiving attention, there exists no VC exchange protocol within Solid. More specifically, current applications need to rely on implicit agreements for both the transfer destination (i.e. the Web location where the VC should be sent to), and the data format of the messages exchanged. This forces stakeholders to invent their own credential transfer mechanisms, thereby hampering interoperability and adoption. In this paper, we present a VC exchange protocol between Solid Pods with explicit target destination and message format. We propose a working and interoperable protocol using DIDComm for structured messaging primitives in the form of JSON-headers and LDN inboxes as target destinations. LDN inboxes are interoperable with Solid and can be advertised via WebIDs, however, their setup and management of LDN inboxes is difficult, and reliance on WebIDs for inbox discovery might prevent interoperability between systems with different identifiers.",

            "abstract": "\n Link traversal\u2013based query processing (ltqp), in which a sparql query is evaluated over a web of documents rather than a single dataset, is often seen as a theoretically interesting yet impractical technique. However, in a time where the hypercentralization of data has increasingly come under scrutiny, a decentralized Web of Data with a simple document-based interface is appealing, as it enables data publishers to control their data and access rights. While (ltqp allows evaluating complex queries over such webs, it suffers from performance issues (due to the high number of documents containing data) as well as information quality concerns (due to the many sources providing such documents). In existing ltqp approaches, the burden of finding sources to query is entirely in the hands of the data consumer. In this paper, we argue that to solve these issues, data publishers should also be able to suggest sources of interest and guide the data consumer toward relevant and trustworthy data. We introduce a theoretical framework that enables such guided link traversal and study its properties. We illustrate with a theoretic example that this can improve query results and reduce the number of network requests. We evaluate our proposal experimentally on a virtual linked web with specifications and indeed observe that not just the data quality but also the efficiency of querying improves.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs have become a foundation for sharing data on the web and building intelligent services across many sectors and also within some of the most successful corporations in the world. The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a \u20ac2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.",

            "title": "Distributed Social Benefit Allocation using Reasoning over Personal Data in Solid",
            "abstract": "When interacting with government institutions, citizens may often be asked to provide a number of documents to various officials, due to the way the data is being processed by the government, and regulation or guidelines that restrict sharing of that data between institutions. Occasionally, documents from third parties, such as the private sector, are involved, as the data, rules, regulations and individual private data may be controlled by different parties. Facilitating efficient flow of information in such cases is therefore important, while still respecting the ownership and privacy of that data. Addressing these types of use cases in data storage and sharing, the Solid initiative allows individuals, organisations and the public sector to store their data in personal online datastores. Solid has been previously applied in data storage within government contexts, so we decided to extend that work by adding data processing services on top of such data and including multiple parties such as citizen and the private sector. However, introducing multiple parties within the data processing flow may impose new challenges, and implementing such data processing services in practice on top of Solid might present opportunities for improvement from the perspective of the implementer of the services. Within this work, together with the City of Antwerp in Belgium, we have produced a proof-of-concept service implementation operating at the described intersection of public sector, citizens and private sector, to manage social benefit allocation in a distributed environment. The service operates on distributed Linked Data stored in multiple Solid pods in RDF, using Notation3 rules to process that data and SPARQL queries to access and modify it. This way, our implementation seeks to respect the design principles of Solid, while taking advantage of the related technologies for representing, processing and modifying Linked Data. This document will describe our chosen use case, service design and implementation, and our observations resulting from this experiment. Through the proof-of-concept implementation, we have established a preliminary understanding of the current challenges in implementing such a service using the chosen technologies. We have identified topics such as verification of data that should be addressed when using such an approach in practice, assumptions related to data locations and tight coupling between our logic between the rules and program code. Addressing these topics in future work should help further the adoption of Linked Data as a means to solve challenges around data sharing, processing and ownership such as with government processes involving multiple parties.",

            "abstract": "Logic can define how agents are provided or denied access to resources, how to interlink resources using mining processes and provide users with choices for possible next steps in a workflow. These decisions are for the most part hidden, internal to machines processing data. In order to exchange this internal logic a portable Web logic is required which the Semantic Web could provide. Combining logic and data provides insights into the reasoning process and creates a new level of trust on the Semantic Web. Current Web logics carries only a fragment of first-order logic (FOL) to keep exchange languages decidable or easily processable. But, this is at a cost: the portability of logic. Machines require implicit agreements to know which fragment of logic is being exchanged and need a strategy for how to cope with the different fragments. These choices could obscure insights into the reasoning process. We created RDF Surfaces in order to express the full expressivity of FOL including saying explicitly `no'. This vision paper provides basic principles and compares existing work. Even though support for FOL is semi-decidable, we argue these problems are surmountable. RDF Surfaces span many use cases, including describing misuse of information, adding explainability and trust to reasoning, and providing scope for reasoning over streams of data and queries. RDF Surfaces provide the direct translation of FOL for the Semantic Web. We hope this vision paper attracts new implementers and opens the discussion to its formal specification.",

            "abstract": "Originally designed as a decentralized ecosystem, the Web has undergone a significant centralization in recent years. In order to regain control over our digital self, we need to understand how we arrived at this point and how we can get back on track. This chapter explains the history of decentralization in a Web context and details Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s role in the continued battle for a free and open Web. The challenges and solutions are not purely technical in nature but rather fit into a larger socio-economic puzzle, to which all of us are invited to contribute. Let us take back the Web for good and leverage its full potential as envisioned by its creator.",
