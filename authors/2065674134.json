            "abstract": "How would randomly shuffling feature vectors among nodes from the same class affect graph neural networks (GNNs)? The feature shuffle, intuitively, perturbs the dependence between graph topology and features (A-X dependence) for GNNs to learn from. Surprisingly, we observe a consistent and significant improvement in GNN performance following the feature shuffle. Having overlooked the impact of A-X dependence on GNNs, the prior literature does not provide a satisfactory understanding of the phenomenon. Thus, we raise two research questions. First, how should A-X dependence be measured, while controlling for potential confounds? Second, how does A-X dependence affect GNNs? In response, we (i) propose a principled measure for A-X dependence, (ii) design a random graph model that controls A-X dependence, (iii) establish a theory on how A-X dependence relates to graph convolution, and (iv) present empirical analysis on real-world graphs that align with the theory. We conclude that A-X dependence mediates the effect of graph convolution, such that smaller dependence improves GNN-based node classification.",

            "abstract": "Hypergraphs are a natural and powerful choice for modeling group interactions in the real world, which are often referred to as higher-order networks. For example, when modeling collaboration networks, where collaborations can involve not just two but three or more people, employing hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for learning and mining on hypergraphs, and hypergraph mining, which seeks to enhance our understanding of underlying systems through hypergraph modeling, gained increasing attention in research. Researchers have discovered various structural patterns in real-world hypergraphs, leading to the development of mining tools. Moreover, they have designed generators with the aim of reproducing and thereby shedding light on these patterns. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for them, and we also provide in-depth discussions to provide insights into future research on hypergraph mining.",

            "abstract": "Desirable random graph models (RGMs) should (i) be tractable so that we can compute and control graph statistics, and (ii) generate realistic structures such as high clustering (i.e., high subgraph densities). A popular category of RGMs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi and stochastic Kronecker) outputs edge probabilities, and we need to realize (i.e., sample from) the edge probabilities to generate graphs. Typically, each edge (in)existence is assumed to be determined independently. However, with edge independency, RGMs theoretically cannot produce high subgraph densities unless they\"replicate\"input graphs. In this work, we explore realization beyond edge independence that can produce more realistic structures while ensuring high tractability. Specifically, we propose edge-dependent realization schemes called binding and derive closed-form tractability results on subgraph (e.g., triangle) densities in graphs generated with binding. We propose algorithms for graph generation with binding and parameter fitting of binding. We empirically validate that binding exhibits high tractability and generates realistic graphs with high clustering, significantly improving upon existing RGMs assuming edge independency.",

Recent advances in generative self-supervised learning (SSL) suggest that hypergraph neural networks learned from generative self supervision have the potential to effectively encode the complex hypergraph topology. Designing a generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs, however, is not straightforward. Questions remain with regard to its generative SSL task, connection to downstream tasks, and empirical properties of learned representations. In light of the promises and challenges, we propose a novel generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs. We first formulate a generative SSL task on hypergraphs, hyperedge filling, and highlight its theoretical connection to node classification. Based on the generative SSL task, we propose a hypergraph SSL method, HypeBoy. HypeBoy learns effective general-purpose hypergraph representations, outperforming 16 baseline methods across 11 benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) is naturally discrete, making machine learning based on differentiable optimization inapplicable. Karalias&Loukas (2020) adapted the probabilistic method to incorporate CO into differentiable optimization. Their work ignited the research on unsupervised learning for CO, composed of two main components: probabilistic objectives and derandomization. However, each component confronts unique challenges. First, deriving objectives under various conditions (e.g., cardinality constraints and minimum) is nontrivial. Second, the derandomization process is underexplored, and the existing derandomization methods are either random sampling or naive rounding. In this work, we aim to tackle prevalent (i.e., commonly involved) conditions in unsupervised CO. First, we concretize the targets for objective construction and derandomization with theoretical justification. Then, for various conditions commonly involved in different CO problems, we derive nontrivial objectives and derandomization to meet the targets. Finally, we apply the derivations to various CO problems. Via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs, we validate the correctness of our derivations and show our empirical superiority w.r.t. both optimization quality and speed.",

Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the weight of its propagation.

In this work, we investigate some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AEROGNN, a novel GNN architecture designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64). On 9 out of 12 node classification benchmarks, AERO-GNN outperforms the baseline GNNs, highlighting the advantages of deep graph attention.

However, merging nodes, which is a realistic operation in many scenarios (e.g., bus station reorganization, multiple team formation), has been overlooked. In this work, we study the problem of improving graph cohesiveness by merging nodes. First, we formulate the problem mathematically using the size of the k-truss, for a given k, as the objective. Then, we prove the NP-hardness and non-modularity of the problem. After that, we develop BATMAN, a fast and effective algorithm for choosing sets of nodes to be merged, based on our theoretical findings and empirical observations.

Graph clustering (i.e., dividing nodes into groups of similar ones) is a fundamental problem in graph analysis with applications in various fields. Recent studies have demonstrated that graph neural network (GNN) based approaches yield promising results for graph clustering. However, we observe that their performance degenerates significantly on graphs with noise edges, which are prevalent in practice. In this work, we propose MetaGC for robust GNN-based graph clustering. MetaGC employs a decomposable clustering loss function, which can be rephrased as a sum of losses over node pairs. We add a learnable weight to each node pair, and MetaGC adaptively adjusts the weights of node pairs using meta-weighting so that the weights of meaningful node pairs increase and the weights of less-meaningful ones (e.g., noise edges) decrease. We show empirically that MetaGC learns weights as intended and consequently outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based competitors, even when they are equipped with separate denoising schemes, on five real-world graphs under varying levels of noise.

These group interactions are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. In graphs, transitivity is helpful to understand the connections between node pairs sharing a neighbor, and it has extensive applications in various domains. Hypergraphs, an extension of graphs, are designed to represent group relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no examination regarding the transitivity of real-world group interactions. In this work, we investigate the transitivity of group interactions in real-world hypergraphs. We first suggest intuitive axioms as necessary characteristics of hypergraph transitivity measures. Then, we propose a principled hypergraph transitivity measure HyperTrans, which satisfies all the proposed axioms, with a fast computation algorithm Fast-HyperTrans. After that, we analyze the transitivity patterns in real-world hypergraphs distinguished from those in random hypergraphs. Lastly, we propose a scalable hypergraph generator THera. It reproduces the observed transitivity patterns by leveraging community structures, which are pervasive in real-world hypergraphs.

            "title": "Characterization of Simplicial Complexes by Counting Simplets Beyond Four Nodes",
            "abstract": "Simplicial complexes are higher-order combinatorial structures which have been used to represent real-world complex systems. In this paper, we concentrate on the local patterns in simplicial complexes called simplets, a generalization of graphlets. We formulate the problem of counting simplets of a given size in a given simplicial complex. For this problem, we extend a sampling algorithm based on color coding from graphs to simplicial complexes, with essential technical novelty. We theoretically analyze our proposed algorithm named SC3, showing its correctness, unbiasedness, convergence, and time/space complexity. Through the extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets, we show the superiority of SC3 in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability, compared to the baseline methods. Finally, we use the counts given by SC3 for simplicial complex analysis, especially for characterization, which is further used for simplicial complex clustering, where SC3 shows a strong ability of characterization with domain-based similarity.",
