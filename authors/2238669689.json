            "abstract": "Recording the provenance of scientific computation results is key to the support of traceability, reproducibility and quality assessment of data products. Several data models have been explored to address this need, providing representations of workflow plans and their executions as well as means of packaging the resulting information for archiving and sharing. However, existing approaches tend to lack interoperable adoption across workflow management systems. In this work we present Workflow Run RO-Crate, an extension of RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) and Schema.org to capture the provenance of the execution of computational workflows at different levels of granularity and bundle together all their associated objects (inputs, outputs, code, etc.). The model is supported by a diverse, open community that runs regular meetings, discussing development, maintenance and adoption aspects. Workflow Run RO-Crate is already implemented by several workflow management systems, allowing interoperable comparisons between workflow runs from heterogeneous systems. We describe the model, its alignment to standards such as W3C PROV, and its implementation in six workflow systems. Finally, we illustrate the application of Workflow Run RO-Crate in two use cases of machine learning in the digital image analysis domain.",

The EOSC-Life Research Infrastructure Cluster project brought together Europe\u2019s Life Science Research Infrastructures to create an Open, Digital and Collaborative space for biological and medical research to develop a cloud-based Workflow Collaboratory. As adopting FAIR practices extends beyond data, the Workflow Collaboratory drives the implementation of FAIR computational workflows and tools. It fosters tool-focused collaborations and reuse via the sharing of data analysis workflows and offers an ecosystem of services for researchers and workflow specialists to find, use and reuse workflows. It\u2019s web-friendly Digital Object Metadata Framework, based on RO-Crate and Bioschemas, supports the description and exchange of workflows across the services.",

            "abstract": "Background The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) Metadata Framework is an established and widely used set of open-source community specifications and software tools for enabling discovery, exchange and publication of metadata from experiments in the life sciences. The original ISA software suite provided a set of user-facing Java tools for creating and manipulating the information structured in ISA-Tab \u2013 a now widely used tabular format. To make the ISA framework more accessible to machines and enable programmatic manipulation of experiment metadata, a JSON serialization ISA-JSON was developed. Results In this work, we present the ISA API, a Python library for the creation, editing, parsing, and validating of ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats by using a common data model engineered as Python class objects. We describe the ISA API feature set, early adopters and its growing user community. Conclusions The ISA API provides users with rich programmatic metadata handling functionality to support automation, a common interface and an interoperable medium between the two ISA formats, as well as with other life science data formats required for depositing data in public databases.",
