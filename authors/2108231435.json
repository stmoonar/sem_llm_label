            "abstract": "This brief investigates the issue of state estimation and unbounded unknown input reconstruction for a class of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear interconnected systems with uncertain output and mismatched unknown input distribution matrix. Based on descriptor augmentation strategy and coordinate transformation, the effect of measurement noise and matched unknown input parts are firstly decoupled. Then, a novel multi-intermediate estimator-assisted unknown input observer is constructed to estimate state and mismatched unknown input. In addition, sufficient conditions in linear matrix inequality (LMI) form is derived to guarantee the stability of the observer and to facilitate observer parameter tuning. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.",

            "abstract": "Recommender system holds the promise of accurately understanding and estimating the user preferences. However, due to the extremely sparse user-item interactions, the learned recommender models can be less robust and sensitive to the highly dynamic user preferences and easily changed recommendation environments. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective robust recommender framework by generating additional samples from the Gaussian distributions. In specific, we design two types of data augmentation strategies. For the first one, we directly produce the data based on the original samples, where we simulate the generation process in the latent space. For the second one, we firstly change the original samples towards the direction of maximizing the loss function, and then produce the data based on the altered samples to make more effective explorations. Based on both of the above strategies, we leverage adversarial training to optimize the recommender model with the generated data which can achieve the largest losses. In addition, we theoretically analyze our framework, and find that the above two data augmentation strategies equal to impose a gradient based regularization on the original recommender models. We conduct extensive experiments based on six real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from the industry and academic communities. While previous models have achieved remarkable successes, an important problem may still hinder their performances, that is, the sparsity of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. In specific, our framework contains a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate high-quality user behavior sequences, while the anchor model is trained based on the original and new generated samples, and leveraged to provide the final recommendation list. To implement the sampler model, we first design four types of heuristic methods based on either random or frequency-based strategies. And then, to improve the quality of the generated sequences, we propose two learning-based samplers by discovering the decision boundaries or increasing the sample informativeness. At last, we build an RL based model to automatically determine where to edit the history behaviors and how many items should be replaced. Considering that the sampler model can be imperfect, we, at last, analyze the influence of the noisy information contained in the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory, and design a simple but effective method to better serve the anchor model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Previous models mostly focus on designing different models to fit the observed data, which can be quite sparse in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel generative session-based recommendation framework. The main building block of our idea is to develop a generator to simulate user sequential behaviors, which are leveraged to train and improve the target sequential recommender model. In order to generate high quality samples, we consider two aspects: (1) the rationality as a sequence of user behaviors, and (2) the informativeness for training the target model. To satisfy these requirements, we design a doubly adversarial network. The first adversarial module aims to make the generated samples conform to the underlying patterns of the real user sequential preference (rationality requirement). The second adversarial module is targeted at widening the model experiences by generating samples which can induce larger model losses (informativeness requirement). In our model, the samples are generated based on a reinforcement learning strategy, where the reward is related with both of the above aspects. In order to stable the training process, we introduce a self-paced regularizer to learn the agent in an easy-to-hard manner. We conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

Existing research focus on designing different models for better fitting the offline datasets. However, the observational data may have been contaminated by the exposure or selection biases, which renders the learned sequential models unreliable. In order to solve this fundamental problem, in this paper, we propose to reformulate the sequential recommendation task with the potential outcome framework, where we are able to clearly understand the data bias mechanism and correct it by re-weighting the training instances with the inverse propensity score (IPS). For more robustness modeling, a clipping strategy is applied to the IPS estimation to reduce the variance of the learning objective. To make our framework more practical, we design a parameterized model to remove the impact of the potential latent confounders. At last, we theoretically analyze the unbiasedness of the proposed framework under both vanilla and clipping IPS estimations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on debiased sequential recommendation. We conduct extensive experiment based on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation basically aims to capture user evolving preference. Intuitively, a user interacts with an item usually because of some specific feature, and user evolving preference is essentially determined by a series of important features along the time line. However, existing sequential models usually represent each item by a unified embedding, which fails to distinguish item features, let along modeling the feature sequences. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel sequential recommender model by learning the key item feature sequences underlying user behaviors, which facilitates more focused model optimization and better recommendation performance. To achieve this goal, we firstly represent each item by explicit or latent features, and then build both soft and hard models to route optimal feature sequences. More specifically, in the soft model, we design a 2D attention mechanism, which simultaneously distinguishes the importances of the items in a sequence and the features for the same item. For the hard model, we regard the feature routing problem as a Markov decision process, and propose a reinforcement learning method to generate feature sequences, which can lead to the lowered negative log-likelihood. In the experiments, we compare our model with the state-of-the-art methods based on real-world datasets, where we can empirically demonstrate 8.2 and 16.1 improvements of our model on NDCG and MRR, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The key of sequential recommendation lies in the accurate item correlation modeling. Previous models infer such information based on item co-occurrences, which may fail to capture the real causal relations, and impact the recommendation performance and explainability. In this paper, we equip sequential recommendation with a novel causal discovery module to capture causalities among user behaviors. Our general idea is firstly assuming a causal graph underlying item correlations, and then we learn the causal graph jointly with the sequential recommender model by fitting the real user behavior data. More specifically, in order to satisfy the causality requirement, the causal graph is regularized by a differentiable directed acyclic constraint. Considering that the number of items in recommender systems can be very large, we represent different items with a unified set of latent clusters, and the causal graph is defined on the cluster level, which enhances the model scalability and robustness. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis on the identifiability of the learned causal graph. To the best of our knowledge, this paper makes a first step towards combining sequential recommendation with causal discovery. For evaluating the recommendation performance, we implement our framework with different neural sequential architectures, and compare them with many state-of-the-art methods based on real-world datasets. Empirical studies manifest that our model can on average improve the performance by about 6.1% and 11.3% on F1 and NDCG, respectively. To evaluate the model explainability, we build a new dataset with human labeled explanations for both quantitative and qualitative analysis.",

Our framework is composed of a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate new user behavior sequences based on the observed ones, while the anchor model is leveraged to provide the final recommendation list, which is trained based on both observed and generated sequences. We design the sampler model to answer the key counterfactual question: \"what would a user like to buy if her previously purchased items had been different?\". Beyond heuristic intervention methods, we leverage two learning-based methods to implement the sampler model, and thus, improve the quality of the generated sequences when training the anchor model. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory and achieve a trade-off between the information and the noise introduced by the generated sequences. Experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate our framework's effectiveness and generality.",

            "abstract": "Due to the nonlinear and time-variant characteristics of a complicate industrial process, modern industrial control engineers are more likely to adopt fuzzy control method. In a fuzzy controller, its core is a group of fuzzy control rules. This paper presents some data mining methods to generate the language variables on which fuzzy control rules' generation depends. These methods are incremental fuzzy clustering algorithm in a batch mode, data weight associated with scale of samples control, divisional threshold value control. These methods can achieve the targets as follows: (1) update the rule base dynamically: (2) limit the samples' infinite growth and adjust controlled model dynamically by real-time information; (3) control the object exactly and quickly.",

            "abstract": "For a class of nonlinear systems that the entire operation region can be divided into several operating regions and the property of each subsystem is linear, a modified fuzzy neural network (FNN) is designed as identifier. The prior knowledge of the system is considered adequately in the FNN model. The local model network of FNN is used to approximate the subsystem of each zone according to ARMAX model. The output of FNN model is the interpolation of local model network outputs with the output of the fuzzy decision-making layer. A new cost function is used when training FNN model. It can reduce over-fit of FNN model.",
