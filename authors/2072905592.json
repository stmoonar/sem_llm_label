            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.",

            "abstract": "Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph GegenConv (TGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency.",

            "title": "LAVA: Data Valuation without Pre-Specified Learning Algorithms",
            "abstract": "Traditionally, data valuation (DV) is posed as a problem of equitably splitting the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training data. As a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of the underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for many DV use cases, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then. Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point, which incurs a large computation burden. This work leapfrogs over the current limits of data valuation methods by introducing a new framework that can value training data in a way that is oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm. Our main results are as follows. (1) We develop a proxy for the validation performance associated with a training set based on a non-conventional class-wise Wasserstein distance between training and validation sets. We show that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the validation performance for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions. (2) We develop a novel method to value individual data based on the sensitivity analysis of the class-wise Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can be directly obtained for free from the output of off-the-shelf optimization solvers when computing the distance. (3) We evaluate our new data valuation framework over various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show that, surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a significant improvement over SOTA performance while being orders of magnitude faster.",

            "abstract": "The great learning ability of deep learning models facilitates us to comprehend the real physical world, making learning to simulate complicated particle systems a promising endeavour. However, the complex laws of the physical world pose significant challenges to the learning based simulations, such as the varying spatial dependencies between interacting particles and varying temporal dependencies between particle system states in different time stamps, which dominate particles' interacting behaviour and the physical systems' evolution patterns. Existing learning based simulation methods fail to fully account for the complexities, making them unable to yield satisfactory simulations. To better comprehend the complex physical laws, this paper proposes a novel learning based simulation model- Graph Networks with Spatial-Temporal neural Ordinary Equations (GNSTODE)- that characterizes the varying spatial and temporal dependencies in particle systems using a united end-to-end framework. Through training with real-world particle-particle interaction observations, GNSTODE is able to simulate any possible particle systems with high precisions. We empirically evaluate GNSTODE's simulation performance on two real-world particle systems, Gravity and Coulomb, with varying levels of spatial and temporal dependencies. The results show that the proposed GNSTODE yields significantly better simulations than state-of-the-art learning based simulation methods, which proves that GNSTODE can serve as an effective solution to particle simulations in real-world application.",

Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.",

            "abstract": "Multivariate time-series anomaly detection is critically important in many applications, including retail, transportation, power grid, and water treatment plants. Existing approaches for this problem mostly employ either statistical models which cannot capture the nonlinear relations well or conventional deep learning (DL) models [e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)] that do not explicitly learn the pairwise correlations among variables. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method, correlation-aware spatial\u2013temporal graph learning (termed CST-GL), for time-series anomaly detection. CST-GL explicitly captures the pairwise correlations via a multivariate time series correlation learning (MTCL) module based on which a spatial\u2013temporal graph neural network (STGNN) can be developed. Then, by employing a graph convolution network (GCN) that exploits one- and multihop neighbor information, our STGNN component can encode rich spatial information from complex pairwise dependencies between variables. With a temporal module that consists of dilated convolutional functions, the STGNN can further capture long-range dependence over time. A novel anomaly scoring component is further integrated into CST-GL to estimate the degree of an anomaly in a purely unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that CST-GL can detect and diagnose anomalies effectively in general settings as well as enable early detection across different time delays.

            "abstract": "Current literature, aiming to surpass the\"Chain-of-Thought\"approach, often resorts to external modi operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. Due to their myopic perspective, they escalate the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways. By employing algorithmic examples fully in-context, this overarching view of the whole process exploits the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and even more recent multi-query strategies that employ an extensive tree search algorithms while using significantly fewer tokens. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application. The code and related content can be found in: https://algorithm-of-thoughts.github.io.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection from graph data is an important data mining task in many applications such as social networks, finance, and e-commerce. Existing efforts in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS, to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark datasets.",

            "title": "How to Sift Out a Clean Data Subset in the Presence of Data Poisoning?",
            "abstract": "Given the volume of data needed to train modern machine learning models, external suppliers are increasingly used. However, incorporating external data poses data poisoning risks, wherein attackers manipulate their data to degrade model utility or integrity. Most poisoning defenses presume access to a set of clean data (or base set). While this assumption has been taken for granted, given the fast-growing research on stealthy poisoning attacks, a question arises: can defenders really identify a clean subset within a contaminated dataset to support defenses? This paper starts by examining the impact of poisoned samples on defenses when they are mistakenly mixed into the base set. We analyze five defenses and find that their performance deteriorates dramatically with less than 1% poisoned points in the base set. These findings suggest that sifting out a base set with high precision is key to these defenses' performance. Motivated by these observations, we study how precise existing automated tools and human inspection are at identifying clean data in the presence of data poisoning. Unfortunately, neither effort achieves the precision needed. Worse yet, many of the outcomes are worse than random selection. In addition to uncovering the challenge, we propose a practical countermeasure, Meta-Sift. Our method is based on the insight that existing attacks' poisoned samples shifts from clean data distributions. Hence, training on the clean portion of a dataset and testing on the corrupted portion will result in high prediction loss. Leveraging the insight, we formulate a bilevel optimization to identify clean data and further introduce a suite of techniques to improve efficiency and precision. Our evaluation shows that Meta-Sift can sift a clean base set with 100% precision under a wide range of poisoning attacks. The selected base set is large enough to give rise to successful defenses.",
