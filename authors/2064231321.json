            "title": "Fair Column Subset Selection",
            "abstract": "The problem of column subset selection asks for a subset of columns from an input matrix such that the matrix can be reconstructed as accurately as possible within the span of the selected columns. A natural extension is to consider a setting where the matrix rows are partitioned into two groups, and the goal is to choose a subset of columns that minimizes the maximum reconstruction error of both groups, relative to their respective best rank-k approximation. Extending the known results of column subset selection to this fair setting is not straightforward: in certain scenarios it is unavoidable to choose columns separately for each group, resulting in double the expected column count. We propose a deterministic leverage-score sampling strategy for the fair setting and show that sampling a column subset of minimum size becomes NP-hard in the presence of two groups. Despite these negative results, we give an approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within 1.5 times the optimal solution size. We also present practical heuristic algorithms based on rank-revealing QR factorization. Finally, we validate our methods through an extensive set of experiments using real-world data.",

            "title": "Generalized Leverage Scores: Geometric Interpretation and Applications",
            "abstract": "In problems involving matrix computations, the concept of leverage has found a large number of applications. In particular, leverage scores, which relate the columns of a matrix to the subspaces spanned by its leading singular vectors, are helpful in revealing column subsets to approximately factorize a matrix with quality guarantees. As such, they provide a solid foundation for a variety of machine-learning methods. In this paper we extend the definition of leverage scores to relate the columns of a matrix to arbitrary subsets of singular vectors. We establish a precise connection between column and singular-vector subsets, by relating the concepts of leverage scores and principal angles between subspaces. We employ this result to design approximation algorithms with provable guarantees for two well-known problems: generalized column subset selection and sparse canonical correlation analysis. We run numerical experiments to provide further insight on the proposed methods. The novel bounds we derive improve our understanding of fundamental concepts in matrix approximations. In addition, our insights may serve as building blocks for further contributions.",

            "abstract": "Signed networks transform the information encoded by conventional graphs by attaching either a positive or a negative sign to every edge. This subtle modification vastly enhances the modelling capabilities of graphs. For instance, in a social network, where edges might represent interactions between users, the sign may determine whether an exchange was friendly or hostile. However, the introduction of edge signs invalidates many established methods and results from the graph-mining toolbox, and thus, problem formulations and algorithmic techniques must be studied anew. In this tutorial we aim to provide an overview of the literature in mining signed networks. We will present the most important theoretical results since their inception to the present day, we will discuss some of the most common applications, and we will reflect on emerging applications and directions for future work.",

            "title": "Finding large balanced subgraphs in signed networks",
            "abstract": "Signed networks are graphs whose edges are labelled with either a positive or a negative sign, and can be used to capture nuances in interactions that are missed by their unsigned counterparts. The concept of balance in signed graph theory determines whether a network can be partitioned into two perfectly opposing subsets, and is therefore useful for modelling phenomena such as the existence of polarized communities in social networks. While determining whether a graph is balanced is easy, finding a large balanced subgraph is hard. The few heuristics available in the literature for this purpose are either ineffective or non-scalable. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for finding large balanced subgraphs in signed networks. The algorithm relies on signed spectral theory and a novel bound for perturbations of the graph Laplacian. In a wide variety of experiments on real-world data we show that our algorithm can find balanced subgraphs much larger than those detected by existing methods, and in addition, it is faster. We test its scalability on graphs of up to 34 million edges.",
