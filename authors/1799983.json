            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

While expert system administrators can install and deploy applications in the systems correctly, this is something that general users can not usually do. The eFlows4HPC project aims to provide methodologies and tools to enable the use and reuse of application workflows. One of the aspects that the project focuses on is simplifying the application deployment in large and complex systems. The approach uses containers, not generic ones, but containers tailored for each target High-Performance Computing (HPC) system. This paper presents the Container Image Creation service developed in the framework of the project and experimentation based on project applications. We compare the performance of the specialized containers against generic containers and against a native installation. The results show that in almost all cases, the specialized containers outperform the generic ones (up to 2\u00d7 faster), and in all cases, the performance is the same as with the native installation.",

These tools have typically been used to support the research on application areas that require them. This poses good initial conditions for Translational Computer Science (TCS), although this does not always occur. This paper describes our experience with the PyCOMPSs project, a programming model for distributed computing. While it is a research instrument for our team, it has also been applied in multiple real use cases under the umbrella of European Funded projects or as part of internal projects between various departments at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The paper illustrates how the authors have engaged in TCS as an underlying research methodology, collecting experiences from three European projects",

            "abstract": "The landscape of workflow systems for scientific applications is notoriously convoluted with hundreds of seemingly equivalent workflow systems, many isolated research claims, and a steep learning curve. To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",

            "abstract": "The adoption of Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is steadily increasing. However, to become fully pervasive, AI needs resources at the edge of the network. The cloud can provide the processing power needed for big data, but edge computing is close to where data are produced and therefore crucial to their timely, flexible, and secure management. In this paper, we introduce the AI-SPRINT project, which will provide solutions to seamlessly design, partition, and run AI applications in computing continuum environments. AI-SPRINT will offer novel tools for AI applications development, secure execution, easy deployment, as well as runtime management and optimization: AI-SPRINT design tools will allow trading-off application performance (in terms of end-to-end latency or throughput), energy efficiency, and AI models accuracy while providing security and privacy guarantees. The runtime environment will support live data protection, architecture enhancement, agile delivery, runtime optimization, and continuous adaptation.",

            "abstract": "This deliverable focuses on the proling activities developed in the project with the partner's applications. To perform this proling activities, a couple of benchmarks were dened in collaboration with WP5. The rst benchmark is an embarrassingly parallel benchmark that performs a read and then multiple writes of the same object, with the objective of stressing the memory and storage systems and evaluate the overhead when these reads and writes are performed in parallel. A second benchmark is dened based on the Continuation Multi Level Monte Carlo (C-MLMC) algorithm. While this algorithm is normally executed using multiple levels, for the proling and performance analysis objectives, the execution of a single level was enough since the forthcoming levels have similar performance characteristics. Additionally, while the simulation tasks can be executed as parallel (multi-threaded tasks), in the benchmark, single threaded tasks were executed to increase the number of simulations to be scheduled and stress the scheduling engines. A set of experiments based on these two benchmarks have been executed in the MareNostrum 4 supercomputer and using PyCOMPSs as underlying programming model and dynamic scheduler of the tasks involved in the executions. While the rst benchmark was executed several times in a single iteration, the second benchmark was executed in an iterative manner, with cycles of 1) Execution and trace generation; 2) Performance analysis; 3) Improvements. This had enabled to perform several improvements in the benchmark and in the scheduler of PyCOMPSs. The initial iterations focused on the C-MLMC structure itself, performing re-factors of the code to remove ne grain and sequential tasks and merging them in larger granularity tasks. The next iterations focused on improving the PyCOMPSs scheduler, removing existent bottlenecks and increasing its performance by making the scheduler a multithreaded engine. While the results can still be improved, we are satised with the results since the granularity of the simulations run in this evaluation step are much ner than the one that will be used for the real scenarios. The deliverable nishes with some recommendations that should be followed along the project in order to obtain good performance in the execution of the project codes.",

            "abstract": "The importance of the programming model in the development of applications has been increasingly more important with the evolution of computing architectures and infrastructures. Aspects such as the number of cores and heterogeneity in the computing nodes, the increase in scale, and new highly distributed environments (the so-called computing continuum) make it even more critical. Superscalar programming models have been proposed as an alternative for the development of parallel and distributed applications. They are a family of task-based programming models that aim at offering a sequential programming interface while enabling a parallel execution in distributed programming environments. Generic aspects supported by the model are: task dependency analysis, parallelism exploitation, data renaming, and data management. Over the years, BSC has developed multiple instances of this family, each of them with some specific aspects depending on the needs and possibilities of the existing computing infrastructure. The talk will present a historical perspective of the superscalar programming models for distributed computing and the challenges that we foresee for the near future.",

The activities have been focused in two aspects: reduction of the storage space used by applications and design and implementation of an interface that optimizes the use of fast local storage by MPI simulations involved in the project applications. In the rst case, for one of the environments involved in the project (PyCOMPSs) the default behavior is to keep all intermediate les until the end of the execution, in case these les are reused later by any additional task. In the case of the other environment (HyperLoom), all les are deleted by default. To unify these two behaviours, the calls \\delete object\" and \\detele le\"have been added to the API and a ag \\keep\" that can be set to true to keep the les and objects that maybe needed later on. We are reporting results on the optimization of the storage needed by a small case of the project application that reduces the storage needed from 25GB to 350MB. The second focus has been on the de nition of an interface that enables the optimization of the use of local storage disk. This optimization focuses on MPI simulations that may be executed across multiple nodes. The added annotation enables to de ne access patters of the processes in the MPI simulations, with the objective of giving hints to the runtime of where to allocate the di erent MPI processes and reduce the data transfers, as well as the storage usage.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Advancing the State-of-the-art of Scientific Workflows Management Systems Research and Development",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.
