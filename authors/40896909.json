            "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed an increasing frequency and intensity of disasters, from extreme weather, drought, and wildfires to hurricanes, floods, and wars. Providing timely disaster response and humanitarian aid to these events is a critical topic for decision makers and relief experts in order to mitigate impacts and save lives. When a disaster occurs, it is important to acquire first-hand, real-time information about the potentially affected area, its infrastructure, and its people in order to develop situational awareness and plan a response to address the health needs of the affected population. This requires rapid assembly of multi-source geospatial data that need to be organized and visualized in a way to support disaster-relief efforts. In this paper, we introduce a new cyberinfrastructure solution\u2014GeoGraphVis\u2014that is empowered by knowledge graph technology and advanced visualization to enable intelligent decision making and problem solving. There are three innovative features of this solution. First, a location-aware knowledge graph is created to link and integrate cross-domain data to make the graph analytics-ready. Second, expert-driven disaster response workflows are analyzed and modeled as machine-understandable decision paths to guide knowledge exploration via the graph. Third, a scene-based visualization strategy is developed to enable interactive and heuristic visual analytics to better comprehend disaster impact situations and develop action plans for humanitarian aid.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a key technique for linking and integrating cross\u2010domain data, concepts, tools, and knowledge to enable data\u2010driven analytics. As much of the world's data have become massive in size, visualizing graph entities and their interrelationships intuitively and interactively has become a crucial task for ingesting and better utilizing graph content to support semantic reasoning, discovering hidden knowledge discovering, and better scientific understanding of geophysical and social phenomena. Despite the fact that many such phenomena (e.g., disasters) have clear spatial footprints and geographic properties, their location information is considered only as a textual label in existing graph visualization tools, limiting their capability to reveal the geospatial distribution patterns of the graph nodes. In addition, most graph visualization techniques rely on 2D graph visualization, which constrains the dimensions of information that can be presented and lacks support for graph structure examination from multiple angles. To tackle the above challenges, we developed a novel 3D map\u2010based graph visualization algorithm to enable interactive exploration of graph content and patterns in a spatially explicit manner. The algorithm extends a 3D force directed graph by integrating a web map, an additional geolocational force, and a force balancing variable that allows for the dynamic adjustment of the 3D graph structure and layout. This mechanism helps create a balanced graph view between the semantic forces among the graph nodes and the attractive force from a geolocation to a graph node. Our solution offers a new perspective in visualizing and understanding spatial entities and events in a knowledge graph.",

            "abstract": "Initiated by the University Consortium of Geographic Information Science (UCGIS), the GIS&T Body of Knowledge (BoK) is a community\u2010driven endeavor to define, develop, and document geospatial topics related to geographic information science and technologies (GIS&T). In recent years, GIS&T BoK has undergone rigorous development in terms of its topic re\u2010organization and content updating, resulting in a new digital version of the project. While the BoK topics provide useful materials for researchers and students to learn about GIS, the semantic relationships among the topics, such as semantic similarity, should also be identified so that a better and automated topic navigation can be achieved. Currently, the related topics are either defined manually by editors or authors, which may result in an incomplete assessment of topic relationships. To address this challenge, our research evaluates the effectiveness of multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques in extracting semantics from text, including both deep neural networks and traditional machine learning approaches. Besides, a novel text summarization\u2014KACERS (Keyword\u2010Aware Cross\u2010Encoder\u2010Ranking Summarizer)\u2014is proposed to generate a semantic summary of scientific publications. By identifying the semantic linkages among key topics, this work guides the future development and content organization of the GIS&T BoK project. It also offers a new perspective on the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing scientific publications and demonstrates the potential of the KACERS summarizer in semantic understanding of long text documents.",

Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

One of these applications and services is smartphone-based vehicle indoor positioning, which is a key technology for smart car parking and driverless cars. So far, most vehicle indoor positioning solutions either use infrastructures (e.g., WiFi access points) or inertial sensors, which suffer from low positioning accuracy, limited coverage, or high cost to deploy new equipment. To tackle these challenges, in this work we propose a novel Deep Learning-based Vehicle Indoor Positioning (DeepVIP) approach using smartphone built-in sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and gravity sensor. Experiments are conducted in indoor parking areas. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a rapidly growing paradigm and technology stack for integrating large-scale, heterogeneous data in an AI-ready form, i.e., combining data with the formal semantics required to understand it. However, toolchains that support data synthesis and knowledge discovery through information organization, search, filtering, and visualization have been developed at a pace lagging knowledge graph technology. In this paper, we present Knowledge Explorer, an open-source faceted search interface that provides environmentally intelligent services for interactively browsing and navigating KnowWhereGraph. Currently one of the largest open knowledge graphs, KnowWhereGraph contains over 12 billion statements with rich spatial and temporal information from more than 30 data layers. With an extensive collection of facets, Knowledge Explorer enables spatial, temporal, full-text, and expert search with dereferencing functionality to support \"follow-your-nose\" exploration, and it allows users to narrow their search by selecting facets. Given the size of the underlying graph and dependency on GeoSPARQL, we have improved query performance by implementing Elasticsearch indexing, spatial query generation, and caching. Knowledge Explorer is capable of retrieving information within seconds, answering a wide variety of competency questions posed by researchers, humanitarian relief organizations, and the broader public, thus helping better perform tasks such as cross-gazetteer place retrieval and disaster assessment from global to local geographic scales.",

            "title": "XDRNet: Deep Learning-based Pedestrian and Vehicle Dead Reckoning Using Smartphones",
            "abstract": "As the city continues to grow, the demand for positioning in large urban buildings and underground spaces has become particularly important. However, due to the obstruction by walls and other structures, satellite signals are subject to extremely strong interference and attenuation indoors, so the indoor positioning accuracy is relatively low compared with outdoor positioning. And with the development of MEMS sensors, it is possible to use inertial navigation on mobile devices. Because of the cumulative error of the integration process, there are problems in using traditional inertial positioning methods on smartphones. In this paper, we presented a deep learning based pedestrian and vehicle Indoor positioning method, XDRNet. This method can get the positioning trajectories of moving objects by learning the relationship between real trajectories and motion states. Then, driving behavior and pedestrian behavior are distinguished by deep neural network method. In this paper, a lightweight network structure is used to make the above method work better on smartphones. Based on the above research, this paper uses the underground parking area of an office building as the experimental area to evaluated the positioning performance of above methods. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of the methods in this paper, which is applicable to both pedestrian and vehicle motion carriers.",

            "title": "A Data-Driven Inertial Navigation/Bluetooth Fusion Algorithm for Indoor Localization",
            "abstract": "The introduction of data-driven inertial navigation provides new opportunities that the pedestrian dead reckoning could not well provide for constraining inertial system error drift on smartphones, and has been considered as another promising approach to meet the requirement of location-based services. However, indoor localization systems based on a single technology still have their limitations, such as the drift of inertial navigation and the received signal strength fluctuation of Bluetooth, making them unable to provide reliable positioning. To exploit the complementary strengths of each technology, this paper proposes a feasible fusion framework by utilizing a particle filter to integrate data-driven inertial navigation with localization based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). For data-driven inertial navigation, under the premise of using the deep neural network with great potential in model-free generalization to regress pedestrian motion characteristics, we effectively combined the method of using gravity to stabilize inertial measurement units data to make the network more robust. Experimental results show that in the test of different smartphone usages, the proposed data-driven inertial navigation and BLE-based localization technology have good results in modeling user\u2019s movement and positioning respectively. And due to this, the proposed fusion algorithm has almost unaffected by the usages of smartphones. Compared with BLE-based localization that achieved a good mean positional error (MPE) of 1.76m, for the four usages of texting, swinging, calling and pocket, the proposed fusion algorithm reduced the MPE by 32.35%, 20.51%, 20.74%, and 45.37%, respectively, and can further improve localization accuracy on the basis of existing fusion method.",

The competition provided a unique overview of the state-of-the-art of systems, technologies, and methods for indoor positioning and navigation purposes. Through fair comparison of the performance achieved by each system, the competition was able to identify the most promising approaches and to pinpoint the most critical working conditions. In 2020, the competition included 5 diverse off-site off-site Tracks, each resembling real use cases and challenges for indoor positioning. The results in terms of participation and accuracy of the proposed systems have been encouraging. The best performing competitors obtained a third quartile of error of 1 m for the Smartphone Track and 0.5 m for the Foot-mounted IMU Track. While not running on physical systems, but only as algorithms, these results represent impressive achievements.",

            "abstract": "Spatial data visualization technology allows users to understand Geographic Information System (GIS) applications. Unlike traditional visualization methods, Augmented Reality (AR) inserts virtual objects and information directly into digital representations of the real world, which makes these objects and data more easily understood and interactive. However, effective AR-GIS systems and rich spatial information visualization is still a challenging task. In addition, indoor AR-GIS systems are further impeded by the limited capacity of these systems to detect and display geometry and semantic information. To address this problem, a novel AR and indoor map fusion method is proposed that automatically registers spatial information onto a live camera view of a mobile phone. We fused Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) localization techniques to track the camera positions. The proposed algorithm extracts and matches a bounding box of the indoor map to a real world scene. We render the indoor map and semantic information into the real world, based on the real-time computed spatial relationship between the indoor map and live camera view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach accurately and richly visualizes spatial information. Our augmented reality and indoor map fusion technique effectively links rich indoor spatial information to real world scenes in AR integrated GIS.",
