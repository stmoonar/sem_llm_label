            "abstract": "To enable precision medicine and remote patient monitoring, internet of healthcare things (IoHT) has gained significant interest as a promising technique. With the widespread use of IoHT, nonetheless, privacy infringements such as IoHT data leakage have raised serious public concerns. On the other side, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have demonstrated great potential for enhancing trustworthiness and privacy protection for IoHT systems. In this survey, a holistic review of existing blockchain-based IoHT systems is conducted to indicate the feasibility of combining blockchain and IoHT in privacy protection. In addition, various types of privacy challenges in IoHT are identified by examining general data protection regulation (GDPR). More importantly, an associated study of cutting-edge privacy-preserving techniques for the identified IoHT privacy challenges is presented. Finally, several challenges in four promising research areas for blockchain-based IoHT systems are pointed out, with the intent of motivating researchers working in these fields to develop possible solutions.",

            "abstract": "Collective decision-making problems consisting of individual decisions are commonly seen in social applications. In this article, the vehicle energy station distribution problem (VESDP) is considered, which is modeled as a network-based collective decision-making problem fulfilling consumers\u2019 requirements by arranging the distribution of energy stations rationally. This problem involves the game among the government and energy station investors. The government intends to maximize the satisfaction of both gas and electric vehicle (EV) customers through policy guidance, while investors aim to maximize their own profits. To solve this problem, we propose an individual evolutionary game model guided by global evolutionary optimization with the following three features. From the individual perspective, we use a network-based evolutionary game with a confidence mechanism to describe the behavior of investors. From the global perspective, we design a genetic algorithm to find out the global-optimized program, which considers the satisfaction of all customers. To heal the divergence between these two perspectives, we design a policy formulation method for the government to motivate selfish investors to adopt strategies in accordance with the overall interests of all customers by using subsidies and taxation. Experiments are performed on both square grid and real-world networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Spatial optimization problems (SOPs) refer to a class of problems where the decision variables require spatial organization. Existing methods based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs) fit conventional evolutionary operators by flattening the spatial representations of SOPs to one dimension, which hence loses crucial spatial structures of the potential solutions. To address this issue, this article proposes a tensorial evolutionary algorithm (TEA) by formulating a tensor space of the SOPs, where the population of candidate solutions is represented as a third-order tensor. Accordingly, we design a tensor-product crossover operator and a two-phase mutation consisting of a local convolutional mutation operator and a global Gaussian mutation operator in the tensor space. These operators are all implemented based on tensor operations. Under the consideration of spatial context on individual solutions, we devise three types of evolutionary tensors, namely, the crossover tensor, the convolutional mutant tensor, and the Gaussian mutant tensor for the three tensorial evolutionary operators correspondingly. The resultant TEA is tested using two typical real-world SOPs, namely, the facility layout problem and the image steganography problem. Comparative experimental studies validate the effectiveness and robustness of TEA.",

            "abstract": "Medical education relies heavily on Simulated Patients (SPs) to provide a safe environment for students to practice clinical skills, including medical image analysis. However, the high cost of recruiting qualified SPs and the lack of diverse medical imaging datasets have presented significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces MedDiT, a novel knowledge-controlled conversational framework that can dynamically generate plausible medical images aligned with simulated patient symptoms, enabling diverse diagnostic skill training. Specifically, MedDiT integrates various patient Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which describe the attributes and symptoms of patients, to dynamically prompt Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior and control the patient characteristics, mitigating hallucination during medical conversation. Additionally, a well-tuned Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model is incorporated to generate medical images according to the specified patient attributes in the KG. In this paper, we present the capabilities of MedDiT through a practical demonstration, showcasing its ability to act in diverse simulated patient cases and generate the corresponding medical images. This can provide an abundant and interactive learning experience for students, advancing medical education by offering an immersive simulation platform for future healthcare professionals. The work sheds light on the feasibility of incorporating advanced technologies like LLM, KG, and DiT in education applications, highlighting their potential to address the challenges faced in simulated patient-based medical education.",

            "abstract": "Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are popular for executing submarine missions, which involve multiple targets distributed in a large and complex underwater environment. The path planning of multiple AUVs is a significant and challenging problem, which determines the location of surface points for AUV launch and plans the paths of AUVs for target traveling. Most existing works model the problem as a single-objective static optimization problem. However, the target missions may change over time, and multiple optimization objectives are usually expected for decision making. Thus, this article models the problem as a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem and proposes a cooperative evolutionary computation algorithm to provide diverse and high-quality solutions for decision makers. In the proposed method, solutions are represented using a bilayer encode scheme, in which the first layer indicates the surface location points and the second layer represents the traveling sequences of target missions. Multiple populations for multiple objectives framework is adopted to efficiently solve the dynamic multiobjective AUV optimization problem. In addition, a recombination-based sampling strategy is developed to improve convergence by fusing the information of multiple populations. Once a change occurs, an incremental response strategy is adopted to generate high-quality solutions for population evolution. Based on the dataset of New Zealand bathymetry, six complex underwater scenarios are constructed with a size of 50 km \u00d7 50 km\u00d7 10 km and 400 target missions for tests. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution diversity and optimality.",

            "abstract": "Note-level automatic singing transcription, involving the extraction of onset, offset, and pitch information from a singing voice, is a crucial process in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), The recent advancements in deep learning models have led to significant progress in this field. However, annotating a training dataset requires professional music expertise, and the entire annotation process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, this field suffers from a severe data scarcity problem. To address this issue, we developed a singing transcription model based on wav2vec 2.0, a pretrained speech representation model. The model can learn from unlabeled speech and weakly-labeled singing data and use this knowledge to benefit the transcription task. The experiments showed that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement over previous approaches on various benchmarks. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance even with a small proportion of training data.",

            "abstract": "Distributed database system (DDBS) technology has shown its advantages with respect to query processing efficiency, scalability, and reliability. Moreover, by partitioning attributes of sensitive associations into different fragments, DDBSs can be used to protect data privacy. However, it is complex to design a DDBS when one has to optimize privacy and utility in a time-varying environment. This article proposes a distributed prediction-randomness framework for the evolutionary dynamic multiobjective partitioning optimization of databases. In the proposed framework, two sub-populations contain individuals representing database partitioning solutions. One sub-population utilizes a Markov chain-based predictor to predict discrete-domain solutions for database partitioning when the environment changes, and the other sub-population utilizes the random initialization operator to maintain population diversity. In addition, a knee-driven migration operator is utilized to exchange information between two sub-populations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing solutions with respect to accuracy, convergence speed, and scalability.",

            "abstract": "Inspired by the success of the text-to-image (T2I) generation task, many researchers are devoting themselves to the text-to-video (T2V) generation task. Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.",

            "abstract": "Density clustering has shown advantages over other types of clustering methods for processing arbitrarily shaped datasets. In recent years, extensive research efforts has been made on the improvements of DBSCAN or the algorithms incorporating the concept of density peaks. However, these previous studies remain the problems of being sensitive to the parameter settings, and some of them will stuck in weak results when encountering the situations of varying-density distributions. To overcome these issues, we propose an evolution framework named EvoS&R that evolves multiple seeds and the corresponding radii for varying-density data clustering. Compared with the traditional methods, EvoS&R handles the parameter tuning and multi-density fitting problems in an integrated and straightforward manner. Note that, however, the underlying task in EvoS&R is a mixed-variable optimization problem that is challenging in nature. We specifically design a hybrid encoding differential evolution algorithm with novel encoding, mutation, etc., to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Extensive experiments on density-based datasets shows that our algorithm outperforms the other state-of-the-arts in most cases, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
