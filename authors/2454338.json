            "abstract": "Recommender systems are omnipresent today, especially on the Web, and the quality of their recommendations is crucial for user satisfaction. Unlike most works on the topic, in this article we do not focus on the algorithmic side of the problem (i.e., searching for the algorithm that better learns from the collected user feedback) and instead study the importance of the data in input to the algorithms, identifying the information that should be collected from users to build better recommendations. We study restaurant recommendations for locals and show that fine-tuned data and state-of-the-art algorithms can outperform the leading recommendation service, TripAdvisor. The findings make a case for better-thought and purpose-tailored data collection techniques.",

            "abstract": "We address the problem of acquiring reliable ratings of items such as restaurants or movies from the crowd. A reliable rating is a truthful rating from a worker that is knowledgeable enough about the item she is rating. We propose a crowdsourcing platform that considers workers\u2019 expertise with respect to the items being rated and assigns workers the best items to rate. In addition, our platform focuses on acquiring ratings for items that only have a few ratings. Traditional crowdsourcing platforms are not suitable for such a task for two reasons. First, ratings are subjective and there is no single correct rating for an item which makes most existing work on predicting the expertise of crowdsourcing workers inapplicable. Second, in traditional crowdsourcing platforms there is no control over task assignment by the requester. In our case, we are interested in providing workers with the best items to rate based on their estimated expertise for the items and the number of ratings the items have. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system using both synthetic and real-world data about",

            "abstract": "People nowadays find it difficult to identify the best places to spend their leisure time performing different activities. Some services have been created to give a complete list of the opportunities offered by the city in which they live, but they overload people with information and make it difficult for them to identify what is more interesting. Personalized recommendations partially solve this problem of overload, but they need a deeper understanding of the personal tastes of people and of the different ways in which people want to spend their leisure time. In this thesis we identify the requirements for a recommender system for leisure activities, study which data are needed and which algorithm better identifies the most interesting options for each requester. We explore the effects of data quality on recommendations, identifying which kind of information is needed to better understand user needs and who can provide better-quality opinions. \nWe analyse the possibility of using crowdsourcing as a means for collecting ratings when volunteering is not providing the needed amount of ratings or when a new dataset of ratings is needed to answer some interesting research questions. Finally, we show how the lessons learned can be applied in practice, presenting a prototype of personalized restaurant recommender service.",

            "abstract": "When we go to the museum, we see many interesting objects that have fascinating stories related to them. However, visitors do not often share these experiences with people that have not visited the exhibition. Sharing is beneficial both because it can create interest and attract people to the museum, and because it can help people who cannot attend the visit (for example, is physically unable to do so) to still enjoy it. We were interested to understand the extent and motivation behind sharing (or not sharing) and test how to encourage visitors to do so. We conducted and are conducting various surveys and trials, for which we report the preliminary results in this paper. Initial findings show that i) people today rarely share their visits for lack of content to complement their storytelling, and ii) by providing visitors with a simple and easy-to-create virtual photobook with their dearest memories from the visit we can significantly enhance this sharing.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we study the factors that affect people's decision in participating in leisure activities in the social and cultural environment. To this end, we collected the ratings of local people from three different cities around the world on standard leisure activities, and looked at the personal, social and contextual features shaping their preferences. We then used this dataset to evaluate how these features can be exploited to recommend places people would actually like. Our initial results suggest that friends are a good source for recommending places, with higher precision and recall than considering only popular places, but these can be improved reducing the scope to similar friends in the context of the particular activity. We have also found that people preferences are sensitive to the companion (e.g., partner, friends, tourists) for which they look for different features. The results also suggest that similarities in the preferences of people can be extended to other activities, which points to the potential of profiling users based on lifestyle. We finally present the design and prototype of a system, namely Come Along, which aims at helping people discover, find and participate to social and leisure activities.",

We demonstrate how current systems cover only partially the social and individual motivations on deciding and teaming up for events, and propose i) a system of implicit and explicit incentives that rewards intention and experience sharing within circles based on friendship or interests and ii) a discovery algorithm that combines the importance of coming along with friends with the personal interests to recommend events. The resulting platform has been applied to generic events as well as domain-specific ones such as shows in movie theaters.",
