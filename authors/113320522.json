            "title": "DANSK and DaCy 2.6.0: Domain Generalization of Danish Named Entity Recognition",
            "abstract": "Named entity recognition is one of the cornerstones of Danish NLP, essential for language technology applications within both industry and research. However, Danish NER is inhibited by a lack of available datasets. As a consequence, no current models are capable of fine-grained named entity recognition, nor have they been evaluated for potential generalizability issues across datasets and domains. To alleviate these limitations, this paper introduces: 1) DANSK: a named entity dataset providing for high-granularity tagging as well as within-domain evaluation of models across a diverse set of domains; 2) DaCy 2.6.0 that includes three generalizable models with fine-grained annotation; and 3) an evaluation of current state-of-the-art models' ability to generalize across domains. The evaluation of existing and new models revealed notable performance discrepancies across domains, which should be addressed within the field. Shortcomings of the annotation quality of the dataset and its impact on model training and evaluation are also discussed. Despite these limitations, we advocate for the use of the new dataset DANSK alongside further work on the generalizability within Danish NER.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces v0.5 of the AI Safety Benchmark, which has been created by the MLCommons AI Safety Working Group. The AI Safety Benchmark has been designed to assess the safety risks of AI systems that use chat-tuned language models. We introduce a principled approach to specifying and constructing the benchmark, which for v0.5 covers only a single use case (an adult chatting to a general-purpose assistant in English), and a limited set of personas (i.e., typical users, malicious users, and vulnerable users). We created a new taxonomy of 13 hazard categories, of which 7 have tests in the v0.5 benchmark. We plan to release version 1.0 of the AI Safety Benchmark by the end of 2024. The v1.0 benchmark will provide meaningful insights into the safety of AI systems. However, the v0.5 benchmark should not be used to assess the safety of AI systems. We have sought to fully document the limitations, flaws, and challenges of v0.5. This release of v0.5 of the AI Safety Benchmark includes (1) a principled approach to specifying and constructing the benchmark, which comprises use cases, types of systems under test (SUTs), language and context, personas, tests, and test items; (2) a taxonomy of 13 hazard categories with definitions and subcategories; (3) tests for seven of the hazard categories, each comprising a unique set of test items, i.e., prompts. There are 43,090 test items in total, which we created with templates; (4) a grading system for AI systems against the benchmark; (5) an openly available platform, and downloadable tool, called ModelBench that can be used to evaluate the safety of AI systems on the benchmark; (6) an example evaluation report which benchmarks the performance of over a dozen openly available chat-tuned language models; (7) a test specification for the benchmark.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of a varying number of ordered clusters from sets of any cardinality is a challenging task for neural networks, combining elements of set representation, clustering and learning to order. This task arises in many diverse areas, ranging from medical triage and early discharge, through machine part management and multi-channel signal analysis for petroleum exploration to product catalog structure prediction. This paper focuses on that last area, which exemplifies a number of challenges inherent to adaptive ordered clustering, referred to further as the eponymous Cat-alog Problem . These include learning variable cluster constraints, exhibiting relational reasoning and managing combinatorial complexity. Despite progress in both neural clustering and set-to-sequence methods, no joint, fully differentiable model exists to-date. We develop such a modular architecture, referred to further as Neural Ordered Clusters (NOC), enhance it with a specific mechanism for learning cluster-level cardinality constraints, and provide a robust comparison of its performance in relation to alternative models. We test our method on three datasets, including synthetic catalog structures and PROCAT, a dataset of real-world catalogs consisting of over 1 . 5 M products, achieving state-of-the-art results on a new, more challenging formulation of the underlying problem, which has not been addressed before. Additionally, we examine the network\u2019s ability to learn higher-order interactions.",

            "title": "Assessing Language Model Deployment with Risk Cards",
            "abstract": "This paper introduces RiskCards, a framework for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with an application of language models. As with all language, text generated by language models can be harmful, or used to bring about harm. Automating language generation adds both an element of scale and also more subtle or emergent undesirable tendencies to the generated text. Prior work establishes a wide variety of language model harms to many different actors: existing taxonomies identify categories of harms posed by language models; benchmarks establish automated tests of these harms; and documentation standards for models, tasks and datasets encourage transparent reporting. However, there is no risk-centric framework for documenting the complexity of a landscape in which some risks are shared across models and contexts, while others are specific, and where certain conditions may be required for risks to manifest as harms. RiskCards address this methodological gap by providing a generic framework for assessing the use of a given language model in a given scenario. Each RiskCard makes clear the routes for the risk to manifest harm, their placement in harm taxonomies, and example prompt-output pairs. While RiskCards are designed to be open-source, dynamic and participatory, we present a\"starter set\"of RiskCards taken from a broad literature survey, each of which details a concrete risk presentation. Language model RiskCards initiate a community knowledge base which permits the mapping of risks and harms to a specific model or its application scenario, ultimately contributing to a better, safer and shared understanding of the risk landscape.",

Large model sizes makes computational cost one of the main limiting factors for training and evaluating such models; and has raised severe concerns about the sustainability, reproducibility, and inclusiveness for researching PLMs. These concerns are often based on personal experiences and observations. However, there had not been any large-scale surveys that investigate them. In this work, we provide a first attempt to quantify these concerns regarding three topics, namely, environmental impact, equity, and impact on peer reviewing. By conducting a survey with 312 participants from the NLP community, we capture existing (dis)parities between different and within groups with respect to seniority, academia, and industry; and their impact on the peer reviewing process. For each topic, we provide an analysis and devise recommendations to mitigate found disparities, some of which already successfully implemented. Finally, we discuss additional concerns raised by many participants in free-text responses.",

We propose an efficient method with small model sizes and less training data with only 2-8 training instances per class. Our proposed method, AncSetFit, targets low-data scenarios by anchoring the task and label information through sentence embeddings in fine-tuning a Sentence Transformer model. It uses contrastive learning and a triplet loss to enforce training instances of a class to be closest to its own textual semantic label information in the embedding space - and thereby learning to embed different class instances more distinct. AncSetFit obtains strong performance in data-sparse scenarios compared to existing methods across SST-5, Emotion detection, and AG News data, even with just two examples per class.",

In the past years, many NLP tasks have been introduced in this area, with some systems reaching good results on English language datasets. Existing AI based approaches for fighting misinformation in literature suggest automatic stance detection as an integral first step to success. Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for English to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a non-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target languages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques from Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human expertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a supervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar results for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in this work, as are found for English. We also provide a stance detection dataset in the Zulu language. Our experimental results show that by leveraging English datasets and machine translation we can increase performances on both English data along with other languages.",
