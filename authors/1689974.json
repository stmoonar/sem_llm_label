            "abstract": "Personalized recommendations have a growing importance in direct marketing, which motivates research to enhance customer experiences by knowledge graph (KG) applications. For example, in financial services, companies may benefit from providing relevant financial articles to their customers to cultivate relationships, foster client engagement and promote informed financial decisions. While several approaches center on KG-based recommender systems for improved content, in this study we focus on interpretable KG-based recommender systems for decision making.To this end, we present two knowledge graph-based approaches for personalized article recommendations for a set of customers of a large multinational financial services company. The first approach employs Reinforcement Learning and the second approach uses the XGBoost algorithm for recommending articles to the customers. Both approaches make use of a KG generated from both structured (tabular data) and unstructured data (a large body of text data).Using the Reinforcement Learning-based recommender system we could leverage the graph traversal path leading to the recommendation as a way to generate interpretations (Path Directed Reasoning (PDR)). In the XGBoost-based approach, one can also provide explainable results using post-hoc methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and ELI5 (Explain Like I am Five).Importantly, our approach offers explainable results, promoting better decision-making. This study underscores the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques with KG-driven insights to bolster experience in customer relationship management.",

This manually constructed part of the wordnet is to be eventually integrated with the automatically generated/manually checked part covering the whole of the rest of the Old English lexicon (currently under construction). We present the workflow for the definition of these emotion synsets on the basis of a dataset produced by a specialist in this area. We also look at the enrichment of the original Global WordNet Association Lexical Markup Framework (GWA LMF) schema to include the extra information which this part of the OldEWN requires. In the final part of the article we discuss how the wordnet style of lexicon organisation can be used to share and disseminate research findings/datasets in lexical semantics.",

The article begins with an overview of some recent trends which have had a significant impact on linked data models and vocabularies. Next, we give a general overview of existing vocabularies and models for different categories of LLD resource. After which we look at some of the latest developments in community standards and initiatives including descriptions of recent work on the OntoLex-Lemon model, a survey of recent initiatives in linguistic annotation and LLD, and a discussion of the LLD metadata vocabularies META-SHARE and lime. In the next part of the paper, we focus on the influence of projects on LLD models and vocabularies, starting with a general survey of relevant projects, before dedicating individual sections to a number of recent projects and their impact on LLD vocabularies and models. Finally, in the conclusion, we look ahead at some future challenges for LLD models and vocabularies. The appendix to the paper consists of a brief introduction to the OntoLex-Lemon model.",

Users of language resources have different needs in terms of format, language, topics, etc. for the data they need to use. Linghub (McCrae and Cimiano, 2015) was first developed for this purpose, using the capabilities of linked data to represent metadata, and tackling the heterogeneous metadata issue. Linghub aimed at helping language resources and technology users to easily find and retrieve relevant data, and identify important information on access, topics, etc. This work describes a rejuvenation and modernisation of the 2015 platform into using a popular open source data management system, DSpace, as foundation. The new platform, Linghub2, contains updated and extended resources, more languages offered, and continues the work towards homogenisation of metadata through conversions, through linkage to standardisation strategies and community groups, such as the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) community group.",

            "abstract": "Word senses are the fundamental unit of description in lexicography, yet it is rarely the case that different dictionaries reach any agreement on the number and definition of senses in a language. With the recent rise in natural language processing and other computational approaches there is an increasing demand for quantitatively validated sense catalogues of words, yet no consensus methodology exists. In this paper, we look at four main approaches to making sense distinctions: formal, cognitive, distributional, and intercultural and examine the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We then consider how these may be combined into a single sound methodology. We illustrate this by examining two English words, \u201cwing\u201d and \u201cfish,\u201d using existing resources for each of these four approaches and illustrate the weaknesses of each. We then look at the impact of such an integrated method and provide some future perspectives on the research that is necessary to reach a principled method for making sense distinctions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the sentiment of a comment from a video or an image is an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark.",
