            "title": "Sustainable Grain Transportation in Ukraine Amidst War Utilizing KNARM and KnowWhereGraph",
            "abstract": "In this work, we propose a sustainable path-finding application for grain transportation during the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine. This application is to build a suite of algorithms to find possible optimal paths for transporting grain that remains in Ukraine. The application uses the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology(KNARM) and the KnowWhereGraph to achieve this goal. Currently, we are working towards creating an ontology that will allow for a more effective heuristic approach by incorporating the lessons learned from the KnowWhereGraph. The aim is to enhance the path-finding process and provide more accurate and efficient results. In the future, we will continue exploring and implementing new techniques that can further improve the sustainability of the path-finding applications with a knowledge graph backend for grain transportation through hazardous and adversarial environments. The code is available upon reviewer\u2019s request. It can not be made public due to the sensitive nature of the data.",

            "abstract": "A knowledge graph focusing on water quality in relation to health risks posed by water activities (such as diving or swimming) is not currently available. To address this limitation, we first use existing resources to construct a knowledge graph relevant to water quality and health risks using KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM). Subsequently, we explore knowledge graph completion approaches for maintaining and updating the graph. Specifically, we manually identify a set of domain-specific UMLS concepts and use them to extract a graph of approximately 75,000 semantic triples from the Semantic MEDLINE database (which contains head-relation-tail triples extracted from PubMed). Using the resulting knowledge graph, we experiment with the KG-BERT approach for graph completion by employing pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa models and also models fine-tuned on a collection of water quality and health risks abstracts retrieved from the Web of Science. Experimental results show that KG-BERT with BERT/RoBERTa models fine-tuned on a domain-specific corpus improves the performance of KG-BERT with pre-trained models. Furthermore, KG-BERT gives better results than several translational distance or semantic matching baseline models.",

(156) Technological advancements in many fields have led to huge increases in data production, including data volume, diversity, and the speed at which new data is becoming available. In accordance with this, there is a lack of conformity in the ways data is interpreted. In-depth analyses making use of various data types and data sources, and extracting knowledge has become one of the many challenges with this big data. This is especially the case in life-sciences where simplification and flattening of diverse data types often leads to incorrect predictions. Effective applications of big data approaches in the life sciences require better, knowledge-based, semantic models that are suitable as a framework for big data integration, while avoiding overly extreme simplification, such as reducing various biological data types to the gene level. A major challenge in developing such semantic knowledge models, or ontologies, is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Automated methods are still very limited and significant human expertise is required. In this research, we describe a methodology to systematize this knowledge acquisition and representation challenge, termed KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM). We also present how KNARM was applied on three ontologies: BioAssay Ontology (BAO), LINCS FramEwork Ontology (LIFE) ,and Drug Target Ontology (DTO) built for three different projects: BioAssay Ontology, Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), and Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG), and how they work together in complex queries.",
