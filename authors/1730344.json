            "abstract": "Addressing the complexities of querying unstructured graphs such as knowledge graphs and social networks, this paper introduces D KWS, a novel distributed keyword search system. Leveraging a monotonic property, we ensure correct parallelization of our advanced keyword search algorithm, which incorporates tight pruning bounds and is divided into monotonic backward and forward search phases. The system is further augmented by the notify-push paradigm and the PINE programming model, facilitating asynchronous communication and preemptive searches to mitigate staleness in distributed environments. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate DKWS's performance advantage, being up to two orders of magnitude faster and incurring 7.6 times lower communication costs than the existing systems.",

Traditionally, PC chairs take a \"manual\" approach to form a PC. In practice, however, such an approach, might not create a diverse PC w.r.t. certain dimensions. Furthermore, it has been reported that the traditional manual approach may lead to dense coauthorship networks among PC members. All these aspects can easily make it challenging in practice to ensure fair and quality assignments of reviewers to submissions. In this article, we share our experiences and results of installing a novel data-driven PC-chair-inthe- loop PC formation framework for EDBT 2023 to mitigate some of the challenges brought by traditional PC formation methods.",

            "title": "DARKER: Efficient Transformer with Data-driven Attention Mechanism for Time Series",
            "abstract": "\n Transformer-based models have facilitated numerous applications with superior performance. A key challenge in transformers is the quadratic dependency of its training time complexity on the length of the input sequence. A recent popular solution is using random feature attention (RFA) to approximate the costly vanilla attention mechanism. However, RFA relies on only a single, fixed projection for approximation, which does not capture the input distribution and can lead to low efficiency and accuracy, especially on time series data. In this paper, we propose DARKER, an efficient transformer with a novel\n DA\n ta-d\n R\n iven\n KER\n nel-based attention mechanism. To precisely present the technical details, this paper discusses them with a fundamental time series task, namely, time series classification (tsc). First, the main novelty of DARKER lies in approximating the softmax kernel by learning multiple machine learning models with trainable weights as multiple projections offline, moving beyond the limitation of a fixed projection. Second, we propose a projection index (called pIndex) to efficiently search the most suitable projection for the input for training transformer. As a result, the overall time complexity of DARKER is linear with the input length. Third, we propose an indexing technique for efficiently computing the inputs required for transformer training. Finally, we evaluate our method on 14 real-world and 2 synthetic time series datasets. The experiments show that DARKER is 3\u00d7-4\u00d7 faster than vanilla transformer and 1.5\u00d7-3\u00d7 faster than other SOTAs for long sequences. In addition, the accuracy of DARKER is comparable to or higher than that of all compared transformers.\n",

            "abstract": "JSON keyword search searches the current versions of documents in a collection. However, JSON documents change over time due to edits. Some applications, such as data forensics and auditing, need to search past versions of documents and for changes to documents. This paper introduces a system called Temporal JSON Keyword Search (TJKS) for search in a collection of JSON documents that vary over time. TJKS lets users control which temporal slice, or part of the history, can be searched using a temporal search semantics; we support both of the major temporal semantics: sequenced and nonsequenced search. This paper presents the semantics of temporal JSON keyword search, discusses an efficient implementation, and evaluates the implementation. Our extensions are largely orthogonal to specific keyword search techniques, so this research provides a blueprint for extending keyword search to include time and potentially other kinds of metadata.",

Visual query interfaces (VQIs) are popular lowand industry (for example, PubChema) are increasingly exposing VQIs to enable an end user to draw a subgraph search query interactively without writing a single line of code in a proprietary QL. We focus on two novel streams of research that exploit the central role played by no-code visual environments in subgraph search. First, classical VQI frameworks for low-code/ no-code search suffers from several limitations, such as high creation and maintenance cost, lack of superior support for no-code subgraph query formulation, and poor portability across application domains and data sources.2 We introduce the paradigm",

            "abstract": "A key learning goal of learners taking a database systems course is to understand how SQL queries are processed in an RDBMS in practice. To this end, comprehension of different alternative query plans (AQPs) that may be considered during the selection of the query execution plan (QEP) of a query is paramount. In this demonstration, we present a novel and generic system called ARENA that facilitates exploration of informative alternative query plans of a given SQL query to aid the comprehension of QEP selection. Under the hood, ARENA addresses a novel problem called informative plan selection problem (TIPS) which aims to discover alternative plans from the underlying plan space so that the plan informativeness is maximized. We demonstrate various innovative features of ARENA emphasizing the important role it can play in supplementing database education.",
