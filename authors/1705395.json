            "abstract": "Finding the right users to be chosen as targets for advertising campaigns is not a trivial task, and it may allow important commercial advantages. A novel approach is presented here for the recommendation of new possible consumers to brands interested in distributing advertising campaigns, ranked according to the \u201ccompatibility\u201d between users and brands. A database containing both descriptions associated with different brands, and textual information about users\u2019 opinions on different topics, is required in input. Then, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to measure to what extent the users match with the brands, based on the texts associated with their opinions. The approach has been tested on both synthetic and real datasets, and with two different formulations, showing promising results in all the considered experiments.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation An interesting problem is to study how gene co-expression varies in two different populations, associated with healthy and unhealthy individuals, respectively. To this aim, two important aspects should be taken into account: (i) in some cases, pairs/groups of genes show collaborative attitudes, emerging in the study of disorders and diseases; (ii) information coming from each single individual may be crucial to capture specific details, at the basis of complex cellular mechanisms; therefore, it is important avoiding to miss potentially powerful information, associated with the single samples. Results Here, a novel approach is proposed, such that two different input populations are considered, and represented by two datasets of edge-labeled graphs. Each graph is associated to an individual, and the edge label is the co-expression value between the two genes associated to the nodes. Discriminative patterns among graphs belonging to different sample sets are searched for, based on a statistical notion of \u2018relevance\u2019 able to take into account important local similarities, and also collaborative effects, involving the co-expression among multiple genes. Four different gene expression datasets have been analyzed by the proposed approach, each associated to a different disease. An extensive set of experiments show that the extracted patterns significantly characterize important differences between healthy and unhealthy samples, both in the cooperation and in the biological functionality of the involved genes/proteins. Moreover, the provided analysis confirms some results already presented in the literature on genes with a central role for the considered diseases, still allowing to identify novel and useful insights on this aspect. Availability and implementation The algorithm has been implemented using the Java programming language. The data underlying this article and the code are available at https://github.com/CriSe92/DiscriminativeSubgraphDiscovery.",

In the last few years, different types of topological measures have been introduced and applied to infer the biological relevance of network components/interactions, according to their position within the network structure. Although comparisons of such measures have been previously proposed, to what extent the topology per se may lead to the extraction of novel biological knowledge has never been critically examined nor formalized in the literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present a comparative analysis of nine outstanding topological measures, based on compact views obtained from the rank they induce on a given input biological network. The goal is to understand their ability in correctly positioning nodes/edges in the rank, according to the functional knowledge implicitly encoded in biological networks. To this aim, both internal and external (gold standard) validation criteria are taken into account, and six networks involving three different organisms (yeast, worm and human) are included in the comparison. The results show that a distinct handful of best-performing measures can be identified for each of the considered organisms, independently from the reference gold standard.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nInput files and code for the computation of the considered topological measures and K-haus distance are available at https://gitlab.com/MaryBonomo/ranking.\n\n\nCONTACT\nsimona.rombo@unipa.it.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.",

While different features can be extracted from the raw data, only few of them are actually relevant and effective for the classification process. Since relevant features are often unknown a priori, many candidate features are usually introduced. This degrades both the speed and the predictive accuracy of the classifier due to the presence of redundancy in the feature candidate set. We propose a class of features for image classification based on the notion of irredundant bidimensional pair-patterns, and we present an algorithm for image classification based on their extraction. The devised technique scales well on parallel multi-core architectures, as witnessed by the experimental results that have been obtained exploiting a benchmark image dataset.",

            "abstract": "Motivation: Although the nucleosome occupancy along a genome can be in part predicted by in vitro experiments, it has been recently observed that the chromatin organization presents important differences in vitro with respect to in vivo. Such differences mainly regard the hierarchical and regular structures of the nucleosome fiber, whose existence has long been assumed, and in part also observed in vitro, but that does not apparently occur in vivo. It is also well known that the DNA sequence has a role in determining the nucleosome occupancy. Therefore, an important issue is to understand if, and to what extent, the structural differences in the chromatin organization between in vitro and in vivo have a counterpart in terms of the underlying genomic sequences. Results: We present the first quantitative comparison between the in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps of two model organisms (S. cerevisiae and C. elegans). The comparison is based on the construction of weighted k\u2010mer dictionaries. Our findings show that there is a good level of sequence conservation between in vitro and in vivo in both the two organisms, in contrast to the abovementioned important differences in chromatin structural organization. Moreover, our results provide evidence that the two organisms predispose themselves differently, in terms of sequence composition and both in vitro and in vivo, for the nucleosome occupancy. This leads to the conclusion that, although the notion of a genome encoding for its own nucleosome occupancy is general, the intrinsic histone k\u2010mer sequence preferences tend to be species\u2010specific.

A functional network is a graph where nodes represent cellular components (e.g., genes, proteins, mRNA, etc.) and edges represent associations among such molecules. Different types of components may cohesist in the same network, and associations may be related to physical[biochemical interactions or functional/phenotipic relationships. Due to both the large amount of involved information and the computational complexity typical of the problems in this domain, the proposed framework is based on big data technologies (Spark and NoSQL databases).

Entropic profiles are based on information theory principles, and can be used to study the under-/over-representation of subwords, by also providing information about the scale of conserved DNA regions. Here, we focus on the algorithmic aspects related to entropic profiles. In particular, we propose linear time algorithms for their computation that rely on suffix-based data structures, more specifically on the truncated suffix tree (TST) and on the enhanced suffix array (ESA).

In this work we propose a novel strategy useful to intercept candidate coding sequences resulting from some possible editing substitutions on the start and stop codons of a given input organism DNA. Our method is based on the simulation of the RNA editing mechanism, in order to generate candidate Open Reading Frame (ORF) sequences that could code for some, yet unknown, proteins.

Much less so in epigenomics, although the role of k-mers in chromatin organization and nucleosome positioning is particularly relevant. Fundamental questions concerning the informational content and compositional structure of nucleosome favouring and disfavoring sequences with respect to their basic building blocks still remain open.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present the first analysis on the role of k-mers in the composition of nucleosome enriched and depleted genomic regions (NER and NDR for short) that is: (i) exhaustive and within the bounds dictated by the information-theoretic content of the sample sets we use and (ii) informative for comparative epigenomics. We analize four different organisms and we propose a paradigmatic formalization of k-mer dictionaries, providing two different and complementary views of the k-mers involved in NER and NDR. The first extends well known studies in this area, its comparative nature being its major merit. The second, very novel, brings to light the rich variety of k-mers involved in influencing nucleosome positioning, for which an initial classification in terms of clusters is also provided. Although such a classification offers many insights, the following deserves to be singled-out: short poly(dA:dT) tracts are reported in the literature as fundamental for nucleosome depletion, however a global quantitative look reveals that their role is much less prominent than one would expect based on previous studies.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nDictionaries, clusters and Supplementary Material are available online at http://math.unipa.it/rombo/epigenomics/.\n\n\nCONTACT\nsimona.rombo@unipa.it\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Clustering PPI networks can be useful for isolating groups of interacting proteins that participate in the same biological processes or that perform together specific biological functions. Evolutionary orthologies can be inferred this way, as well as functions and properties of yet uncharacterized proteins.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present an overview of the main state-of-the-art clustering methods that have been applied to PPI networks over the past decade. We distinguish five specific categories of approaches, describe and compare their main features and then focus on one of them, i.e. population-based stochastic search. We provide an experimental evaluation, based on some validation measures widely used in the literature, of techniques in this class, that are as yet less explored than the others. In particular, we study how the capability of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to extract clusters in PPI networks varies when different topology-based fitness functions are used, and we compare GAs with the main techniques in the other categories. The experimental campaign shows that predictions returned by GAs are often more accurate than those produced by the contestant methods. Interesting issues still remain open about possible generalizations of GAs allowing for cluster overlapping.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nWe point out which methods and tools described here are publicly available.\n\n\nCONTACT\nsimona.rombo@math.unipa.it\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

            "abstract": "Several approaches have been presented in the literature to cluster Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks. They can be grouped in two main categories: those allowing a protein to participate in different clusters and those generating only nonoverlapping clusters. In both cases, a challenging task is to find a suitable compromise between the biological relevance of the results and a comprehensive coverage of the analyzed networks. Indeed, methods returning high accurate results are often able to cover only small parts of the input PPI network, especially when low-characterized networks are considered. We present a coclustering-based technique able to generate both overlapping and nonoverlapping clusters. The density of the clusters to search for can also be set by the user. We tested our method on the two networks of yeast and human, and compared it to other five well-known techniques on the same interaction data sets. The results showed that, for all the examples considered, our approach always reaches a good compromise between accuracy and network coverage. Furthermore, the behavior of our algorithm is not influenced by the structure of the input network, different from all the techniques considered in the comparison, which returned very good results on the yeast network, while on the human network their outcomes are rather poor.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, the amount of biological interaction data discovered and stored in public databases (e.g., KEGG [2]) considerably increased. To this aim, RDF is a powerful representation for interactions (or pathways), since they can be modeled as directed graphs, often referred to as biological networks, where nodes represent cellular components and the (labeled or unlabeled) edges correspond to interactions among components. Often for a given organism some components are known to be linked by well studied interactions. Such groups of components are called modules and they can be represented by sub-graphs in the corresponding biological network model. At today, one of the most important problems for biologists is that of querying the interaction dataset of an organism by a specific module exploited as the query. The aim is to discover if such a module is contained in the input interaction dataset. In this scenario biological variations (e.g. insertions and/or deletions of both nodes and edges) due to the evolution need to be considered in the search process, thus that approximate matching is more effective than exact matching. Typically the problem is reconducted to the search of all the subgraphs in the biological network (i.e. the input graph database) that are isomorphic to the given module (i.e. the query graph). Since such a test is known to be an NP-hard problem, many proposals introduce heuristics (i.e. similarity or distance measurements) and particular indexing structures to reduce the overall complexity (e.g., [3, 4]).",

In these approaches, an image is decomposed into a number of patches, consisting each of a square or rectangular solid block. This paper proposes image compression techniques based on patches that are not necessarily solid blocks, but are affected instead by a controlled number of undetermined or don't care pixels. Such patches are chosen from a set of candidate motifs that are extracted in turn from the image 2D motif basis, the latter consisting of a compact set of patterns that result from the autocorrelation of the image with itself. As is expected, it is found that limited indeterminacy can be traded for higher compression at the expense of negligible loss. Preliminary experiments show that this technique yields higher compression than other popular techniques such as GZip, BZip and Jpeg.",

Known methods that perform these tasks operate symmetrically, i.e., they do not assign a distinct role to the input PPI networks. However, in most cases, the input networks are indeed distinguishable on the basis of how the corresponding organism is biologically well characterized. In this paper a new idea is developed, that is, to exploit differences in the characterization of organisms at hand in order to devise methods for comparing their PPI networks. We use the PPI network (called Master) of the best characterized organism as a fingerprint to guide the alignment process to the second input network (called Slave), so that generated results preferably retain the structural characteristics of the Master network. Technically, this is obtained by generating from the Master a finite automaton, called alignment model, which is then fed with (a linearization of) the Slave for the purpose of extracting, via the Viterbi algorithm, matching subgraphs. We propose an approach able to perform global alignment and network querying, and we apply it on PPI networks. We tested our method showing that the results it returns are biologically relevant.",

These solutions are made of dense sub-matrices containing the maximum number of ones. The algorithm considers an initial random solution, constituted by a single protein, that is then evolved to search for a locally optimal solution by adding/removing connected proteins that best contribute to improve the quality function.

            "abstract": "We propose an algorithm, called BI-GRAPPIN, to search for similarities across PPI networks. The technique core consists in computing a maximum weight matching of bipartite graphs to compare the neighborhoods of pairs of proteins in different PPI networks. The idea is that proteins belonging to different networks should be matched look- ing not only at their own sequence similarity, but also at the similarity of proteins they \"strongly\" interact with, ei- ther directly or indirectly. We implemented the method and tested it on both real and synthetic data, showing its effec- tiveness in solving ambiguous situations and in individuat- ing functionally related proteins. Differently from previous work, the presented algorithm allows to take into account both quantitative and reliability information possibly avail- able about interactions.",

            "abstract": "In this paper a technique to improve protein secondary structure prediction is proposed. The approach is based on the idea of combining the results of a set of prediction tools, choosing the most correct parts of each prediction. The correctness of the resulting prediction is measured referring to accuracy parameters used in several editions of CASP. Experimental evaluations validating the proposed approach are also reported.",
