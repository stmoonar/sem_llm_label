            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

In recent survey the submission of efficient system in maintaining and analyzing PB level structured data is otherwise said to be Banian. Storage structure limits in relational database has been crossed higher level compared storage structure. It effectively integrates interactive query was in a higher scale in the storage management . It has a same query interface to the cross platform dataset . It has two importance such as compatibility and scalability . The important stages in the Banian system architecture are: (1) Storage layer with help of HDFS for the massive data where storage is distributed; (2) for parallel database using splitting and scheduling technology we can perform scheduling and execution layer; (3) standard SQL provides cross platform query interface for application layer. Query optimization to a higher range 30times improved in Banian. To provide and enhance the performance and parallel execution.",

            "abstract": "With the evolution of modern technology wireless sensor nodes are finding a lot of applications in day to day life starting from smart home system to military surveillance. The primary building block of a wireless sensor network is a spatially distributed set of autonomous sensor nodes or motes. In order to design a wireless sensor network it is necessary to understand the structure and working of a sensor node. The sensor nodes can be considered as tiny battery powered computers that consists of a computing subsystem, communication subsystem, sensor subsystem, power subsystem. In this paper we review the features of these subsystems so that it is easy for the application developer to quickly understand and select the type of component for building customized sensor node platform. In this paper we have studied the features of different microprocessors and transceivers properties used in sensor nodes. We also study the classifications of sensors based on applications, the relevant sensor parameters, and different storage devices with their properties. This paper can be a ready reference to beginners interested in this field. One more major problem of wireless sensor network application that should be addressed is the limited lifetime of sensor nodes due to energy constraints. We also review how energy harvesting can increase the lifetime of a wireless sensor network and the possible methods that can be implemented for energy harvesting.",

            "abstract": "Images require substantial storage and transmission resources, thus image compression is advantageous to overcome these difficulties. This paper presents Application of DWT for image processing. The main objectives of this paper are image compression, reconstruction, pattern recognition and image data hiding. First, in compression of two-dimensional image data is divided an image into blocks of size N x M and then computed the DWT of each block at the finest spatial resolution. The blocks of transformed coefficients were classified into type HH, HL, LH and LL. Again, block LL can be used to classify four more blocks in second level. Each class consisted of group of blocks of size (N/2) x (M/2) of similar type. Then these blocks are quantized using SPIHT (Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees) Algorithm to get a compressed image (i.e. bit stream). Reconstruction of image follows exactly reverse process i.e. inverse SPIHT and inverse DWT. The reconstructed image will be equivalent to original image. New algorithms are developed for pattern recognition and image data hiding, Secondly DWT based feature for pattern recognition. This algorithm is based on binary comparison using X-OR operation and Hamming distance algorithms. Since here binary comparison is done, the DWT is used to enable better recognition accuracy. Finally, this paper presents image data hiding. In this, compressed image (bit stream image or called signature image) is embedded into a dummy image (or called host image). This is done using bit replacement technique. The quality of embedded image cannot be identified by human visual system.",

It has been referred to as a disruptive technology which has implications on a host of issues such as licensing, scalability, cost and performance measures, privacy and security. We propose in this paper a flexible distributed storage integrity auditing mechanism, utilizing the homomorphic token and distributed erasure-coded data. Our method achieves the integrity of storage correctness guaranty and identification of misbehaving servers i.e. whenever data modifications or deletions have been detected during the storage correctness verification and error localization across cloud servers. The performance analysis shows that our scheme is more secure than existing system against Byzantine failure,",
