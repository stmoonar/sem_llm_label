            "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, the current techniques for generating such examples rely on deterministic heuristic rules, which fail to produce optimal adversarial examples. In response, this study proposes a new method called the Fraud's Bargain Attack (FBA), which uses a randomization mechanism to expand the search space and produce high-quality adversarial examples with a higher probability of success. FBA uses the Metropolis-Hasting sampler, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, to improve the selection of adversarial examples from all candidates generated by a customized stochastic process called the Word Manipulation Process (WMP). The WMP method modifies individual words in a contextually-aware manner through insertion, removal, or substitution. Through extensive experiments, this study demonstrates that FBA outperforms other methods in terms of attack success rate, imperceptibility and sentence quality.",

            "title": "Unveiling Hidden Implicit Similarities for Cross-Domain Recommendation",
            "abstract": "E-commerce businesses are increasingly dependent on recommendation systems to introduce personalized services and products to targeted customers. Providing effective recommendations requires sufficient knowledge about user preferences and product (item) characteristics. Given the current abundance of available data across domains, achieving a thorough understanding of the relationship between users and items can bring in more collaborative filtering power and lead to a higher recommendation accuracy. However, how to effectively utilize different types of knowledge obtained across domains is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to discover both explicit and implicit similarities from latent factors across domains based on matrix tri-factorization. In our research, common factors in a shared dimension (users or items) of two coupled matrices are discovered, while at the same time, domain-specific factors of the shared dimension are also preserved. We will show that such preservation of both common and domain-specific factors are significantly beneficial to cross-domain recommendations. Moreover, on the non-shared dimension, we propose to use the middle matrix of the tri-factorization to match the unique factors, and align the matched unique factors to transfer cross-domain implicit similarities and thus further improve the recommendation. This research is the first that proposes the transfer of knowledge across the non-shared (non-coupled) dimensions. Validated on real-world datasets, our approach outperforms existing algorithms by more than two times in terms of recommendation accuracy. These empirical results illustrate the potential of utilizing both explicit and implicit similarities for making across-domain recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial images, while their robustness in text classification are rarely studied. Several lines of text attack methods have been proposed in the literature, such as character-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. However, it is still a challenge to minimize the number of word distortions necessary to induce misclassification, while simultaneously ensuring the lexical correctness, syntactic correctness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose the Bigram and Unigram based Monotonic Heuristic Search (BU-MHS) method to examine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has three major merits. Firstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level but also at the bigram level to avoid producing meaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input words with both their synonyms and sememe candidates, which greatly enriches potential substitutions compared to only using synonyms. Lastly, we design a search algorithm, i.e., Monotonic Heuristic Search (MHS), to determine the priority of word replacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost in an adversarial attack. We evaluate the effectiveness of BU-MHS on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by attacking four state-of-the-art DNNs models. Experimental results show that our BU-MHS achieves the highest attack success rate by changing the smallest number of words compared with other existing models.",

            "abstract": "Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are known immensely brittle towards text adversarial examples. Recent attack algorithms usually adopt word-level substitution strategies following a pre-computed word replacement mechanism. However, their resultant adversarial examples are still imperfect in achieving grammar correctness and semantic similarities, which is largely because of their unsuitable candidate word selections and static optimization methods. In this research, we propose BESA, a BERT-based Simulated Annealing algorithm, to address these two problems. Firstly, we leverage the BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) to generate contextual-aware candidate words to produce fluent adversarial text and avoid grammar errors. Secondly, we employ Simulated Annealing (SA) to adaptively determine the word substitution order. The SA provides sufficient word replacement options via internal simulations, with an objective to obtain both a high attack success rate and a low word substitution rate. Besides, our algorithm is able to jump out of local optima with a controlled probability, making it closer to achieve the best possible attack (i.e., the global optima). Experiments on five popular datasets manifest the superiority of BESA compared with existing methods, including TextFooler, BAE, BERT-Attack, PWWS, and PSO.",

            "abstract": "Real-world traffic sign recognition is an important step toward building autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient-based attack, score-based attack, decision-based attack, and transfer-based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because 1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast moving car and 2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real-world road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas\u2014this also helps to generate natural perturbations; 2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance of the pretrained attention map; 3) we design a simple objective function that can be easily optimized; and 4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real-world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability. We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility: https://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proven an effective way to extract high-level features from remote sensing (RS) images automatically. Many variants of the CNN model have been proposed, including principal component analysis network (PCANet), canonical correlation analysis network (CCANet), multiple scale CCANet (MS-CCANet) and multiview CCANet (MCCANet). The PCANet is specialized for single view feature abstraction, while in many real-world practices, the RS data are frequently observed from many more views. Although CCANet, MS-CCANet and MCCANet can be applied to two or more view data, they consider only the pair-wise correlation by calculating a series of two-order covariance matrices. However, the high-order consistence, which can only be explored by collectively and simultaneously examining all views, remains undiscovered. In this paper, we propose the tensor canonical correlation analysis network (TCCANet) to tackle this problem. Particularly, TCCANet learns filter banks by simultaneously maximizing arbitrary number of views with high-order-correlation and solves the optimization problem by decomposing a covariance tensor. After the convolutional stage, we utilize binarization and block-wise histogram strategies to generate the final feature. Furthermore, we also develop a Multiple Scale version of TCCANet, i.e., MS-TCCANet, to extract enriched representation of the RS data by incorporating all previous convolutional layers. Numerical experiment results on RSSCN7 and SAT-6 datasets demonstrate the advantages of TCCANet and MS-TCCANet for RS scene recognition.",

In this research, we propose game theoretical learning between a variational adversary and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), participating in a variable-sum two-player sequential Stackelberg game.

Our ideal adversarial manipulation is a minimum change to the data which yet is large enough to mislead the CNNs. We propose an optimization procedure to find optimal adversarial manipulations by solving for the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Specifically, the adversary's payoff function depends on the data manipulation which is determined by a Variational Autoencoder, while the CNN classifier's payoff functions are evaluated by misclassification errors. The optimization of our adversarial manipulations is defined by Alternating Least Squares and Simulated Annealing. Experimental results demonstrate that our game-theoretic manipulations are able to mislead CNNs that are well trained on the original data as well as on data generated by other models. We then let the CNNs to incorporate our manipulated data which leads to secure classifiers that are empirically the most robust in defending various types of adversarial attacks.",

            "abstract": "We develop an adversarial learning algorithm for supervised classification in general and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in particular. The algorithm's objective is to produce small changes to the data distribution defined over positive and negative class labels so that the resulting data distribution is misclassified by the CNN. The theoretical goal is to determine a manipulating change on the input data that finds learner decision boundaries where many positive labels become negative labels. Then we propose a CNN which is secure against such unforeseen changes in data. The algorithm generates adversarial manipulations by formulating a multiplayer stochastic game targeting the classification performance of the CNN. The multiplayer stochastic game is expressed in terms of multiple two-player sequential games. Each game consists of interactions between two players\u2014an intelligent adversary and the learner CNN\u2014such that a player's payoff function increases with interactions. Following the convergence of a sequential noncooperative Stackelberg game, each two-player game is solved for the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium finds a pair of strategies (learner weights and evolutionary operations) from which there is no incentive for either learner or adversary to deviate. We then retrain the learner over all the adversarial manipulations generated by multiple players to propose a secure CNN which is robust to subsequent adversarial data manipulations. The adversarial data and corresponding CNN performance is evaluated on MNIST handwritten digits data. The results suggest that game theory and evolutionary algorithms are very effective in securing deep learning models against performance vulnerabilities simulated as attack scenarios from multiple adversaries.",

In binary classification, for example, when only a subset of positive instances is labeled whereas the remaining are unlabeled, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is required to model from both positive and unlabeled data. Similarly, when class labels are corrupted by mislabeled instances, methods are needed for learning in the presence of class label noise (LN). Here we propose adaptive sampling (AdaSampling), a framework for both PU learning and learning with class LN. By iteratively estimating the class mislabeling probability with an adaptive sampling procedure, the proposed method progressively reduces the risk of selecting mislabeled instances for model training and subsequently constructs highly generalizable models even when a large proportion of mislabeled instances is present in the data. We demonstrate the utilities of proposed methods using simulation and benchmark data, and compare them to alternative approaches that are commonly used for PU learning and/or learning with LN. We then introduce two novel bioinformatics applications where AdaSampling is used to: 1) identify kinase-substrates from mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data and 2) predict transcription factor target genes by integrating various next-generation sequencing data.",
