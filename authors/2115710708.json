            "abstract": "With the rapid development of 5G Internet of things technology, the traditional WebGIS visualization technology can not meet the needs of Oilfield Engineering for the integration and visualization of various sensor monitoring data. This paper uses the most advanced ecarts open source data visualization technology, combined with the basic architecture of WebGIS, to realize the multi-dimensional and comprehensive visualization of all kinds of sensor data with temporal and spatial characteristics, and improve the ability of integration and analysis of multi-source data.",

It integrates the ComGIS technology of MapX to the fire attemper commanding Management, combining the data supplement of the fire alarm accepting system. It offers the bran-new resolvent and technology project. Visual Basic and MapX are used to integrate the fire protection attemper commanding Management Information system, adopting the Oracle 9i as the database foundation of the system. The system combines the fire alarm accepting system to the nice orientation and the recourse project, which should be the new modernized approach in the fire protection attemper commanding management.",
