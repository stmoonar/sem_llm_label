            "abstract": "Multivariate time series find extensive applications in conjunction with machine learning methodologies for scenario forecasting across various domains. Nevertheless, certain domains exhibit inherent complexities and diversities, which detrimentally impact the predictive efficacy of global models. This ongoing study introduces a Subset Modeling Framework designed to acknowledge the inherent diversity within a domain\u2019s multivariate space. Comparative assessments between subset models and global models are conducted in terms of performance, revealing compelling findings and suggesting the potential for further exploration and refinement of this novel framework.",

            "title": "Discovering Denial Constraints in Dynamic Datasets",
            "abstract": "Denial constraints (DCs) are data dependencies with high expressive power, offering great flexibility for modeling data quality rules. Specifying DCs manually is problematic, as the required domain expertise is expensive and scarce. Moreover, database updates can invalidate DCs thought to hold and simultaneously uncover new DCs. This fact leads to burdensome scenarios where experts must often revisit DC specifications. Several algorithms have been devised to discover DCs from data, among which only one considers DC discovery on data updates. However, that solution underperforms in many scenarios due to long runtime and excessive memory use. Also, it targets database inserts only, so no previous solution covers deletions. This paper proposes an efficient and flexible algorithm that covers the earlier limitations regarding performance and scope. The algorithm maintains small-footprint intermediate structures during database updates and a method that exploits the changes in this intermediate to update the DCs incrementally. The results of our extensive experimental evaluation show that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the existing one, with much better scalability in the size of the data updates.",

            "abstract": "The success of machine learning (ML) systems depends on data availability, volume, quality, and efficient computing resources. A challenge in this context is to reduce computational costs while maintaining adequate accuracy of the models. This paper presents a framework to address this challenge. The idea is to identify \u201csubdomains\u201d within the input space, train local models that produce better predictions for samples from that specific subdomain, instead of training a single global model on the full dataset. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets. Our results indicate that subset modelling (i) improves the predictive performance compared to a single global model and (ii) allows data-efficient training.",
