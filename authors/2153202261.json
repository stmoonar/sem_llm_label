            "abstract": "Brain network analysis is vital for understanding the neural interactions regarding brain structures and functions, and identifying potential biomarkers for clinical phenotypes. However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.",

            "abstract": "Biological networks are commonly used in biomedical and healthcare domains to effectively model the structure of complex biological systems with interactions linking biological entities. However, due to their characteristics of high dimensionality and low sample size, directly applying deep learning models on biological networks usually faces severe overfitting. In this work, we propose R-MIXUP, a Mixup-based data augmentation technique that suits the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of adjacency matrices from biological networks with optimized training efficiency. The interpolation process in R-MIXUP leverages the log-Euclidean distance metrics from the Riemannian manifold, effectively addressing the swelling effect and arbitrarily incorrect label issues of vanilla Mixup. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MIXUP with five real-world biological network datasets on both regression and classification tasks. Besides, we derive a commonly ignored necessary condition for identifying the SPD matrices of biological networks and empirically study its influence on the model performance. The code implementation can be found in Appendix D.",

Within the complex brain system, differences in neuronal connection strengths parcellate the brain into various functional modules (network communities), which are critical for brain analysis. However, identifying such communities within the brain has been a non-trivial issue due to the complexity of neuronal interactions. In this work, we propose a novel interpretable transformer-based model for joint hierarchical cluster identification and brain network classification. Extensive experimental results on real-world brain network datasets show that with the help of hierarchical clustering, the model achieves increased accuracy and reduced runtime complexity while providing plausible insight into the functional organization of brain regions.",

            "abstract": "Recent neuroimaging studies have highlighted the importance of network-centric brain analysis, particularly with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The emergence of Deep Neural Networks has fostered a substantial interest in predicting clinical outcomes and categorizing individuals based on brain networks. However, the conventional approach involving static brain network analysis offers limited potential in capturing the dynamism of brain function. Although recent studies have attempted to harness dynamic brain networks, their high dimensionality and complexity present substantial challenges. This paper proposes a novel methodology, Dynamic bRAin Transformer (DART), which combines static and dynamic brain networks for more effective and nuanced brain function analysis. Our model uses the static brain network as a baseline, integrating dynamic brain networks to enhance performance against traditional methods. We innovatively employ attention mechanisms, enhancing model explainability and exploiting the dynamic brain network\u2019s temporal variations. The proposed approach offers a robust solution to the low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals, a recurring issue in direct DNN modeling. It also provides valuable insights into which brain circuits or dynamic networks contribute more to final predictions. As such, DRAT shows a promising direction in neuroimaging studies, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of brain organization and the role of neural circuits.",

The key component of TBDS is the brain network generator which adopts a DAG learning approach to transform the raw time-series into task-aware brain connectivities. Besides, we design an additional contrastive regularization to inject task-specific knowledge during the brain network generation process. Comprehensive experiments on two fMRI datasets, namely Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TBDS. In addition, the generated brain networks also highlight the prediction-related brain regions and thus provide unique interpretations of the prediction results.

Deep neural network models have led a tremendous success in various downstream tasks. However, common property in brain network data, the small number of samples compared with the huge amount of features, hinders the application of deep learning techniques for brain network analysis.

            "title": "Transformer-Based Hierarchical Clustering for Brain Network Analysis (Extended Abstract)",
            "abstract": "Brain networks, graphical models such as those constructed from MRI, have been widely used in pathological prediction and analysis of brain functions. Within the complex brain system, differences in neuronal connection strengths parcellate the brain into various functional modules (network communities), which are critical for brain analysis. However, identifying such communities within the brain has been a nontrivial issue due to the complexity of neuronal interactions. In this work, we propose a novel interpretable transformer-based model for joint hierarchical cluster identification and brain network classification with three main contributions. First, we offer an end-to-end transformer-based approach to learning clustering assignments. Through pairwise attention, a clustering layer, BCluster, and a transformer encoder collaboratively learn a globally shared clustering assignment that is continuously tuned to downstream tasks. BCluster enhances the model\u2019s performance and reduces run time complexity while also providing clinical insights. Second, we propose a hierarchical structure for the clustering model, enabling the model to learn more abstract, higher-level cluster representations by combining lower-level modules. Each clustering layer is attached to a distinct readout module, which allows the model to utilize the cluster embeddings of every layer effectively. Last but not least, we redesign the attention mechanism of the transformer with stochastic noise, which enhances its cluster learning capability. We compare our model\u2019s performance with SOTA models and perform clustering analysis with the ground truth community labels. Extensive experimental results show that with the help of hierarchical clustering, the model achieves increased accuracy and reduced runtime complexity while providing plausible insight into the functional organization of brain regions.",

            "abstract": "Mapping the connectome of the human brain using structural or functional connectivity has become one of the most pervasive paradigms for neuroimaging analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivated from geometric deep learning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for modeling complex networked data. Despite their superior performance in many fields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective GNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a benchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the process by (1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both functional and structural neuroimaging modalities and (2) modularizing the implementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for effective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible research on GNN-based brain network analysis, we host the BrainGB website at https://braingb.us with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an out-of-box Python package. We hope that this work will provide useful empirical evidence and offer insights for future research in this novel and promising direction.",

            "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most common imaging modalities to investigate brain functions. Recent studies in neuroscience stress the great potential of functional brain networks constructed from fMRI data for clinical predictions. Traditional functional brain networks, however, are noisy and unaware of downstream prediction tasks, while also incompatible with the deep graph neural network (GNN) models. In order to fully unleash the power of GNNs in network-based fMRI analysis, we develop FBNETGEN, a task-aware and interpretable fMRI analysis framework via deep brain network generation. In particular, we formulate (1) prominent region of interest (ROI) features extraction, (2) brain networks generation, and (3) clinical predictions with GNNs, in an end-to-end trainable model under the guidance of particular prediction tasks. Along with the process, the key novel component is the graph generator which learns to transform raw time-series features into task-oriented brain networks. Our learnable graphs also provide unique interpretations by highlighting prediction-related brain regions. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets, i.e., the recently released and currently largest publicly available fMRI dataset Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), and the widely-used fMRI dataset PNC, prove the superior effectiveness and interpretability of FBNETGEN. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Wayfear/FBNETGEN.",
