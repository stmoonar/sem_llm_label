            "abstract": "Generative modeling has been used frequently in synthetic data generation. Fairness and privacy are two big concerns for synthetic data. Although Recent GAN [\\cite{goodfellow2014generative}] based methods show good results in preserving privacy, the generated data may be more biased. At the same time, these methods require high computation resources. In this work, we design a fast, fair, flexible and private data generation method. We show the effectiveness of our method theoretically and empirically. We show that models trained on data generated by the proposed method can perform well (in inference stage) on real application scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Neural Topic Models (NTM), inspired by variational autoencoders, have attracted a lot of research interest; however, these methods have limited applications in the real world due to the challenge of incorporating human knowledge. This work presents a semi-supervised neural topic modeling method, vONTSS, which uses von Mises-Fisher (vMF) based variational autoencoders and optimal transport. When a few keywords per topic are provided, vONTSS in the semi-supervised setting generates potential topics and optimizes topic-keyword quality and topic classification. Experiments show that vONTSS outperforms existing semi-supervised topic modeling methods in classification accuracy and diversity. vONTSS also supports unsupervised topic modeling. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that vONTSS in the unsupervised setting outperforms recent NTMs on multiple aspects: vONTSS discovers highly clustered and coherent topics on benchmark datasets. It is also much faster than the state-of-the-art weakly supervised text classification method while achieving similar classification performance. We further prove the equivalence of optimal transport loss and cross-entropy loss at the global minimum.",

To address these two challenging problems, we devised a graph-inspired deep learning approach that uses data from human-body mounted wearable sensors. As a step toward a complete HAR solution, the proposed method was further used to build a deep transfer learning model. Specifically, we present a multi-layer residual structure involving graph convolutional neural network (ResGCNN) toward the sensor-based HAR tasks, namely the HAR-ResGCNN approach. Experimental results on the PAMAP2 and mHealth data sets demonstrate that our ResGCNN is effective at capturing the characteristics of actions with comparable results compared to other sensor-based HAR models (with an average accuracy of 98.18% and 99.07%, respectively). More importantly, the parameter-based transfer learning experiments using the ResGCNN model show excellent transferability and small sample learning ability, which is a promising solution in sensor-based HAR applications.",

As a continued effort, we extend the framework presented in our earlier work [17] to discover and refine cognitive models of learning with learning data. The framework includes 1. a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that models and clusters cognitive learning patterns; 2. a multidimensional measure that quantifies validity and reliability of the discovered cognitive models of learning; 3. a topic-based solution that interprets the cognitive models from a linguistic perspective; and 4. a simulation-based analysis for both accuracy measures and course refinement insights. We demonstrate the end-to-end solution with two applications and four case studies that are deployed in an openly navigated learning system in a workforce learning environment. We also report the usefulness of the discovered cognitive models of learning with subject matter expert evaluation.",

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) extensions and deep learning based approaches have demonstrated improved mastery prediction accuracy compared to the basic BKT model; however, neither set of models provides actionable guidance on learning activities beyond mastery prediction. We propose a novel framework for personalized knowledge tracing with attention mechanism. Our proposed framework incorporates auxiliary learner attributes into knowledge tracing and interprets mastery prediction with the learning attributes. The proposed approach can also provide personalized next best learning activity recommendations. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed approach in mastery prediction is slightly higher compared to deep learning based approaches and that the proposed approach can provide personalized next best learning activity recommendation.",

We propose using Alexa, a voice-controlled Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA), in e-learning to provide in-person practice to achieve some desired learning goals. With Alexa enabled learning experiences, learners are able to practice with other students (one role of Alexa) or receive immediate feedback from teachers (another role of Alexa) in an e-learning environment. We propose a configuration driven conversation engine, which can support instructional designers to create diverse in-person practice opportunities in e-learning. We demonstrate that learning designers can create an Alexa activity with a few configuration steps. We also share results on the effectiveness of an Alexa activity with formative assessment evaluation in real world applications.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning based knowledge tracing approaches achieve high accuracy in mastery prediction with pattern extraction on a large learning behavior data set. However, when there is little training data available, these approaches either fail to extract the key patterns or result in over fitting. Ideally, we aim to provide a similar learning experience to both the first group of learners, who interact with a new course or a new activity with little learning behavior data to provide personalized guidance, and the learners who interact with the course later. We propose a novel architecture, Attentive Neural Turing Machine (ANTM), to solve the cold start knowledge tracing problem. The proposed ANTM comprises an attentive controller module and differential reading and writing processes with extra memory bank. Accuracy (ACC) and Area Under Curve (AUC) measures are used for model performance comparison. Results show the proposed approach can learn fast and generalize well to unseen data. It achieves around 95% ACC trained with only 3 learners, while conventional deep learning based approaches achieve only 65% ACC with over prediction issues.",

            "abstract": "Intelligent systems designed using machine learning algorithms require a large number of labeled data. Background knowledge provides complementary, real-world factual information that can augment the limited labeled data to train a machine learning algorithm. The term Knowledge Graph (KG) is in vogue as for many practical applications, it is convenient and useful to organize this background knowledge in the form of a graph. Recent academic research and implemented industrial intelligent systems have shown promising performance for machine learning algorithms that combine training data with a knowledge graph. In this article, we discuss the use of relevant KGs to enhance the input data for two applications that use machine learning\u2014recommendation and community detection. The KG improves both accuracy and explainability.",
