            "title": "Persona-PhysioSync AV: Personalized Interaction through Personality and Physiology Monitoring in Autonomous Vehicles",
            "abstract": "The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a transformative leap in transportation technology. Central to the success of AVs is ensuring user safety, but this endeavor is accompanied by the challenge of establishing trust and acceptance of this novel technology. The traditional \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to AVs may limit their broader societal, economic, and cultural impact. Here, we introduce the Persona-PhysioSync AV (PPS-AV). It adopts a comprehensive approach by combining personality traits with physiological and emotional indicators to personalize the AV experience to enhance trust and comfort. A significant aspect of the PPS-AV framework is its real-time monitoring of passenger engagement and comfort levels within AVs. It considers a passenger\u2019s personality traits and their interaction with physiological and emotional responses. The framework can alert passengers when their engagement drops to critical levels or when they exhibit low situational awareness, ensuring they regain attentiveness promptly, especially during Take-Over Request (TOR) events. This approach fosters a heightened sense of Human\u2013Vehicle Interaction (HVI), thereby building trust in AV technology. While the PPS-AV framework currently provides a foundational level of state diagnosis, future developments are expected to include interaction protocols that utilize interfaces like haptic alerts, visual cues, and auditory signals. In summary, the PPS-AV framework is a pivotal tool for the future of autonomous transportation. By prioritizing safety, comfort, and trust, it aims to make AVs not just a mode of transport but a personalized and trusted experience for passengers, accelerating the adoption and societal integration of autonomous vehicles.",

            "abstract": "PurposeThe 2020 Coronavirus pandemic forced universities to hastily transition to eLearning on a mass scale, necessitating the identification of populations who are more challenged by the transition. This study aims to identify how students\u2019 level of introversion/extraversion and digital literacy come to play in their satisfaction with the eLearning environment.Design/methodology/approachThe analysis examined 272 Israeli students who moved from a face-to-face learning environment to a Zoom learning environment between March\u2013July 2020, following the outbreak of the pandemic. All the participants completed two rounds of surveys, and 62 of the 272 participants were then interviewed, and their social network was mapped using a sociogram.FindingsFindings indicated that, in accordance with the \u201cpoor get richer\u201d hypothesis, introverts expressed more satisfaction from the transition to the video-conferencing Zoom platform than extraverts. In addition, for highly introverted people, high digital literacy was significantly associated with increased course satisfaction, whereas for highly extraverted people, a high number of social ties with peers from the course was associated with course satisfaction.Originality/valueAs expected, the study\u2019s findings shows that there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach for online learning. Learners with different personalities can benefit from learning environments that foster greater satisfaction with the learning experience. Online platforms can, and should, be designed in a way that offers this needed personalization, and this study provides initial principles that can inform such personalization.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/OIR-01-2023-0028",

            "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that a prolonged feeling of loneliness is a major risk factor for psychopathology among children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between patterns of social media use with loneliness and psychopathology among 65 adolescents who were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and treated at a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Israel. Social capital (online and offline) was negatively associated with loneliness. There was no association between loneliness and patterns of social media use, age, gender, psychiatric diagnosis, or disease severity. Our findings indicate that both online and offline social capital are associated with loneliness, and highlight the importance of studying the effect of peer online social support in alleviating loneliness.",

            "abstract": "Suicide, one of the top causes of life lost in developed countries, is a major health problem, especially today, with the dramatic increase in mental health difficulties that was triggered during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Opportunely, the recent emergence of internet-based crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk) may accelerate research on suicide prevention, however, this type of suicide research online involves a difficult ethical challenge: how to keep participants\u2019 safe without compromising their privacy. To address this ethical challenge, a consortium of experts from multiple research institutions was assembled. The consortium discussed the advantages and disadvantages for participants involved in crowdsourcing-based studies that address suicide risk. This discussion resulted in a consensual step-by-step protocol for researchers who wish to conduct suicide research online, using the crowdsourcing platforms. This article provides a detailed description of the protocol and outlines key ethical arguments that led to its formulation. Unresolved issues are discussed as well and other researchers are encouraged to implement the proposed protocol and suggest further improvements. It is our hope that the current protocol will facilitate the research on large and diverse populations online and thus contribute to the global efforts to reduce suicide rates around the world.",

A driverless vehicle will transport its passengers to their destinations. User experience would be enhanced by adapting the workings of the vehicle in line with the personality of its user. An autonomic car information system preference questionnaire was designed, focusing on different components of a futuristic information system. Participants comprised 155 students. The results demonstrated two factors: willingness to share information and need for control. A regression analysis on the automatic car preferences, personality (the Big 5), gender, and age showed that openness, consciousnesses, and age were related to different preferences. The results are assessed, followed by a discussion on personality in relation to the autonomic car.",

            "abstract": "The commercial availability of many real-life smart sensors, wearables, and mobile apps provides a valuable source of information about a wide range of human behavioral, physiological, and social markers that can be used to infer the user\u2019s mental state and mood. However, there are currently no commercial digital products that integrate these psychosocial metrics with the real-time measurement of neural activity. In particular, electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-validated and highly sensitive neuroimaging method that yields robust markers of mood and affective processing, and has been widely used in mental health research for decades. The integration of wearable neuro-sensors into existing multimodal sensor arrays could hold great promise for deep digital neurophenotyping in the detection and personalized treatment of mood disorders. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain digital neurophenotyping model based on the socioecological model of health. The proposed model presents a holistic approach to digital mental health, leveraging recent neuroscientific advances, and could deliver highly personalized diagnoses and treatments. The technological and ethical challenges of this model are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The last few years have seen a revolution in aerial robotics where personal drones are becoming pervasive to our environments and can be bought by anyone anywhere, including at local supermarkets. As they become ubiquitous to our lives, it is crucial to understand how they are perceived and understood by people. The robotics community has extensively theorized and quantified how robotic agents are perceived as social creatures and how this affects users and passersby. However, drones present different form factors that are yet to be systematically explored. This work aims to fill this gap by understanding people's perceptions of drones and how drones physical features correlate to a series of dimensions. We explored the quadcopters available on the 2018 market and built a dataset of 63 images that were evaluated in a user study (N=307). Using the study results, we present a model of how people understand drones based on their design and which physical features are better suited for people wanting to interact with drones. Our findings highlight that safety features have a negative effect on several dimensions including trust. Our work contributes a set of design guidelines for future personal drones and concludes on the implications for ubiquitous computing.",

The purpose of this paper is to explore how demographic variables, SNS importance, social and informational usage, and personality traits (extroversion/introversion, openness, neuroticism, internal and external locus of control) can explain participation frequency of the four biggest SNSs in Israel: Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter.,The research was conducted in Israel during the Fall semester of the 2017\u20132018 academic year and encompassed 244 students. Researchers used six questionnaires to gather data: a demographic questionnaire, a participation frequency questionnaire on four different SNSs, four SNSs importance questionnaire, social and informational usage on four different SNSs questionnaire, personality questionnaire (extroversion, openness and neuroticism) and the locus of control questionnaire.,The findings revealed that different social network sites play distinct roles for various individuals. WhatsApp, the most frequently used platform, is used more by women and people with internal locus of control. Facebook is more frequently used by open people and Instagram is more frequently used by women, younger adults and neurotic people. Twitter is more frequently used by men. In addition, for all SNSs, the higher the social and informational usage is, the more important the SNSs are to the users, which significantly explains participation frequency.,The differences between social networks can be evidence that each social network serves a different group and does not compete with other SNSs. This may well explain why many people make use of several social networks and have a tendency to move from one to another.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to examine participation in online social platforms consisting of information exchange, social network interactions, and political deliberation. Despite the proven benefits of online participation, the majority of internet users read social media data but do not directly contribute, a phenomenon called lurking.,A survey was administered electronically to 507 participants and consisted of ten sections in a questionnaire to gather data on the relationship between online participation and the following variables: anonymity, social value orientation, motivations, and participation in offline activities, as well as the internet\u2019s political influence and personality traits.,Findings show that users with high levels of participation also identify themselves, report higher levels of extroversion, openness, and activity outside the internet, the motivations being an intermediary variable in the relationship between the variables value.,The study shows that participation in online social platforms is not only related to personality traits, but they are impacted by the nature of the motivations that drive them to participate in the particular social platform, as well as by the interest toward the specific topic, or the type or nature of the social group with whom they are communicating.",

            "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to explore patterns of communication between adolescents and their friends across both \"online\" and \"in-person\" contexts. The participants were adolescents (n\u2009=\u2009727) aged 11-16 years attending middle schools in urban and rural areas of Italy. Participants completed daily logs of their in-person and online contacts with friends for 20 consecutive school days. Girls reported more total contacts with their friends than did boys as well as friendships that were closer and more intimate. However, boys indicated more contact than girls via electronic communication and online. Contacts with peers in general were less frequent among the older participants, perhaps because of increasing academic demands. Participants who complemented in-person contact with friends with electronic contact were less lonely than their counterparts who were less versatile in accessing different modalities of making contact with friends.",
