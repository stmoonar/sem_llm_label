            "title": "AutoGen: An Automated Dynamic Model Generation Framework for Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Considering the balance between revenue and resource consumption for industrial recommender systems, intelligent recommendation computing has been emerging recently. Existing solutions deploy the same recommendation model to serve users indiscriminately, which is sub-optimal for total revenue maximization. We propose a multi-model service solution by deploying different-complexity models to serve different-valued users. An automated dynamic model generation framework AutoGen is elaborated to efficiently derive multiple parameter-sharing models with diverse complexities and adequate predictive capabilities. A mixed search space is designed and an importance-aware progressive training scheme is proposed to prevent interference between different architectures, which avoids the model retraining and improves the search efficiency, thereby efficiently deriving multiple models. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoGen.",
