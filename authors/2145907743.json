            "abstract": "Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have shown promising abilities to diagnose through a conversation with a patient like a human doctor would. However, current systems are mostly based on sequence modeling, which does not account for medical knowledge. This makes the systems more prone to misdiagnosis in case of diseases with limited information. To overcome this issue, we present MDKG, an end-to-end dialogue system for medical dialogue generation (MDG) specifically designed to adapt to new diseases by quickly learning and evolving a meta-knowledge graph that allows it to reason about disease-symptom correlations. Our approach relies on a medical knowledge graph to extract disease-symptom relationships and uses a dynamic graph-based meta-learning framework to learn how to evolve the given knowledge graph to reason about disease-symptom correlations. Our approach incorporates medical knowledge and hence reduces the need for a large number of dialogues. Evaluations show that our system outperforms existing approaches when tested on benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Graph-based techniques have gained traction for representing and analyzing data in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Knowledge graph-based language representation models have shown promising results in leveraging domain-specific knowledge for NLP tasks, particularly in the biomedical NLP field. However, such models have limitations, including knowledge noise and neglect of contextual relationships, leading to potential semantic errors and reduced accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes two novel methods. The first method combines knowledge graph-based language model with nearest-neighbor models to incorporate semantic and category information from neighboring instances. The second method involves integrating knowledge graph-based language model with graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage feature information from neighboring nodes in the graph. Experiments on relation extraction (RE) and classification tasks in English and Chinese language datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements with both methods, highlighting their potential for enhancing the performance of language models and improving NLP applications in the biomedical domain.",

            "abstract": "The clustering-based unsupervised relation discovery method has gradually become one of the important methods of open relation extraction (OpenRE). However, high-dimensional vectors can encode complex linguistic information which leads to the problem that the derived clusters cannot explicitly align with the relational semantic classes. In this work, we propose a relation-oriented clustering model and use it to identify the novel relations in the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enable the model to learn to cluster relational data, our method leverages the readily available labeled data of pre-defined relations to learn a relation-oriented representation. We minimize distance between the instance with same relation by gathering the instances towards their corresponding relation centroids to form a cluster structure, so that the learned representation is cluster-friendly. To reduce the clustering bias on predefined classes, we optimize the model by minimizing a joint objective on both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that our method reduces the error rate by 29.2% and 15.7%, on two datasets respectively, compared with current SOTA methods.",

            "abstract": "Natural question generation (QG) aims to generate questions from a passage, and generated questions are answered from the passage. Most models with state-of-the-art performance model the previously generated text at each decoding step. However, (1) they ignore the rich structure information that is hidden in the previously generated text. (2) they ignore the impact of copied words on the passage. We perceive that information in previously generated words serves as auxiliary information in subsequent generation. To address these problems, we design the Iterative Graph Network-based Decoder (IGND) to model the previous generation using a Graph Neural Network at each decoding step. Moreover, our graph model captures dependency relations in the passage that boost the generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models with sentence-level QG tasks on SQuAD and MARCO datasets.",

The questions in ReCO are opinion based queries issued to commercial search engine. The passages are provided by the crowdworkers who extract the support snippet from the retrieved documents. Finally, an abstractive yes/no/uncertain answer was given by the crowdworkers. The release of ReCO consists of 300k questions that to our knowledge is the largest in Chinese reading comprehension. A prominent characteristic of ReCO is that in addition to the original context paragraph, we also provided the support evidence that could be directly used to answer the question. Quality analysis demonstrates the challenge of ReCO that it requires various types of reasoning skills such as causal inference, logical reasoning, etc. Current QA models that perform very well on many question answering problems, such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018), only achieves 77% accuracy on this dataset, a large margin behind humans nearly 92% performance, indicating ReCO present a good challenge for machine reading comprehension.

The answer-agnostic NQG methods reduce the bias towards named entities and increasing the model's degrees of freedom, but sometimes result in generating unanswerable questions which are not valuable for the subsequent machine reading comprehension system. In this paper, we treat the answers as the hidden pivot for question generation and combine the question generation and answer selection process in a joint model.

As a supplement to the search engine, we also introduce a series of models to support inference and graph based querying. Currently, the data of Sogou knowledge graph that are collected from 136 different websites and constantly updated consist of 54 million entities and over 600 million entity links.

            "abstract": "Open-domain question answering focuses on using diverse information resources to answer any types of question. Recent years, with the development of large-scale data set and various deep neural networks models, some recent advances in open domain question answering system first utilize the distantly supervised dataset as the knowledge resource, then apply deep learning based machine comprehension techniques to generate the right answers, which achieves impressive results compared with traditional feature-based pipeline methods. However, these deep learning based methods suffer from the inferior quality of the distantly supervised data, and the answer score is un-normalized among multiple documents. Furthermore, unlike previous open-domain question answering system, they process each document independently which may ignore the valuable information in the context. In this paper, we propose a document gated reader to generate the right answer from multiple documents. We propose a document-level gate operation to determine the question-document relevance and embed it into the answer generation process, and optimize it with the global normalization objective. We also develop a bootstrapping based data generation scheme to obtain high-quality training data.

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel transfer multi-task learning method for Bacteria Biotope rel+ner task at BioNLP-OST 2019. To alleviate the data deficiency problem in domain-specific information extraction, we use BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and pre-train it using mask language models and next sentence prediction on both general corpus and medical corpus like PubMed. In fine-tuning stage, we fine-tune the relation extraction layer and mention recognition layer designed by us on the top of BERT to extract mentions and relations simultaneously. The evaluation results show that our method achieves the best performance on all metrics (including slot error rate, precision and recall) in the Bacteria Biotope rel+ner subtask.",
