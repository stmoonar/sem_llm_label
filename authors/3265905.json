The mechanism integrates a three-finger end effector and employs a 2-DOF driving system in both serial kinematic chains mounted on the base, addressing performance problems caused by moving actuators. First, the architecture of the gripper mechanism is described, and its mobility is verified. Next, the inverse and forward kinematic problems are solved, and the Jacobian matrix is derived to analyze the singularity conditions. The inverse and forward singularity surfaces are plotted. The workspace is investigated using a search method, and two indices, manipulability and dexterity, are studied. The proposed manipulator\u2019s parameters are optimized for improved dexterity. The novel gripper mechanism has high potential for grasping different types of parts within a large workspace, making it a valuable addition to the field of robotics.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in enhancing the quality of low\u2010resolution (LR) facial images for various social life applications. Existing methods often use domain\u2010specific prior knowledge, which is effective in improving the face super\u2010resolution model's performance. However, it is challenging to obtain rich and accurate prior information from LR inputs in real\u2010world scenarios, which can limit the robustness and generalization ability of the developed face super\u2010resolution model. In this paper, a multisource reference\u2010based face super\u2010resolution Network, namely MSRNet, is proposed. Without considering the prior knowledge of faces, the network can reconstruct a LR face image with a magnitude factor of 8 under the guidance of multiple reference face images of different identities. By constructing an \u201cappearance\u2010alike\u201d reference data set Face_Ref, the designed MSRNet aims to fully exploit the local and spatially similar high frequency information between the distinct references and the current face. More specifically, to effectively combine the information from multiple references, a cross\u2010scale and cross\u2010space feature fusion mechanism is introduced for external and internal references, and then the enhanced local semantics are finally incorporated into the high\u2010resolution face reconstruction. The robustness of face image super\u2010resolution is increased compared to current correlation approaches, since it not only eliminates the need for face prior knowledge but also avoids performing alignment operations on reference faces with multiple expressions and different poses. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to produce results for face super\u2010resolution that are satisfying and dependable and outperforms the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods in terms of visual perceptual quality and quantity evaluation.",

In the method, a framework (CEM3DMG) is designed to synthesize 3D images by learning microstructural information from a 2D backscattered electron (BSE) image. Experimental results show that CEM3DMG can generate realistic 3D images of arbitrary size with a resolution of 0.47 $\\mu m$ per pixel. Visual observation confirms that the generated 3D images exhibit similar microstructural features to the 2D images, including pores and particles morphology. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals that these 3D microstructures closely match the real 2D microstructure in terms of gray level histogram, phase proportions, and pore size distribution.",

            "abstract": "Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are concerned with finding the best solutions for problems with missing analytical details. Most classical methods for such problems are based on strong and fixed a priori assumptions, such as Gaussianity. However, the complex real-world problems, especially when the global optimum is desired, could be very far from the a priori assumptions because of their diversities, causing unexpected obstacles. In this study, we propose a generative adversarial net-based broad-spectrum global optimizer (OPT-GAN) which estimates the distribution of optimum gradually, with strategies to balance exploration-exploitation trade-off. It has potential to better adapt to the regularity and structure of diversified landscapes than other methods with fixed prior, e.g., Gaussian assumption or separability. \nExperiments on diverse BBO benchmarks and high dimensional real world applications exhibit that OPT-GAN outperforms other traditional and neural net-based BBO algorithms.

            "title": "Software Architecture Design of Animation Studies Platform Using Structure-Behavior Coalescence Method",
            "abstract": "Animation education in the new media era is moving toward the goal of cultivating high-end talents. The development of an architecture-oriented animation studies platform provides guarantee for the training of talents in terms of teaching quality. This research uses the Internet as the medium and mobile phones and computer clients as the main technology platforms, starting from the software architecture and constructing the system model of the animation studies platform according to the Structure-Behavior Coalescence (SBC) method. The core theme of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a modeling language with model consistency of systems structure and systems behavior. This paper developed Structure-Behavior Coalescence State Machine (SBC-SM) as the formal language for the MBSE animation studies platform design model singularity. The model consistency will be fully guaranteed in the MBSE animation studies platform design when the SBC state machine approach is adopted. It not only improves the efficiency of platform development but also reduces the difficulty and risk of platform development.",

            "abstract": "Solid texture synthesis (STS), an effective way to extend a 2D exemplar to a 3D solid volume, exhibits advantages in computational photography. However, existing methods generally fail to accurately learn arbitrary textures, which may result in the failure to synthesize solid textures with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial nets-based framework (STS-GAN) to extend the given 2D exemplar to arbitrary 3D solid textures. In STS-GAN, multi-scale 2D texture discriminators evaluate the similarity between the given 2D exemplar and slices from the generated 3D texture, promoting the 3D texture generator synthesizing realistic solid textures. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can generate high-fidelity solid textures with similar visual characteristics to the 2D exemplar.",

            "title": "A Novel Graphic Bending Transformation on Benchmark",
            "abstract": "Classical benchmark problems utilize multiple transformation techniques to increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape\u2019s \"shape\", but rather than change the \"view point\". For instance, after rotated, ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.",
