            "abstract": "We present an efficient method for adapting a monolingual Large Language Model (LLM) to another language, addressing challenges of catastrophic forgetting and tokenizer limitations. We focus this study on adapting Llama 2 to Arabic. Our two-stage approach begins with expanding the vocabulary and training only the embeddings matrix, followed by full model continual pre-training on a bilingual corpus. By continually pre-training on a mix of Arabic and English corpora, the model retains its proficiency in English while acquiring capabilities in Arabic. Our approach results in significant improvements in Arabic and slight enhancements in English, demonstrating cost-effective cross-lingual transfer. We perform ablations on embedding initialization techniques, data mix ratios, and learning rates and release a detailed training recipe. To demonstrate generalizability of this approach we also adapted Llama 3 8B to Arabic and Llama 2 13B to Hindi.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the Bittensor Language Model, called\"BTLM-3B-8K\", a new state-of-the-art 3 billion parameter open-source language model. BTLM-3B-8K was trained on 627B tokens from the SlimPajama dataset with a mixture of 2,048 and 8,192 context lengths. BTLM-3B-8K outperforms all existing 3B parameter models by 2-5.5% across downstream tasks. BTLM-3B-8K is even competitive with some 7B parameter models. Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context performance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192 context length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama dataset; aggressively tuned the \\textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used ALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity. On Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that users prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models. Compacting the 7B parameter model to one with 3B parameters, with little performance impact, is an important milestone. BTLM-3B-8K needs only 3GB of memory with 4-bit precision and takes 2.5x less inference compute than 7B models, helping to open up access to a powerful language model on mobile and edge devices. BTLM-3B-8K is available under an Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/cerebras/btlm-3b-8k-base.",
