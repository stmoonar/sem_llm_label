            "abstract": "Clustering analysis of daily load profiles represents an effective technique to classify and aggregate electric users based on their actual consumption patterns. Among other purposes, it may be exploited as a preliminary stage for load forecasting, which is applied in the same way to consumers in the same cluster. Several clustering algorithms have been proposed and developed in the literature, and the choice of the most appropriate set of clustering parameters is crucial for ensuring reliable results. In this paper, an automated service, suited for repeated clustering analysis, is presented. The pipeline is able to process a generic time series dataset and is easily adjustable to test other clustering input parameters; therefore, it may be utilized to find the best set of parameters with the specific dataset. Moreover, it facilitates repeated characterization on real-time load profiles with the aim of detecting sudden changes of consumers behaviors and variable external conditions, which influence the real power forecasting activity on a short temporal scale.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) demonstrated promising application perspective in different scenarios, especially when combined with Graph Machine Learning (GML) techniques able to interpret and infer over facts. Given the natural network structures of Smart Grid equipment and the exponential growth of electric power data, Smart Grid Knowledge Graphs (SGKGs) provides unprecedented opportunities to manage massive power resources and provide intelligent applications. However, a single representation of the SGKGs is never sufficient to properly exploit GML techniques that leverage different aspects of the KG for various objectives. In this work, we provide a methodology to extract various significant views of the SGKG by iteratively applying a series of transformation to the description of the power network in the IEC CIM standard. Our implementation is based on a declarative approach to guarantee easier portability, and we deploy the transformations as a stateless microservice, facilitating modular integration with the rest of the Smart Grid Semantic Platform. Experimental evaluation on two real power distribution networks demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in highlighting important topological information, without discarding precious additional knowledge present in the SGKG.",

            "abstract": "The widespread diffusion of electric mobility requires a contextual expansion of the charging infrastructure. An extended collection and processing of information regarding charging of electric vehicles may turn each electric vehicle charging station into a valuable source of streaming data. Charging point operators may profit from all these data for optimizing their operation and planning activities. In such a scenario, big data and machine learning techniques would allow valorizing real-time data coming from electric vehicle charging stations. This paper presents an architecture able to deal with data streams from a charging infrastructure, with the final aim to forecast electric charging station availability after a set amount of minutes from present time. Both batch data regarding past charges and real-time data streams are used to train a streaming logistic regression model, to take into account recurrent past situations and unexpected actual events. The streaming model performs better than a model trained only using historical data. The results highlight the importance of constantly updating the predictive model parameters in order to adapt to changing conditions and always provide accurate forecasts.",

            "title": "Remote Laboratory Testing Demonstration",
            "abstract": "The complexity of a smart grid with a high share of renewable energy resources introduces several issues in testing power equipment and controls. In this context, real-time simulation and Hardware in the Loop (HIL) techniques can tackle these problems that are typical for power system testing. However, implementing a convoluted HIL setup in a single infrastructure can be physically impossible or can increase the time required to test a smart grid application in detail. This paper introduces the Joint Test Facility for Smart Energy Networks with Distributed Energy Resources (JaNDER) that allows users to exchange data in real-time between two or more infrastructures. This tool enables the integration of infrastructures, exploiting the synergies between them, and creating a virtual infrastructure that can perform more experiments using a combination of the resources installed in each infrastructure. In particular, JaNDER can extend a HIL setup. In order to validate this new testing concept, a coordinated voltage controller has been tested in a Controller HIL setup where JaNDER was used to interact with an actual On Load Tap Changer (OLTC) controller located in a remote infrastructure. The results show that the latency introduced by JaNDER is not critical; hence, under certain circumstances, it can be used to expand the real-time testing without affecting the stability of the experiment.",

The demonstrator named Smart Grid Semantic Platform (SGSP) has been created using these technologies integrating several aspects of the management of an electricity distribution network. The services deployed on the platform concern the visualization of the topographic data and electricity grid assets, as well as the processing and displaying of historical data related to the operation of the networks and/or the result of Big Data analysis. This paper demonstrates how useful the synergy is between the standard semantic model of the electric network (IEC CIM 61968) and the historical data of the time series of medium voltage electricity consumption analyzed using a Big Data platform. Specifically it illustrates the realization of a use case about the calculation of a load index of the electric lines.",

            "title": "Integration of power quality information in the framework of a standard semantic model",
            "abstract": "The growing amount of information produced by automatic systems is often associated with the paradigm of Big Data. Next to this approach it remains the interest in integrating information of different origin within a shared framework, conceptually able to be formalized by an ontology. The IEC Common Information Model (CIM) is a natural candidate to take on the role of reference ontology in the electrical context being able to describe different types of electrical domain information (eg. topologies of electrical networks, market information, metering, etc.) in an integrated way. The activities described here have adopted the CIM standard as a reference semantic model for the representation of information gathered from Power Quality (PQ) monitoring of medium voltage distribution networks, in order to demonstrate the possible synergies with the types of information already provided in that model, namely those associated with topological and cartographic information. The result of this integration could also be in perspective leveraged in the context of the deployment of the 2\u00b0 generation of Italian meters that will include Power Quality data.",
