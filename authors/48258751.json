            "abstract": "Existing mobile-edge computing (MEC) systems are facing the challenges of limited resources and highly dynamic network environments. How to allocate resources to maintain the efficiency and timeliness of data and tasks is still an open issue. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted MEC systems using federated multiagent reinforcement learning (RL). First, we formulate a joint optimization problem as a multiagent Markov decision process by jointly minimizing the average age of information and maximizing the number of recent tasks. Second, we design a novel scheduling algorithm for online collaborative resources by adopting multiple agents to learn and make decisions in accordance with the overall interests through federal learning. Finally, an experience replay mechanism for the internal experience pool is introduced to further improve learning efficiency. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is superior to the recent typical RL-based algorithms. It not only has higher efficiency in task processing and data freshness but also has more stable performance and adaptability across diverse experimental conditions.",

            "abstract": "The novel sensing paradigm known as crowdsensing leverages ubiquitous smart devices to collect data in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional crowdsensing schemes assume a central framework to execute truth discovery algorithm to assure data quality, which may introduce reliability and privacy issues. Blockchain is a promising technology that provides a decentralized, transparent, and immutable platform. However, designing a blockchain-based quality assurance scheme in crowdsensing is not a trivial problem. First, truth discovery is a time-consuming iterative algorithm, which is not practical to execute on blockchain. Second, privacy-preserving schemes always require that the participants join in multiround communications, which is not acceptable in open blockchain because of users\u2019 highly unpredictable behaviors. Finally, on-chain data are publicly accessible, and achieving a good balance between data utility and privacy is an important issue. In this article, we propose a lightweight quality assurance framework atop blockchain to build a reliable, privacy preserving, and fair crowdsensing system. Specifically, we carefully design two kinds of smart contracts to cooperatively maintain a long-term reliable platform to execute crowdsensing tasks. In the contracts, we devise a reputation-based aggregator selection algorithm to reach the consensus on truthful results while avoiding expensive on-chain iterative processes. The participant selection scheme and reward policy are further utilized to filter appropriate participants to complete the task. Our scheme also protects data privacy and does not require communications between participants. Finally, we implement and deploy the contracts on Ethereum and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the contracts can practically execute crowdsensing tasks.",

            "abstract": "Our daily observations tell us that the delivery of social sentiments and emotions differs between strangers and romantic partners. This work explores how relationship status influences our delivery and perception of social touches and emotions, by evaluating the physics of contact interactions. In a study with human participants, strangers and romantically involved touchers delivered emotional messages to receivers\u2019 forearms. Physical contact interactions were measured using a customized 3D tracking system. The results indicate that strangers and romantic receivers recognize emotional messages with similar accuracy, but with higher levels of valence and arousal between romantic partners. Further investigation into the contact interactions which underlie the higher levels of valence and arousal reveals that a toucher tunes their strategy with their romantic partner. For example, when stroking, romantic touchers use velocities preferential to C-tactile afferents, and maintain contact for longer durations with larger contact areas. Notwithstanding, while we show that relationship intimacy influences the deployment of touch strategies, such impact is relatively subtle compared to distinctions between gestures, emotional messages, and individual preferences.",

            "abstract": "Children\u2019s knowledge of the ordinal relations among number symbols is related to their mathematical learning. Ordinal knowledge has been measured using judgment (i.e., decide whether a sequence of three digits is in order) and ordering tasks (i.e., order three digits from smallest to largest). However, the question remains whether performance on these two ordinal tasks tap into similar cognitive processes. Canadian children (N = 87; Age M = 8.7 years, Grade 3) completed symbolic number tasks (i.e., number comparison, ordering, and order judgment) and measures of arithmetic fluency (i.e., addition and subtraction) and working memory (i.e., digit span backward). For both ordinal tasks, there was a reverse distance effect for ordered sequences such that children responded faster to adjacent than to non-adjacent sequences (e.g., 2 3 4 vs. 4 7 9) and a canonical distance effect for unordered sequences such that children responded faster to non-adjacent than to adjacent sequences (e.g., 4 2 3 vs. 4 9 7). Working memory and number comparison each predicted unique variance in the ordinal measures (ordering, order judgment, and a latent ordinal factor based on the two measures). Furthermore, ordinal skills superseded the role of number comparison as the key predictor of arithmetic, controlling for children\u2019s gender and working memory skills. In summary, although both ordering and order judgment tasks index ordinal knowledge, a latent factor that excludes task-specific error may be a better index than either task separately.",

            "title": "An Empirical Grid Model for Precipitable Water Vapor",
            "abstract": "Atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a key variable for weather forecast and climate research. Various techniques (e.g., radiosondes, global navigation satellite system, satellite remote sensing and reanalysis products by data assimilation) can be used to measure (or retrieve) PWV. However, gathering PWV data with high spatial and temporal resolutions remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a new empirical PWV grid model (called ASV-PWV) using the zenith wet delay from the Askne model and improved by the spherical harmonic function and vertical correction. Our method is convenient and enables the user to gain PWV data with only four input parameters (e.g., the longitude and latitude, time, and atmospheric pressure of the desired position). Profiles of 20 radiosonde stations in Qinghai Tibet Plateau, China, along with the latest publicly available C-PWVC2 model are used to validate the local performance. The PWV data from ASV-PWV and C-PWVC2 is generally consistent with radiosonde (the average annual bias is \u22120.44 mm for ASV-PWV and \u22121.36 mm for C-PWVC2, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 3.44 mm for ASV-PWV and 2.51 mm for C-PWVC2, respectively). Our ASV-PWV performs better than C-PWVC2 in terms of seasonal characteristics. In general, a sound consistency exists between PWV values of ASV-PWV and the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA5) (total 7381 grid points in 2020). The average annual bias and RMSE are \u22120.73 mm and 4.28 mm, respectively. ASV-PWV has a similar performance as ERA5 reanalysis products, indicating that ASV-PWV is a potentially alternative option for rapidly gaining PWV.",

            "abstract": "Our sense of touch is essential and permeates in interactions involving natural explorations and affective communications. For instance, we routinely judge the ripeness of fruit at the grocery store, caress the arm of a spouse to offer comfort, and stroke textiles to gauge their softness. Meanwhile, interactive displays that provide tactile feedback are becoming normal and ubiquitous in our daily lives, and are extending rich and immersive interactions into augmented and virtual reality. To replicate touch sensation and make virtual objects feel tangible, such feedback will need to relay a sense of compliance, or softness, one of the key dimensions underlying haptic perception. As our understanding of softness perception remains incomplete, this study seeks to understand exploratory strategies and perceptual cues that may optimally encode material softness. Specifically, we employ methods of computational finite element modeling, biomechanical experimentation, psychophysical evaluation, and data-driven analysis. Overall, this work may aid in engineering the next-generation wearable haptic displays, which must be more tangible, compatible, and perceptually naturalistic.",

            "abstract": "Across a plethora of social situations, we touch others in natural and intuitive ways to share thoughts and emotions, such as tapping to get one\u2019s attention or caressing to soothe one\u2019s anxiety. A deeper understanding of these human-to-human interactions will require, in part, the precise measurement of skin-to-skin physical contact. Among prior efforts, each measurement approach exhibits certain constraints, e.g., motion trackers do not capture the precise shape of skin surfaces, while pressure sensors impede skin-to-skin contact. In contrast, this work develops an interference-free 3D visual tracking system using a depth camera to measure the contact attributes between the bare hand of a toucher and the forearm of a receiver. The toucher\u2019s hand is tracked as a posed and positioned mesh by fitting a hand model to detected 3D hand joints, whereas a receiver\u2019s forearm is extracted as a 3D surface updated upon repeated skin contact. Based on a contact model involving point clouds, the spatiotemporal changes of hand-to-forearm contact are decomposed as six, high-resolution, time-series contact attributes, i.e., contact area, indentation depth, absolute velocity, and three orthogonal velocity components, together with contact duration. To examine the system\u2019s capabilities and limitations, two types of experiments were performed. First, to evaluate its ability to discern human touches, one person delivered cued social messages, e.g., happiness, anger, sympathy, to another person using their preferred gestures. The results indicated that messages and gestures, as well as the identities of the touchers, were readily discerned from their contact attributes. Second, the system\u2019s spatiotemporal accuracy was validated against measurements from independent devices, including an electromagnetic motion tracker, sensorized pressure mat, and laser displacement sensor. While validated here in the context of social communication, this system is extendable to human touch interactions such as maternal care of infants and massage therapy.",

Existing static performance anti-pattern checkers are conservative and limited to a small set of bugs. This paper presents ImMut, the first test augmentation approach to performance testing for image displaying in Android apps to complement these static checkers. Given a functional test case, ImMut mutates it towards a performance test case by either (1) injecting external-source images with large ones or (2) copy-pasting a repeatable fragment and slightly mutating the copies to display many (potentially distinct) images. Evaluation on our prototype implementation showed promising results that ImMut revealed 14 previously unknown performance bugs that are beyond the capability of state-of-the-art static checkers.",

            "abstract": "Brushed stimuli are perceived as pleasant when stroked lightly on the skin surface of a touch receiver at certain velocities. While the relationship between brush velocity and pleasantness has been widely replicated, we do not understand how resultant skin movements \u2013 e.g., lateral stretch, stick-slip, normal indentation \u2013 drive us to form such judgments. In a series of psychophysical experiments, this work modulates skin movements by varying stimulus stiffness and employing various treatments. The stimuli include brushes of three levels of stiffness and an ungloved human finger. The skin\u2019s friction is modulated via non-hazardous chemicals and washing protocols, and the skin\u2019s thickness and lateral movement are modulated by thin sheets of adhesive film. The stimuli are hand-brushed at controlled forces and velocities. Human participants report perceived pleasantness per trial using ratio scaling. The results indicate that a brush\u2019s stiffness influenced pleasantness more than any skin treatment. Surprisingly, varying the skin\u2019s friction did not affect pleasantness. However, the application of a thin elastic film modulated pleasantness. Such barriers, though elastic and only 40 microns thick, inhibit the skin\u2019s tangential movement and disperse normal force. The finding that thin films modulate affective interactions has implications for wearable sensors and actuation devices.",
