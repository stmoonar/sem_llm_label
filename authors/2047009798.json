            "abstract": "Manipulating a target object using non-prehensile actions presents a complex problem that requires addressing multiple constraints, such as finding collision-free trajectories, modeling the object dynamics, and speed of execution. Previous approaches have relied on contact-rich manipulation, where the object moves predictably while attached to the manipulator, thereby avoiding the need to model the object's dynamics. However, this assumption may not always hold, and different end-effectors may be necessary depending on the use case. In place of contact-rich manipulation, we implement the pushing-by-striking method (without tactile feedback) by explicitly modeling the object dynamics. Our novel framework disentangles planning and control enabling us to operate in a context-free manner. Our method consists of two components: an A* planner and a low-level RL controller. The low-level RL controller feeds on purely object-centric representations and has an object-centric action space, thus making it agnostic of the scene context. On the other hand, the planning module operates idependently of the low-level control and only takes scene context into account, making the approach quick to adapt and implement. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm against a global RL policy which is computationally expensive and unreliable to train or fine-tune. To the best of our knowledge, a model-free RL policy without tactile feedback on push-by-strike problems has not been addressed before.",

            "abstract": "The robustness and availability of cloud services are becoming increasingly important as more applications migrate to the cloud. The operations landscape today is more complex, than ever. Site reliability engineers (SREs) are expected to handle more incidents than ever before with shorter service-level agreements (SLAs). By exploiting log, tracing, metric, and network data, Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) enables detection of faults and anomalous issues of services. A wide variety of anomaly detection techniques have been incorporated in various AIOps platforms (e.g. PCA and autoencoder), but they all suffer from false positives. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for persistent anomaly detection on top of the traditional anomaly detection approaches, with the goal of reducing false positives and providing more trustworthy alerting signals. We test our method on both simulated and real-world datasets. Our technique reduces false positive anomalies by at least 28%, resulting in more reliable and trustworthy notifications.

            "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a relatively unexplored class of assets. Designing strategies to forecast NFT trends is an intricate task due to its extremely volatile nature. The market is largely driven by public sentiment and \"hype\", which in turn has a high correlation with conversations taking place on social media platforms like Twitter. Prior work done for modelling stock market data does not take into account the extent of impact certain highly influential tweets and their authors can have on the market. Building on these limitations and the nature of the NFT market, we propose a novel reach-aware temporal learning approach to make predictions for forecasting future trends in the NFT market. We perform experiments on a new dataset consisting of over 1.3 million tweets and 180 thousand NFT transactions spanning over 15 NFT collections curated by us. Our model (TA-NFT) outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by an average of 36%. Through extensive quantitative and ablative analysis, we demonstrate the ability of our approach as a practical method for predicting NFT trends.",

            "abstract": "NFT or Non-Fungible Token is a token that certifies a digital asset to be unique. A wide range of assets including, digital art, music, tweets, memes, are being sold as NFTs. NFT-related content has been widely shared on social media sites such as Twitter. We aim to understand the dominant factors that influence NFT asset valuation. Towards this objective, we create a first-of-its-kind dataset linking Twitter and OpenSea (the largest NFT marketplace) to capture social media profiles and linked NFT assets. Our dataset contains 245,159 tweets posted by 17,155 unique users, directly linking 62,997 NFT assets on OpenSea worth 19 Million USD. We have made the dataset publicly available.1 We analyze the growth of NFTs, characterize the Twitter users promoting NFT assets, and gauge the impact of Twitter features on the virality of an NFT. Further, we investigate the effectiveness of different social media and NFT platform features by experimenting with multiple machine learning and deep learning models to predict an asset\u2019s value. We model the problem as a binary classification as well as an ordinal classification task. Our results show that social media features improve the ordinal classification accuracy by 6% over baseline models that use only NFT platform features. Among social media features, count of user membership lists, number of likes and replies are important features. On the other hand, OpenSea features like offer entered, bids withdrawn, bid entered and is presale turn out to be important predictors.",

            "abstract": "We present a joint multi-robot trajectory optimizer that can compute trajectories for tens of robots in aerial swarms within a small fraction of a second. The computational efficiency of our approach is built on breaking the per-iteration computation of the joint optimization into smaller, decoupled sub-problems and solving them in parallel through a custom batch optimizer. We show that each of the sub-problems can be reformulated to have a special Quadratic Programming structure, wherein the matrices are shared across all the problems and only the associated vector varies. As result, the batch solution update rule reduces to computing just large matrix vector products which can be trivially accelerated using GPUs. We validate our optimizer\u2019s performance in difficult benchmark scenarios and compare it against existing state-of-the-art approaches. We demonstrate remarkable improvements in computation time its scaling with respect to the number of robots. Moreover, we also perform better in trajectory quality as measured by smoothness and arc-length metrics.",

Immediately after the start of the event, posts related to the riots started to trend on social media. A social media platform which stood out was a free speech endorsing social media platform Parler; it is being claimed as the platform on which the riots were planned and talked about. Our report presents a contrast between the trending content on Parler and Twitter around the time of riots. We collected data from both platforms based on the trending hashtags and draw comparisons based on what are the topics being talked about, who are the people active on the platforms and how organic is the content generated on the two platforms. While the content trending on Twitter had strong resentments towards the event and called for action against rioters and inciters, Parler content had a strong conservative narrative echoing the ideas of voter fraud similar to the attacking mob. We also find a disproportionately high manipulation of traffic on Parler when compared to Twitter.",
