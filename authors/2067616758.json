            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) enable users to use natural language feedback to control their recommendations, overcoming many of the challenges of traditional recommendation systems. However, the practical adoption of CRSs remains limited due to a lack of rich and diverse conversational training data that pairs user utterances with recommendations. To address this problem, we introduce a new method to generate synthetic training data by transforming curated item collections, such as playlists or movie watch lists, into item-seeking conversations. First, we use a biased random walk to generate a sequence of slates, or sets of item recommendations; then, we use a language model to generate corresponding user utterances. We demonstrate our approach by generating a conversational music recommendation dataset with over one million conversations, which were found to be consistent with relevant recommendations by a crowdsourced evaluation. Using the synthetic data to train a CRS, we significantly outperform standard retrieval baselines in offline and online evaluations.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are ubiquitous yet often difficult for users to control, and adjust if recommendation quality is poor. This has motivated conversational recommender systems (CRSs), with control provided through natural language feedback. However, as with most application domains, building robust CRSs requires training data that reflects system usage$\\unicode{x2014}$here conversations with user utterances paired with items that cover a wide range of preferences. This has proved challenging to collect scalably using conventional methods. We address the question of whether it can be generated synthetically, building on recent advances in natural language. We evaluate in the setting of item set recommendation, noting the increasing attention to this task motivated by use cases like music, news, and recipe recommendation. We present TalkTheWalk, which synthesizes realistic high-quality conversational data by leveraging domain expertise encoded in widely available curated item collections, generating a sequence of hypothetical yet plausible item sets, then using a language model to produce corresponding user utterances. We generate over one million diverse playlist curation conversations in the music domain, and show these contain consistent utterances with relevant item sets nearly matching the quality of an existing but small human-collected dataset for this task. We demonstrate the utility of the generated synthetic dataset on a conversational item retrieval task and show that it improves over both unsupervised baselines and systems trained on a real dataset.",

            "abstract": "Access policies specify what are the actions that different actors can perform on the available resources. Access policies are a core notion in multiuser environments, such as operating systems and distributed databases. Currently, most of these systems use general data specification languages, such as JSON, XML and YAML to describe access policies. Yet, domain-specific languages are also available for this task. One of such languages is Legalease, from Microsoft. This paper presents a new version of Legalease, called Hapi. Hapi replaces Legalease\u2019s notion of a lattice with a partially ordered set (poset). We demonstrate that posets already give all the expressivity of Legalease, while simplifying its specification and the implementation of verification algorithms. Hapi is currently publicly available. The language is distributed with tools for translating programs to YAML and for visualizing access rights. Hapi provides developers with an Intermediary Representation of policies that allows this language to be easily embedded in any project. Said representation generalizes the notion of actors, actions and resources to user-defined entities; hence, being more flexible than typical data-access description languages.",

However, in practice KBs are both incomplete and over-specified, failing to answer some queries that have real-world answers. \\emph{Query embedding} (QE) techniques have been recently proposed where KB entities and KB queries are represented jointly in an embedding space, supporting relaxation and generalization in KB inference. However, experiments in this paper show that QE systems may disagree with deductive reasoning on answers that do not require generalization or relaxation. We address this problem with a novel QE method that is more faithful to deductive reasoning, and show that this leads to better performance on complex queries to incomplete KBs. Finally we show that inserting this new QE module into a neural question-answering system leads to substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "Neural approaches to natural language processing (NLP) often fail at the logical reasoning needed for deeper language understanding. In particular, neural approaches to reasoning that rely on embedded \\emph{generalizations} of a knowledge base (KB) implicitly model which facts that are \\emph{plausible}, but may not model which facts are \\emph{true}, according to the KB. While generalizing the facts in a KB is useful for KB completion, the inability to distinguish between plausible inferences and logically entailed conclusions can be problematic in settings like as KB question answering (KBQA). We propose here a novel KB embedding scheme that supports generalization, but also allows accurate logical reasoning with a KB. Our approach introduces two new mechanisms for KB reasoning: neural retrieval over a set of embedded triples, and\"memorization\"of highly specific information with a compact sketch structure. Experimentally, this leads to substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art on two KBQA benchmarks.",
