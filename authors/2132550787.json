            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of digital twin technology is expected to reduce the significant cost of traditional physical debugging. Moreover, it can also fully combine IoT real-time data, large data analysis, and simulation, to make the best decisions. In the digital twin network, the data distribution and computing power of different device nodes shows great heterogeneity, but the internal node data are independent and identically distributed. Therefore, our learning algorithm should be able to learn not only the network commonality, but also the node specificity. In order to provide secure and personalised services for different device nodes, a polymorphic learning (PL) framework is proposed in this paper. PL divides the classical neural network model into a homomorphic model and a polymorphic model to realise flexible network control. Finally, the advantages of the PL algorithm in the collaborative optimisation of different nodes are proven through simulation experiments, and the algorithm running process is simulated through a classic case, with the final results proving the superiority of the algorithm.",

            "abstract": "In the context of complex and dynamic marine environment, the offloading of computing tasks for ships of Internet of Things (IoT) users is a very challenging problem considering the different quality of service (QoS) requirements of maritime applications. Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a scene frame prediction system based on digital twin technology. The system is mainly composed of an unmanned perception module, a communication link module, a command center module that provides intelligent computing services, and an interaction and visualization module for human operators. These modules together constitute a system for predicting and recovery the time-series matrix composed of scene frames and object frames. At the same time, in view of the current problems of lack of real-time information and long response time in the maritime search and rescue (SAR) field, this paper instantiates the above system to improve the existing SAR system. Satellites and unmanned vehicles perceive part of the scene data of the real cyber-physical system in real-time and divide them into multiple frames according to the timestamps. In addition, this paper also proposes an environmental graph-attention network (Env-GAT) to achieve efficient and reliable frame predicting. Finally, this paper verifies that the performance of the spatiotemporal attention graph network model has reached the optimal level through computational experiments.",
