            "abstract": "In recent years, a large number of Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) have been introduced in the literature. The communities behind these graphs strive to gather, clean, and integrate scholarly metadata from various sources to produce clean and easy-to-process knowledge graphs. In this context, a very important task of the respective cleaning and integration workflows is deduplication. In this paper, we briefly describe and evaluate the accuracy of the deduplication algorithm used for the OpenAIRE Research Graph. Our experiments show that the algorithm has an adequate performance producing a small number of false positives and an even smaller number of false negatives.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, assessing the performance of researchers has become a burden due to the extensive volume of the existing research output. As a result, evaluators often end up relying heavily on a selection of performance indicators like the h-index. However, over-reliance on such indicators may result in reinforcing dubious research practices, while overlooking important aspects of a researcher\u2019s career, such as their exact role in the production of particular research works or their contribution to other important types of academic or research activities (e.g., production of datasets, peer reviewing). In response, a number of initiatives that attempt to provide guidelines towards fairer research assessment frameworks have been established. In this work, we present BIP! Scholar, a Web-based service that offers researchers the opportunity to set up profiles that summarise their research careers taking into consideration well-established guidelines for fair research assessment, facilitating the work of evaluators who want to be more compliant with the respective practices.

In this work, we focus on the problem of estimating the expected citation-based popularity (or short-term impact) of papers. State-of-the-art methods for this problem attempt to leverage the current citation data of each paper. However, these methods are prone to inaccuracies for recently published papers, which have a limited citation history. In this context, we previously introduced ArtSim, an approach that can be applied on top of any popularity estimation method to improve its accuracy. Its power originates from providing more accurate estimations for the most recently published papers by considering the popularity of similar, older ones. In this work, we present ArtSim+, an improved ArtSim adaptation that considers an additional type of paper similarity and incorporates a faster configuration procedure, resulting in improved effectiveness and configuration efficiency.",

Our method models a researcher exploring the paper citation network, and introduces an attention-based mechanism, akin to a time-restricted version of preferential attachment, that explicitly captures the researcher\u2019s preference to read papers which received a lot of attention recently.

However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge in it challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open dataset compiled to facilitate the coronavirus-related literature exploration, by providing various indicators of scientific impact for the relevant articles.

Most existing approaches attempt to predict the exact number of citations each article will receive in the near future, however this is a difficult regression analysis problem. Moreover, most approaches rely on the existence of rich metadata for each article, a requirement that cannot be adequately fulfilled for a large number of them. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that solving a simpler machine learning problem, that of classifying articles based on their expected impact, is adequate for many real world applications and we propose a simplified model that can be trained using minimal article metadata. Finally, we examine various configurations of this model and evaluate their effectiveness in solving the aforementioned classification problem.",

To alleviate this issue, search engines have used citation-based article impact ranking. However, most engines rely on very simplistic impact measures (usually the citation count) and make the problematic assumption that there is a one-size-fits-all impact measure. To address these problems, we present BIP! Finder, a search engine that facilitates the identification of valuable articles by exploiting two different impact measures, each capturing a different aspect of the article impact. In addition, BIP! Finder provides many useful features (article comparison, intuitive visualisations, article bookmarking mechanism, etc.) making it a powerful addition to the researcher's toolbox.",

            "abstract": "As the rate at which scientific work is published continues to increase, so does the need to discern high-impact publications. In recent years, there have been several approaches that seek to rank publications based on their expected citation-based impact. Despite this level of attention, this research area has not been systematically studied. Past literature often fails to distinguish between short-term impact, the current popularity of an article, and long-term impact, the overall influence of an article. Moreover, the evaluation methodologies applied vary widely and are inconsistent. In this work, we aim to fill these gaps, studying impact-based ranking theoretically and experimentally. First, we provide explicit definitions for short-term and long-term impact, and introduce the associated ranking problems. Then, we identify and classify the most important ideas employed by state-of-the-art methods. After studying various evaluation methodologies of the literature, we propose a specific benchmark framework that can help us better differentiate effectiveness across impact aspects. Using this framework we investigate: (1) the practical difference between ranking by short- and long-term impact, and (2) the effectiveness and efficiency of ranking methods in different settings. To avoid reporting results that are discipline-dependent, we perform our experiments using four datasets from different scientific disciplines.",
