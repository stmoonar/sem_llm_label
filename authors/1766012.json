            "abstract": "A growing body of work in economics and computation focuses on the trade-off between implementability and simplicity in mechanism design. The goal is to develop a theory that not only allows to design an incentive structure easy to grasp for imperfectly rational agents, but also understand the ensuing limitations on the class of mechanisms that enforce it. In this context, the concept of OSP mechanisms has assumed a prominent role since they provably account for the absence of contingent reasoning skills, a specific cognitive limitation. For single-dimensional agents, it is known that OSP mechanisms need to use certain greedy algorithms. In this work, we introduce a notion that interpolates between OSP and SOSP, a more stringent notion where agents only plan a subset of their own future moves. We provide an algorithmic characterization of this novel class of mechanisms for single-dimensional domains and binary allocation problems, that precisely measures the interplay between simplicity and implementability. We build on this to show how mechanisms based on reverse greedy algorithms (a.k.a., deferred acceptance auctions) are algorithmically more robust to imperfectly rationality than those adopting greedy algorithms.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we study the Stochastic Budgeted Multi-round Submodular Maximization (SBMSm) problem, where we aim to adaptively maximize the sum, over multiple rounds, of a monotone and submodular objective function defined on subsets of items. The objective function also depends on the realization of stochastic events, and the total number of items we can select over all rounds is bounded by a limited budget. This problem extends, and generalizes to multiple round settings, well-studied problems such as (adaptive) influence maximization and stochastic probing. We show that, if the number of items and stochastic events is somehow bounded, there is a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for SBMSm. Then, we provide a simple greedy $1/2(1-1/e-\\epsilon)\\approx 0.316$-approximation algorithm for SBMSm, that first non-adaptively allocates the budget to be spent at each round, and then greedily and adaptively maximizes the objective function by using the budget assigned at each round. Finally, we introduce the {\\em budget-adaptivity gap}, by which we measure how much an adaptive policy for SBMSm is better than an optimal partially adaptive one that, as in our greedy algorithm, determines the budget allocation in advance. We show that the budget-adaptivity gap lies between $e/(e-1)\\approx 1.582$ and $2$.",

            "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are comprised by autonomous agents, each with a potentially specific goal that may be different from the objective of the system designer. MAS represent the perfect environment for the work in Algorithmic Mechanism Design (AMD), which seeks to design incentive-compatible mechanisms, the core idea being to maximise the profit of the agents when they behave honestly, thus preventing misbehaviour and allowing the designer to optimise her goal. AMD often assumes full rationality of agents who are expected to know their full preferences (however complex they are) and to strategise optimally so that the mechanism is guided towards outcomes they prefer. However, in real MAS, this is too strong an assumption. Humans could interact with software agents and irrationally choose suboptimal strategies due to their cognitive biases and/or limitations [1]. Software agents themselves could be \u201cirrational\u201d since they could have been \u201cbadly\u201d programmed either because the programmer misunderstood the incentive structure in place or due to computational barriers [2]. Much work has been done in the last years to relax full rationality and set an agenda to design AMD mechanisms for real MAS, where we seek to incentivise honest behaviour when agents have some form of imperfect rationality. This paper will survey some recent works focusing on mechanism design when agents have imperfect rationality.",

            "abstract": "Several elections run in the last years have been characterized by attempts to manipulate the result of the election through the diffusion of fake or malicious news over social networks. This problem has been recognized as a critical issue for the robustness of our democracy. Analyzing and understanding how such manipulations may occur is crucial to the design of effective countermeasures to these practices. Many studies have observed that, in general, to design an optimal manipulation is usually a computationally hard task. Nevertheless, literature on bribery in voting and election manipulation has frequently observed that most hardness results melt down when one focuses on the setting of (nearly) single-peaked agents, i.e., when each voter has a preferred candidate (usually, the one closer to her own belief) and preferences of remaining candidates are inversely proportional to the distance between the candidate position and the voter's belief. Unfortunately, no such analysis has been done for election manipulations run in social networks. In this work, we try to close this gap: specifically, we consider a setting for election manipulation that naturally raises (nearly) single-peaked preferences, and we evaluate the complexity of election manipulation problem in this setting: while most of the hardness and approximation results still hold, we will show that single-peaked preferences allow to design simple, efficient and effective heuristics for election manipulation.",

            "abstract": "The design of algorithms or protocols that are able to align the goals of the planner with the selfish interests of the agents involved in these protocols is of paramount importance in almost every decentralized setting (such as, computer networks, markets, etc.) as shown by the rich literature in Mechanism Design. Recently, huge interest has been devoted to the design of mechanisms for imperfectly rational agents, i.e., mechanisms for which agents are able to easily grasp that there is no action different from following the protocol that would satisfy their interests better. This work has culminated in the definition of Obviously Strategyproof (OSP) Mechanisms, that have been shown to capture the incentives of agents without contingent reasoning skills. Without an understanding of the algorithmic nature of OSP mechanisms, it is hard to assess how well these mechanisms can satisfy the goals of the planner. For the case of binary allocation problems and agents whose private type is a single number, recent work has shown that a generalization of greedy completely characterizes OSP. In this work, we strengthen the connection between greedy and OSP by providing a characterization of OSP mechanisms for all optimization problems involving these single-parameter agents. Specifically, we prove that OSP mechanisms must essentially work as follows: they either greedily look for agents with \"better\" types and allocate them larger outcomes; or reverse greedily look for agents with \"worse\" types and allocate them smaller outcomes; or, finally, split the domain of agents in \"good\" and \"bad\" types, and subsequently proceed in a reverse greedy fashion for the former and greedily for the latter. We further demonstrate how to use this characterization to give bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms for the well known scheduling related machines problem.",

            "abstract": "The design of mechanisms where incentives are simple to understand for the agents has attracted a lot of attention recently. One particularly relevant concept in this direction has been Obvious Strategyproofness (OSP), a class of mechanisms that are so simple to be recognized as incentive compatible even by agents with a limited form of rationality. It is known that there exist payments that lead to an OSP mechanism whenever the algorithm they augment is either greedy or reverse greedy (a.k.a., deferred acceptance). However, to date, their explicit definition is unknown. In this work we provide payments for OSP mechanisms based on greedy or reverse greedy algorithms. Interestingly, our results show an asymmetry between these two classes of algorithms: while for reverse greedy the usual strategyproof payments work well also for OSP, the payments for greedy algorithms may break individual rationality or budget balancedness. Thus, the designer needs to subsidize the market in order to simultaneously guarantee these properties and simple incentives. We apply this result to analyze the amount of subsidies needed by a well-known greedy algorithm for combinatorial auctions with single-minded bidders.",

Here, we give the first set of tight results on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms for scheduling related machines and a characterization of set system instances for which OSP mechanisms that return optimal solutions exist. By extending the well-known cycle monotonicity technique, we are able to concentrate on the algorithmic component of OSP mechanisms and provide some novel paradigms for their design, when private types belong to a set with few values.

            "abstract": "Modeling how agents form their opinions is of paramount importance for designing marketing and electoral campaigns. In this work, we present a new framework for opinion formation which generalizes the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen model by incorporating three important features: (i) social group membership, that limits the amount of influence that people not belonging to the same group may lead on a given agent; (ii) both attraction among friends, and repulsion among enemies; (iii) different strengths of influence lead from different people on a given agent, even if the social relationships among them are the same.\n\n\n\nWe show that, despite its generality, our model always admits a pure Nash equilibrium which, under opportune mild conditions, is even unique. Next, we analyze the performances of these equilibria with respect to a social objective function defined as a convex combination, parametrized by a value \u03bb\u2208[0,1], of the costs yielded by the untruthfulness of the declared opinions and the total cost of social pressure. We prove bounds on both the price of anarchy and the price of stability which show that, for not-too-extreme values of \u03bb, performance at equilibrium are very close to optimal ones. For instance, in several interesting scenarios, the prices of anarchy and stability are both equal to max{2\u03bb,1-\u03bb}/min{2\u03bb,1-\u03bb} which never exceeds 2 for \u03bb\u2208[1/5,1/2].",

            "abstract": "Most economic reports suggest that almost half of the market value unlocked by artificial intelligence (AI) by the next decade (about 9 trillion USD per year) will be in marketing&sales. In particular, AI will allow the optimization of more and more intricate economic settings in which multiple different activities can be automated jointly. A relatively recent example is that one of ad auctions in which similar products or services are displayed together with their price, thus merging advertising and pricing in a unique website. This is the case, e.g., of Google Hotel Ads and TripAdvisor. More precisely, as in a classical ad auction, the ranking of the ads depends on the advertisers' bids, while, differently from classical ad auctions, the price is displayed together with the ad, so as to provide a direct comparison among the prices and thus dramatically affect the behavior of the users. This paper investigates how displaying prices and ads together conditions the properties of the main economic mechanisms such as VCG and GSP. Initially, we focus on the direct-revelation mechanism, showing that prices are chosen by the mechanisms once given the advertisers' reports. We also provide an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal allocation given the private information reported by the advertisers. Then, with both VCG and GSP payments, we show the inefficiency in terms of Price of Anarchy (PoA) and Stability (PoS) over the social welfare and mechanism's revenue when the advertisers choose the prices. The main results show that, with both VCG and GSP, PoS over the revenue may be unbounded even with two slots, while PoA over the social welfare may be as large as the number of slots. Finally, we show that, under some assumptions, simple modifications to VCG and GSP allow us to obtain a better PoS over the revenue.",

            "abstract": ". Security Games have been widely adopted to model scenarios in which one player, the Defender , has to decide how to deploy her resources to minimize the loss that can be caused by an attack performed by another player, the Attacker , aiming at maximizing such loss. In the present paper, we focus on scenarios in which the De-fender has lexicographic-like preferences on the targets, being primarily interested in defending the integrity of a subset of the targets and, only secondarily , to reduce the amount of the other damaged targets. Our central motivation for studying this problem comes from the need to reduce the impact of malicious \ufb02ows in networks, that can be either physical, like cities, or virtual, e.g., social networks. In this work, we introduce a new class of security games to model these scenarios, characterizing it and proving the NP -hardness of computing a leader-follower equilibrium, which is the most appropriate solution concept for this setting. To compute such an equilibrium, we then provide an exact exponential-time algorithm, capable of exploiting the topological properties of the network. Finally, we show that, with opportune optimizations, this algorithm can work ef-\ufb01ciently even on network of 10000 nodes.",

The social proof marketing strategy assumes that the marketer provides a novel product for free to some users of a social network and then promptly recommends the product to other users, by informing them that a number of their friends are already using it. In this paper we study this popular marketing strategy in scenarios where the new product enters in markets where two old products are already competing. We show that if customers tend to adopt the product that is the most popular one (over the three alternative products) among their friends, then this marketing strategy allows to maximize the diffusion of the new product only on a narrow class of networks. Moreover, even if we focus on this narrow class of networks, computing the best order of the recommendations is computationally intractable. Instead, if customers are less prone to change their mind, that is, if they are willing to adopt some product only when an absolute majority of their friends has already agreed on it, then the marketing strategy always works well and, furthermore, an optimal order of recommendations can be computed in polynomial time.",

            "abstract": "Online social networks are nowadays one of the most effective and widespread tools used to share information. In addition to being employed by individuals for communicating with friends and acquaintances, and by brands for marketing and customer service purposes, they constitute a primary source of daily news for a significant number of users. Unfortunately, besides legit news, social networks also allow to effectively spread inaccurate or even entirely fabricated ones. Also due to sensationalist claims, misinformation can spread from the original sources to a large number of users in a very short time, with negative consequences that, in extreme cases, can even put at risk public safety or health. \nIn this work we discuss and propose methods to limit the spread of misinformation over online social networks. The issue is split in two separate sub-problems. We first aim to identify the most probable sources of the misinformation among the subset of users that have been reached by it. In the second step, assuming to know the misinformation sources, we want to locate a minimum number of monitors (that is, entities able to identify and block false information) in the network in order to prevent that the misinformation campaign reaches some \u201ccritical\u201d nodes while maintaining low the number of nodes exposed to the infection. \nFor each of the two issues, we provide both heuristics and mixed integer programming formulations. To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks. The results of this extensive experimental phase validate our heuristics as effective tools to contrast the spread of misinformation in online social networks. \nRegarding the source identification step, our approach showed success rates above 80% in most of the considered settings, and above 60% in almost all of them. \nWith respect to the second issue, our heuristic proved to be able to obtain solutions that exceeded (in terms of number of required monitors) the ones obtained through our MILP-based approach of more than 20% in only few test scenarios. Our heuristics for both problems also proved to outperform significantly some previously proposed algorithms.",

Logit dynamics allows irrationality in players\u2019 behavior and may take time exponential in the number of players n to converge to a stable state (i.e., a certain distribution over pure strategy profiles). We prove that every potential game, for which the behavior of the logit dynamics is not chaotic as n increases, admits distributions stable for a super-polynomial number of steps in n no matter the players\u2019 irrationality and the starting profile of the dynamics. The convergence rate to these metastable distributions is polynomial in n when the players are not too rational. Our proofs build upon the new concept of partitioned Markov chains, which might be of independent interest, and a number of involved technical contributions.",

We study a wide range of cases distinguishing for the number of candidates or for the kind of messages spread over the network. We provide a positive result, showing that, except for trivial cases, manipulation is not affordable, the optimization problem being hard even if the manipulator has an unlimited budget (i.e., he can add or remove as many edges as desired). Furthermore, we prove that our hardness results still hold in a reoptimization variant, where the manipulator already knows an optimal solution to the problem and needs to compute a new solution once a local modification occurs (e.g., in bandit scenarios where estimations related to random variables change over time).",

            "abstract": "Opinion diffusion has been largely studied in the literature on settings where the opinion whose spread has to be maximized, say white, competes against one opinion only, say black. For instance, for diffusion mechanisms modeled in terms of best response dynamics over majority agents (who change their opinion as to conform it to the majority of their neighbors), it is known that the spread can be maximized via certain greedy dynamics that can be computed in polynomial time. This setting is precisely the one considered in the paper. However, differently from earlier literature, it is assumed that one further opinion, say gray, is available to the agents. Moving from the observation that, with the third alternative to hand, greedy dynamics can dramatically fail to maximize the spread of opinion \\emphwhite, the paper then embarks in thorough computational, algorithmic and experimental studies. The picture that emerges is totally different from what is known for the case when two opinions are available only. Indeed, it is shown that greedy dynamics can dramatically fail in maximizing the spread. In particular, deciding whether there exists a dynamics that can spread the opinion white to at least k agents or can reach a consensus is shown to be intractable, formally $\\NP$-hard. On the other hand, islands of tractability based on certain structural properties of the interaction graph are identified. Finally, experimental results are discussed, which shed lights on opinion diffusion in real social networks.",

Within this setting, questions related to which extent a minority/majority can spread the opinion it supports to the other agents are considered. It is shown that if there are only two available opinions, no matter of the underlying social graph G = (N,E), there is always a group formed by a half of the agents that can annihilate the opposite opinion. A polynomial-time algorithm to compute a group of agents enjoying these properties is also devised and analyzed. The result marks the boundary of tractability, since the influence power of minorities is shown to depend on certain features of the underlying graphs, which are NP-hard to be identified. Finally, for more than two opinions we show that even the simpler problem of deciding whether there exists a sequence of updates leading to consensus is NP-hard.",

            "abstract": "Friedkin and Johnsen (1990) modeled opinion formation in social networks as a dynamic process which evolves in rounds: at each round each agent updates her expressed opinion to a weighted average of her innate belief and the opinions expressed in the previous round by her social neighbors. The stubbornness level of an agent represents the tendency of the agent to express an opinion close to her innate belief. \nMotivated by the observation that innate beliefs, stubbornness levels and even social relations can co-evolve together with the expressed opinions, we present a new model of opinion formation where the dynamics runs in a co-evolving environment. We assume that agents\u2019 stubbornness and social relations can vary arbitrarily, while their innate beliefs slowly change as a function of the opinions they expressed in the past. We prove that, in our model, the opinion formation dynamics converges to a consensus if reasonable conditions on the structure of the social relationships and on how the personal beliefs can change are satisfied. Moreover, we discuss how this result applies in several simpler (but realistic) settings.",

            "abstract": "We focus on the election manipulation problem through social influence, where a manipulator exploits a social network to make her most preferred candidate win an election. Influence is due to information in favor of and/or against one or multiple candidates, sent\u00a0 by seeds and spreading through the network according to the independent cascade model.\u00a0 We provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the election control problem, investigating\u00a0 two forms of manipulations: seeding to buy influencers given a social network and removing\u00a0 or adding edges in the social network given the set of the seeds and the information sent.\u00a0 In particular, we study a wide range of cases distinguishing in the number of candidates or\u00a0 the kind of information spread over the network. \nOur main result shows that the election manipulation problem is not affordable in\u00a0 the worst-case, even when one accepts to get an approximation of the optimal margin of\u00a0 victory, except for the case of seeding when the number of hard-to-manipulate voters is not\u00a0 too large, and the number of uncertain voters is not too small, where we say that a voter\u00a0 that does not vote for the manipulator's candidate is hard-to-manipulate if there is no way\u00a0 to make her vote for this candidate, and uncertain otherwise. \nWe also provide some results showing the hardness of the problems in special cases.\u00a0 More precisely, in the case of seeding, we show that the manipulation is hard even if the\u00a0 graph is a line and that a large class of algorithms, including most of the approaches\u00a0 recently adopted for social-influence problems (e.g., greedy, degree centrality, PageRank, VoteRank), fails to compute a bounded approximation even on elementary networks, such\u00a0 as undirected graphs with every node having a degree at most two or directed trees. In the\u00a0 case of edge removal or addition, our hardness results also apply to election manipulation\u00a0 when the manipulator has an unlimited budget, being allowed to remove or add an arbitrary\u00a0 number of edges, and to the basic case of social influence maximization/minimization in\u00a0 the restricted case of finite budget. \nInterestingly, our hardness results for seeding and edge removal/addition still hold\u00a0 in a re-optimization variant, where the manipulator already knows an optimal solution\u00a0 to the problem and computes a new solution once a local modification occurs, e.g., the\u00a0 removal/addition of a single edge.",

We prove a number of bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms, which show that OSP can come at a significant cost.

            "abstract": "The emergence of online social networks has revolutionized the way people seek and share information. Nowadays, popular online social sites as Twitter, Facebook and Google+ are among the major news sources as well as the most effective channels for viral marketing. However, these networks also became the most effective channel for spreading misinformation, accidentally or maliciously. The widespread diffusion of inaccurate information or fake news can lead to undesirable and severe consequences, such as widespread panic, libelous campaigns and conspiracies. In order to guarantee the trustworthiness of online social networks it is a crucial challenge to find effective strategies to contrast the spread of the misinformation in the network. \n \nIn this paper we concentrate our attention on two problems related to the diffusion of misinformation in social networks: identify the misinformation sources and limit its diffusion in the network. We consider a social network where some nodes have already been infected from misinformation. We first provide an heuristics to recognize the set of most probable sources of the infection. Then, we provide an heuristics to place a few monitors in some network nodes in order to control information diffused by the suspected nodes and block misinformation they injected in the network before it reaches a large part of the network. To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks. Empirical results indicate that our heuristics are among the most effective known in literature.",

The payoff of an agent depends on whether the declared preference agrees with the belief of the agent and on the coordination with the preferences declared by the neighbors of the agent in the underlying social network. These games have been used to model the formation of opinions and the adoption of innovations in social networks. \n \nRecently, researchers have obtained bounds on the Price of Anarchy and on the Price of Stability of discrete preference games and they have studied to which extent the winning preference reached via best-response dynamics disagrees with the majority of beliefs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of these results to variants of the model. Our starting point is the observation that bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Stability can be very dependent on the way the quality of an equilibrium is measured. On the other side, results about the disagreement between majority at equilibria and majority among beliefs continue to hold even if we consider different classes of dynamics, such as no-worse-response dynamics, best response with multiple players updating at the same time, or with weighted neighbors.",

We prove that for clique social networks, the dynamics always converges to consensus (no matter the level of noise) if the social pressure is high enough. Moreover, we provide (tight) bounds on the speed of convergence; these bounds are polynomial in the number of players provided that the pressure grows sufficiently fast.

            "abstract": "Recently, much attention has been devoted to discrete preference games to model the formation of opinions in social networks. More specifically, these games model the agents' strategic decision of expressing publicly an opinion, which is a result of an interplay between the agent's private belief and the social pressure. However, these games have very limited expressive power; they can model only very simple social relations and they assume that all the agents respond to social pressure in the same way. In this paper, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games. These games have additional characteristics that can model social relations to allies or competitors and complex relations among more than two agents. Moreover, they introduce different levels of strength for each relation, and they personalize the dependence of each agent to her neighborhood. \n \nWe show that these novel games admit generalized ordinal potential functions and, more importantly, that every two-strategy game that admits a generalized ordinal potential function is structurally equivalent to a generalized discrete preference game. This implies that the games in this novel class capture the full generality of two-strategy games in which the existence of (pure) equilibria is guaranteed by topological arguments.",

            "abstract": "We study discrete preference games in heterogeneous social networks. These games model the interplay between a player's private belief and his/her publicly stated opinion (which could be different from the player's belief) as a strategic game in which the players' strategies are the opinions and the cost of an opinion in a state is a convex combination through a parameter $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ of two factors: the disagreement between the player's opinion and his/her internal belief and the number of neighbors whose opinions differ from the one of the player. The parameter $\\alpha$ models how stubborn a player is: players with large $\\alpha$ change their opinion only if many neighbors disagree with his/her belief. We consider social networks that are heterogeneous in the sense that the parameter $\\alpha$ can vary from player to player. \nWe ask if it is possible that the belief shared by the majority of the players does not coincide with the opinion that is publicly announced by the majority of the players in an equilibrium state. Our main result is a characterization of the social networks that admit an initial belief assignment for which there exists a sequence of best response moves that reach an equilibrium in which the initial majority is subverted. Our characterization is effective in the sense that can be tested efficiently and the initial belief assignment that can be subverted can be computed in time polynomial in the number of players. Our result is actually stronger as we show that in each initial belief assignment that can be subverted, subversion is actually obtained in a very strong way: it only takes one move of a single player, the swing player, to lead the social network to a point of no return in which any rational move from any player leads to a subverted majority.",

            "abstract": "Drawing on ideas from game theory and quantum physics, we investigate nonlocal correlations from the point of view of equilibria in games of incomplete information. These equilibria can be classified in decreasing power as general communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria and correlated equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of belief-invariant equilibrium has appeared in game theory before, in the 1990s. However, the class of non-signalling correlations associated to belief-invariance arose naturally already in the 1980s in the foundations of quantum mechanics. \nIn the present work, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the above classes of equilibria, and furthermore quantum correlated equilibria, using tools from quantum information but the language of game theory. We present a general framework of belief-invariant communication equilibria, which contains (quantum) correlated equilibria as special cases. Our framework also contains the theory of Bell inequalities, a question of intense interest in quantum mechanics and the original motivation for the above-mentioned studies. \nWe then use our framework to show new results related to social welfare. Namely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than correlated equilibria, and one where all non-belief-invariant equilibria are socially suboptimal. Then, we show that in some cases optimal social welfare is achieved by quantum correlations, which do not need an informed mediator to be implemented. Furthermore, we illustrate potential practical applications: for instance, situations where competing companies can correlate without exposing their trade secrets, or where privacy-preserving advice reduces congestion in a network. Along the way, we highlight open questions on the interplay between quantum information, cryptography, and game theory.",

It is known how truthfulness imposes (even severe) losses and how certain notions of verification are unhelpful in this setting; one is thus left powerless to solve this problem satisfactorily in presence of selfish agents. We here address this issue and characterize the minimal set of verification assumptions needed for the truthfulness of optimal algorithms, for both social cost and max cost objective functions. En route, we give a host of novel conceptual and technical contributions ranging from topological notions of verification to a lower bounding technique for truthful mechanisms that connects methods to test truthfulness (i.e., cycle monotonicity) with approximation guarantee.",

            "abstract": "We study the revenue performance of sequential posted-price mechanisms and some natural extensions for a setting where the valuations of the buyers are drawn from a correlated distribution. Sequential posted-price mechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted-price mechanisms to single-parameter multiunit settings in which each buyer demands only one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the buyers. For standard sequential posted-price mechanisms, we prove that with the valuation distribution having finite support, no sequential posted-price mechanism can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even with unlimited supply. We extend this result to the case of a continuous valuation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously (i.e., everywhere-supported, continuous, symmetric, and normalized (conditional) distributions that satisfy regularity, the MHR condition, and affiliation). In fact, it turns out that the best fraction of the optimal revenue that is extractable by a sequential posted-price mechanism is proportional to the ratio of the highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that a simple generalization of these mechanisms achieves a better revenue performance; namely, if the sequential posted-price mechanism has for each buyer the option of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then a \u03a9 (1/max { 1,d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d denotes the degree of dependence of the valuations, ranging from complete independence (d=0) to arbitrary dependence (d = n-1).",

Yet, only very recently have scientists started considering the more realistic case in which competing entities try to expand their market and maximize their share via viral marketing.

(2) Does the number of adopters of one of the alternatives increase in a monotone and submodular way with respect to the set of initial adopters of that alternative? (3) To what extent does the competition among alternatives affect the total number of agents adopting one of the alternatives?",

Consciousness is a central research theme in Neuroscience and AI, which remains, to date, an obscure phenomenon of human brains. Our starting point is a recent experiment, called Post Decision Wagering (PDW) (Persaud, McLeod, and Cowey 2007), that attempts to align experimenters' and subjects' objectives by leveraging financial incentives. We note a similarity with mechanism design, a research area which aims at the design of protocols that reconcile often divergent objectives through incentive-compatibility. We look at the issue of measuring awareness from this perspective. We abstract the setting underlying the PDW experiment and identify three factors that could make it ineffective: rationality, risk attitude and bias of subjects. Using mechanism design tools, we study the barrier between possibility and impossibility of incentive compatibility with respect to the aforementioned characteristics of subjects. We complete this study by showing how to use our mechanisms to potentially get a better understanding of consciousness.\n \n",

            "abstract": "We study discrete preference gamesthat have been used to model issues such as the formation of opinions or the adoption of innovations in the context of a social network. In these games, the payoff of each agent depends on the agreement of her strategy to her internal belief and on its coordination with the strategies of her neighbors in the social network. Recent papers have obtained bounds on the price of anarchy and stability of these games. Our starting point is the observation that such bounds can be very sensitive on the way the quality of equilibria is quantified. This motivates us to foc us on properties of the games that do not depend on these details. In particular, we consider the question of whether the public opinion can be different than the public \u201cbelief\u201d. We show that strategi c behavior typically leads to changes of the public opinion compared to the public belief. We completely characterize the social networks (graphs) where such changes can happen and furthermore study the complexity of such transitions. We show that deciding whether a minority belief can become the majority opinion is NP-hard even when the initial number of supporters of this belief is very c lose to 1/4 of the social network size. Next, motivated by the limited expressive power of discrete preference games, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games . These games have additional characteristics and can model social relations to allies or compet itors, including complex relations between more than two agents, introduce different levels of strengt h for each relation, and personalize the dependence of each agent to its neighborhood. We show that these games admit generalized ordinal potential functions. More importantly, we show that every game with two strategies per agent that admits a generalized ordinal potential function is structu rally equivalent to a generalized discrete preference game. This implies that the games in the novel class capture the full generality of twostrategy games in which the existence of (pure) equilibria is guaranteed by topological arguments.",

Central to this field is the MaxMin Allocation problem, for which there is a significant gap between known approximation and inapproximability results. Closing this gap is a stimulating challenge. \n \nTo this end, we consider a regular version of MaxMin Allocation where each agent must receive exactly k goods, for a given integer k. We call this problem k-division. The analysis of this problem allows us to highlight two interesting features of the classical MaxMin Allocation problem. First, we show a close connection of the problem with matroid theory. This connection provides us an exact algorithm for a special case of k-division and a 1/k-approximation algorithm for general inputs. Moreover, we show that the difficulty of the MaxMin Allocation may be caught by an apparently simpler problem, namely the k-division problem in which an agent's utility for a single good can only take one value out of three.",

            "abstract": "One of the main criticisms to game theory concerns the assumption of full rationality. Logit dynamics is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of irrationality (a.k.a. \"noise\") is introduced in players' behavior. In this context, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as opposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy profiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and uniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take time exponential in the number of players. We therefore look at an approximate version of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by Auletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e., players do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps (rather than forever, as for logit equilibria). The hope is that these distributions exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics. \nWe identify a class of potential games, called asymptotically well-behaved, for which the behavior of the logit dynamics is not chaotic as the number of players increases so to guarantee meaningful asymptotic results. We prove that any such game admits distributions which are metastable no matter the level of noise present in the system, and the starting profile of the dynamics. These distributions can be quickly reached if the rationality level is not too big when compared to the inverse of the maximum difference in potential. Our proofs build on results which may be of independent interest, including some spectral characterizations of the transition matrix defined by logit dynamics for generic games and the relationship of several convergence measures for Markov chains.",

            "abstract": "One of the main criticisms to game theory concerns the assumption of full rationality. Logit dynamics is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of irrationality (a.k.a. \"noise\") is introduced in players' behavior. In this context, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as opposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy profiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and uniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take exponential time. We therefore look at an approximate version of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by Auletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions which remain stable (i.e., players do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps (rather than forever, as for logit equilibria). The hope is that these distributions exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics. \nWe devise a sufficient condition for potential games to admit distributions which are metastable no matter the level of noise present in the system, and the starting profile of the dynamics. These distributions can be quickly reached if the rationality level is not too big when compared to the inverse of the maximum difference in potential.

            "abstract": "Logit dynamics [Blume, Games and Economic Behavior, 1993] is a randomized best response dynamics where at every time step a player is selected uniformly at random and she chooses a new strategy according to the \u201clogit choice function\u201d, i.e. a probability distribution biased towards strategies promising higher payoffs, where the bias level corresponds to the degree of rationality of the agents. While the logit choice function is a very natural behavioral model for approximately rational agents, the specific revision process that selects one single player per time step seems less justified. In this paper we thus focus on the dynamics where at every time step every player simultaneously updates her strategy according to the logit choice function. We call such a dynamics the \u201call-logit\u201d, as opposed to the classical \u201cone-logit\u201d dynamics. The all-logit dynamics for a game induces an ergodic Markov chain over the set of strategy profiles which is significantly different from the Markov chain induced in the one-logit case. In this paper we first highlight similarities and differences between the two dynamics with some simple examples of two-player games; we then give a characterization of the class of games such that the Markov chains induced by the all-logit dynamics are reversible and we show it is a subclass of potential games; finally, we analyze the mixing time of the all-logit dynamics for a well-known coordination game.",
