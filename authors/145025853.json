            "abstract": "Collaborative Business Analysis (CBA) is a methodology that involves bringing together different stakeholders, including business users, analysts, and technical specialists, to collaboratively analyze data and gain insights into business operations. The primary objective of CBA is to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration between the different groups involved in business analysis, as this can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the data and better decision-making. CBA typically involves a range of activities, including data gathering and analysis, brainstorming, problem-solving, decision-making and knowledge sharing. These activities may take place through various channels, such as in-person meetings, virtual collaboration tools or online forums. This paper deals with virtual collaboration tools as an important part of Business Intelligence (BI) platform. Collaborative Business Intelligence (CBI) tools are becoming more user-friendly, accessible, and flexible, allowing users to customize their experience and adapt to their specific needs. The goal of a virtual assistant is to make data exploration more accessible to a wider range of users and to reduce the time and effort required for data analysis. It describes the unified business intelligence semantic model, coupled with a data warehouse and collaborative unit to employ data mining technology. Moreover, we propose a virtual assistant for CBI and a reference model of virtual tools for CBI, which consists of three components: conversational, data exploration and recommendation agents. We believe that the allocation of these three functional tasks allows you to structure the CBI issue and apply relevant and productive models for human-like dialogue, text-to-command transferring, and recommendations simultaneously. The complex approach based on these three points gives the basis for virtual tool for collaboration. CBI encourages people, processes, and technology to enable everyone sharing and leveraging collective expertise, knowledge and data to gain valuable insights for making better decisions. This allows to respond more quickly and effectively to changes in the market or internal operations and improve the progress.",

            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Business Intelligence constitutes a set of methodologies and tools aiming at querying, reporting, on-line analytic processing (OLAP), generating alerts, performing business analytics, etc. When in need to perform these tasks collectively by different collaborators, we need a Collaborative Business Intelligence (CBI) platform. CBI plays a significant role in targeting a common goal among various companies, but it requires them to connect, organize and coordinate with each other to share opportunities, respecting their own autonomy and heterogeneity. This paper presents a CBI platform that hat democratizes data by allowing BI users to easily connect, share and visualize data among collaborators, obtain actionable answers by collaborative analysis, investigate and make collaborative decisions, and also store the analyses along graphical diagrams and charts in a collaborative ontology knowledge base. Our CBI framework supports and assists information sharing, collaborative decision-making and annotation management beyond the boundaries of individuals and enterprises.",

Ontology construction is a difficult group activity that involves many people with the different expertise. Generally, domain experts are not familiar with the ontology implementation environments and implementation experts do not have all the domain knowledge. We have designed Collaborative Business Intelligence Ontology (CBIOnt) for BI4People project. In this paper, we present CBIOnt that is OWL 2 DL ontology for the description of collaborative session between different collaborators working together on the business intelligent platform. As the collaborative session between various collaborators belongs to some collaborative form, phase and research aspect, therefore CBIOnt captures this knowledge along with the collaborative session content (comments, questions, answers, etc.) so that one can inference various types of information stored on ontologies when required. In addition, it stores the location and temporal-spatial information about the collaboration held between collaborators. We believe CBIOnt serves as a formal framework for dealing with the collaborative session taken place among collaborators on the semantic Web.",

Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",

            "abstract": "The rise of big data has revolutionized data exploitation practices and led to the emergence of new concepts. Among them, data lakes have emerged as large heterogeneous data repositories that can be analyzed by various methods. An efficient data lake requires a metadata system that addresses the many problems arising when dealing with big data. In consequence, the study of data lake metadata models is currently an active research topic and many proposals have been made in this regard. However, existing metadata models are either tailored for a specific use case or insufficiently generic to manage different types of data lakes, including our previous model MEDAL. In this paper, we generalize MEDAL's concepts in a new metadata model called goldMEDAL. Moreover, we compare goldMEDAL with the most recent state-of-the-art metadata models aiming at genericity and show that we can reproduce these metadata models with goldMEDAL's concepts. As a proof of concept, we also illustrate that goldMEDAL allows the design of various data lakes by presenting three different use cases.",

            "abstract": "With new emerging technologies, such as satellites and drones, archaeologists collect data over large areas. However, it becomes difficult to process such data in time. Archaeological data also have many different formats (images, texts, sensor data) and can be structured, semi-structured and unstructured. Such variety makes data difficult to collect, store, manage, search and analyze effectively. A few approaches have been proposed, but none of them covers the full data lifecycle nor provides an efficient data management system. Hence, we propose the use of a data lake to provide centralized data stores to host heterogeneous data, as well as tools for data quality checking, cleaning, transformation and analysis. In this paper, we propose a generic, flexible and complete data lake architecture. Our metadata management system exploits goldMEDAL, which is the most generic metadata model currently available. Finally, we detail the concrete implementation of this architecture dedicated to an archaeological project.",

The need for analyzing data stored in different data warehouses generates the requirement of merging them into one integrated data warehouse. The data warehouse merging process is composed of two steps: matching multidimensional components and then merging them. Current approaches do not take all the particularities of multidimensional data warehouses into account, e.g., only merging schemata, but not instances; or not exploiting hierarchies nor fact tables. Thus, in this paper, we propose an automatic merging approach for star schema-modeled data warehouses that works at both the schema and instance levels. We also provide algorithms for merging hierarchies, dimensions and facts. Eventually, we implement our merging algorithms and validate them with the use of both synthetic and benchmark datasets.",
