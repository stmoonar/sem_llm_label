            "abstract": "In recommender systems, reinforcement learning solutions have effectively boosted recommendation performance because of their ability to capture long-term user-system interaction. However, the action space of the recommendation policy is a list of items, which could be extremely large with a dynamic candidate item pool. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hyper-actor and critic learning framework where the policy decomposes the item list generation process into a hyper-action inference step and an effect-action selection step. The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to stabilize the learning process. We build simulated environments on public datasets and empirically show that our framework is superior in recommendation compared to standard RL baselines.",

            "abstract": "Personalized recommender systems fulfill the daily demands of customers and boost online businesses. The goal is to learn a policy that can generate a list of items that matches the user's demand or interest. While most existing methods learn a pointwise scoring model that predicts the ranking score of each individual item, recent research shows that the listwise approach can further improve the recommendation quality by modeling the intra-list correlations of items that are exposed together. This has motivated the recent list reranking and generative recommendation approaches that optimize the overall utility of the entire list. However, it is challenging to explore the combinatorial space of list actions and existing methods that use cross-entropy loss may suffer from low diversity issues. In this work, we aim to learn a policy that can generate sufficiently diverse item lists for users while maintaining high recommendation quality. The proposed solution, GFN4Rec, is a generative method that takes the insight of the flow network to ensure the alignment between list generation probability and its reward. The key advantages of our solution are the log scale reward matching loss that intrinsically improves the generation diversity and the autoregressive item selection model that captures the item mutual influences while capturing future reward of the list. As validation of our method's effectiveness and its superior diversity during active exploration, we conduct experiments on simulated online environments as well as an offline evaluation framework for two real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Security bug report (SBR) prediction has been increasingly investigated for eliminating security attack risks of software products. However, there is still much room for improving the performance of automatic SBR prediction. This work is inspired by the work of two recent studies proposed by Peters et al. and Wu et al., which are focused on SBR prediction and both published on the top tier journal TSE (Transactions on Software Engineering). The goal of this work is to improve the effectiveness of supervised machine learning-based SBR prediction with the help of software security domain knowledge. It first extracts software security domain knowledge from CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities Exposure), which are authoritative sources of software vulnerability. After that, the matrix of bug reports is generated based on the roots of security domain keywords. Large-scale experiments are conducted on a set of trustworthy datasets cleaned by Wu et al. The results show our domain knowledge-guided approach could improve the effectiveness of SBR prediction by 25% in terms of F1-score on average.",

            "abstract": "To capture higher-order structural features, most GNN-based algorithms learn node representations incorporating k-hop neighbors' information. Due to the high time complexity of querying k-hop neighbors, most graph algorithms cannot be deployed in a giant dense temporal network to execute millisecond-level inference. This problem dramatically limits the potential of applying graph algorithms in certain areas, especially financial fraud detection. Therefore, we propose Asynchronous Propagation Attention Network, an asynchronous continuous time dynamic graph algorithm for real-time temporal graph embedding. Traditional graph models usually execute two serial operations: first graph querying and then model inference. Different from previous graph algorithms, we decouple model inference and graph computation to alleviate the damage of the heavy graph query operation to the speed of model inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance while greatly improving the inference speed. The source code is published at a Github repository.",

            "abstract": "With the continuous evolution of research on convolutional neural networks, it is an efficient and fashionable method to introduce attention mechanism into the convolutional structure. The channel attention designed in SENet has made a great contribution to the promotion of the attention convolution model. However, our research found that SENet focuses on certain feature channels rather than objects in the channels. It will simultaneously enhance or weaken the target objects and background information in a certain channel. On the basis of the channel attention convolution network, we first perform channel sorting and group convolution on the feature map, and expand each group to $\\beta $ times the original feature channel during the group convolution process to construct a channel expansion convolution network (CENet), where $\\beta $ is an array used to represent the channel expansion coefficient. CENet captures the attention of objects in the feature channel while expanding the proportion of features in the relatively important channel. Furthermore, we improved the structure of CENet and merged it into the intra-layer multi-scale convolutional model to construct an object-level attention multi-scale convolutional neural network (OAMS-CNN). We have conducted a large number of experiments on four data sets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft and Stanford Cars. The experimental results show that our proposed new object-level attention convolution model has achieved good image classification results.",
