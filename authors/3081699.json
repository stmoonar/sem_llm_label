            "abstract": "Data Fairness is a crucial topic due to the recent wide usage of AI powered applications. Most of the real-world data is filled with human or machine biases and when those data are being used to train AI models, there is a chance that the model will reflect the bias in the training data. Existing bias-mitigating generative methods based on GANs, Diffusion models need in-processing fairness objectives and fail to consider computational overhead while choosing computationally-heavy architectures, which may lead to high computational demands, instability and poor optimization performance. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we present a fair data generation technique based on knowledge distillation, where we use a small architecture to distill the fair representation in the latent space. The idea of fair latent space distillation enables more flexible and stable training of Fair Generative Models (FGMs). We first learn a syntax-agnostic (for any data type) fair representation of the data, followed by distillation in the latent space into a smaller model. After distillation, we use the distilled fair latent space to generate high-fidelity fair synthetic data. While distilling, we employ quality loss (for fair distillation) and utility loss (for data utility) to ensure that the fairness and data utility characteristics remain in the distilled latent space. Our approaches show a 5%, 5% and 10% rise in performance in fairness, synthetic sample quality and data utility, respectively, than the state-of-the-art fair generative model.",

            "abstract": "This work presents Fair4Free, a novel generative model to generate synthetic fair data using data-free distillation in the latent space. Fair4Free can work on the situation when the data is private or inaccessible. In our approach, we first train a teacher model to create fair representation and then distil the knowledge to a student model (using a smaller architecture). The process of distilling the student model is data-free, i.e. the student model does not have access to the training dataset while distilling. After the distillation, we use the distilled model to generate fair synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments show that our synthetic samples outperform state-of-the-art models in all three criteria (fairness, utility and synthetic quality) with a performance increase of 5% for fairness, 8% for utility and 12% in synthetic quality for both tabular and image datasets.",

            "abstract": "We present FairX, an open-source Python-based benchmarking tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of models under the umbrella of fairness, utility, and eXplainability (XAI). FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-mitigation models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework. Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data. This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets. The open-source FairX benchmarking package is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/fahim-sikder/FairX}.",

            "abstract": "Stream reasoning can be defined as incremental reasoning over incrementally-available information. The formula progression procedure for Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) makes use of syntactic formula rewritings to incrementally evaluate formulas against incrementally-available states. Progression however assumes complete state information, which can be problematic when not all state information is available or can be observed, such as in qualitative spatial reasoning tasks or in robotics applications. In those cases, there may be uncertainty as to which state out of a set of possible states represents the \u2018true\u2019 state. The main contribution of this paper is therefore an extension of the progression procedure that efficiently keeps track of all consistent hypotheses. The resulting procedure is flexible, allowing a trade-off between faster but approximate and slower but precise progression under uncertainty. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated by considering the time and space requirements, as well as the impact of permitting varying degrees of uncertainty.",

A recent trend is that users use the real-time property of these services to share their opinions and thoughts as events unfold on TV or in the real world. In the context of TV broadcasts, Twitter (over a mobile device, for example) is referred to as a second screen. This paper presents the first characterization of the second screen usage over the playoffs of a major sports league. We present both temporal and spatial analysis of the Twitter usage during the end of the National Hockey League (NHL) regular season and the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs. Our analysis provides insights into the usage patterns over the full 72-day period and with regards to in-game events such as goals, but also with regards to geographic biases. Quantifying these biases and the significance of specific events, we then discuss and provide insights into how the playoff dynamics may impact advertisers and third-party developers that try to provide increased personalization.",

            "abstract": "Modern robotic systems often consist of a growing set of information-producing components that need to be appropriately connected for the system to function properly. This is commonly done manually or through relatively simple scripts by specifying explicitly which components to connect. However, this process is cumbersome and error-prone, does not scale well as more components are introduced, and lacks flexibility and robustness at run-time. This paper presents an algorithm for setting up and maintaining implicit subscriptions to information through its semantics rather than its source, which we call semantic subscriptions. The proposed algorithm automatically reconfigures the system when necessary in response to changes at run-time, making the semantic subscriptions adaptive to changing circumstances. To illustrate the effectiveness of adaptive semantic subscriptions, we present a case study with two SoftBank Robotics NAO robots for handling the cases when a component stops working and when new components, in this case a second robot, become available. The solution has been implemented as part of a stream reasoning framework integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS).",
