            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Performance of applications in production environments can be sensitive to network congestion. Cray Aries supports adaptively routing each network packet independently based on the load or congestion encountered as a packet traverses the network. Software can dictate different routing policies, adjusting between minimal and non-minimal bias, for each posted message. We have extensively evaluated the sensitivity of the routing bias selection on application performance as well as whole system performance in both production and controlled conditions. We show that the default routing bias used in Aries-based systems is often sub-optimal and that using a higher bias towards minimal routes will not only reduce the congestion effects on the application but also will decrease the overall congestion on the network. This routing scheme results in not only improved mean performance (by up to 12%) of most production applications but also reduced run-to-run variability. Our study prompted the two supercomputing facilities (ALCF and NERSC) to change the default routing mode on their Aries-based systems. We present the substantial improvement measured in the overall congestion management and interconnect performance in production after making this change.",

            "abstract": "Network congestion is one of the biggest problems facing HPC systems today, affecting system throughput, performance, user experience, and reproducibility. Congestion manifests as run-to-run variability due to contention for shared resources (e.g., filesystems) or routes between compute endpoints. Despite its significance, current network benchmarks fail to proxy the real-world network utilization seen on congested systems. We propose a new open-source benchmark suite called the Global Performance and Congestion Network Tests (GPCNeT) to advance the state of the practice in this area. The guiding principles used in designing GPCNeT are described and the methodology employed to maximize its utility is presented. The capabilities of GPCNeT are evaluated by analyzing results from several world's largest HPC systems, including an evaluation of congestion management on a next-generation network. The results show that systems of all technologies and scales are susceptible to congestion and this work motivates the need for congestion control in next-generation networks.",

One in particular is the ability to fully utilize the high\u2010speed communications network, given that the serial performance of a Xeon PhiTM core is a fraction of a Xeon\u00aecore. In this paper, we take a look at the trade\u2010offs associated with allocating enough cores to fully utilize the Aries high\u2010speed network versus cores dedicated to computation, eg, the trade\u2010off between MPI and OpenMP. In addition, we evaluate new features of Cray MPI in support of KNL, such as internode optimizations. We also evaluate one\u2010sided programming models such as Unified Parallel C. We quantify the impact of the above trade\u2010offs and features using a suite of National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center applications.",

To handle the considerable computational cost of this problem, we present CosmoFlow: a highly scalable deep learning application built on top of the TensorFlow framework. CosmoFlow uses efficient implementations of 3D convolution and pooling primitives, together with improvements in threading for many element-wise operations, to improve training performance on Intel\u00ae Xeon Phi\u2122 processors. We also utilize the Cray PE Machine Learning Plugin for efficient scaling to multiple nodes. We demonstrate fully synchronous data-parallel training on 8192 nodes of Cori with 77% parallel efficiency, achieving 3.5 Pflop/s sustained performance. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale science application of the TensorFlow framework at supercomputer scale with fully-synchronous training. These enhancements enable us to process large 3D dark matter distribution and predict the cosmological parameters \u03a9subM/sub, \u03c3sub8/sub and nsubs/sub with unprecedented accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning has proven to be a successful tool for solving a large variety of problems in various scientific fields and beyond. In recent years, the models as well as the available datasets have grown bigger and more complicated, and thus, an increasing amount of computing resources is required in order to train these models in a reasonable amount of time. Besides being able to use HPC resources, deep learning model developers want flexible frameworks which allow for rapid prototyping. One of the most important of these frameworks is Google TensorFlow, which provides both features, ie, good performance as well as flexibility. In this paper, we discuss different solutions for scaling the TensorFlow Framework to thousands of nodes on contemporary Cray XC supercomputing systems.",

            "abstract": "Owing to increases in computing power, high-order Eulerian schemes will likely become instrumental in simulations of turbulence and magnetic field amplification in astrophysical fluids in the next years. We present the implementation of a fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme for constrained-transport magnetohydrodynamics in the code WOMBAT. We establish the correctness of our implementation with extensive number tests. We find that the fifth-order scheme performs as accurately as a common second-order scheme at half the resolution. We argue that for a given solution quality, the new scheme is more computationally efficient than lower order schemes in three dimensions. We also establish the performance characteristics of the solver in the WOMBAT framework. Our implementation fully vectorizes using flattened arrays in thread-local memory. It performs at about 0.6 million zones per second per node on Intel Broadwell. We present scaling tests of the code on up to 98,000 cores on the Cray XC40 machine \u201cHazel Hen,\u201d with a sustained performance of about 5% of peak at scale.",

We present a summary of the procedural and technical solutions that have been developed since the launch of Chandra to meet unanticipated challenges in the area of data processing. Lessons learned concerning data processing are discussed, including an explanation of the source of each problem and the Chandra team's response to the problem. Potential pitfalls that might affect future projects are also included. The user interface, data quality screening, and quicklook software developed specifically to address issues identified after launch have proved valuable in meeting the goals of low-cost, efficient, and flexible mission operations for the Chandra mission and can provide insight for future mission designs.",
