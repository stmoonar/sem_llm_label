            "title": "KGUF: Simple Knowledge-aware Graph-based Recommender with User-based Semantic Features Filtering",
            "abstract": "The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into recommendation has led to a novel family of Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches, namely Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF). Following the same GNNs wave, recommender systems exploiting Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have also been successfully empowered by the GCF rationale to combine the representational power of GNNs with the semantics conveyed by KGs, giving rise to Knowledge-aware Graph Collaborative Filtering (KGCF), which use KGs to mine hidden user intent. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that computing and combining user-level intent might not always be necessary, as simpler approaches can yield comparable or superior results while keeping explicit semantic features. Under this perspective, user historical preferences become essential to refine the KG and retain the most discriminating features, thus leading to concise item representation. Driven by the assumptions above, we propose KGUF, a KGCF model that learns latent representations of semantic features in the KG to better define the item profile. By leveraging user profiles through decision trees, KGUF effectively retains only those features relevant to users. Results on three datasets justify KGUF's rationale, as our approach is able to reach performance comparable or superior to SOTA methods while maintaining a simpler formalization.

The research and industrial community have devoted an unprecedented effort to propose approaches and architectures to extract relevant and tailored information from every shred of knowledge. Inspired by the advances in knowledge graph, Graph Convolutional Networks, Link Prediction, and Recommender Systems research, this study aims to meet their cutting-edge research needs of holistic datasets by largely expanding the information available for two well-known recommendation datasets in the book and movie domains, i.e., LibraryThing and MovieLens 25M. We collect the associated knowledge graphs (KGs) for each of them and publish a mapping for each item in the two datasets with the corresponding entities in the original Wikidata, DBpedia, and Freebase KGs.

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KG) have been proven to be a powerful source of side information to enhance the performance of recommendation algorithms. Their graph-based structure paves the way for the adoption of graph-aware learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this respect, state-of-the-art models achieve good performance and interpretability via user-level combinations of intents leading users to their choices. Unfortunately, such results often come from and end-to-end learnings that considers a combination of the whole set of features contained in the KG without any analysis of the user decisions. In this paper, we introduce KGTORe, a GNN-based model that exploits KG to learn latent representations for the semantic features, and consequently, interpret the user decisions as a personal distillation of the item feature representations. Differently from previous models, KGTORe does not need to process the whole KG at training time but relies on a selection of the most discriminative features for the users, thus resulting in improved performance and personalization. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show that KGTORe achieves remarkable accuracy performance and several ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of its components. The implementation of KGTORe is available at: https://github.com/sisinflab/KGTORe.",

Their message-passing schema effectively distills the collaborative signal throughout the user-item graph by propagating informative content from neighbor to ego nodes. In this demonstration, we show how to run complete experimental pipelines with six state-of-the-art graph recommendation models in Elliot (i.e., our framework for recommender system evaluation). We seek to highlight four main features, namely: (i) we support reproducibility in PyTorch Geometric (i.e., the library we use to implement the baselines); (ii) reproduced graph models span across various GCN families; (iii) we prepare a Docker image to provide a self-consistent ecosystem for the running of experiments.

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, due to the little use of content information, they narrowly focus on accuracy, disregarding a higher degree of personalization. Meanwhile, knowledge graphs are arousing considerable interest in recommendation models thanks to their ability to enrich the system with content features that captures subtle user-item relations. Nevertheless, with many high-quality features, the models become more complex and challenging to train. We extend KGFlex [16], a hybrid model that analyzes historical data to understand the semantic features the user decisions depend on. KGFlex represents item features as embeddings, and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user, thus reducing the complexity and raising the degree of personalization. The method does not neglect long tail items, reducing the popularity bias and ensuring a high level of fairness. The user-item prediction is mediated by the user\u2019s personal views of the embeddings that grant a high degree of expressiveness. This extension analyzes different entropy measurement strategies, an enhanced user negative decision modeling, and assesses the fairness of KGFlex and the impact of its hyperparameters.

            "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently been shown to improve the recommendation accuracy of collaborative filtering algorithms. Their message-passing schema refines user and item node representation by aggregating the informative content from the neighborhood. However, noisy contributions can flatten the differences among nodes after multiple hops, as not all user-item interactions are equally important. This impact is mitigated by (i) restricting the exploration depth in the graph and optionally weighting the neighbor contribution and (ii) going beyond the traditional message propagation at multiple hops. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these exploration strategies affect the recommendation of novel and diverse products. This study investigates the influence of such GCN techniques on novelty and diversity of recommendations. It also assesses and motivates the impact of the number of exploration hops on the same metrics by analyzing interactions between same-type and different-type nodes, such as user-user and user-item.
