            "abstract": "Count questions are an important type of information need, though often present in noisy, contradictory, or semantically not fully aligned form on the Web. In this work, we propose CardiO, a lightweight and modular framework for searching entity counts on the Web. CardiO extracts all counts from a set of relevant Web snippets, and infers the most central count based on semantic and numeric distances from other candidates. In the absence of supporting evidence, the system relies on peer sets of similar size, to provide an estimate. Experiments show that CardiO can produce accurate and traceable counts better than small LLM-only methods. Although larger models have higher precision, when used to enhance CardiO components, they do not contribute to the final precision or recall.",

            "title": "CoQEx: Entity Counts Explained",
            "abstract": "For open-domain question answering, queries on entity counts, such ashow many languages are spoken in Indonesia, are challenging. Such queries can be answered through succinct contexts with counts:estimated 700 languages, and instances:Javanese and Sundanese. Answer candidates naturally give rise to a distribution, where count contexts denoting the queried entity counts and their semantic subgroups often coexist, while the instances ground the counts in their constituting entities. In this demo we showcase the CoQEx methodology (Count Queries Explained) [5,6], which aggregates and structures explanatory evidence across search snippets, for answering user queries related to entity counts [4]. Given a entity count query, our system CoQEx retrieves search-snippets and provides the user with a distribution-aware prediction prediction, categorizes the count contexts into semantic groups and ranks instances grounding the counts, all in real-time.

            "title": "Completeness, Recall, and Negation in Open-world Knowledge Bases: A Survey",
            "abstract": "General-purpose knowledge bases (KBs) are a cornerstone of knowledge-centric AI. Many of them are constructed pragmatically from web sources and are thus far from complete. This poses challenges for the consumption as well as the curation of their content. While several surveys target the problem of completing incomplete KBs, the first problem is arguably to know whether and where the KB is incomplete in the first place, and to which degree. In this survey, we discuss how knowledge about completeness, recall, and negation in KBs can be expressed, extracted, and inferred. We cover (i) the logical foundations of knowledge representation and querying under partial closed-world semantics; (ii) the estimation of this information via statistical patterns; (iii) the extraction of information about recall from KBs and text; (iv) the identification of interesting negative statements; and (v) relaxed notions of relative recall. This survey is targeted at two types of audiences: (1) practitioners who are interested in tracking KB quality, focusing extraction efforts, and building quality-aware downstream applications; and (2) data management, knowledge base, and semantic web researchers who wish to understand the state-of-the-art of knowledge bases beyond the open-world assumption. Consequently, our survey presents both fundamental methodologies and the results that they have produced, and gives practice-oriented recommendations on how to choose between different approaches for a problem at hand.",

They require some kind of reasoning since web documents and knowledge bases, indispensable sources of information, rarely store direct answers to questions, such as, \u201cAre there more astronauts or Physics Nobel Laureates?\u201d We tackle questions on class cardinality comparison by tapping into three sources for absolute cardinalities as well as the cardinalities of orthogonal subgroups of the classes. We propose novel techniques for aggregating signals with partial coverage for more reliable estimates and evaluate them on a dataset of 4005 class pairs, achieving an accuracy of 83.7%.",

            "abstract": "A challenging case in web search and question answering are count queries, such as\"number of songs by John Lennon''. Prior methods merely answer these with a single, and sometimes puzzling number or return a ranked list of text snippets with different numbers. This paper proposes a methodology for answering count queries with inference, contextualization and explanatory evidence. Unlike previous systems, our method infers final answers from multiple observations, supports semantic qualifiers for the counts, and provides evidence by enumerating representative instances. Experiments with a wide variety of queries show the benefits of our method. To promote further research on this underexplored topic, we release an annotated dataset of 5k queries with 200k relevant text spans.",

Pragmatically constructed from available web sources, these KBs are far from complete, which poses a set of challenges in curation as well as consumption. In this tutorial we discuss how completeness, recall and negation in DBs and KBs can be represented, extracted, and inferred. We proceed in 5 parts: (i) We introduce the logical foundations of knowledge representation and querying under partial closed-world semantics. (ii) We show how information about recall can be identified in KBs and in text, and (iii) how it can be estimated via statistical patterns. (iv) We show how interesting negative statements can be identified, and (v) how recall can be targeted in a comparative notion.",

            "abstract": ". General-purpose knowledge bases (KBs), like DBpedia and Wikidata, contain billions of facts but, are still incomplete, use messy redundant relations and have inconsistent data. These pitfalls manifest themselves in applications like question answering (QA), where, the state-of-the-art commercial search engines answer popular user queries in information cards and carousels when the answers are available in the KBs. However, the moment a query concerns a lesser known entity, the system defaults to the classical web search and information retrieval with text highlighting. In this work we focus on the aspect of count information. Understanding count information on a semantic level is important not only for back-end data curation but also user-end applications like QA. The end goal being to move beyond aggregations into a more systematic approach to dealing with count information. Even though count information is found abundantly in text sources, extraction is non-trivial since it does not follow the general subject-predicate-object principle ( Obama has two children ! h Obama, children, 2 i instead of h Obama, has, 2 children i ). Count information can be modelled as integers as in the previous sentence or through entity enumerations ( Obama\u2019s children are Sasha and Malia. ). We de\ufb01ne and model count information and address its role in data curation and QA.",

FD small cells with device-to-device (D2D) communication links could achieve the expected capacity of the future cellular networks (5G). In this work, we consider joint scheduling and dynamic power algorithm (DPA) for a single cell FD small cell network with D2D links (D2DLs). We formulate the optimal user selection and power control as a non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem to get the optimal user scheduling and transmission power in a given TTI. Our numerical results show that using DPA gives better overall throughput performance than full power transmission algorithm (FPA). Also, simultaneous transmissions (combination of uplink (UL), downlink (DL), and D2D occur 80% of the time thereby increasing the spectral efficiency and network capacity.",

Due to the unattended nature of the network the sink is not always present. Hence, the nodes in the network are required to function in a distributed way in order to ensure Data Survivability and Data Confidentiality. In this work we address these two issues. We have proposed algorithm (s) to ensure Data Survivability by encryption and data replication. We propose a simple scheme for key management which ensures confidentiality by sharing the key among various nodes in the network so that the adversary cannot read the data by compromising a node in the network. We have compared our scheme with the existing ones, both mathematically and by simulations. Analysis shows that our scheme performs better in terms of overheads and efficiency.",
