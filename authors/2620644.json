            "title": "Towards Hybrid Automation by Bootstrapping Conversational Interfaces for IT Operation Tasks",
            "abstract": "Process automation has evolved from end-to-end automation of repetitive process branches to hybrid automation where bots perform some activities and humans serve other activities. In the context of knowledge-intensive processes such as IT operations, implementing hybrid automation is a natural choice where robots can perform certain mundane functions, with humans taking over the decision of when and which IT systems need to act. Recently, ChatOps, which refers to conversation-driven collaboration for IT operations, has rapidly accelerated efficiency by providing a cross-organization and cross-domain platform to resolve and manage issues as soon as possible. Hence, providing a natural language interface to bots is a logical progression to enable collaboration between humans and bots. This work presents a no-code approach to provide a conversational interface that enables human workers to collaborate with bots executing automation scripts. The bots identify the intent of users' requests and automatically orchestrate one or more relevant automation tasks to serve the request. We further detail our process of mining the conversations between humans and bots to monitor performance and identify the scope for improvement in service quality.",

The proposed algorithm presents a generalisation such that the optimisation process can operate in the entire spectrum from \u2018complete consensus\u2019 to \u2018complete disagreement\u2019. A user-defined control parameter \u03b8 is identified for controlling such tradeoff as well as the temporal convergence properties. We formulate the algorithm based upon generalised time-synchronous gossip algorithm and subgradient method and provide analytical results for first and second moment convergence analysis. The proposed algorithm also provides a convergence rate estimate of in the number of iterations m when the step size is constant. We consider the effect of noise in networked systems from the perspectives of modelling uncertainty and measurement noise in subgradient estimation process and communication among agents, respectively. A numerical case study based on a multi-agent building energy system is used to validate the proposed algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Learning the emergence of cooperation in conflicting scenarios such as social dilemmas is a centerpiece of research. Many reinforcement learning based theories exist in the literature to address this problem. The well-known fact about RL based model's very slow learning capabilities coupled with large state space exhibit significant negative effects especially in repeated version of social dilemma settings such as repeated Public Goods Game (PGG) and thereby making them ineffective to model sustainability of cooperation. In this paper, we address this research challenge by augmenting the reinforcement learning based models with a notion of collaboration among the agents, motivated by the fact that humans learn not only through their own actions but also by following the actions of other agents who also continuously learn about the environment. In particular, we propose a novel model, which we refer to as Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL), wherein we define collaboration among the agents as the ability of agents to fully follow other agent's actions/decisions. This is also termed as social learning. The proposed CRL model significantly influences the speed of individual learning, which eventually has a large effect on the collective behavior as compared to that of RL only models and thereby effectively explaining the sustainability of cooperation in repeated PGG settings. We also extend the CRL model for PGGs over different generations where agents die out and new agents are born following a birth-death process.",

            "title": "Dynamic Particle Allocation to Solve Interactive POMDP Models for Social Decision Making",
            "abstract": "In social dilemma settings, such as repeated Public Goods Games (PGGs), humans often come across a dilemma whether to contribute or not based on past contributions from others. In such settings, the decision taken by an agent/human actually depends not only on the belief the agent has about other agents and the environment, but also on their beliefs about others' beliefs. To factor in these aspects, we propose a novel formulation of computational theory of mind (ToM) to model human behavior in a repeated PGG using interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs). Interactive particle filter (IPF) is a well-known algorithm used to approximately solve I-POMDP models for the agents to find their optimal contributions. Number of particles assigned to an agent in IPF can be translated into time and computational resources. Solving I-POMDPs in a time-memory efficient manner even in the case of small state spaces is a largely intractable problem. Also, maintaining a fixed number of particles assigned to each agent, over time, will be highly inefficient in terms of resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic particle allocation algorithm for different agents based on how well they could predict. We validate our proposed algorithm through real experiments involving human agents. Our results suggest that dynamic particle allocation based IPF for I-POMDPs is effective in modelling human behaviours in repeated social dilemma setting while utilizing computational resources in an effective manner.",

            "abstract": "Distributed optimization has been a significantly important topic in recent multi-agent networked systems research for a variety of real-life applications. Most of the previous works are focused on how to find the globally optimal solution under certain assumptions on the objective functions as well as the agent interaction characteristics. However, in many practical problems (specifically, where agents form multiple sub-groups smaller than the overall multi-agent system based on commonalities of objective functions or nature of connectivity), globally optimal solution may not be very useful and quite difficult to achieve. Achieving multiple local optimal solutions for different sub-groups may be more useful in these cases. In this context, this paper presents a new distributed optimization problem formulation by introducing a modified cost function involving a parameter that controls the tradeoff between consensus and disagreement enabling realization of the entire spectrum of globally optimal solution to multiple locally optimal solutions. A distributed generalized consensus-based gradient (DGCG) algorithm is proposed to solve such an optimization problem for strongly convex objective functions. We show the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm and two illustrative numerical examples for validating the methodology.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a generalized gossip-based algorithm to solve distributed optimization problems in multi-agent networks, especially for multiple supply-demand optimization problems. The proposed algorithm provides a generalization such that the optimization process can operate in the entire spectrum of \u201ccomplete consensus\u201d to \u201ccomplete disagreement\u201d. A user-defined control parameter \u03b8 is identified for controlling such tradeoff as well as the temporal convergence properties. Analytical results for first moment convergence analysis are presented and it is shown that with \u03b8 \u2192 0, the formulation boils down to a classical consensus based protocol. Beyond the control parameter, the agent interaction matrix is also shown to be useful for effectively suppressing large localized uncertainties in subgradient estimation. A practical use case regarding building zone temperature control is presented as a numerical example for validation.",

            "abstract": "Symbol sequences are generated from observed time series data to construct probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) models that capture the evolution of the dynamical system under consideration. One of the key challenges here is to estimate the relevant history or depth (i.e., the size of temporal memory) of the symbol sequences; in this context, spectral decomposition of the one-step transition matrix has been recently proposed for depth estimation. This paper compares the performance of depth estimation by spectral analysis with that of other commonly used metrics (e.g., log-likelihood, entropy rate and signal reconstruction) for analysis of symbolic dynamic systems. For experimental validation of the proposed concept, time-series data of fatigue damage evolution in a polycrystalline alloy, collected on a laboratory apparatus, have been discretized to generate symbol sequences. The depths, estimated by the spectral decomposition method, are then compared with those obtained by other metrics, and the results are found to be in close agreement. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering of time-series data, obtained for a number of test specimens in the fatigue-test experiments, demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed depth estimation method as well as the accuracy of depth estimation via spectral analysis and PFSA model construction.",
