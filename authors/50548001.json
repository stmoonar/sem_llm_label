            "abstract": "Volunteer computing is a way of supporting people around the world who provide free computer resources, to participate in scientific calculation or data analysis on the Internet. This provides an effective solution to solve the problems of large scale of basic scientific computing and more computing resources requirements. Task allocation is a very important part of volunteer computing. An effective algorithm can significantly improve computational efficiency. At present, most of the existing tasks are divided in term of the computer hardware conditions or the initial state of the computer in the volunteer computing. It seems that this have no obvious impact to calculating efficiency in a short time, but this task will be less flexible when idle resources of the volunteer computing becomes less or more. To make full use of idle computer resources, a dynamic task allocation algorithm (TAA) based on weighted velocity was proposed in this work. The research results showed that the weighted velocity as a parameter can be used to test the computing performance of a computer, dynamically manage task allocation as well. Keywords: volunteer computing, task allocation, weighted average velocity",

            "title": "A Task Allocation Algorithm with Weighted Average Velocity Based on Online Active Period",
            "abstract": "In some complex scientific calculation, the resources of the calculation are very large. To a certain extent, the improvement of the computer level has met the needs of many computing, but a lot of more complex calculation cannot still be effectively resolved. Volunteer computing is a computational method that divides the complexity of computing tasks into simple subtasks, and collects the results of volunteer computing resources to solve the subtasks. In this calculation process, the task assignment module is an extremely important part of the whole computing platform. Many of the existing task allocation algorithms (TAA) are used to group by the similar conditions of the volunteer computer. TAA used in this work grouped by the computers with similar online active period, and the computation efficiency is improved by using the weighted average velocity as a parameter. The experimental results showed that TAA with the weighted average velocity based on online active period can effectively improve the performance of the volunteer computing platform.

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a grid-based clustering algorithm Clu-US which is competent to find clusters of non-convex shapes on uncertain data stream. Clu-US maps the uncertain data tuples to the grid space which could store and update the summary information of stream. The uncertainty of data is taken into account for calculating the probability center of a grid. Then, the distance between the probability centers of two adjacent grids is adopted for measuring whether they are \"close enough\" in grids merging process. Furthermore, a dynamic outlier deletion mechanism is developed to improve clustering performance. The experimental results show that Clu-US outperforms other algorithms in terms of clustering quality and speed.",
