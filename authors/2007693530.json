            "abstract": "Principled accountability for autonomous decision-making in uncertain environments requires distinguishing intentional outcomes from negligent designs from actual accidents. We propose analyzing the behavior of autonomous agents through a quantitative measure of the evidence of intentional behavior. We model an uncertain environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). For a given scenario, we rely on probabilistic model checking to compute the ability of the agent to influence reaching a certain event. We call this the scope of agency. We say that there is evidence of intentional behavior if the scope of agency is high and the decisions of the agent are close to being optimal for reaching the event. Our method applies counterfactual reasoning to automatically generate relevant scenarios that can be analyzed to increase the confidence of our assessment. In a case study, we show how our method can distinguish between 'intentional' and 'accidental' traffic collisions.",

            "abstract": "A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a powerful cryptographic primitive used in many decentralized or privacy-focused applications. However, the high overhead of ZKPs can restrict their practical applicability. We design a programming language, Ou, aimed at easing the programmer's burden when writing efficient ZKPs, and a compiler framework, Lian, that automates the analysis and distribution of statements to a computing cluster. Ou uses programming language semantics, formal methods, and combinatorial optimization to automatically partition an Ou program into efficiently sized chunks for parallel ZK-proving and/or verification. We contribute: (1) A front-end language where users can write proof statements as imperative programs in a familiar syntax; (2) A compiler architecture and implementation that automatically analyzes the program and compiles it into an optimized IR that can be lifted to a variety of ZKP constructions; and (3) A cutting algorithm, based on Pseudo-Boolean optimization and Integer Linear Programming, that reorders instructions and then partitions the program into efficiently sized chunks for parallel evaluation and efficient state reconciliation.",

Legal theory offers a paramount method for assessing culpability: putting the agent 'on the stand' to subject their actions and intentions to cross-examination. We show that under minimal assumptions automated reasoning can rigorously interrogate algorithmic behaviors as in the adversarial process of legal fact finding. We use the formal methods of symbolic execution and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving to discharge queries about agent behavior in factual and counterfactual scenarios, as adaptively formulated by a human investigator. We implement our framework and demonstrate its utility on an illustrative car crash scenario.",

            "abstract": "Insightful interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to the principled governance of complex technologies, like those produced by modern computing research and development. Technical research on the interaction between computation and society often focuses on how researchers model social and physical systems. These models underlie how computer scientists specify problems and propose algorithmic solutions. However, the social effects of computing can depend just as much on obscure and opaque technical caveats, choices, and qualifiers. Such artifacts are products of the particular algorithmic techniques and theory applied to solve a problem once modeled, and their nature can imperil thorough sociotechnical scrutiny of the often discretionary decisions made to manage them. We describe three classes of objects used to encode these choices and qualifiers: heuristic models, assumptions, and parameters. We raise six reasons these objects may be hazardous to comprehensive analysis of computing and argue they deserve deliberate consideration as researchers explain scientific work.",

            "abstract": "We design and implement a privacy-preserving Boolean satis\ufb01ability (ppSAT) solver, which allows mutually distrustful parties to evaluate the conjunction of their input formulas while maintaining privacy. We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne a family of security guarantees reconcilable with the (known) exponential complexity of SAT solving, and then construct an oblivious variant of the classic DPLL algorithm which can be integrated with existing secure two-party computation (2PC) techniques. We further observe that most known SAT solving heuristics are unsuitable for 2PC, as they are highly data-dependent in order to minimize the number of exploration steps. Faced with how best to trade off between the number of steps and the cost of obliviously executing each one, we design three ef\ufb01cient oblivious heuristics, one deterministic and two randomized. As a result of this effort we are able to evaluate our ppSAT solver on small but practical instances arising from the haplotype inference problem in bioinformatics. We conclude by looking towards future directions for making ppSAT solving more practical, most especially the integration of con\ufb02ict-driven clause learning (CDCL).",

We apply the cryptographic theory of secure multiparty computation (MPC) to model checking. With our construction, adversarial parties D and A holding $\\mathcalM and \u03c6 respectively may check satisfaction --- notationally, whether $\\mathcalM |= \u03c6 --- while maintaining privacy of all other meaningful information. Our protocol adopts oblivious graph algorithms to provide for secure computation of global explicit state model checking with specifications in Computation Tree Logic (CTL), and its design ameliorates the asymptotic overhead required by generic MPC schemes. We therefore introduce the problem of privacy preserving model checking (PPMC) and provide an initial step towards applicable and efficient constructions.",
