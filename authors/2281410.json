            "title": "Higher-Order Networks Representation and Learning: A Survey",
            "abstract": "Network data has become widespread, larger, and more complex over the years. Traditional network data is dyadic, capturing the relations among pairs of entities. With the need to model interactions among more than two entities, significant research has focused on higher-order networks and ways to represent, analyze, and learn from them. There are two main directions to studying higher-order networks. One direction has focused on capturing higher-order patterns in traditional (dyadic) graphs by changing the basic unit of study from nodes to small frequently observed subgraphs, called motifs. As most existing network data comes in the form of pairwise dyadic relationships, studying higher-order structures within such graphs may uncover new insights. The second direction aims to directly model higher-order interactions using new and more complex representations such as simplicial complexes or hypergraphs. Some of these models have long been proposed, but improvements in computational power and the advent of new computational techniques have increased their popularity. Our goal in this paper is to provide a succinct yet comprehensive summary of the advanced higher-order network analysis techniques. We provide a systematic review of the foundations and algorithms, along with use cases and applications of higher-order networks in various scientific domains.",

            "title": "Semi-Supervised Graph Ultra-Sparsifier Using Reweighted \u21131 Optimization",
            "abstract": "Graph representation learning with the family of graph convolution networks (GCN) provides powerful tools for prediction on graphs. As graphs grow with more edges, the GCN family suffers from sub-optimal generalization performance due to task-irrelevant connections. Recent studies solve this problem by using graph sparsification in neural networks. However, graph sparsification cannot generate ultra-sparse graphs while simultaneously maintaining the performance of the GCN family. To address this problem, we propose Graph Ultra-sparsifier, a semi-supervised graph sparsifier with dynamically-updated regularization terms based on the graph convolution. The graph ultra-sparsifier can generate ultra-sparse graphs while maintaining the performance of the GCN family with the ultra-sparse graphs as inputs. In the experiments, when compared to the state-of-the-art graph sparsifiers, our graph ultra-sparsifier generates ultra-sparse graphs and these ultra-sparse graphs can be used as inputs to maintain the performance of GCN and its variants in node classification tasks.",

We first generate the hierarchical linguistic tree of news documents; by doing so, we translate each news document's linguistic style into its writer's usage of words and how these words are recursively structured as phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and, ultimately, the document. By integrating the hierarchical linguistic tree with the neural network, the proposed method learns and classifies the representation of news documents by capturing their locally sequential and globally recursive structures that are linguistically meaningful. It is the first work offering the hierarchical linguistic tree and the neural network preserving the tree information to our best knowledge. Experimental results based on public real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, which can outperform state-of-the-art techniques in classifying short and long news documents. We also examine the differential linguistic style of fake news and the truth and observe some patterns of fake news. The code and data have been publicly available.",

Hence, network robustness becomes critical to understanding system robustness. In this paper, we propose a spectral measure for network robustness: the second spectral moment $m_{2}$ of the network. Our results show that a smaller second spectral moment $m_{2}$ indicates a more robust network. We demonstrate both theoretically and with extensive empirical studies that the second spectral moment can help (1) capture various traditional measures of network robustness; (2) assess the robustness of networks; (3) design networks with controlled robustness; and (4) study how complex networked systems (e.g., power systems) behave under cascading failures.",

With this foundation, we then propose an influence graph, using which we assess the intent of fake news spreaders.

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has gained worldwide attention and allowed fake news, such as ``COVID-19 is the flu,'' to spread quickly and widely on social media. Combating this coronavirus infodemic demands effective methods to detect fake news. To this end, we propose a method to infer news credibility from hashtags involved in news dissemination on social media, motivated by the tight connection between hashtags and news credibility observed in our empirical analyses. We first introduce a new graph that captures all (direct and \\textit{indirect}) relationships among hashtags. Then, a language-independent semi-supervised algorithm is developed to predict fake news based on this constructed graph. This study first investigates the indirect relationship among hashtags;the proposed approach can be extended to any homogeneous graph to capture a comprehensive relationship among nodes. Language independence opens the proposed method to multilingual fake news detection. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying fake news, especially at an \\textit{early} stage of propagation.",

            "abstract": "A large body of research has focused on analyzing large networks and graphs. However, network and graph data is often anonymized for reasons such as protecting data privacy. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to verify the source of network data, which leads to questions such as: Given an anonymized graph, can we identify the network from which it is collected? Or, if one claims the graph is sampled from a certain network, can we verify this claim? The intuitive approach is to check for subgraph isomophism. However, subgraph isomophism is NP-complete; hence, infeasible for most large networks. Inspired by biometrics studies, we address these challenges by formulating two new problems: network identification and network authentication. To tackle these problems, similar to research on human fingerprints, we introduce two versions of a network identity: (1) embedding-based identity and (2) distribution-based identity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these network identities using extensive experiments on real-world networks. Using these identities, we propose two approaches for network identification. One method uses supervised learning and can achieve an identification accuracy of 84.4 percent, and the other, which is easier to implement, relies on distances between identities and achieves an accuracy rate of 70.8 percent. For network authentication, we propose two methods to build a network authentication system. The first is a supervised learner and yields a low false accept rate and the other method, allows one to control the false reject rate with a reasonable false accept rate across networks. We demonstrate that network authentication can also be used for biometrics, authenticating users based on their touch data on phones and tablets. Our study can help identify or verify the source of network data, validate network-based research, and be used for network-based biometrics.",

            "abstract": "Network representation learning has played a critical role in studying networks. One way to study a graph is to focus on its spectrum, i.e., the eigenvalue distribution of its associated matrices. Recent advancements in spectral graph theory show that spectral moments of a network can be used to capture the network structure and various graph properties. However, sometimes networks with different structures or sizes can have the same or similar spectral moments, not to mention the existence of the cospectral graphs. To address such problems, we propose a 3D network representation that relies on the spectral information of subgraphs: the Spectral Path, a path connecting the spectral moments of the network and those of its subgraphs of different sizes. We show that the spectral path is interpretable and can capture relationship between a network and its subgraphs, for which we present a theoretical foundation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the spectral path in applications such as network visualization and network identification.",
