            "title": "Stance and Hate Event Detection in Tweets Related to Climate Activism - Shared Task at CASE 2024",
            "abstract": "Social media plays a pivotal role in global discussions, including on climate change. The variety of opinions expressed range from supportive to oppositional, with some instances of hate speech. Recognizing the importance of understanding these varied perspectives, the 7th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE) at EACL 2024 hosted a shared task focused on detecting stances and hate speech in climate activism-related tweets. This task was divided into three subtasks: subtasks A and B concentrated on identifying hate speech and its targets, while subtask C focused on stance detection. Participants\u2019 performance was evaluated using the macro F1-score. With over 100 teams participating, the highest F1 scores achieved were 91.44% in subtask C, 78.58% in subtask B, and 74.83% in subtask A. This paper details the methodologies of 24 teams that submitted their results to the competition\u2019s leaderboard.",

            "title": "RUHate-MM: Identification of Hate Speech and Targets using Multimodal Data from Russia-Ukraine Crisis",
            "abstract": "During the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, hate speech targeted toward specific groups was widespread on different social media platforms. With most social platforms allowing multimodal content, the use of multimodal content to express hate speech is widespread on the Internet. Although there has been considerable research in detecting hate speech within unimodal content, the investigation into multimodal content remains insufficient. The limited availability of annotated multimodal datasets further restricts our ability to explore new methods to interpret and identify hate speech and its targets. The availability of annotated datasets for hate speech detection during political events, such as invasions, are even limited. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive multimodal dataset consisting of 20,675 posts related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which were manually annotated as either 'Hate Speech' or 'No Hate Speech'. Additionally, we categorize the hate speech data into three targets: 'Individual', 'Organization', and 'Community'. Our benchmarked evaluations show that there is still room for improvement in accurately identifying hate speech and its targets. We hope that the availability of this dataset and the evaluations performed on it will encourage the development of new methods for identifying hate speech and its targets during political events like invasions and wars.

            "abstract": "Addressing the need for effective hate speech moderation in contemporary digital discourse, the Multimodal Hate Speech Event Detection Shared Task made its debut at CASE 2023, co-located with RANLP 2023. Building upon its success, an extended version of the shared task was organized at the CASE workshop in EACL 2024. Similar to the earlier iteration, in this shared task, participants address hate speech detection through two subtasks. Subtask A is a binary classification problem, assessing whether text-embedded images contain hate speech. Subtask B goes further, demanding the identification of hate speech targets, such as individuals, communities, and organizations within text-embedded images. Performance is evaluated using the macro F1-score metric in both subtasks. With a total of 73 registered participants, the shared task witnessed remarkable achievements, with the best F1-scores in Subtask A and Subtask B reaching 87.27% and 80.05%, respectively, surpassing the leaderboard of the previous CASE 2023 shared task. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of seven teams that submitted results for Subtask A and five teams for Subtask B.",

            "title": "Uncovering Political Hate Speech During Indian Election Campaign: A New Low-Resource Dataset and Baselines",
            "abstract": "The detection of hate speech in political discourse is a critical issue, and this becomes even more challenging in low-resource languages. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset named IEHate, which contains 11,457 manually annotated Hindi tweets related to the Indian Assembly Election Campaign from November 1, 2021, to March 9, 2022. We performed a detailed analysis of the dataset, focusing on the prevalence of hate speech in political communication and the different forms of hateful language used. Additionally, we benchmark the dataset using a range of machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based algorithms. Our experiments reveal that the performance of these models can be further improved, highlighting the need for more advanced techniques for hate speech detection in low-resource languages. In particular, the relatively higher score of human evaluation over algorithms emphasizes the importance of utilizing both human and automated approaches for effective hate speech moderation. Our IEHate dataset can serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on developing and evaluating hate speech detection techniques in low-resource languages. Overall, our work underscores the importance of addressing the challenges of identifying and mitigating hate speech in political discourse, particularly in the context of low-resource languages.

Experimental analysis of the presented dataset has shown that understanding both modalities is essential for detecting these techniques. It is confirmed in our experiments with several state-of-the-art multi-modal models. In future work, we plan to extend the dataset in size. We further plan to develop new multi-modal models tailored explicitly to hate-speech detection, aiming for a deeper understanding of the text and image relation. It would also be interesting to perform experiments in a direction that explores what social entities the given hate speech tweet targets.",
