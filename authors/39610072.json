            "title": "A Formal Framework for Disaster Risk Properties",
            "abstract": "Disaster risk properties (or disaster variables) such as intensity, exposure, severity, vulnerability, resilience, and capacity are significant because they provide essential information for understanding and managing disaster risk and cascading effects. While there are an increasing number of datasets that record these properties based on different criteria, such as regional levels (e.g., community resilience at counties vs. census tracts), thematic levels (e.g., social vulnerability based on race vs. socioeconomic status), or even for different hazard types (e.g., disaster risk for earthquakes vs. hurricanes), we lack a formal model that captures the semantics of these properties, i.e., their interactions with one another, and their context. Context is described through relations that constrain each property specific to an entity or as a property of an entity with respect to another entity. For example, intensity is exclusively the property of a disaster event, whereas vulnerability is a property of an element-at-risk concerning a specific hazard type. Here, we propose the Disaster Properties Ontology (DPO) that formalizes seven core properties in the disaster domain. It is built by re-using existing standard ontologies such as OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL, SOSA, and PROV-O. Additionally, DPO is developed as a sub-module of a more comprehensive Disaster Management reference Domain Ontology (DMDO).",

            "abstract": "It is crucial for emergency management organizations to have rapid access to relevant experts who can advise and assist following a disaster. To improve expert-mining and recommendation capabilities, creating a knowledge graph that links experts to their corresponding topics of expertise and other sources of relevant information is a natural choice to capture an integrated network of people and a rich taxonomy of expertise. In this paper, we present an ontology for modeling experts, their expertise topics and relations between them, and their spatiotemporal scoping. We go on to discuss the primary conceptual components and how they can be instantiated, then present overarching examples related to emergency management operations. The ontology synthesizes three different ways to characterize an expert, based on a) identifiable academic expertise; b) voluntary engagements, work-related responsibilities or experience; and c) organization specializations or affiliations.",

Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

For data integration and interoperability needs within Knowledge Graphs (KGs), these taxonomies must be translated into formal ontologies. In this paper we present an ontology design pattern for modeling a scientific taxonomy as an ontology. The focus of the pattern is to 1) capture temporal dynamics of concepts as taxonomies evolve, 2) model the provenance of concepts to add context and enable governance, 3) assist the translation of taxonomic relations to ontological relations appropriately that will empower their use within KGs, and 4) tag provenance and other metadata information to mappings or alignments of uncertainty between concepts in different ontologies.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a rapidly growing paradigm and technology stack for integrating large-scale, heterogeneous data in an AI-ready form, i.e., combining data with the formal semantics required to understand it. However, toolchains that support data synthesis and knowledge discovery through information organization, search, filtering, and visualization have been developed at a pace lagging knowledge graph technology. In this paper, we present Knowledge Explorer, an open-source faceted search interface that provides environmentally intelligent services for interactively browsing and navigating KnowWhereGraph. Currently one of the largest open knowledge graphs, KnowWhereGraph contains over 12 billion statements with rich spatial and temporal information from more than 30 data layers. With an extensive collection of facets, Knowledge Explorer enables spatial, temporal, full-text, and expert search with dereferencing functionality to support \"follow-your-nose\" exploration, and it allows users to narrow their search by selecting facets. Given the size of the underlying graph and dependency on GeoSPARQL, we have improved query performance by implementing Elasticsearch indexing, spatial query generation, and caching. Knowledge Explorer is capable of retrieving information within seconds, answering a wide variety of competency questions posed by researchers, humanitarian relief organizations, and the broader public, thus helping better perform tasks such as cross-gazetteer place retrieval and disaster assessment from global to local geographic scales.",

            "abstract": "Disasters are often unpredictable and complex events, requiring humanitarian organizations to understand and respond to many different issues simultaneously and immediately. Often the biggest challenge to improving the effectiveness of the response is quickly finding the right expert, with the right expertise concerning a specific disaster type/disaster and geographic region. To assist in achieving such a goal, this paper demonstrates a knowledge graph-based search engine developed on top of an expert knowledge graph. It accommodates three modes of information retrieval, including a follow-your-nose search, an expert similarity search, and a SPARQL query interface. We will demonstrate utilizing the system to rapidly navigate from a hazard event to a specific expert who may be helpful, for example. More importantly, as the data is fully integrated including links between hazards and their abstract topics, we can find experts who have relevant expertise while navigating the graph.",

            "abstract": ". The notion of Linked Open Science rests on the assump-tion that Linked Data principles contribute to science and scienti\ufb01c data management in several distinct ways (e.g., by adding rich semantics to improve retrieval and reuse of data). This begs the question of the right level of granularity for such semantic enrichment. On the one extreme of the spectrum, one may provide semantic annotations on the level of entire datasets to improve retrieval while leaving the actual data un-touched. On the other end, one may semantically describe every single datum, such as a particular observation leading to data that supports reasoning, automated con\ufb02ation, and so on, while, at the same time, dra-matically increasing the size of data, including redundancy. This paper reports on our experience in modeling heterogeneous environmental data using a semantically-enabled observation framework, namely the SOSA ontology and its extensions to handle observation collections. We discuss di\ufb00erent means of using these observation collections and compare their pros and cons in terms of data size and ease of querying.",

One promising method for integrating data in such a way is through the use of a common, underlying spatial reference system, such as a Discrete Global Grid (e.g., the S2 Grid System), and pre-computing spatial relations between features and the constituent components at a spatial resolution appropriate for the data and use case. That is, by emphasizing the notion of the cell, we can examine what is in a cell, predict contents of its parent and child cells, and quickly get an overview of spatially co-located features and regions of interest without having to directly compute spatial interactions. This paper provides an ontology design pattern, to be used as a structural template, for modeling how features or regions map onto a hierarchical grid system and addresses how the attributes of these features may be inherited upwards or downwards through the hierarchy. We furthermore provide a motivating example and implementation.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth of the Linked Data on the Web has greatly facilitated collecting data from remote sensors, from air quality sensors spread out across a city, to seismograph stations spread across the entire world. Integrating these heterogeneous data can be quite challenging; however one can achieve this through the use of available W3C standards to create a knowledge graph. For this use case, the W3C also provides a standard, the Sensor, Observation, Sample, Actuator (SOSA) Ontology, that allows for the semantic encoding of sensors and their observations. However, even with the guidance of this standard, it may be difficult to produce a correct graph with high fidelity from heterogeneous sources. In this paper we present a set of (data) shape constraints, called SOSA-SHACL, for the SOSA ontology using a data validation language, namely the W3C standard SHACL (Shape Constraint Language). These constraints enable us to evaluate whether the modeled observations in our Knowledge Graph comply with the SOSA recommendations. Furthermore, we show through several case studies how the closed world assumption plays a role in the process of designing such shape constraints, especially as SOSA is based on the open world assumption.",
