            "title": "PiggyBack: Pretrained Visual Question Answering Environment for Backing up Non-deep Learning Professionals",
            "abstract": "We propose a PiggyBack, a Visual Question Answering platform that allows users to apply the state-of-the-art visual-language pretrained models easily. We integrate visual-language models, pretrained by HuggingFace, an open-source API platform of deep learning technologies; however, it cannot be runnable without programming skills or deep learning understanding. Hence, our PiggyBack supports an easy-to-use browser-based user interface with several deep-learning visual language pretrained models for general users and domain experts. The PiggyBack includes the following benefits: Portability due to web-based and thus runs on almost any platform, A comprehensive data creation and processing technique, and ease of use on visual language pretrained models.
