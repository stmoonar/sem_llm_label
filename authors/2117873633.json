            "title": "HyperNews: Simultaneous News Recommendation and Active-Time Prediction via a Double-Task Deep Neural Network",
            "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation can help users stay on top of the current affairs without being overwhelmed by the endless torrents of online news. However, the freshness or timeliness of news has been largely ignored by current news recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach dubbed HyperNews which explicitly models the effect of timeliness on news recommendation. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task of predicting the so-called \"active-time\" that users spend on each news article. Our key finding is that it is beneficial to address the problem of news recommendation together with the related problem of active-time prediction in a multi-task learning framework. Specifically, we train a double-task deep neural network (with a built-in timeliness module) to carry out news recommendation and active-time prediction simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such a \"kill-two-birds-with-one-stone\" solution has seldom been tried in the field of news recommendation before. Our extensive experiments on real-life news datasets have not only confirmed the mutual reinforcement of news recommendation and active-time prediction but also demonstrated significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art news recommendation techniques.",

            "title": "Community-Centric Graph Convolutional Network for Unsupervised Community Detection",
            "abstract": "Community detection, aiming at partitioning a network into multiple substructures, is practically importance. Graph convolutional network (GCN), a new deep-learning technique, has recently been developed for community detection. Markov Random Fields (MRF) has been combined with GCN in the MRFasGCN method to improve accuracy. However, the existing GCN community-finding methods are semi-supervised, even though community finding is essentially an unsupervised learning problem. We developed a new GCN approach for unsupervised community detection under the framework of Autoencoder. We cast MRFasGCN as an encoder and then derived node community membership in the hidden layer of the encoder. We introduced a community-centric dual decoder to reconstruct network structures and node attributes separately in an unsupervised fashion, for faithful community detection in the input space. We designed a scheme of local enhancement to accommodate nodes to have more common neighbors and similar attributes with similar community memberships. Experimental results on real networks showed that our new method outperformed the best existing methods, showing the effectiveness of the novel decoding mechanism for generating links and attributes together over the commonly used methods for reconstructing links alone.",
