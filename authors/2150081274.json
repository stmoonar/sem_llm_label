            "abstract": "As the volume of network attacks on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems increases, the existing supervised methods that over-rely on priori knowledge can hardly cope with increasingly stealthy and legitimate unknown protocol attacks for heterogeneous industrial scenarios. In this article, we present an anomaly based deep learning attack-aware method called ALOC, which constitutes the dual frequency domain transform (FDT) and implicit generative adversarial networks (GANs). The former is proposed that reduces the cost of hand-designed features and normalizes raw traffic bytes as the input under different protocol types. With the assistance of a deep auto-encoder (DAE) with 1-D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs), the latter can automatically build a behavioral baseline based on the multiscale distribution of transformed raw bytes. The potential SCADA anomalies or intrusions can be effectively detected, which enables field operators to avoid security risks in a timely manner. Essentially, the trained model conveniently determines the anomaly boundaries by augmenting the representation capabilities of raw session information in high-dimensional space. In response, adversarial training with different loss functions is introduced to constrain the reconstruction of anomalous samples extremely, which in turn improves the detection performance and analyzes anomaly attributes. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is more effective and generalized than existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Attack Traffic Classification (ATC) technique is an essential tool for Industrial Control System (ICS) network security, which can be widely used in active defense, situational awareness, attack source traceback and so on. At present, the state-of-the-art ATC methods are usually based on traffic statistical features and machine learning techniques, including supervised classification methods and unsupervised clustering methods. However, it is difficult for these methods to overcome the problems of lack of attack samples and high real-time requirement in ATC in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks. In order to address the above problems, we propose a self-growing ATC model based on a new density-based heuristic clustering method, which can continuously and automatically detect and distinguish different kinds of unknown attack traffic generated by various attack tools against SCADA networks in real time. An effective representation method of SCADA network traffic is proposed to further improve the performance of ATC. In addition, a large number of experiments are conducted on a compound dataset consisting of the SCADA network dataset, the attack tool dataset and the ICS honeypot dataset, to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art ATC methods in the crucial situation of only normal SCADA network traffic.",

            "abstract": "Honeypots have proven to be an effective defense method for industrial control systems (ICSs). However, as attacker skills become more sophisticated, it becomes increasingly difficult to develop honeypots that can effectively recognize and respond to such attacks. In this article, we propose a neural network-based ICS honeypot scheme named NeuPot that improves security from two aspects: 1) honeypot interaction; and 2) cyber threats detection capability. NeuPot can respond to attacker requests depending on a specific industrial scenario without constant communication with the ICS and detect malicious traffic. To create this honeypot scheme, a new seq2seq time-series forecast model guided by Huber loss is designed to simulate the long-term changes in actual ICS physical processes. Second, a Modbus honeypot framework is created to react to changes in these ICS physical processes in their interactions with attackers and to capture various cyber threats against the ICS. Further, a novel loss function for industrial protocol-level malicious traffic detection is devised to identify known and unknown threats. According to our experiments, the proposed honeypot scheme is highly effective and outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in terms of interactivity and in detecting cyber threats.",

            "abstract": "The malware attacks targeting the industrial control network are gradually increasing, and the nonlinear phenomenon makes it difficult to predict the propagation behavior of malware. Once the dynamic system becomes unstable, the propagation of malware will be out of control, which will seriously threaten the security of the industrial control network. So, it is necessary to model and study the propagation of malware in the industrial control network. In this paper, a SIDQR model with dual delay is proposed by fully considering the characteristics of the industrial control network. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of the model, the Hopf bifurcation is discussed in detail when the value of dual delay is greater than zero, and the expression for the threshold is also provided. The results of the experiments indicate that the system may have multiple bifurcation points. By comparing different immune and quarantine rates, it is found that the immune rate can be appropriately increased and the isolation rate can be appropriately reduced in the industrial control network, which can suppress the spread of malware without interrupting the industrial production.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in many real applications, and recent studies have revealed their vulnerabilities against topology attacks. To address this issue, existing efforts have mainly been dedicated to improving the robustness of GNNs, while little attention has been paid to the detection of such attacks. In this work, we study the victim node detection problem under topology attacks against GNNs. Our approach is built upon the key observation rooted in the intrinsic message passing nature of GNNs. That is, the neighborhood of a victim node tends to have two competing group forces, pushing the node classification results towards the original label and the targeted label, respectively. Based on this observation, we propose to detect victim nodes by deliberately designing an effective measurement of the neighborhood variance for each node. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets and five existing topology attacks show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed detection approach.",

More and more cyber attacks are targeting the ICS worldwide. This paper presents a novel honeynet-based epidemic model in ICS network. The honeynet is an active approach that can attract malware attacks and provide sample information and immunization strategy of the malware. An epidemic model with immunization and quarantine in ICS network is formulated to explore the dynamics of the malware propagation, and the honeynet potency is analyzed as well. Theoretical analysis reveals the disease-free and endemic equilibrium of our model, then the local and global stability of the disease-free (endemic) equilibrium are examined by the basic reproduction number. Furthermore, numerical experiments show that the honeypot with more system vulnerabilities is conducive to suppress the malware epidemic, and the honeynet with lower average degree power low index can be more effectively. In addition, simulation experiments provide the actual behavior of malware propagation in the ICS network and verification of our derivations.",

However, conventional network traffic collection methods used in honeynets cannot meet the more and more complex requirements of large-scale and distributed honeynets. This paper presents a new network traffic collection framework for distributed ICS honeynets called Honeyeye. Honeyeye can provide some different running modes for different application scenarios and purposes. Honeyeye can not only collect and save network traffic, but also parse it into readable data and convert it into the required format. By this way, Honeyeye tends to provide network administrators and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with more understandable and directly available data rather than captured opaque binary data. Experimental results show that the framework is effective in parsing, converting, and transmitting ICS honeynet traffic.",

The proposed method can not only identify different kinds of attack traffic against ICS network, but also evaluate their potentially malicious intents. In addition, the proposed method is able to discover new kinds of attack traffic from ICS network traffic. Specifically, the attack traffic is characterized as the communication pattern, which is used to evaluate the intent level and further resolved as the communication pattern fingerprint (CPF). The CPF is used to distinguish different kinds of attack traffic and discover new attack traffic.

It is urgent to develop a multi-task collaborative scheduling system for the data collection in Industrial Control System in order to make full use of existing hardware and software resources, save human resource costs, and improve the real-time and accuracy of data collection and fusion tasks. The paper proposes a heterogeneous inter-node communication architecture for industrial control data acquisition and researches the evaluation model of resource node and task. An urgent sorting scheduling algorithm and preemptive scheduling algorithm is proposed to solve the multidimensional scheduling requirements and real-time problems of industrial control data collection tasks.",
