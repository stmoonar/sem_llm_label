            "title": "FbMultiLingMisinfo: Challenging Large-Scale Multilingual Benchmark for Misinformation Detection",
            "abstract": "According to recent research, geometric deep learning allows to reach unprecedented accuracy for online misinformation detection. By fully leveraging the news social context, URL propagation paths in social networks are first represented as graphs and then classified using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Despite these remarkable efforts, researchers are still hampered by the scarcity of high-quality benchmark datasets, and as a result, the efficacy of state-of-the-art approaches could be overestimated. So far, in order to obtain a decent number of third-party fact-checked URLs, researchers have either sampled news from notoriously reliable and unreliable sources using distant supervision, or they have gathered pre-labeled URLs from third-party fact-checking websites. In the former case, resulting datasets can be quite large, but also noisy and biased since pieces of news are labeled as true or false according to their source label, and not individually fact-checked. In the latter case, assigned labels are more reliable, but the included news articles are usually in a single language and they may reflect unknown editorial decisions. As a result, datasets of the latter type are typically small, homogeneous, and thus unrealistically easy for automatic fake news detection models. In this work, we present FbMultiLingMisinfo, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, aimed at a more realistic evaluation of state-of-the-art misinformation detection models. URLs in our dataset come from the Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Data Set, which we augmented with their propagation paths on Twitter. Our experimental results show that, when GNN-based models are tested on FbMultiLingMisinfo, recent misinformation detection results are only partially confirmed. We further show that a sharp reduction in the training size significantly reduces the model accuracy on FbMultiLingMisinfo, but not on two other widely used benchmark datasets for fake news detection.",

            "title": "Intersectional Affirmative Action Policies for Top-k Candidates Selection",
            "abstract": "We study the problem of selecting the top-k candidates from a pool of applicants, where each candidate is associated with a score indicating his/her aptitude. Depending on the specific scenario, such as job search or college admissions, these scores may be the results of standardized tests or other predictors of future performance and utility. We consider a situation in which some groups of candidates experience historical and present disadvantage that makes their chances of being accepted much lower than other groups. In these circumstances, we wish to apply an affirmative action policy to reduce acceptance rate disparities, while avoiding any large decrease in the aptitude of the candidates that are eventually selected. Our algorithmic design is motivated by the frequently observed phenomenon that discrimination disproportionately affects individuals who simultaneously belong to multiple disadvantaged groups, defined along intersecting dimensions such as gender, race, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and disability. In short, our algorithm's objective is to simultaneously: select candidates with high utility, and level up the representation of disadvantaged intersectional classes. This naturally involves trade-offs and is computationally challenging due to the the combinatorial explosion of potential subgroups as more attributes are considered. We propose two algorithms to solve this problem, analyze them, and evaluate them experimentally using a dataset of university application scores and admissions to bachelor degrees in an OECD country. Our conclusion is that it is possible to significantly reduce disparities in admission rates affecting intersectional classes with a small loss in terms of selected candidate aptitude. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study fairness constraints with regards to intersectional classes in the context of top-k selection.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing affirmative action policies for selecting the top-k candidates from a pool of applicants. We assume that for each candidate we have socio-demographic attributes and a series of variables that serve as indicators of future performance (e.g., results on standardized tests) - as well as historical data including the actual performance of previously selected candidates. We consider the case where an organization wishes to increase the selection of people from disadvantaged socio-demographic groups. Hence, we seek to design an affirmative action policy to select candidates who are more likely to perform well, but in a way that increases the representation of disadvantaged groups. Our motivating application is the design of university admission policies to bachelor's degrees. We use a causal framework to describe several families of policies (changing component weights, giving bonuses, and enacting quotas), and compare them both theoretically and through extensive experimentation on a real-world dataset containing thousands of university applicants. Our empirical results indicate that simple policies could favor the admission of disadvantaged groups without significantly compromising on the quality of accepted candidates.",

            "title": "Algorithms for Fair Team Formation in Online Labour Marketplaces\u2731",
            "abstract": "As freelancing work keeps on growing almost everywhere due to a sharp decrease in communication costs and to the widespread of Internet-based labour marketplaces (e.g., guru.com, feelancer.com, mturk.com, upwork.com), many researchers and practitioners have started exploring the benefits of outsourcing and crowdsourcing [13, 14, 16, 23, 25, 29]. Since employers often use these platforms to find a group of workers to complete a specific task, researchers have focused their efforts on the study of team formation and matching algorithms and on the design of effective incentive schemes [2, 3, 4, 17]. Nevertheless, just recently, several concerns have been raised on possibly unfair biases introduced through the algorithms used to carry out these selection and matching procedures. For this reason, researchers have started studying the fairness of algorithms related to these online marketplaces [8, 19], looking for intelligent ways to overcome the algorithmic bias that frequently arises. Broadly speaking, the aim is to guarantee that, for example, the process of hiring workers through the use of machine learning and algorithmic data analysis tools does not discriminate, even unintentionally, on grounds of nationality or gender. In this short paper, we define the Fair Team Formation problem in the following way: given an online labour marketplace where each worker possesses one or more skills, and where all workers are divided into two or more not overlapping classes (for examples, men and women), we want to design an algorithm that is able to find a team with all the skills needed to complete a given task, and that has the same number of people from all classes. We provide inapproximability results for the Fair Team Formation problem together with four algorithms for the problem itself. We also tested the effectiveness of our algorithmic solutions by performing experiments using real data from an online labor marketplace.",
