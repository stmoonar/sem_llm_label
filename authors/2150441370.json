            "title": "Parameter-efficient Tuning of Large-scale Multimodal Foundation Model",
            "abstract": "Driven by the progress of large-scale pre-training, parameter-efficient transfer learning has gained immense popularity across different subfields of Artificial Intelligence. The core is to adapt the model to downstream tasks with only a small set of parameters. Recently, researchers have leveraged such proven techniques in multimodal tasks and achieve promising results. However, two critical issues remain unresolved: how to further reduce the complexity with lightweight design and how to boost alignment between modalities under extremely low parameters. In this paper, we propose A graceful prompt framework for cross-modal transfer (Aurora) to overcome these challenges. Considering the redundancy in existing architectures, we first utilize the mode approximation to generate 0.1M trainable parameters to implement the multimodal prompt tuning, which explores the low intrinsic dimension with only 0.04% parameters of the pre-trained model. Then, for better modality alignment, we propose the Informative Context Enhancement and Gated Query Transformation module under extremely few parameters scenes. A thorough evaluation on six cross-modal benchmarks shows that it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art but even outperforms the full fine-tuning approach.

            "abstract": "Laser tracker has been introduced successfully for geometric deviations calibration of multi-axis machine tools. In this paper, a new method called \u201cpose measurement principle\u201d is developed for measuring geometrical error of rotary axes by means of a single laser tracker and NC precise table. The reflector is mounted on the NC precise table with eccentricity, and the NC precise table is mounted on rotary table. A single laser tracker located at different base stations in order is used for coordinate determination of three fixed points of the reflector to get the pose information of rotary axes, then calculate the pose deviations and identify all the errors. For the error identification, first of all, with the extension of the definition of geometric errors, the 6 geometric errors is represented by pose deviation. Second, 3 angular errors are identified geometrically first, then eliminate the angular errors of all measuring coordinates to obtain the 3 straightness errors. Finally, the 6 errors mathematical model for rotary table is developed. The validity of the proposed method has been confirmed by simulations and experiments. From both of them, it has been confirmed that the proposed method gives precise results and is able to apply to the measurement of rotary axes effectively.",
