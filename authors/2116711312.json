            "title": "Continuous Input Embedding Size Search For Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Latent factor models are the most popular backbones for today's recommender systems owing to their prominent performance. Latent factor models represent users and items as real-valued embedding vectors for pairwise similarity computation, and all embeddings are traditionally restricted to a uniform size that is relatively large (e.g., 256-dimensional). With the exponentially expanding user base and item catalog in contemporary e commerce, this design is admittedly becoming memory-inefficient. To facilitate lightweight recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently opened up opportunities for identifying varying embedding sizes for different users/items. However, challenged by search efficiency and learning an optimal RL policy, existing RL-based methods are restricted to highly discrete, predefined embedding size choices. This leads to a largely overlooked potential of introducing finer granularity into embedding sizes to obtain better recommendation effectiveness under a given memory budget. In this paper, we propose continuous input embedding size search (CIESS), a novel RL-based method that operates on a continuous search space with arbitrary embedding sizes to choose from. In CIESS, we further present an innovative random walk-based exploration strategy to allow the RL policy to efficiently explore more candidate embedding sizes and converge to a better decision. CIESS is also model-agnostic and hence generalizable to a variety of latent factor RSs, whilst experiments on two real-world datasets have shown state-of-the-art performance of CIESS under different memory budgets when paired with three popular recommendation models.",

            "abstract": "As a representative information retrieval task, site recommendation, which aims at predicting the optimal sites for a brand or an institution to open new branches in an automatic data-driven way, is beneficial and crucial for brand development in modern business. However, there is no publicly available dataset so far and most existing approaches are limited to an extremely small scope of brands, which seriously hinders the research on site recommendation. Therefore, we collect, construct and release an open comprehensive dataset, namely OpenSiteRec, to facilitate and promote the research on site recommendation. Specifically, OpenSiteRec leverages a heterogeneous graph schema to represent various types of real-world entities and relations in four international metropolises. To evaluate the performance of the existing general methods on the site recommendation task, we conduct benchmarking experiments of several representative recommendation models on OpenSiteRec. Furthermore, we also highlight the potential application directions to demonstrate the wide applicability of OpenSiteRec. We believe that our OpenSiteRec dataset is significant and anticipated to encourage the development of advanced methods for site recommendation. OpenSiteRec is available online at https://OpenSiteRec.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "In recommender systems, reinforcement learning solutions have effectively boosted recommendation performance because of their ability to capture long-term user-system interaction. However, the action space of the recommendation policy is a list of items, which could be extremely large with a dynamic candidate item pool. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hyper-actor and critic learning framework where the policy decomposes the item list generation process into a hyper-action inference step and an effect-action selection step. The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to stabilize the learning process. We build simulated environments on public datasets and empirically show that our framework is superior in recommendation compared to standard RL baselines.",

            "abstract": "Historical user-item interaction datasets are essential in training modern recommender systems for predicting user preferences. However, the arbitrary user behaviors in most recommendation scenarios lead to a large volume of noisy data instances being recorded, which cannot fully represent their true interests. While a large number of denoising studies are emerging in the recommender system community, all of them suffer from highly dynamic data distributions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework, AutoDenoise, with an Instance Denoising Policy Network, for denoising data instances with an instance selection manner in deep recommender systems. To be specific, AutoDenoise serves as an agent in DRL to adaptively select noise-free and predictive data instances, which can then be utilized directly in training representative recommendation models. In addition, we design an alternate two-phase optimization strategy to train and validate the AutoDenoise properly. In the searching phase, we aim to train the policy network with the capacity of instance denoising; in the validation phase, we find out and evaluate the denoised subset of data instances selected by the trained policy network, so as to validate its denoising ability. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of AutoDenoise combined with multiple representative recommender system models.",

            "abstract": "Feature selection plays an impactful role in deep recommender systems, which selects a subset of the most predictive features, so as to boost the recommendation performance and accelerate model optimization. The majority of existing feature selection methods, however, aim to select only a fixed subset of features. This setting cannot fit the dynamic and complex environments of practical recommender systems, where the contribution of a specific feature varies significantly across user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive feature selection framework, AdaFS, for deep recommender systems. To be specific, we develop a novel controller network to automatically select the most relevant features from the whole feature space, which fits the dynamic recommendation environment better. Besides, different from classic feature selection approaches, the proposed controller can adaptively score each example of user-item interactions, and identify the most informative features correspondingly for subsequent recommendation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments based on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaFS, and its excellent transferability to the most popular deep recommendation models.",

            "abstract": "Feature quality has an impactful effect on recommendation performance. Thereby, feature selection is a critical process in developing deep learning-based recommender systems. Most existing deep recommender systems, however, focus on designing sophisticated neural networks, while neglecting the feature selection process. Typically, they just feed all possible features into their proposed deep architectures, or select important features manually by human experts. The former leads to non-trivial embedding parameters and extra inference time, while the latter requires plenty of expert knowledge and human labor effort. In this work, we propose an AutoML framework that can adaptively select the essential feature fields in an automatic manner. Specifically, we first design a differentiable controller network, which is capable of automatically adjusting the probability of selecting a particular feature field; then, only selected feature fields are utilized to retrain the deep recommendation model. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We conduct further experiments to investigate its properties, including the transferability, key components, and parameter sensitivity.",

            "title": "Local Variational Feature-Based Similarity Models for Recommending Top-N New Items",
            "abstract": "The top-N recommendation problem has been studied extensively. Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms show promising results for the problem. They predict a user\u2019s preferences by estimating similarities between a target and user-rated items. Top-N recommendation remains a challenging task in scenarios where there is a lack of preference history for new items. Feature-based Similarity Models (FSMs) address this particular problem by extending item-based collaborative filtering by estimating similarity functions of item features. The quality of the estimated similarity function determines the accuracy of the recommendation. However, existing FSMs only estimate global similarity functions; i.e., they estimate using preference information across all users. Moreover, the estimated similarity functions are linear; hence, they may fail to capture the complex structure underlying item features. In this article, we propose to improve FSMs by estimating local similarity functions, where each function is estimated for a subset of like-minded users. To capture global preference patterns, we extend the global similarity function from linear to nonlinear, based on the effectiveness of variational autoencoders. We propose a Bayesian generative model, called the Local Variational Feature-based Similarity Model, to encapsulate local and global similarity functions. We present a variational Expectation Minimization algorithm for efficient approximate inference. Extensive experiments on a large number of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Top-N recommendations have been studied extensively. Promising results have been achieved by recent item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) methods. The key to ICF lies in the estimation of item similarities. Observing the block-diagonal structure of the item similarities in practice, we propose a block-diagonal regularization (BDR) over item similarities for ICF. The intuitions behind BDR are as follows: (1) with BDR, item clustering is embedded into the learning of ICF methods; (2) BDR induces sparsity of item similarities, which guarantees recommendation efficiency; and (3) BDR captures in-block transitivity to overcome rating sparsity. By regularizing the item similarity matrix of item similarity models with BDR, we obtain a block-aware item similarity model. Our experimental evaluations on a large number of datasets show that the block-diagonal structure is crucial to the performance of top-N recommendation.",
