            "title": "Profiling Deep Learning Workloads at Scale using Amazon SageMaker",
            "abstract": "With the rise of deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML) has become compute and data intensive, typically requiring multi-node multi-GPU clusters. As state-of-the-art models grow in size in the order of trillions of parameters, their computational complexity and cost also increase rapidly. Since 2012, the cost of deep learning doubled roughly every quarter, and this trend is likely to continue. ML practitioners have to cope with common challenges of efficient resource utilization when training such large models. In this paper, we propose a new profiling tool that cross-correlates relevant system utilization metrics and framework operations. The tool supports profiling DL models at scale, identifies performance bottlenecks, and provides insights with recommendations. We deployed the profiling functionality as an add-on to Amazon SageMaker Debugger, a fully-managed service that leverages an on-the-fly analysis system (called rules) to automatically identify complex issues in DL training jobs. By presenting deployment results and customer case studies, we show that it enables users to identify and fix issues caused by inefficient hardware resource usage, thereby reducing training time and cost.",

            "abstract": "Manual debugging is a common productivity drain in the machine learning (ML) lifecycle. Identifying underperforming training jobs requires constant developer attention and deep domain expertise. As state-of-the-art models grow in size and complexity, debugging becomes increasingly difficult. Just as unit tests boost traditional software development, an automated ML debugging library can save time and money. We present Amazon SageMaker Debugger, a machine learning feature that automatically identifies and stops underperforming training jobs. Debugger is a new feature of Amazon SageMaker that automatically captures relevant data during training and evaluation and presents it for online and offline inspection. Debugger helps users define a set of conditions, in the form of built-in or custom rules, that are applied to this data, thereby enabling users to catch training issues as well as monitor and debug ML model training in real-time. These rules save time and money by alerting the developer and terminating a problematic training job early.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to design, implement and test the automatic marking system for programming languages using key-words and boolean operations to solve the processing problems of natural languages. There are accurate grammar systems and key-words in programming languages. Using these characteristics, We have designed, programmed, and tested automatic marking system for programming languages through key-words and boolean operations in this paper. We have categorized programming languages into 7 types as the type of answer and when a professor input any key-words, the system make him put conjunction with the special character. It can be logical expressions instantly so that the system easily operates. We asked 10 students who are majoring in computer engineering to take a test on the paper and web to show how well automatic marking system that we have programmed works. Then We requested 3 professors if the subject problems marked objectively. As a result, automatic marking system proved to be appropriate. We have proposed the way of using key-words and boolean operation for prohibiting huge natural language processing in marking of subjective question. It promotes efficiency rate of programming, objectivity and speed through the transferal to the web for marking since the system prohibits marker to include personal opinion on marking and gives feedback quickly",

Main memory database system (MMDBS) has been an attractive choice as a real-time database system (RTDBS) since if suggests the possibility of ensuring fast response time and predictability. But the recovery schemes used in existing MMDBS do not ensure fast responsiveness because of logging overhead. We propose a recovery mechanism that uses shadow-paging recovery scheme, stable memory, and sequential transaction processing. We also address how it can meet the real-time property of transactions by providing fast response time and fast recovery.",
