            "title": "Loss Compensation in Multi-Session Recommendation Under Limited Availability",
            "abstract": "In many recommendation applications, items may have limited availability thereby causing conflict among users interested in the same items. Over time, this results in unequal user treat-ment: few users are recommended the limited items and receive preferential treatment, while the rest is left with sub-optimal recommendations, ultimately leading them to leave. In this paper, we formalize the novel problem of compensating users in multi-session recommendations under limited item availability. Our aim is to generate recommendations that not only optimize accuracy, but also compensate users over time for the loss of accuracy incurred in previous iterations. We design compensation strategies that serve users and items in different orders and accommodate various recommendation adoption models. Our algorithms are integrated into SoCRATe (System for Compensating Recommendations with Availability and Time), a framework that enables us to study loss compensation over time. Our experiments on real data demonstrate that to best compensate users for the incurred loss, traditional recommenders need to be revisited to account for item availability. Our experiments on synthetic data explore different parameters of our solution and show that it is much faster than an optimal (brute-force) compensation strategy, while achieving comparable results.",

            "title": "Accounting for Bossy Users in Context-Aware Group Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Lots of activities, like watching a movie or going to the restaurant, are intrinsically group-based. To recommend such activities to groups, traditional single-user recommendation techniques are not appropriate and, as a consequence, over the years a number of group recommender systems have been developed. Recommending items to be enjoyed together by a group of people poses many ethical challenges: in fact, a system whose unique objective is to achieve the best recommendation accuracy might learn to disadvantage submissive users in favor of more aggressive ones. In this work we investigate the ethical challenges of context-aware group recommendations, in the general case of ephemeral groups (i.e., groups where the members might be together for the first time), using a method that can recommend also items that are new to the system. We show the goodness of our method on two real-world datasets. The first one is a very large dataset containing the personal and group choices regarding TV programs of 7,921 users w.r.t. sixteen contexts of viewing, while the second one gathers the musical preferences (both individual and in groups) of 280 real users w.r.t. two contexts of listening. Our extensive experiments show that our method always manages to obtain the highest recall while delivering ethical guarantees in line with the other fair group recommender systems tested.",

Ethics-aware data processing has become a pressing need, considering that data are often used within critical decision processes (e.g., staff evaluation, college admission, criminal sentencing). The goal of this paper is to propose a vision for the injection of ethical principles (fairness, non-discrimination, transparency, data protection, diversity, and human interpretability of results) into the data analysis lifecycle (source selection, data integration, and knowledge extraction) so as to make them first-class requirements. In our vision, a comprehensive checklist of ethical desiderata for data protection and processing needs to be developed, along with methods and techniques to ensure and verify that these ethically motivated requirements and related legal norms are fulfilled throughout the data selection and exploration processes. Ethical requirements can then be enforced at all the steps of knowledge extraction through a unified data modeling and analysis methodology relying on appropriate conceptual and technical tools.",

            "title": "Event Recognition Strategies applied in the Mercurio Project",
            "abstract": "Mercurio is a project currently investigated at Politecnico di Milano whose aim is to support the decision-making process of financial investors. Mercurio identifies relevant events both from financial news articles and financial indexes and uses sequential pattern mining to predict exceptional events given their past occurrences and relationships with other events. The process of event recognition, both from textual and numerical data sources, is crucial to successfully reach the goals. Investors constantly read financial news and analyze financial indexes, using their knowledge and experience to predict market events and make profitable investments. Mercurio [1, 2] aims at supporting this process by automatically extracting, from data freely available on the Web, events that influence and shake the market. Event recognition strategies are applied to both textual and numerical financial information. Textual data sources. Mercurio monitors Italian financial data sources such as Sole 24 Ore , Corriere della Sera , Radiocor , etc. These data are processed according to different strategies: Semantic recognition. Events are recognized through semantic rules that formalize the knowledge of our domain expert. Rules define relationships between sentence structures and events; they are designed to capture meanings that go beyond the sole natural language processing since they recognize \u201chidden\u201d information inside the news, e.g. financial newspapers, usually, publish interviews when requested by a company: why would a company want to be interviewed? It seems that interviews are often published for reassuring investors in times of crisis. Classification. Often, data information sources specify, for each article, one or more categories, possibly hierarchical, it belongs to, e.g. articles about balance, merge& acquisition, etc. These categories are mostly general-purpose 3 http://www.ilsole24ore.com/ 4 http://www.corriere.it/economia/ 5 http://www.radiocor.ilsole24ore.com/ and hard to use in our context in a significant way. Mercurio employs a domain-specific classification of articles, manually performed by our domain expert on a training set of articles, then automatically derived by the system for the remaining articles. Communication style. Over time, companies develop a certain communication style characterized by the amount of published news, the different sources dealing with it, the diversity of reported topics, etc.. It is interesting to discover events where a company breaks its expected communication trend, e.g. an out-of-the-blue article breaking a \u201clong\u201d communication silence. Article summarization. Long articles are hardly read by investors who, instead of reading the whole news, usually skim through its content or trust little more than title and introduction. Mercurio applies summarization techniques to provide investors with only the most relevant information. It ranks each sentence in the article according to its position in the text (at the beginning, end, etc.) and to its content (domain-dependent stop-words as well as significant expressions are kept into account) and constructs a summary that contains only the most informative sentences. Numerical data sources. Mercurio gathers stock prices from Yahoo! Finance 6 and employs technical analysis [3] techniques to determine significant events. Stock events. Mercurio identifies changes in stock using simple moving averages (sma) of different day lengths. For up/down trends and congestions, sma10, sma20 and sma40 are used, e.g., if the price is above sma10; sma10 is above sma20 and sma20 is above sma40 there is an ongoing uptrend. To find up/down jumps, Mercurio analyzes how sma3 and sma5 change in a time-window of a week. All stock changes are found a posteriori and then used for training. Candlestick patterns. Japanese candlestick charts 7 are used to represent stock prices at possibly different aggregation levels; specific candlestick patterns predict particular market movements. Mercurio uses these patterns in combination with stock events to increment the precision of the event recognition. Moreover, we are investigating the use of patterns at different levels of aggregation, e.g. a candlesticks representing days or weeks.",
