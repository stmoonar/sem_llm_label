            "abstract": "We demonstrate FaiRank, an interactive system to explore fairness of ranking in online job marketplaces. FaiRank takes as input a set of individuals and their attributes, some of which are protected, and a scoring function, through which those individuals are ranked for jobs. It finds a partitioning of individuals on their protected attributes over which fairness of the scoring function is quantified. FaiRank has several appealing features: (1) It can be used by different users: the auditor whose role is to monitor the fairness of ranking in a job marketplace, the job owner seeking to examine the influence of a scoring function and its variants on the ranking of candidates for a job, and the end-user who wants to assess the fairness of jobs on different marketplaces; (2) It is able to quantify fairness under different data and process transparency settings: when some attributes are anonymized and when only the ranking (and not the scoring function) is available; (3) It is interactive and lets its users explore different scoring functions and examine how fairness evolves; (4) It is generic and provides the ability to quantify different notions of fairness. Our demonstration will provide attendees with several scenarios for fairness of ranking in job marketplaces to experiment with and acquire an understanding of this important research question and its impact in practice.",

            "abstract": "Clustering is often a first step when trying to make sense of a large data set. A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node-link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix interactive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the relationship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results.",

            "abstract": "In data analysis domain, data are often described by a single matrix in which the rows describe objects and the columns describe features of these objects. Nevertheless, in many real world applications, data are said to be multi-dimensional, meaning that they cannot be fully described by only one matrix, but rather by a collection of matrices, or even as a tensor. Typically, we can nd these kind of data in the social networks where several entities (people, documents, etc) can have multiple relationship. In the framework of the co-clustering problem (or two-way clustering) we already proposed (Bisson et al. 2008; Hussain et al. 2010) an algorithm, named chisim, to compute simultaneously the similarity measures between rows and columns. This approach allows to discover high order similarities between objects and features, and we experimentally shown that our method achieves better results than the state of the art co-clustering systems such as LSA, ITCC, etc. In this paper, we propose to go a step further by extending the chisim method in two directions. First, we introduce di erent architectures in order to combine the similarity matrices obtained by applying chisim to a collection of matrices. We show that some of these architectures improve the quality of the co-clustering. Second, we propose a natural generalization of chisim in order to directly tackle tensors. Here a major concern is time and space complexity of this new method and thus we analyze some trade-o allowing the problem to become tractable for medium size datasets.",

Thus, two documents are said to be similar if they share similar (but not necessary identical) words and two words are similar if they occur in similar documents. The algorithm has been shown to work well for unsupervised document clustering. By introducing some \u201ca priori\u201d knowledge about the class labels of documents in the initialization step of \u03c7-Sim, we are able to extend the method to deal for the supervised task.

It presents a method for discovering high-level student behaviors from a very large set of low-level traces corresponding to problem-solving actions in a learning environment.

Then a domain-independent hierarchical clustering identifies what we call general attitudes, yielding automatic diagnosis expressed in natural language, addressed in principle to teachers.

A query is then interpreted through a vocabulary learning step, where terms in the context are selected, and a query learning step, where new queries are built by the conjunction of terms of the initial query with terms of the vocabulary.

            "abstract": "Analysis of the huge volumes of data generated by large scale sequencing projects clearly requires the construction of new sophisticated computer systems. These systems should be able to handle the biological data as well as the results of the analysis of this data. They should also help the user to choose the most appropriate method for a simple task and to string together the methods needed to solve a global analysis task. In this paper we present the prototype of a software system that provides an environment for the analysis of large-scale sequence data. In a first approach this environment has been put to the test within the B. subtilis sequencing project. This system integrates both a descriptive knowledge of the entities involved (genes, regulatory signals etc.) and the methodological knowledge concerning an extendable set of analytical methods (i.e. how to solve a sequence analysis problem through task decomposition and method selection). A knowledge representation based on two existing object-oriented models, named Shirka and SCARP, is used to implement this integrated system. In addition, the present prototype provides a suitable user interface for both displaying the results generated by several methods and interacting with the objects. We present in this paper an overview of the knowledge-based models used to build this integrated system, and a description of the way in which biological entities and sequence analysis tasks are represented. We give illustrations of the co-operation between user and system during the problem solving process. Such a system constitutes a computer workbench for molecular biologists studying the genetic programs of living organisms.",

The major feature of APIC lies in its genericity. As a matter of fact, this interface can obviously be used to visualise genetic or physical maps but it also able to display other kinds of information such as curves or pictures. On the one hand, APIC provides the biologist who builds a new sequence analysis method with a standard interface allowing to display his results. Thus, he can avoid implementing a specific visualisation tool. On the other hand, even when the methods already have their own interfaces, using APIC has the advantage of giving a homogeneous way to compare several results coming from different analysis tools. Moreover, it provides some powerful functions for navigating and browsing into the results.",
