            "title": "Disentangled Graph Social Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Social recommender systems have drawn a lot of attention in many online web services, because of the incorporation of social information between users in improving recommendation results. Despite the significant progress made by existing solutions, we argue that current methods fall short in two limitations: (1) Existing social-aware recommendation models only consider collaborative similarity between items, how to incorporate item-wise semantic relatedness is less explored in current recommendation paradigms. (2) Current social recommender systems neglect the entanglement of the latent factors over heterogeneous relations (e.g., social connections, user-item interactions). Learning the disentangled representations with relation heterogeneity poses great challenge for social recommendation. In this work, we design a Disentangled Graph Neural Network (DGNN) with the integration of latent memory units, which empowers DGNN to maintain factorized representations for heterogeneous types of user and item connections. Additionally, we devise new memory-augmented message propagation and aggregation schemes under the graph neural architecture, allowing us to recursively distill semantic relatedness into the representations of users and items in a fully automatic manner. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our model by achieving great improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

            "title": "Multi-Interest Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation System with Fuzzy Feedback based User Simulator",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

            "abstract": "Crime has become a major concern in many cities, which calls for the rising demand for timely predicting citywide crime occurrence. Accurate crime prediction results are vital for the beforehand decision-making of government to alleviate the increasing concern about the public safety. While many efforts have been devoted to proposing various spatial-temporal forecasting techniques to explore dependence across locations and time periods, most of them follow a supervised learning manner, which limits their spatial-temporal representation ability on sparse crime data. Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised learning, this work proposes a Spatial-Temporal Self-Supervised Hypergraph Learning framework (ST-HSL) to tackle the label scarcity issue in crime prediction. Specifically, we propose the cross-region hypergraph structure learning to encode region-wise crime dependency under the entire urban space. Furthermore, we design the dual-stage self-supervised learning paradigm, to not only jointly capture local- and global-level spatial-temporal crime patterns, but also supplement the sparse crime representation by augmenting region self-discrimination. We perform extensive experiments on two real-life crime datasets. Evaluation results show that our ST-HSL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis provides insights into the superiority of our ST-HSL method in the representation of spatial-temporal crime patterns.

            "title": "Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation With Temporal Graph Transformer",
            "abstract": "Modeling time-evolving preferences of users with their sequential item interactions, has attracted increasing attention in many online applications. Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However, the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference. In this work, we tackle the dynamic user-item relation learning with the awareness of multi-behavior interactive patterns. Towards this end, we propose a new Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT) recommendation framework to jointly capture dynamic short-term and long-range user-item interactive patterns, by exploring the evolving correlations across different types of behaviors. The new TGT method endows the sequential recommendation architecture to distill dedicated knowledge for type-specific behavior relational context and the implicit behavior dependencies. Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method TGT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.
