            "abstract": "Security in Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments has become a major concern. This is partly due to a large number of remotely exploitable IoT vulnerabilities in service authentication and access control combined with the lack of timely technical support. To reduce the threat surface of remote vulnerability exploitation, we propose CMXsafe, a secure-by-design application-agnostic proxy layer that can be updated and managed independently of the IoT device application. CMXsafe places IoT devices behind gateways operating as 4th OSI transport layer relayers to offload security concerns of IoT network communications into the proxy layer. Specifically, the proxy layer produces secure communication paths between IoT applications and platforms while enforcing mutual authentication and access control to proxied services. We evaluate the performance of our architecture on the MQTT protocol used in a standard publisher-broker-subscriber configuration provided by Eclipse Mosquitto. We compare the performance penalty on the protocol when securing communications with TLS following a monolithic implementation and with CMXsafe. The experimental results suggest that CMXsafe outperforms integrated security by providing at least a 25% latency reduction and a 22% bandwidth improvement.",

            "abstract": "The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their apparent benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. These vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise power system safety. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution systems. We derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attack impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we propose a method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the distribution system as a reactive defense approach. We study optimal defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game theory approach that is robust to LAAs. The proposed solution takes the potential errors in the attack localization into account. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the distribution network result in the highest detrimental impact on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.",

            "abstract": "Load frequency control (LFC) is used in power systems to prevent frequency fluctuations caused by load disturbances and maintain power supply reliability. LFC utilizes communication channels to generate control signals, thus it is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks and faults. This work considers a cyber-physical model for LFC in which the adversary compromises the resources of the cyber layer to inject a stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) vector. The FDIA injects the best-effort stealthy error into the data collected by the LFC, corrupting the control center\u2019s calculations and leading to incorrect control signals. To effectively manage this complex decision-making scenario, a game theory-based framework is established to analyze the interaction between the controller and the attacker. Based on the model, an FDIA defense mechanism based on a bi-level differential game is proposed. The experiments conducted on a three-region interconnected power system based on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively maintain the stability of the frequency and inter-regional power deviation within acceptable limits, even in the presence of FDIAs.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, posing significant challenges for power distribution systems. In response, this work presents a planning approach in order to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against climatic hazards. The framework systematically addresses uncertainties during extreme events, including weather variability and line damage. Key strategies include line hardening, backup diesel generators, and sectionalizers to strengthen resilience. We model spatio-temporal dynamics and costs through a hybrid model integrating stochastic processes with deterministic elements. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear approach is developed to optimize resilience investments against load loss, generator operations, and repairs. Case studies on the IEEE 15-bus benchmark system and a realistic distribution grid model in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia demonstrate enhanced system robustness as well as cost efficiency of 10% and 15%, respectively.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a decision-making approach for the control of distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) equipped with photovoltaic (PV) units and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The objective is to minimize the total operational cost of the distribution system while satisfying the system operating constraints. The method is based on the discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Different aspects of the operation of the distribution system operation are considered, such as the possibilities of curtailment of PV generation, managing battery storage, reactive power injection, load shedding, and providing a flexibility service for the transmission system. The model is tested for the IEEE 33-bus system with two added DERs and the study cases involve various unexpected events. The experimental results show that this method enables the attainment of relatively low total cost values compared to the reference deterministic approach. The benefits of applying this approach are particularly evident when there is a significant difference between the predicted and actual PV power generation.",

            "abstract": "Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. With the increasing deployment of renewable generation, electric power systems become increasingly dependent on weather changes. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this research and practice gap, we propose efficiently managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through the integration of large deviation theory into chance constraints (LDT-CC). We integrate extreme event statistics into market-clearing, via including LDT-CC to model and price reserve to cope with extreme events, and use weighted chance constraints (WCC) to reduce solution conservatism. We prove that the proposed market design is capable of producing a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed pricing mechanism.",

The suggested approach aims to estimate the required data for sharing between units in line with as much communication reduction as possible. In other words, the proposed approach effectively determines which state variables should be shared (observer concept) among the units during specific time intervals (event-triggered concept). This strategy significantly reduces the overall communication load. It is shown that the estimation error remains bounded and Zeno behavior, characterized by an endless number of transmissions occurring within a limited time frame, does not occur. The proposed methodology can be systematically applied to any communication-based secondary controller in alternating current (AC) microgrids. Simulation results demonstrate a high degree of precision in estimating the states under the proposed approach. Also, the secondary controller performance under the proposed method is evaluated in MATLAB/Simulink environment.",

To address this, the article proposes a nonlinear residual-based observer approach to detect and mitigate such attacks.
