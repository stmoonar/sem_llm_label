            "abstract": "In this paper, we present GDA, a generalized decision aggregation framework that integrates information from distributed sensor nodes for decision making in a resource efficient manner. Different from traditional approaches, our proposed GDA framework is able to not only estimate the reliability of each sensor, but also take advantage of its confidence information, and thus achieves higher decision accuracy. Targeting generalized problem domains, our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different sensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different. GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level of ground truth label information, while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these reasons, our approach can be applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios. In this paper, we also propose two extensions of the GDA framework, i.e., incremental GDA (I-GDA) and parallel GDA (P-GDA) to deal with streaming and large-scale data. The advantages of our proposed methods are demonstrated through both theoretic analysis and extensive experiments.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of choosing the right sources to solicit data from in sensing applications involving broadcast channels, such as those crowdsensing applications where sources share their observations on social media. The goal is to select sources such that expected fusion error is minimized. We assume that soliciting data from a source incurs a cost and that the cost budget is limited. Contrary to other formulations of this problem, we focus on the case where some sources influence others. Hence, asking a source to make a claim affects the behavior of other sources as well, according to an influence model. The paper makes two contributions. First, we develop an analytic model for estimating expected fusion error, given a particular influence graph and solution to the source selection problem. Second, we use that model to search for a solution that minimizes expected fusion error, formulating it as a zero-one integer non-linear programming (INLP) problem. To scale the approach, the paper further proposes a novel reliability-based pruning heuristic (RPH) and a similarity-based lossy estimation (SLE) algorithm that significantly reduce the complexity of the INLP algorithm at the cost of a modest approximation. The analytically computed expected fusion error is validated using both simulations and real-world data from Twitter, demonstrating a good match between analytic predictions and empirical measurements. It is also shown that our method outperforms baselines in terms of resulting fusion error.",

Specifically, we focus on content shared by users on Twitter and Instagram in order to design a system capable of fusing data across multiple networks. Past work has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to detect physical events using various social network platforms. However, many of these signals need corroboration in order to handle events that lack proper support within a single network. We leverage this insight to design an unsupervised approach that can correlate event signals across multiple social networks. Our algorithm can detect events and identify the location of the event occurrence. We evaluate our algorithm using both simulations and real world datasets collected using Twitter and Instagram. The results indicate that our algorithm significantly improves false positive elimination and attains high precision compared to baseline methods on real world datasets.",

We choose picture-oriented networks because taking a picture requires physical proximity, thereby revealing the location of the photographed event. Furthermore, most modern cell phones are equipped with GPS, making picture location, and time metadata commonly available. We consider Instagram as the social network of choice and limit ourselves to urban events (noting that the majority of the world population lives in cities). The paper introduces a new adaptive localization algorithm that does not require the user to specify manually tunable parameters. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm for various real-world datasets, comparing it against a few baseline methods. The results show that our method achieves the best recall, the fewest false positives, and the lowest average error in localizing urban events.",

            "abstract": "Some of the most widely deployed IoT devices in urban areas are smartphones in the possession of urban individuals. Their proliferation has led to the emergence of crowdsensing/crowdsourcing services, where humans collect data about their environment (using phones), and servers aggregate the data for various application purposes of interest. With the emergence of social media, a common alternative form of human data entry has become media posts (e.g., on Twitter). This leads to the prospect of building crowdsensing services on top of social media content, exploiting humans as ``sensors\". In this paper, we develop one such service, called {\\em StoryLine}. The service detects and tracks physical urban events of interest to the user, such as car accidents, infrastructure damage (in the aftermath of a natural disaster), or instances of civil unrest. It offers an interface to client-side software that allows browsing such events in real time, as well as an interface for software applications to a structured representation of the events and their related statistics. The service embodies novel algorithms for real-time detection, demultiplexing, and tracking of physical events using social media data. In our evaluation with Twitter feeds, we show that our service outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in event detection and demultiplexing. We also conduct two case-studies to show the effectiveness of the real-time event detection capability and event tracking performance of our system.",

Empirical data suggests that event detection from Instagram streams errs on the false-negative side due to the relative sparsity of Instagram data (compared to Twitter data), whereas event detection from Twitter can suffer from false-positives, at least if not paired with careful analysis of tweet content. To tackle both problems simultaneously, we design a unified unsupervised algorithm that fuses events detected originally on Instagram (called I-events) and events detected originally on Twitter (called T-events), that occur in adjacent periods, in an attempt to combine the benefits of both sources while eliminating their individual disadvantages. We evaluate the proposed framework with real data crawled from Twitter and Instagram. The results indicate that our algorithm significantly improves tracking accuracy compared to baselines.",

We define structured human interactions as domain-specific workflow. A novel workflow-aware sensing model is proposed to jointly correct unreliable sensor data and keep track of states in a workflow. We also propose a new inference algorithm to handle cases with partially known states and objects as supervision. Our model is evaluated with extensive simulations. As a concrete application, we develop a novel log service called Emergency Transcriber, which can automatically document operational procedures followed by teams of first responders in emergency response scenarios. Evaluation shows that our system has significant improvement over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors and keeps track of workflow states with high accuracy in noisy physical environment.",

            "abstract": "In this demo we present a tool that allows us to visualize the real world events on a map interface using the contents shared by users on Twiter and Instagram. We incorporate a novel algorithm that analyzes the data from both Twitter and Instagram for fusing the contents corresponding to the same event thereby enhancing the corroboration of the event detection techniques for the individual networks. Such a service enables tracking of events using explanation from both the social networks to give a rich experience to the users.",

            "title": "Applying traditional signal processing techniques to social media exploitation for situational understanding",
            "abstract": "Signal processing techniques such as filtering, detection, estimation and frequency domain analysis have long been applied to extract information from noisy sensor data. This paper describes the exploitation of these signal processing techniques to extract information from social networks, such as Twitter and Instagram. Specifically, we view social networks as noisy sensors that report events in the physical world. We then present a data processing stack for detection, localization, tracking, and veracity analysis of reported events using social network data. We show using a controlled experiment that the behavior of social sources as information relays varies dramatically depending on context. In benign contexts, there is general agreement on events, whereas in conflict scenarios, a significant amount of collective filtering is introduced by conflicted groups, creating a large data distortion. We describe signal processing techniques that mitigate such distortion, resulting in meaningful approximations of actual ground truth, given noisy reported observations. Finally, we briefly present an implementation of the aforementioned social network data processing stack in a sensor network analysis toolkit, called Apollo. Experiences with Apollo show that our techniques are successful at identifying and tracking credible events in the physical world.",
