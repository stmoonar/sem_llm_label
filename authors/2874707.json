            "abstract": "Paramount and vast applications such as social networks deal with big graphs. For this reason, big graph analysis and processing is currently a necessity. Detection of connected components is one of the analysis of graphs which is utilized as a sub-part in many graph algorithms, such as clustering. The goal of this paper is to propose a parallel preprocess algorithm with MapReduce to decrease graph volume for rapid detection of connected components. Suggested method is able to lessen the volume up to more than 99% quickly by just two rounds of MapReduce. Our evaluation shows that the combination of the preprocess with detection of connected components has a significant impact on: reduction of execution time up to 7 times, decrease in data transmission of processing nodes in network and MapReduce rounds.",

            "abstract": "The requirement to trace and process moving objects in the contemporary era gradually increases since numerous applications quickly demand precise moving object locations. The Map-matching method is employed as a preprocessing technique, which matches a moving object point on a corresponding road. However, most of the GPS trajectory datasets include stay-points irregularity, which makes map-matching algorithms mismatch trajectories to irrelevant streets. Therefore, determining the stay-point region in GPS trajectory datasets results in better accurate matching and more rapid approaches. In this work, we cluster stay-points in a trajectory dataset with DBSCAN and eliminate redundant data to improve the efficiency of the map-matching algorithm by lowering processing time. We reckoned our proposed method's performance and exactness with a ground truth dataset compared to a fuzzy-logic based map-matching algorithm. Fortunately, our approach yields 27.39% data size reduction and 8.9% processing time reduction with the same accurate results as the previous fuzzy-logic based map-matching approach.",

            "abstract": "Keyword search is an alternative for structured languages in querying graph-structured data. A result to a keyword query is a connected structure covering all or part of the queried keywords. The textual coverage and structural compactness have been known as the two main properties of a relevant result to a keyword query. Many previous works examined these properties after retrieving all of the candidate results using a ranking function in a comparative manner. However, this needs a time-consuming search process, which is not appropriate for an interactive system in which the user expects results in the least possible time. This problem has been addressed in recent works by confining the shape of results to examine their coverage and compactness during the search. However, these methods still suffer from the existence of redundant nodes in the retrieved results. In this paper, we introduce the semantic of minimal covered r-clique (MCCr) for the results of a keyword query as an extended model of existing definitions. We propose some efficient algorithms to detect the MCCrs of a given query. These algorithms can retrieve a comprehensive set of non-duplicate MCCrs in response to a keyword query. In addition, these algorithms can be executed in a distributive manner, which makes them outstanding in the field of keyword search. We also propose the approximate versions of these algorithms to retrieve the top-k approximate MCCrs in a polynomial delay. It is proved that the approximate algorithms can retrieve results in two-approximation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Wikipedia exhibit rich connectivity patterns along with worthwhile content nodes often labeled with meaningful attributes. Keyword search is an effective method to retrieve information from such useful networks. The aim of keyword search is to find a set of answers (subgraphs) covering all or part of the queried keywords. A challenge in keyword search systems is to rank answers according to their relevance to the query. This relevance lies in the textual content and structural compactness of the answers. In this paper, an attribute-specific ranking method is proposed based on language models to rank candidate answers according to their semantic information up to the attribute level. This method scores answers using a model enriched with attribute-specific preferences and integrating both the structure and content of answers. The proposed model is directly estimated on the sub-graphs (answers) and is defined such that it can preserve the local importance of keywords in nodes. Extensive experiments conducted on a standard evaluation framework with three real-world datasets illustrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed ranking method to that of the state-of-the-art methods.",

A keyword query is expressed by a set of keywords and respond by a set of connected structures from the database, which totally or partially cover the queried keywords. These results show how the queried keywords are related in the database. Since there may be numerous results to a given query, a ranking function is essential to present top-k more relevant results to the user. The effectiveness of this function directly affected the effectiveness of the keyword search system. In this paper, we survey the proposed ranking functions in the context of keyword search. First, the proposed models for the results of a keyword query are discussed and a categorization of them is presented. Next, the effective factors in determining the relevance of results are examined. Then, various ranking functions for ordering the results of a query are described and categorized based on their main view in determining the semantic of the results. Finally, we present an analysis of these classes and discuss the evolution of new research strategies to resolve the issues associated with the ranking of results in the keyword search domain.",

This type of networks can be modeled by the enriched graph, in which nodes could have text too. Graph clustering is one of the important attempts toward analyzing social networks. Despite these two facts, most of the existing graph clustering methods independently focused on one of the content or structural aspects. Content-Structural graph clustering algorithms simultaneously consider both the structure and the content of the graph. The main aim of this paper is to achieve well connected (structured) clusters while their nodes benefit from homogeneous attribute values (content). The proposed algorithm in this paper so-called RSL-Cluster performs the clustering by hierarchically removing the edge between nodes which has a weight lower that the average similarity of nodes. This stage continues until reaching the user\u2019s desired number of clusters. Comparing the proposed algorithm with three well-known content-structural clustering algorithms represents the proper functioning of the proposed method. The used measures to evaluate our method include structural, content and the content-structural measures.",

            "abstract": "The ever-increasing volume of trajectories of moving objects and the diversity of intelligent transportation systems and location-based services that rely on spatio-temporal data of moving objects highlight the need for more efficient indexing techniques. The state-of-the-art methods index moving objects at three time modes of past (historical data), present, and future. An integrated method called \u201cPCI\u201d was proposed (past current indexing) to index and store spatial-temporal data of the past and present simultaneously. The method can handle queries in both the time modes and it processes and generates both the past and present indices using an integrated set of processing resources. Two interconnected data structures were utilized to store indices of both the time modes. Connecting the index of different time modes enforces efficiency challenges due to difference in updating costs. Since the method stores the indices in the main memory, the way the structures are connected to each other makes it possible to transfer the current data to the section responsible for historical data. This method indexes them in the trajectory of moving objects at a minimum time expense. As the quality of data inevitably affects the performance of applications, map matching methods was used in PCI to remove noises\u2014e.g., stationary state noises\u2014in the data received from the moving objects. This feature adds to the accuracy and reliability of query results. The effects of data reduction techniques on accelerating indexing, query processing, and reducing memory consumption (in voluminous data sets) were examined. Results of the comparisons, made based on the experiments, showed the higher efficiency of the indexing structure.",

One of the challenges in keyword search is to rank the answers (subgraphs) of a keyword query in order to their relevance to the query.

These functions usually reveal serious effectiveness problems due to their failure in recognising the conceptual differences between relatively similar answers. In this article, we propose a novel model-based method to improve the ranking accuracy of answers to a keyword query using pseudo-relevance feedback. The proposed method is built upon a carefully designed model for an answer called Structure-Aware Relevance Model which is estimated based on the textual and structural characteristics of the answer.
