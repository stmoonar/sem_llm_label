            "title": "Exploring Query Understanding for Amazon Product Search",
            "abstract": "Online shopping platforms, such as Amazon, offer services to billions of people worldwide. Unlike web search or other search engines, product search engines have their unique characteristics, primarily featuring short queries which are mostly a combination of product attributes and structured product search space. The uniqueness of product search underscores the crucial importance of the query understanding component. However, there are limited studies focusing on exploring this impact within real-world product search engines. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive study and sharing our year-long journey investigating how the query understanding service impacts Amazon Product Search. Firstly, we explore how query understanding-based ranking features influence the ranking process. Next, we delve into how the query understanding system contributes to understanding the performance of a ranking model. Building on the insights gained from our study on the evaluation of the query understanding-based ranking model, we propose a query understanding-based multi-task learning framework for ranking. We present our studies and investigations using the real-world system on Amazon Search.",

            "title": "Amazon-M2: A Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset for Recommendation and Text Generation",
            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "Using implicit feedback collected from user clicks as training labels for learning-to-rank algorithms is a well-developed paradigm that has been extensively studied and used in modern IR systems. Using user clicks as ranking features, on the other hand, has not been fully explored in existing literature. Despite its potential in improving short-term system performance, whether the incorporation of user clicks as ranking features is beneficial for learning-to-rank systems in the long term is still questionable. Two of the most important problems are (1) the explicit bias introduced by noisy user behavior, and (2) the implicit bias, which we refer to as the exploitation bias, introduced by the dynamic training and serving of learning-to-rank systems with behavior features. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating user clicks as both training labels and ranking features for learning to rank. We formally investigate the problems in feature collection and model training, and propose a counterfactual feature projection function and a novel uncertainty-aware learning to rank framework. Experiments on public datasets show that ranking models learned with the proposed framework can significantly outperform models built with raw click features and algorithms that rank items without considering model uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Product search engines like Amazon Search often use caches to improve the customer user experience; caches can improve both the system\u2019s latency as well as search quality. However, as search traffic increases over time, the cache\u2019s ever-growing size can diminish the overall system performance. Furthermore, typos, misspellings, and redundancy widely witnessed in real-world product search queries can cause unnecessary cache misses, reducing the cache\u2019s utility. In this paper, we introduce ROSE, a RObuSt cachE, a system that is tolerant to misspellings and typos while retaining the look-up cost of traditional caches. The core component of ROSE is a randomized hashing schema that makes ROSE able to index and retrieve an arbitrarily large set of queries with constant memory and constant time. ROSE is also robust to any query intent, typos, and grammatical errors with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE. ROSE is deployed in the Amazon Search Engine and produced a significant improvement over the existing solutions across several key business metrics.",

            "abstract": "Predicting missing facts in a knowledge graph (KG) is crucial as modern KGs are far from complete. Due to labor-intensive human labeling, this phenomenon deteriorates when handling knowledge represented in various languages. In this paper, we explore multilingual KG completion, which leverages limited seed alignment as a bridge, to embrace the collective knowledge from multiple languages. However, language alignment used in prior works is still not fully exploited: (1) alignment pairs are treated equally to maximally push parallel entities to be close, which ignores KG capacity inconsistency; (2) seed alignment is scarce and new alignment identification is usually in a noisily unsupervised manner. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel self-supervised adaptive graph alignment (SS-AGA) method. Specifically, SS-AGA fuses all KGs as a whole graph by regarding alignment as a new edge type. As such, information propagation and noise influence across KGs can be adaptively controlled via relation-aware attention weights. Meanwhile, SS-AGA features a new pair generator that dynamically captures potential alignment pairs in a self-supervised paradigm. Extensive experiments on both the public multilingual DBPedia KG and newly-created industrial multilingual E-commerce KG empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of SS-AGA",
