            "abstract": "Motivated by the problem of human-tra\ufb03cking, where it is often observed that criminal organizations are linked and behave similarly over time, we introduce the problem of Coupled Clustering of Time-series and their underlying Network . The goal is to \ufb01nd tightly connected subgroups of nodes that also have similar node-speci\ufb01c time series (temporal\u2014not necessarily structural\u2014behavior). We formulate the problem as a coupled matrix factorization for the time series, combined with regularization for network smoothness. We propose CCTN , and an incrementally-updated counterpart, CCTN-inc , which e\ufb03ciently handles network updates. Extensive experiments show that CCTN is up to 4 \u00d7 more accurate than baselines that consider graph structure or time series alone, and CCTN-inc is up to 55 \u00d7 faster than CCTN . As an application, we explore an exclusive database with millions of online ads on human tra\ufb03cking, and successfully deploy our technique to detect criminal organizations.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, \\emph{search story}, a combined display with other organic channels, has become a major source of user traffic on platforms such as e-commerce search platforms, news feed platforms and web and image search platforms. The recommended search story guides a user to identify her own preference and personal intent, which subsequently influences the user's real-time and long-term search behavior. %With such an increased importance of search stories, As search stories become increasingly important, in this work, we study the problem of personalized search story recommendation within a search engine, which aims to suggest a search story relevant to both a search keyword and an individual user's interest. To address the challenge of modeling both immediate and future values of recommended search stories (i.e., cross-channel effect), for which conventional supervised learning framework is not applicable, we resort to a Markov decision process and propose a deep reinforcement learning architecture trained by both imitation learning and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through extensive experiments on real-world data sets from this http URL.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, for the first time, we study label propagation in heterogeneous graphs under heterophily assumption. Homophily label propagation (i.e., two connected nodes share similar labels) in homogeneous graph (with same types of vertices and relations) has been extensively studied before. Unfortunately, real-life networks (e.g., social networks) are heterogeneous, they contain different types of vertices (e.g., users, images, and texts) and relations (e.g., friendships and co-tagging) and allow for each node to propagate both the same and opposite copy of labels to its neighbors. We propose a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {K}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi mathvariant=\"script\">K</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"deng-ieq1-2937493.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-partite label propagation model to handle the mystifying combination of heterogeneous nodes/relations and heterophily propagation. With this model, we develop a novel label inference algorithm framework with update rules in near-linear time complexity. Since real networks change over time, we devise an incremental approach, which supports fast updates for both new data and evidence (e.g., ground truth labels) with guaranteed efficiency. We further provide a utility function to automatically determine whether an incremental or a re-modeling approach is favored. Extensive experiments on real datasets have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, and its superiority over the state-of-the-art label propagation methods.",

            "abstract": "Due to the recent vast availability of transportation traffic data, major research efforts have been devoted to traffic prediction, which is useful in many applications such as urban planning, traffic management and navigations systems. Current prediction methods that independently train a model per traffic sensor cannot accurately predict traffic in every situation (e.g., rush hours, constructions and accidents) because there may not exist sufficient training samples per sensor for all situations. To address this shortcoming, our core idea is to explore the commonalities of prediction tasks across multiple sensors who behave similarly in a specific traffic situation. Instead of building a model independently per sensor, we propose a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that aims to first automatically identify the traffic situations and then simultaneously build one forecasting model for similar-behaving sensors per traffic situation. The key innovation here is that instead of the straightforward application of MTL where each \"task\" corresponds to a sensor, we relate each MTL's \"task\" to a traffic situation. Specifically, we first identify these traffic situations by running clustering algorithms on all sensors' data. Subsequently, to enforce the commonalities under each identified situation, we use the group Lasso regularization in MTL to select a common set of features for the prediction tasks, and we adapt efficient FISTA algorithm with guaranteed convergence rate. We evaluated our methods with a large volume of real-world traffic sensor data; our results show that by incorporating traffic situations, our proposed MTL framework performs consistently better than naively applying MTL per sensor. Moreover, our holistic approach, under different traffic situations, outperforms all the best traffic prediction approaches for a given situation by up to 18% and 30% in short and long term predictions, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and characterizing the processes driving social interactions is one of the fundamental problems in social network research. A particular instance of this problem, known as link prediction, has recently attracted considerable attention in various research communities. Link prediction has many important commercial applications, e.g., recommending friends in an online social network such as Facebook and suggesting interesting pins in a collection sharing network such as Pinterest. This work is focused on the temporal link prediction problem: Given a sequence of graph snapshots G1, \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7, Gt from time 1 to t, how do we predict links in future time t + 1? To perform link prediction in a network, one needs to construct models for link probabilities between pairs of nodes. A temporal latent space model is proposed that is built upon latent homophily assumption and temporal smoothness assumption. First, the proposed modeling allows to naturally incorporate the well-known homophily effect (birds of a feather flock together). Namely, each dimension of the latent space characterizes an unobservable homogeneous attribute, and shared attributes tend to create a link in a network.",

In this paper, we examine the distribution of attention across a large sample of users of a popular social media site Twitter. Through empirical analysis of these data we conclude that attention is very unequally distributed: the top 20\\% of Twitter users own more than 96\\% of all followers, 93\\% of the retweets, and 93\\% of the mentions. We investigate the mechanisms that lead to attention inequality and find that it results from the \"rich-get-richer\" and \"poor-get-poorer\" dynamics of attention diffusion. Namely, users who are \"rich\" in attention, because they are often mentioned and retweeted, are more likely to gain new followers, while those who are \"poor\" in attention are likely to lose followers. We develop a phenomenological model that quantifies attention diffusion and network dynamics, and solve it to study how attention inequality grows over time in a dynamic environment of social media.",

            "abstract": "Real-time traffic prediction from high-fidelity spatiotemporal traffic sensor datasets is an important problem for intelligent transportation systems and sustainability. However, it is challenging due to the complex topological dependencies and high dynamism associated with changing road conditions. In this paper, we propose a Latent Space Model for Road Networks (LSM-RN) to address these challenges holistically. In particular, given a series of road network snapshots, we learn the attributes of vertices in latent spaces which capture both topological and temporal properties. As these latent attributes are time-dependent, they can estimate how traffic patterns form and evolve. In addition, we present an incremental online algorithm which sequentially and adaptively learns the latent attributes from the temporal graph changes. Our framework enables real-time traffic prediction by 1) exploiting real-time sensor readings to adjust/update the existing latent spaces, and 2) training as data arrives and making predictions on-the-fly. By conducting extensive experiments with a large volume of real-world traffic sensor data, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework for real-time traffic prediction on large road networks over competitors as well as baseline graph-based LSM's.",

The main contribution of our work is to combine temporal learning with sequence modeling to capture complex user-item activity patterns to improve job recommendations. First, we propose a time-based ranking model applied to historical observations and a hybrid matrix factorization over time re-weighted interactions. Second, we exploit sequence properties in user-items activities and develop a RNN-based recommendation model. Our solution achieved 5th place in the challenge among more than 100 participants. Notably, the strong performance of our RNN approach shows a promising new direction in employing sequence modeling for recommendation systems.",
