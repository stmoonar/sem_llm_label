            "title": "Optimizing the Demodulation Method for DAS System Based on Point-Backscattering-Enhanced Fiber",
            "abstract": "The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems based on Rayleigh backscattered (RBS) signals can be improved using point-backscattering-enhanced fiber (PBSEF). It is necessary to explore the methods to achieve stable and low noise demodulation for PBSEF-based DAS system. Driven by this, this work theoretically analyzes the effect of the phase and intensity noises on the PBSEF-based demodulated signal during averaging process. The results show that the phase noise has a weaker impact on the demodulated phase than the intensity noise. Based on this analysis, two methods, direct averaging and weighted averaging, for suppressing the noise level of DAS have been investigated and the optimal parameters are investigated. For both methods, simulation and experiments show the noise level suppression of 1.5 and 4.4 times, corresponding to the noise level reduction of 0.45 and 3.78 $\\text{p}\\varepsilon /\\surd $ Hz, respectively. The relationship between the system noise level and the number of sampling points used in the demodulation is different for the two methods. The weighted-averaging method demonstrates superior performance for its higher stability. These conclusions provide significant theoretical basis and guidance for the development of practical high-performance DAS systems for field applications.",

            "title": "Hierarchical Projection Enhanced Multi-behavior Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Various types of user behaviors are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios. To fully utilize the multi-behavior information, the exploration of multiplex interaction among them is essential. Many multi-task learning based multi-behavior methods are proposed recently to use multiple types of supervision signals and perform information transfer among them. Despite the great successes, these methods fail to design prediction tasks comprehensively, leading to insufficient utilization of multi-behavior correlative information. Besides, these methods are either based on the weighting of expert information extracted from the coupled input or modeling of information transfer between multiple behavior levels through task-specific extractors, which are usually accompanied by negative transfer phenomenon1. To address the above problems, we propose a multi-behavior recommendation framework, called Hierarchical Projection Enhanced Multi-behavior Recommendation (HPMR). The key module, Projection-based Transfer Network (PTN), uses the projection mechanism to \"explicitly\" model the correlations of upstream and downstream behaviors, refines the upstream behavior representations, and fully uses the refined representations to enhance the learning of downstream tasks. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets and online A/B test further verify the effectiveness of HPMR in modeling the associations from upstream to downstream and alleviating the negative transfer. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/MC-CV/HPMR.",

            "abstract": "Building appropriate scenarios to meet the personalized demands of different user groups is a common practice. Despite various scenario brings personalized service, it also leads to challenges for the recommendation on multiple scenarios, especially the scenarios with limited traffic. To give desirable recommendation service for all scenarios and reduce the cost of resource consumption, how to leverage the information from multiple scenarios to construct a unified model becomes critical. Unfortunately, the performance of existing multi-scenario recommendation approaches is poor since they introduce unnecessary information from other scenarios to target scenario. In this paper, we show it is possible to selectively utilize the information from different scenarios to construct the scenario-aware estimators in a unified model. Specifically, we first do analysis on multi-scenario modeling with causal graph from the perspective of users and modeling processes, and then propose the Causal Inspired Intervention (CausalInt) framework for multi-scenario recommendation. CausalInt consists of three modules: (1) Invariant Representation Modeling module to squeeze out the scenario-aware information through disentangled representation learning and obtain a scenario-invariant representation; (2) Negative Effects Mitigating module to resolve conflicts between different scenarios and conflicts between scenario-specific and scenario-invariant representations via gradient based orthogonal regularization and model-agnostic meta learning, respectively; (3) Inter-Scenario Transferring module designs a novel TransNet to simulate a counterfactual intervention and effectively fuse the information from other scenarios. Offline experiments over two real-world dataset and online A/B test are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of CausalInt.",
