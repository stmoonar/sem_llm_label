            "abstract": "This brief presents an improved single-controller-multiple-output (SCMO) digital LDO regulating four separate outputs with only one digital controller. The shared digital controller employs a priority-time-multiplexing scheme for optimal performance. The area of the digital controller is reduced by 25% compared to the sum of four separate controllers. Dead-zone control is utilized to save quiescent power during steady state. Two 2-level comparators are employed to generate a 4-bit signal with minimum quiescent current. Clamping loops are also implemented to reduce the undershoot/overshoot. This SCMO digital LDO is verified in a 65-nm CMOS process. There is no cross regulation, and the proposed priority-time-multiplexing scheme ensures an efficient assignment of clock cycles to the most needed output.",

            "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Reward-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intent Analysis of Social Media Information",
            "abstract": "Due to various and serious adverse impacts of spreading fake news, it is often known that only people with malicious intent would propagate fake news. However, it is not necessarily true based on social science studies. Distinguishing the types of fake news spreaders based on their intent is critical because it will effectively guide how to intervene to mitigate the spread of fake news with different approaches. To this end, we propose an intent classification framework that can best identify the correct intent of fake news. We will leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can optimize the structural representation of each tweet by removing noisy words from the input sequence when appending an actor to the long short-term memory (LSTM) intent classifier. Policy gradient DRL model (e.g., REINFORCE) can lead the actor to a higher delayed reward. We also devise a new uncertainty-aware immediate reward using a subjective opinion that can explicitly deal with multidimensional uncertainty for effective decision-making. Via 600K training episodes from a fake news tweets dataset with an annotated intent class, we evaluate the performance of uncertainty-aware reward in DRL. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed framework efficiently reduces the number of selected words to maintain a high 95\\% multi-class accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generating diverse, high quality images from text. Numerous techniques have been proposed on top of or in alignment with models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen that generate images directly from text. A lesser explored approach is DALLE-2's two step process comprising a Diffusion Prior that generates a CLIP image embedding from text and a Diffusion Decoder that generates an image from a CLIP image embedding. We explore the capabilities of the Diffusion Prior and the advantages of an intermediate CLIP representation. We observe that Diffusion Prior can be used in a memory and compute efficient way to constrain the generation to a specific domain without altering the larger Diffusion Decoder. Moreover, we show that the Diffusion Prior can be trained with additional conditional information such as color histogram to further control the generation. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that the proposed approaches perform better than prompt engineering for domain specific generation and existing baselines for color conditioned generation. We believe that our observations and results will instigate further research into the diffusion prior and uncover more of its capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Early event detection aims to detect events even before the event is complete. However, most of the existing methods focus on an event with a single label but fail to be applied to cases with multiple labels. Another non-negligible issue for early event detection is a prediction with overconfidence due to the high vacuity uncertainty that exists in the early time series. It results in an over-confidence estimation and hence unreliable predictions. To this end, technically, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Label Temporal Evidential Neural Network (MTENN), for multi-label uncertainty estimation in temporal data. MTENN is able to quality predictive uncertainty due to the lack of evidence for multi-label classifications at each time stamp based on belief/evidence theory. In addition, we introduce a novel uncertainty estimation head (weighted binomial comultiplication (WBC)) to quantify the fused uncertainty of a sub-sequence for early event detection. We validate the performance of our approach with state-of-the-art techniques on real-world audio datasets.",

However, acquiring the channel state information (CSI) in such systems is challenging because of the high pilot overhead resulting from massive passive IRS elements. This letter discusses the cause and impact of the beam leakage which is caused by the mismatch problem between the beam width and the grid interval in the conventional compressed sensing based channel estimation (CE). Then, an improved orthogonal matching pursuit (IOMP) algorithm is proposed to improve the CE performance by utilizing the feature of the beam leakage. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance without extra computational complexity compared with existing schemes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Renewal Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (RETAS) model is a recently proposed point process model that can fit event sequences such as earthquakes better than preexisting models. Evaluating the log-likelihood function and directly maximizing it has been shown to be a viable approach to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the RETAS model. However, the direct likelihood maximization suffers from numerical issues such as premature termination of parameter searching and sensitivity to the initial value. In this work, we propose to use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm as a numerically more stable alternative to obtain the MLE of the RETAS model. We propose two choices of the latent variables, leading to two variants of the EM algorithm. As well as deriving the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed data required in the E-step of each EM-cycle, we propose an approximation approach to speed up the E-step. The resulting approximate EM algorithms can obtain the MLE much faster without compromising on the accuracy of the solution. These newly developed EM algorithms are shown to perform well in simulation studies and are applied to an Italian earthquake catalog. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, dominant multi-object tracking (MOT) and segmentation (MOTS) methods mainly follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm. Transformer-based end-to-end (E2E) solutions bring some ideas to MOT and MOTS, but they can not achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in major MOT and MOTS bench-marks. Detection and association are two main modules of the tracking-by-detection paradigm. Association techniques mainly depend on the combination of motion and appearance information. As deep learning has been recently developed, the performance of the detection and appearance model is rapidly improved. These trends made us consider whether we can achieve SOTA based on only high-performance detection and appearance model. Our paper mainly focuses on exploring this direction based on CBNetV2 with Swin-B as a detection model and MoCo-v2 as a self-supervised appearance model. Motion information and IoU mapping were removed during the association. Our method achieves SOTA results on 2 mainstream MOT datasets and 1 MOTS dataset which is BDD100K MOT, WAYMO 2D Tracking, BDD100K MOTS. Our method yielded a significant improvement of +10.7% and +33.7%, respectively on BDD 100K MOT and MOTS benchmark. The proposed method won first place in BDD100K Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) challenges at CVPR 2022 Workshop on Autonomous Driving. Our method also won first place in BDD100K Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) challenges at ECCV 2022 Self-supervised Learning for Next-Generation Industry-level Autonomous Driving (SSLAD) Workshop. We hope our simple and effective method can give some insights to the MOT and MOTS research community.

            "title": "Distributed Subspace Projection Graph Signal Estimation With Anomaly Interference",
            "abstract": "The estimation of graph signal is a vital problem in many distributed networks, such as vehicular networks, smart grids, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the Internet of Things. In those networks, anomaly interference widely exists, such as network attack, noise, device fault, which will hazard the healthy of the entire system. In the article, the estimation of graph signals with anomaly interference is investigated. We show that the graph signal estimation problem can be treated as a bandlimited subspace optimization problem, and propose a distributed subspace projection graph signal estimation algorithm based on the graph filter (DispGF), which can achieve better performance with less communication burden. In addition, a graph filter matrix that produces subspace projection is proposed to replace the nonsparse projection matrix, which guarantees distributed implementation and projection accuracy. Different from previous work, here, graph signal estimation is studied with no prior anomaly information. To this end, for FDI attack, random attack, noise interference, we propose anomaly detection and node localization scheme based on smoothness, that can achieve similar performance compared with the case of prior anomaly information known. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed DispGF algorithm. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Consider adversarial multitask networks with a high cost of sharing genuine information, where agents feed others unreliable information according to a time-varying probability caused by a high privacy cost. This makes agents in the network tend to be selfish, and it greatly increases the difficulty of effective information sharing and distributed multitask estimation without the prior cluster information. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive task-switching strategy that is governed by our formulated information sharing model, which cooperates with the proposed distributed adaptive task-switching learning and clustering for secure estimation over adversarial multi-task network (DATSLCS-AM) algorithm. This distributed algorithm guides agents to cooperate reasonably following reputation updating and pseudoclustering, which can improve the effectiveness of information sharing and also increase the security of estimation over adversarial multitask networks. The theoretical analysis of the adaptive pseudoclustering threshold is provided. Finally, extensive simulations validate the superior performance of our distributed algorithm.",
