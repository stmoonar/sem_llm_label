            "abstract": "In this article, a method of extending airborne weather radar modeling to incorporate high-ice-water-content (HIWC) conditions has been developed. A novel aspect is incorporating flight test measurement data, including forward-looking radar measurements and in situ microphysics probes data, into the model and part of the evaluations of modeling. The simulation models assume a dual-polarized, airborne forward-looking radar, while for single-polarized operations, the index-of-dispersion is included as a helpful indicator for HIWC detection. The radar system simulation models are useful for design evaluations for the next generation of airborne aviation hazard monitoring and incorporate HIWC hazard detection algorithms. Example applications of the simulator, such as hazard detection based on the simulated HIWC flight encounter scenarios based on specific numeric weather prediction (NWP) model outputs, are discussed.",

            "title": "The Impacts of Single-Scattering and Microphysical Properties of Ice Particles Smaller Than 100 \u00b5m on the Bulk Radiative Properties of Tropical Cirrus",
            "abstract": "There are large uncertainties in the single-scattering (i.e., morphologies) and microphysical (i.e., concentrations) properties of ice particles whose size are less than ~100 \u00b5m. Insufficient resolutions of the most advanced cloud probes (e.g., cloud particle imager) cannot resolve the micrometer-scale morphologies of small ice particles. Further, the shattering of large ice particles on probes\u2019 inlets or tips causes uncertainties in the measurement of the concentrations of small ice particles. These uncertainties have large impacts on the single-scattering and microphysical properties of small ice particles that are utilized to quantify the bulk radiative properties of cirrus. In this study, the impacts of uncertainties in the morphologies and concentrations of small ice particles on the bulk radiative properties of tropical cirrus were calculated using measurements acquired during the Tropical Warm Pool-International Cloud Experiment. Five different models (i.e., budding Buckyball, Chebyshev particle, droxtal, Gaussian random sphere, and sphere) that represent the shapes of small ice particles were used to calculate the single-scattering properties. The bulk radiative properties, average phase-function (P11\u00af), and average asymmetry parameter (g\u00af) were computed by combining the measured size/habit distributions and the calculated single-scattering properties of ice particles. The impacts of the selection of varying morphologies of small particles on the bulk radiative properties were quantified. For these calculations, the possible range of the concentrations of small ice particles which depend on the degree of shattered large particles were also used. The impacts of varying the single-scattering properties of small ice particles on the bulk radiative properties were the largest in the upper parts of cirrus (T < \u221260 \u00b0C), while they were the smallest in the lower parts of cirrus (\u221245 < T < \u221230 \u00b0C). The impacts of uncertainties in the concentrations of small ice particles on the bulk radiative properties were largest in the lower parts of cirrus (\u221245 < T < \u221230 \u00b0C), whereas they were smallest in the upper parts of cirrus (T < \u221260 \u00b0C). The effect of shattering was maximum in the lower parts of cirrus, whilst it was minimum in the upper parts of cirrus. The combined impacts of uncertainties in the single-scattering (i.e., morphologies) and microphysical (i.e., concentrations) properties of small ice particles revealed variations of up to 11.2% (127.1%; 67.3%) of the integrated intensity in the forward (sideward; backward) angles in P11\u00af and a corresponding change in g\u00af by up to 12.61%.",

            "title": "Theoretical Calculations of Directional Scattering Intensities of Small Nonspherical Ice Crystals: Implications for Forward Scattering Probes",
            "abstract": "In situ aircraft measurements of the sizes and concentrations of liquid cloud droplets and ice crystals with maximum dimensions (Dmax) less than ~50 \u03bcm have been measured mainly using forward scattering probes over the past half century. The operating principle of forward scattering probes is that the measured intensity of light scattered by a cloud particle at specific forward scattering angles can be related to the size of that particle assuming the shape and thermodynamic phase of the target are known. Current forward-scattering probes assume spherical liquid cloud droplets and use the Lorenz\u2013Mie theory to convert the scattered light to particle size. Uncertainties in sizing ice crystals using forward scattering probes are unavoidable since the single-scattering properties of ice crystals differ from those of spherical liquid cloud droplets and because their shapes can vary. In this study, directional scattering intensities of four different aspect ratios (ARs = 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00) of hexagonal ice crystals with random orientations and of spherical liquid cloud droplets were calculated using the discrete dipole approximation (i.e., ADDA) and Lorenz\u2013Mie code, respectively, to quantify the errors in sizing small ice crystals and cloud droplets using current forward scattering probes and to determine the ranges of optimal scattering angles that would be used in future forward scattering probes. The calculations showed that current forward scattering probes have average 5.0% and 17.4% errors in sizing liquid cloud droplets in the forward (4\u201312\u00b0) and backward (168\u2013176\u00b0) direction, respectively. For measurements of hexagonal ice crystals, average sizing errors were 42.1% (23.9%) in the forward (backward) direction and depended on the ARs of hexagonal ice crystals, which are larger than those for liquid cloud droplets. A newly developed size conversion table based on the calculated single-scattering properties of hexagonal ice crystals using the ADDA reduced the sizing errors for the hexagonal ice crystals down to 14.2% (21.9%) in the forward (backward) direction. This study is a purely theoretical examination of the operating principle of forward scattering probes and there are several limitations, such as assumed hexagonal ice crystals with smooth surfaces and random orientations.",

            "abstract": "In situ observations of cloud properties made by airborne probes play a critical role in ice cloud research through their role in process studies, parameterization development, and evaluation of simulations and remote sensing retrievals. To determine how cloud properties vary with environmental conditions, in situ data collected during different field projects processed by different groups must be used. However, because of the diverse algorithms and codes that are used to process measurements, it can be challenging to compare the results. Therefore it is vital to understand both the limitations of specific probes and uncertainties introduced by processing algorithms. Since there is currently no universally accepted framework regarding how in situ measurements should be processed, there is a need for a general reference that describes the most commonly applied algorithms along with their strengths and weaknesses. Methods used to process data from bulk water probes, single-particle light-scattering spectrometers and cloud-imaging probes are reviewed herein, with emphasis on measurements of the ice phase. Particular attention is paid to how uncertainties, caveats, and assumptions in processing algorithms affect derived products since there is currently no consensus on the optimal way of analyzing data. Recommendations for improving the analysis and interpretation of in situ data include the following: establishment of a common reference library of individual processing algorithms, better documentation of assumptions used in these algorithms, development and maintenance of sustainable community software for processing in situ observations, and more studies that compare different algorithms with the same benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "[1]\u00a0A novel automatic classification method is proposed for identifying the habits of large ice-cloud particles and deriving the shape distribution of particle ensembles. This IC-PCA (Ice-crystal Classification with Principal Component Analysis) tool is based on a principal component analysis of selected physical and statistical features of ice-crystal perimeters. The method is developed and tested using image data obtained with a Cloud Particle Imager, but can be applied to other silhouette data as well. For three randomly selected test cases of 222, 200, and 201 crystals from tropical, midlatitude, and arctic ice clouds, the combined classification accuracy of the IC-PCA is 81.1%. Since previous, semiautomatic classification methods are more time-consuming and include a subjective phase, the automatic and objective IC-PCA offers a notable improvement in retrieving the shapes of the individual crystals. As the habit distributions of ice-cloud particles can be applied to computations of radiative impact of cirrus, it is also demonstrated how classification uncertainties propagate into the radiative transfer computations by using the arctic test case as an example. Computations of shortwave radiative fluxes show that the flux differences between clouds of manually and automatically classified crystals can be as large as 10 Wm\u22122 but also that two manual classifications of the same image data result in even larger differences, implying the need for a systematic and repeatable classification method.",
