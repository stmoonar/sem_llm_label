            "abstract": "A sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action sequence. While previous methods have made many efforts to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce a new concept dubbed socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. In light of this, we contribute a novel solution named GCARec (short for graph-augmented co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. GCARec decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps. First, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user preference. Then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at sequential-level and social-level, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of GCARec against several state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets have been released at: https://github.com/wubinzzu/GCARec.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems commonly encounter with the problems of data sparsity and cold start. Recently, social recommendation has emerged with the rapid expansion of social platforms, offering an opportunity to alleviate such two obstacles. Nevertheless, there are still two key limitations in existing studies. From the perspective of model design, previous social recommenders only consider the influence of a user's direct friends or uniformly treat the influences from different friends. From the perspective of model learning, most of them apply a sampling\u2010based optimization strategy, which requires high\u2010quality positive and negative samples. In light of the aforementioned limitations, we propose a new probabilistic method, named Graph Attentive Matrix Factorization (GAMF). Our method not only explicitly captures high\u2010order social relationships, but also adopts an attention mechanism to automatically pick up different influences between friends. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to learn model parameters in a non\u2010sampling manner. Extensive experiments on four large\u2010scale datasets show the superiority of GAMF over state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art recommenders, especially under the cold start scenario.",

            "abstract": "Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have enjoyed considerable success in computer vision and attracted much attention from recommender systems. However, due to the discrete nature of items, it is infeasible to graft GANs directly onto recommendation models. Although several methods have taken steps forward, their training processes are slow-convergent, time-consuming, or even unstable. This article proposes a novel framework named attentive adversarial collaborative filtering (AACF) and an efficient training strategy to improve GANs in recommender systems. There are two distinct novelties over previous work. First, AACF is a differentiable generative adversarial framework that introduces an attention mechanism and \u201cvirtual items\u201d to bridge the gap between the generator and the discriminator. Owing to the intrinsic differentiability, AACF can be stably optimized with gradient descent methods. Second, the efficient training strategy substantially reduces computational complexity. It is capable of efficiently training and scaling up the AACF model to large datasets. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, fast convergence, stability, and scalability of AACF. Since our ideas are general in nature, they will open a path to stably and efficiently train GANs in the research areas with discrete data.

            "abstract": "In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent recommendation is playing an important role in our daily life. How to provide personalized information to users is the core concern of Internet content service providers. To improve the recommendation quality, it is a hot topic to go beyond merely user\u2013item interaction records and take social relations into account in IoT. Recently, emerged graph neural networks (GNNs) shine a light on simulating the recursive social diffusion process, to refine user embedding learning. Nevertheless, two key issues have not been well studied in previous studies: 1) they usually model user preference and social influence within a same semantic space and fail to simultaneously inject high-order connectivity information reflected in both user\u2013item interaction graph and user\u2013user social graph and 2) they typically rely on negative sampling to optimize a recommendation model, which makes them highly sensitive to the design of the sampler and hardly makes full use of GPU\u2019s computing ability. In light of this, we propose a novel framework for item recommendation, namely, an efficient adaptive graph convolutional network (EAGCN). Specifically, we introduce a space-adaptive graph convolutional module, which could jointly explore the propagation process of user interest and social influence. Furthermore, a user-specific gating mechanism is designed to aggregate user representations from both spaces. To make EAGCN practical in social IoT, we devise a fast nonsampling leaner to optimize EAGCN\u2019s parameters with better leveraging matrix computing of GPU. Extensive experiments under four scenarios show that our solution consistently and significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in both model effectiveness and training efficiency.",

While previous efforts toward this task have been made in capturing complex item transition patterns, we argue that they still suffer from three limitations: 1) they have difficulty in explicitly capturing the impact of inherent order of item transition patterns; 2) only a simple and crude embedding is insufficient to yield satisfactory long-term users\u2019 representations from limited training sequences; and 3) they are incapable of dynamically integrating long-term and short-term user interest modeling. In this work, we propose a novel solution named graph-augmented capsule network (GCRec), which exploits sequential user behaviors in a more fine-grained manner. Specifically, we employ a linear graph convolution module to learn informative long-term representations of users. Furthermore, we devise a user-specific capsule module and a position-aware gating module, which are sensitive to the relative sequential order of the recently interacted items, to capture sequential patterns at union-level and point-level. To aggregate the long-term and short-term user interests as a representative vector, we design a dual-gating mechanism, which could decide the contribution ratio of each module given different contextual information.

As users visit items in chronological order, existing methods typically capture a user\u2019s present interests from his/her past-to-present behaviors, i.e., making recommendations with only the unidirectional past information. This article argues that future information is another critical factor for the sequential recommendation. However, directly learning from future-to-present behaviors inevitably causes data leakage. Here, it is pointed out that future information can be learned from users\u2019 collaborative behaviors. Toward this end, this article introduces sequential graphs to depict item transition relationships: where and how each item transits from and will transit to. This temporal evolution information is called the light cone in special and general relativity. Then, a bidirectional sequential graph convolutional network (BiSGCN) is proposed to learn item representations by encoding past and future light cones. Finally, a manifold translating embedding (MTE) method is proposed to model item transition patterns in Riemannian manifolds, which helps to better capture the geometric structures of light cones and item transition patterns. Experimental comparisons and ablation studies verify the outstanding performance of BiSGCN, the benefits of learning from the future, and the improvements of learning in Riemannian manifolds.",

            "abstract": "Predicting what items a user will consume in the next time (i.e., next-item recommendation) is a crucial task for recommender systems. While the factorization method is a popular choice in recommendation, several recent efforts have shown that the inner product does not satisfy the triangle inequality, which may hurt the model's generalization ability. TransRec is a promising method to overcome this issue, which learns a distance metric to predict the strength of user\u2013item interactions. Nevertheless, such method only uses the latest consumed item to model a user's short-term preference, which is insufficient for modeling fidelity. In this article, we propose a simple yet effective method named attentive translation model, to explicitly exploit high-order sequential information for next-item recommendation. Specifically, we construct a user-specific translation vector by accounting for multiple recent items, which encode more information about a user's short-term preference than the latest item. To aggregate multiple items into one representation, we devise a position-aware attention mechanism, learning different weights on items at different orders in a personalized way.
