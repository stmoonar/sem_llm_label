            "title": "Loss Compensation in Multi-Session Recommendation Under Limited Availability",
            "abstract": "In many recommendation applications, items may have limited availability thereby causing conflict among users interested in the same items. Over time, this results in unequal user treat-ment: few users are recommended the limited items and receive preferential treatment, while the rest is left with sub-optimal recommendations, ultimately leading them to leave. In this paper, we formalize the novel problem of compensating users in multi-session recommendations under limited item availability. Our aim is to generate recommendations that not only optimize accuracy, but also compensate users over time for the loss of accuracy incurred in previous iterations. We design compensation strategies that serve users and items in different orders and accommodate various recommendation adoption models. Our algorithms are integrated into SoCRATe (System for Compensating Recommendations with Availability and Time), a framework that enables us to study loss compensation over time. Our experiments on real data demonstrate that to best compensate users for the incurred loss, traditional recommenders need to be revisited to account for item availability. Our experiments on synthetic data explore different parameters of our solution and show that it is much faster than an optimal (brute-force) compensation strategy, while achieving comparable results.",

            "abstract": "Big data poses challenges in maintaining ethical standards for reliable outcomes in machine learning. Data that inaccurately represent populations may result in biased algorithmic models, whose application leads to unfair decisions in delicate fields such as medicine and industry. To address this issue, many fairness mitigation techniques have been introduced, but the proliferation of overlapping methods complicates decision-making for data scientists. This paper proposes a taxonomy to organize these techniques and a pipeline for their evaluation, supporting practitioners in selecting the most suitable ones. The taxonomy classifies and describes techniques qualitatively, while the pipeline offers a quantitative framework for evaluation and comparison. The proposed approach supports data scientists in addressing biased models and data effectively.",

            "abstract": "In the contemporary world, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are an important driver for decision-making, by leveraging real-world data for future predictions. Despite clearly improving efficiency, the lack of transparency in their predictions raises concerns about the degree of fairness of machine learning models, well highlighted by recent instances of algorithmic unfairness, from automated decisions on criminal recidivism to disease prediction. Increased user awareness of algorithmic fairness is met with a deficiency in systems guiding data analysts and practitioners in comprehending the implications of their outputs. To tackle the challenge of fairness interpretability, we propose FairnessFriend, a chatbot solution that combines data science with a human-computer interaction perspective. Given a dataset and a trained machine learning model with established fairness metrics, our system facilitates users in understanding these metrics and their significance in the context of the training data. FairnessFriend provides meanings for various statistical fairness metrics, and presents the resulting metrics values with detailed explanations, offering specific insights into their implications.",

            "abstract": "In the healthcare field, the information created by digital technologies that collect clinical care notes, health service reports and patients\u2019 records, is generating terabytes of data, a great part of which is in textual format. These datasets may become an incredibly valuable asset only if the knowledge they carry is extracted using the appropriate artificial intelligence techniques, and specifically natural language processing (NLP) ones. Unfortunately, most existing tools support NLP for the English language, while local administrations and hospitals typically work in their native language, and therefore it becomes very important to have NLP tools to process biomedical data written also in these languages. Word embeddings are a popular and powerful NLP technique to extract semantics from textual data that could be very useful to solve the problem, but unfortunately for the Italian language there are no such tools specialized in the biomedical field. In this paper we propose BioVec-Ita, a new word embedding model for Italian, specialized in the biomedical field and designed using Word2vec, a flexible model for semantic representation that can be easily integrated with other pipelines. We also evaluate the performance of our word embeddings model in capturing the semantic similarities of biomedical terms, using three very popular test datasets translated into Italian.",

The ever-increasingnumberofconnecteddevicesisaccompaniedbyagrowthofthevolumeofdata, producedatanever-increasing rate, and this massive flow includes data types that are difficult to process using standard database techniques. One of the most critical scenarios is healthcare, whose activities need to store and manage a variety of data types \u2013 reports written in natural language, medical images, genomic data and waveforms of vital signs \u2013 which do not have a well-defined structure. In order to benefit from this large amount of complex data, Data Lakes have recently emerged as a solution to grant central storage and flexible analysis for all types of data. However, there is no Data Lake architecture that fits all the possible scenarios, since the architecture depends heavily on the application domain and, so far, there are no Data Lake architectures that support the specific needs of the healthcare domain. This work proposes HEALER: a Data Lake architecture that effectively performs data ingestion, data storage, and data access with the aim of providing a single central repository for efficient storage of different types of healthcare data. The architecture also enables the analysis and querying of the data, which can be loaded into the Data Lake regardless of their format and type. To verify the effectiveness of the architecture, a proof-of-concept of HEALER has been developed, that allows ingestion of various data, performs waveforms processing to make them more interpretable to researchers and analysts, grants access to the saved data and allows the analysis of natural language reports. Finally we studied the performance of the system in each of its main phases: ingestion, processing, data access and analysis. The results lead us to some important considerations to be taken into account when using and configuring the system components",

Cloud platforms are known to be affected by performance variability, but a better understanding is still required. This article moves in that direction and presents an in\u2010depth, multi\u2010faceted study on the performance variability of VMs. Unlike previous studies, our assessment covers a wide range of factors: 16 VM types from 4 well\u2010known cloud providers, 10 benchmarks, and 28 different metrics. We present four new contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite (VMBS) that let researchers and practitioners systematically collect a diverse set of performance data. Second, we present a new indicator, called VI, that allows for measuring variability in the performance of VMs. Third, we illustrate an analysis of the collected data across four different dimensions: resources, isolation, time, and cost. Fourth, we present multiple predictive models based on machine learning (ML) that aim to forecast future performance and detect time patterns. Our experiments provide important insights on the resource variability of VMs, highlighting differences and similarities between various cloud providers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the widest analysis ever conducted on the topic.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing availability of patients' data, modern medicine is shifting towards prospective healthcare. Electronic health records contain a variety of information useful for clinical patient description and can be exploited for the construction of predictive models, given that similar medical histories will likely lead to similar progressions. One example is unplanned hospital readmission prediction, an essential task for reducing hospital costs and improving patient health. Despite predictive models showing very good performances especially with deep-learning models, they are often criticized for the poor interpretability of their results, a fundamental characteristic in the medical field, where incorrect predictions might have serious consequences for the patient health. In this paper we propose a novel, interpretable deep-learning framework for predicting unplanned hospital readmissions, supported by NLP findings on word embeddings and by neural-network models (ConvLSTM) for better handling temporal data. We validate our system on the two predictive tasks of hospital readmission within 30 and 180 days, using real-world data. In addition, we introduce and test a model-dependent technique to make the representation of results easily interpretable by the medical staff. Our solution achieves better performances compared to traditional models based on machine learning, while providing at the same time more interpretable results.",

At the same time, concern is growing around word and sentence embeddings, popular language models that have been shown to exhibit large amount of social bias. In this work, by leveraging the possibility to further train state-of-the-art pre-trained embedding models, we propose to mitigate gender bias by fine-tuning sentence encoders on a semantic similarity task built around gender stereotype sentences and corresponding gender-swapped anti-stereotypes, in order to enforce similarity between the two categories. We test our intuition on two popular language models, BERT-Base and DistilBERT, and measure the amount of gender bias mitigation using the Sentence Encoder Association Test (SEAT). Our solution shows promising results despite using a small amount of training data, proving that post-processing bias mitigation techniques based on fine-tuning can effectively reduce gender bias in sentence encoders.",

Language models are used for a variety of tasks, such as parsing CVs or improving web search results.

Word embeddings in particular exhibit a large amount of gender bias, and they have been shown to reflect social stereotypes. Recently, sentence embeddings have been introduced as a novel and powerful technique to represent entire sentences as vectors. However, traditional methods for estimating gender bias cannot be applied to sentence representations, because gender-neutral entities cannot be easily identified and listed. We propose a new metric to estimate gender bias in sentence embeddings, named bias score. Our solution, leveraging the semantic importance of individual words and previous research on gender bias in word embeddings, is able to discern between correct and biased gender information at sentence level. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrates that our novel metric identifies gender stereotyped sentences.",

SoCRATe accommodates real users as well as simulated users to enable testing multiple recommendation choice models.
