            "title": "Breaking Filter Bubble: A Reinforcement Learning Framework of Controllable Recommender System",
            "abstract": "In the information-overloaded era of the Web, recommender systems that provide personalized content filtering are now the mainstream portal for users to access Web information. Recommender systems deploy machine learning models to learn users\u2019 preferences from collected historical data, leading to more centralized recommendation results due to the feedback loop. As a result, it will harm the ranking of content outside the narrowed scope and limit the options seen by users. In this work, we first conduct data analysis from a graph view to observe that the users\u2019 feedback is restricted to limited items, verifying the phenomenon of centralized recommendation. We further develop a general simulation framework to derive the procedure of the recommender system, including data collection, model learning, and item exposure, which forms a loop. To address the filter bubble issue under the feedback loop, we then propose a general and easy-to-use reinforcement learning-based method, which can adaptively select few but effective connections between nodes from different communities as the exposure list. We conduct extensive experiments in the simulation framework based on large-scale real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed reinforcement learning-based control method can serve as an effective solution to alleviate the filter bubble and the separated communities induced by it. We believe the proposed framework of controllable recommendation in this work can inspire not only the researchers of recommender systems, but also a broader community concerned with artificial intelligence algorithms\u2019 impact on humanity, especially for those vulnerable populations on the Web.",

            "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) seeks to learn robust models that generalize well under unknown distribution shifts. As a critical aspect of DG, optimizer selection has not been explored in depth. Currently, most DG methods follow the widely used benchmark, DomainBed, and utilize Adam as the default optimizer for all datasets. However, we reveal that Adam is not necessarily the optimal choice for the majority of current DG methods and datasets. Based on the perspective of loss landscape flatness, we propose a novel approach, Flatness-Aware Minimization for Domain Generalization (FAD), which can efficiently optimize both zeroth-order and first-order flatness simultaneously for DG. We provide theoretical analyses of the FAD\u2019s out-ofdistribution (OOD) generalization error and convergence. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FAD on various DG datasets.",

            "title": "Distilling Causal Metaknowledge from Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the explosive increase of information facilitates the massive knowledge graphs, which in turn increase burden of people to understand and leverage the regularity behind these superficial facts. Therefore, the metaknowledge, defined as the knowledge about knowledge, is proposed to identify complex processes of knowledge production and consumption. Unfortunately, even though the current correlation-based rule mining methods in knowledge graph distill the rule-formed metaknowledge, they can not explain the processes of knowledge production. In this paper, we focus on capturing the metaknowledge with causality which is generally regarded as one of the most promising techniques to reveal the interactions between components in the complex system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to interpret the knowledge graph from the causal perspective. For this purpose, we propose a causal metaknowledge method for link prediction, which achieves entity-level link prediction by discovering concept-level topological causality. Specifically, we first formalize causal metaknowledge as causal rule, following the form of logical rule. Then, we transform the relational data into propositional data to learn the causal relationships between topological structures. And an efficient algorithm for discovering local causal relationships is proposed using the d -seperation criterion. Eventually, the causal rules generated based on the mined relationships are used for link prediction. Both simulation-based and real data-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially under the Out-of-Distribution(OoD) settings.",

            "title": "Purify and Generate: Learning Faithful Item-to-Item Graph from Noisy User-Item Interaction Behaviors",
            "abstract": "Matching is almost the first and most fundamental step in recommender systems, that is to quickly select hundreds or thousands of related entities from the whole commodity pool. Among all the matching methods, item-to-item (I2I) graph based matching is a handy and highly effective approach and is widely used in most applications, owing to the essential relationships of entities described in a powerful I2I graph. Yet, the I2I graph is not a ready-made product in a data source. To obtain it from users' behaviors, a common practice in the industry is to construct the graph based on the similarity of item embeddings or co-occurrence frequency directly. However, these methods tend to lose the complicated correlations (high-ordered or nonlinear) inside decision-making actions and cannot achieve the global optimal solution. Moreover, the correlations between items are usually contained in users' short-term actions, which are full of noise information (e.g. spurious association, missing connection). It is vitally important to filter out noise while generating the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Purified Graph Generation (PGG) dedicated to learn faithful I2I graph from sparse and noisy behavior data. We capture the 'confidence value' between user and item to get rid of exception action during decision making, and leverage it to re-sample purified sets that are fed into an unsupervised I2I graph structure learning framework called GPBG. Extensive experimental results from both simulation and real data demonstrate that our method could significantly benefit the performance of I2I graph compared to the typical baselines.",
