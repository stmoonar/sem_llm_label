            "abstract": "Multi-types of user behavior data (e.g., clicking, adding to cart, and purchasing) are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios, which can help to learn users\u2019 multi-faceted preferences. However, it is challenging to explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas features\u201d and gradient conflict in multi-task learning when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d. In this paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d, we propose a Multi-Expert with Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for multi-task learning. Comprehensive experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CIGF.",

Crucial interactive patterns between users and items have been exploited, which brings compelling improvements in many recommendation tasks. In this paper, we attempt to provide a thorough survey of this research topic. We start by reviewing the research background of UBM. Then, we provide a systematic taxonomy of existing UBM research works, which can be categorized into four different directions including Conventional UBM, Long-Sequence UBM, Multi-Type UBM, and UBM with Side Information. Within each direction, representative models and their strengths and weaknesses are comprehensively discussed. Besides, we elaborate on the industrial practices of UBM methods with the hope of providing insights into the application value of existing UBM solutions.

            "abstract": "Building appropriate scenarios to meet the personalized demands of different user groups is a common practice. Despite various scenario brings personalized service, it also leads to challenges for the recommendation on multiple scenarios, especially the scenarios with limited traffic. To give desirable recommendation service for all scenarios and reduce the cost of resource consumption, how to leverage the information from multiple scenarios to construct a unified model becomes critical. Unfortunately, the performance of existing multi-scenario recommendation approaches is poor since they introduce unnecessary information from other scenarios to target scenario. In this paper, we show it is possible to selectively utilize the information from different scenarios to construct the scenario-aware estimators in a unified model. Specifically, we first do analysis on multi-scenario modeling with causal graph from the perspective of users and modeling processes, and then propose the Causal Inspired Intervention (CausalInt) framework for multi-scenario recommendation. CausalInt consists of three modules: (1) Invariant Representation Modeling module to squeeze out the scenario-aware information through disentangled representation learning and obtain a scenario-invariant representation; (2) Negative Effects Mitigating module to resolve conflicts between different scenarios and conflicts between scenario-specific and scenario-invariant representations via gradient based orthogonal regularization and model-agnostic meta learning, respectively; (3) Inter-Scenario Transferring module designs a novel TransNet to simulate a counterfactual intervention and effectively fuse the information from other scenarios. Offline experiments over two real-world dataset and online A/B test are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of CausalInt.",

            "abstract": "Numerical features (e.g., statistical features) are widely used in recommender systems and online advertising. Existing approaches for numerical feature representation in industry are primarily based on discretization. However, hard-discretization based methods (e.g., Equal Distance Discretization) are deficient in continuity while soft-discretization based methods (e.g., AutoDis) lack discriminability. To emphasize both continuity and discriminability for numerical features, we propose an end-to-end representation learning framework named NaryDis. Specifically, NaryDis first leverages hybrid n-ary encoding as an automatic discretization module to generate hybrid-grained discretization results (multiple encoded sequences). Each position of the encoded sequence is assigned with a positional embedding and an intra-ary attention network is leveraged to aggregate the positional embeddings for obtaining ary-wise representations. Then an inter-ary attention is adopted to assemble these representations, which are further constrained by a self-supervised regularization module. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets are conducted to show the superiority and compatibility of NaryDis. Besides, we deeply investigate the properties of continuity and discriminability. Moreover, we further verify the effectiveness of NaryDis on a large-scale industrial advertisement dataset.",

            "abstract": "Online education, which educates students that cannot be present at school, has become an important supplement to traditional education. Without the direct supervision and instruction of teachers, online education is always concerned with potential distractions and misunderstandings. Learning Style Classification (LSC) is proposed to analyze the learning behavior patterns of online learning users, based on which personalized learning paths are generated to help them learn and maintain their interests. Existing LSC studies rely on expert-labored labeling, which is infeasible in large-scale applications, so we resort to unsupervised classification techniques. However, current unsupervised classification methods are not applicable due to two important challenges: C1) the unawareness of the LSC problem formulation and pedagogy domain knowledge; C2) the absence of any supervision signals. In this paper, we give a formal definition of the unsupervised LSC problem and summarize the domain knowledge into problem-solving heuristics (which addresses C1). A rule-based approach is first designed to provide a tentative solution in a principled manner (which addresses C2). On top of that, a novel Deep Unsupervised Classifier with domain Knowledge (DUCK) is proposed to convert the discovered conclusions and domain knowledge into learnable model components (which addresses both C1 and C2), which significantly improves the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Extensive offline experiments on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. Moreover, the proposed methods are now deployed in the Huawei Education Center, and the ongoing A/B testing results verify the effectiveness of the methods.",

            "abstract": "In most real-world recommender systems, users interact with items in a sequential and multi-behavioral manner. Exploring the fine-grained relationship of items behind the users' multi-behavior interactions is critical in improving the performance of recommender systems. Despite the great successes, existing methods seem to have limitations on modelling heterogeneous item-level multi-behavior dependencies, capturing diverse multi-behavior sequential dynamics, or alleviating data sparsity problems. In this paper, we show it is possible to derive a framework to address all the above three limitations. The proposed framework MB-STR, a Multi-Behavior Sequential Transformer Recommender, is equipped with the multi-behavior transformer layer (MB-Trans), the multi-behavior sequential pattern generator (MB-SPG) and the behavior-aware prediction module (BA-Pred). Compared with a typical transformer, we design MB-Trans to capture multi-behavior heterogeneous dependencies as well as behavior-specific semantics, propose MB-SPG to encode the diverse sequential patterns among multiple behaviors, and incorporate BA-Pred to better leverage multi-behavior supervision. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MB-STR by significantly boosting the recommendation performance compared with various competitive baselines. Further ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of different modules of MB-STR.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) is an essential task in online education, which dynamically assesses students\u2019 mastery of concepts by predicting the probability that they correctly answer questions. One of the most effective solutions for knowledge tracing is graph-based methods. They maintain multiple vectors to represent students\u2019 mastery of concepts, and use these vectors to predict the probability of students correctly answering questions. To give more accurate predictions, the graph-based methods require concept relations to update these vectors once students answer questions. However, the concept relations usually require manual annotation in a real-world scenario, limiting the application of the graph-based method. In this paper, we proposed a method called Automatical Graph-based Knowledge Tracing (AGKT), which is a graph-based method that updates these vectors without requiring manually annotated concept relations. We evaluate our method on four public datasets and compare it with ten advanced methods. The experiment results demonstrate that AGKT yields superior performance.",

            "title": "Disentangling Past-Future Modeling in Sequential Recommendation via Dual Networks",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) plays an important role in personalized recommender systems because it captures dynamic and diverse preferences from users' real-time increasing behaviors. Unlike the standard autoregressive training strategy, future data (also available during training) has been used to facilitate model training as it provides richer signals about users' current interests and can be used to improve the recommendation quality. However, existing methods suffer from a severe training-inference gap, i.e., both past and future contexts are modeled by the same encoder when training, while only historical behaviors are available during inference. This discrepancy leads to potential performance degradation. To alleviate the training-inference gap, we propose a new framework DualRec, which achieves past-future disentanglement and past-future mutual enhancement by a novel dual network. Specifically, a dual network structure is exploited to model the past and future context separately.And a bi-directional knowledge transferring mechanism enhances the knowledge learnt by the dual network. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over baseline methods. Besides, we demonstrate the compatibility of DualRec by instantiating using different backbones. Further empirical analysis verifies the high utility of modeling future contexts under our DualRec framework.",
