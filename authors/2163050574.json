            "title": "SEdb 2.0: a comprehensive super-enhancer database of human and mouse",
            "abstract": "Abstract Super-enhancers (SEs) are cell-specific DNA cis-regulatory elements that can supervise the transcriptional regulation processes of downstream genes. SEdb 2.0 (http://www.licpathway.net/sedb) aims to provide a comprehensive SE resource and annotate their potential roles in gene transcriptions. Compared with SEdb 1.0, we have made the following improvements: (i) Newly added the mouse SEs and expanded the scale of human SEs. SEdb 2.0 contained 1 167 518 SEs from 1739 human H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) samples and 550 226 SEs from 931 mouse H3K27ac ChIP-seq samples, which was five times that of SEdb 1.0. (ii) Newly added transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in SEs identified by TF motifs and TF ChIP-seq data. (iii) Added comprehensive (epi)genetic annotations of SEs, including chromatin accessibility regions, methylation sites, chromatin interaction regions and topologically associating domains (TADs). (iv) Newly embedded and updated search and analysis tools, including \u2018Search SE by TF-based\u2019, \u2018Differential-Overlapping-SE analysis\u2019 and \u2018SE-based TF\u2013Gene analysis\u2019. (v) Newly provided quality control (QC) metrics for ChIP-seq processing. In summary, SEdb 2.0 is a comprehensive update of SEdb 1.0, which curates more SEs and annotation information than SEdb 1.0. SEdb 2.0 provides a friendly platform for researchers to more comprehensively clarify the important role of SEs in the biological process.",

            "abstract": "As the final stage of the multi-stage recommender system (MRS), reranking directly affects users' experience and satisfaction, thus playing a critical role in MRS. Despite the improvement achieved in the existing work, three issues are yet to be solved. First, users' historical behaviors contain rich preference information, such as users' long and short-term interests, but are not fully exploited in reranking. Previous work typically treats items in history equally important, neglecting the dynamic interaction between the history and candidate items. Second, existing reranking models focus on learning interactions at the item level while ignoring the fine-grained feature-level interactions. Lastly, estimating the reranking score on the ordered initial list before reranking may lead to the early scoring problem, thereby yielding suboptimal reranking performance. To address the above issues, we propose a framework named Multi-level Interaction Reranking (MIR). MIR combines low-level cross-item interaction and high-level set-to-list interaction, where we view the candidate items to be reranked as a set and the users' behavior history in chronological order as a list. We design a novel SLAttention structure for modeling the set-to-list interactions with personalized long-short term interests. Moreover, feature-level interactions are incorporated to capture the fine-grained influence among items. We design MIR in such a way that any permutation of the input items would not change the output ranking, and we theoretically prove it. Extensive experiments on three public and proprietary datasets show that MIR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models using various ranking and utility metrics.",

            "abstract": "Prediction over tabular data is an essential and fundamental problem in many important downstream tasks. However, existing methods either take a data instance of the table independently as input or do not fully utilize the multi-rows features and labels to directly change and enhance the target data representations. In this paper, we propose to 1) construct a hypergraph from relevant data instance retrieval to model the cross-row and cross-column patterns of those instances, and 2) perform message Propagation to Enhance the target data instance representation for Tabular prediction tasks. Specifically, our specially-designed message propagation step benefits from 1) fusion of label and features during propagation, and 2) locality-aware high-order feature interactions. Experiments on two important tabular data prediction tasks validate the superiority of the proposed PET model against other baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model components and the feature enhancement ability of PET via various ablation studies and visualizations.

            "abstract": "Abstract Chromatin regulators (CRs) regulate epigenetic patterns on a partial or global scale, playing a critical role in affecting multi-target gene expression. As chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data associated with CRs are rapidly accumulating, a comprehensive resource of CRs needs to be built urgently for collecting, integrating, and processing these data, which can provide abundant annotated information on CR upstream and downstream regulatory analyses as well as CR-related analysis functions. This study established an integrative CR resource, named CRdb (http://cr.liclab.net/crdb/), with the aim of curating a large number of available resources for CRs and providing extensive annotations and analyses of CRs to help biological researchers clarify the regulation mechanism and function of CRs. The CRdb database comprised a total of 647 CRs and 2,591 ChIP-seq samples from more than 300 human tissues and cell types. These samples have been manually curated from NCBI GEO/SRA and ENCODE. Importantly, CRdb provided the abundant and detailed genetic annotations in CR-binding regions based on ChIP-seq. Furthermore, CRdb supported various functional annotations and upstream regulatory information on CRs. In particular, it embedded four types of CR regulatory analyses: CR gene set enrichment, CR-binding genomic region annotation, CR-TF co-occupancy analysis, and CR regulatory axis analysis. CRdb is a useful and powerful resource that can help in exploring the potential functions of CRs and their regulatory mechanism in diseases and biological processes.",

With the rapid accumulation of TcoF associated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, the comprehensive collection and integrative analyses of these data are urgently required. Here, we developed the TcoFBase database (http://tcof.liclab.net/TcoFbase), which aimed to document a large number of available resources for mammalian TcoFs and provided annotations and enrichment analyses of TcoFs. TcoFBase curated 2322 TcoFs and 6759 TcoFs associated ChIP-seq data from over 500 tissues/cell types in human and mouse. Importantly, TcoFBase provided detailed and abundant (epi) genetic annotations of ChIP-seq based TcoF binding regions. Furthermore, TcoFBase supported regulatory annotation information and various functional annotations for TcoFs. Meanwhile, TcoFBase embedded five types of TcoF regulatory analyses for users, including TcoF gene set enrichment, TcoF binding genomic region annotation, TcoF regulatory network analysis, TcoF-TF co-occupancy analysis and TcoF regulatory axis analysis. TcoFBase was designed to be a useful resource that will help reveal the potential biological effects of TcoFs and elucidate TcoF-related regulatory mechanisms.",
