            "title": "Iterative Successive Nonlinear Self-Interference Cancellation for In-Band Full-Duplex Communications",
            "abstract": "In-band full-duplex (IBFD) communications have recently been considered for wireless backhaul in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band terrestrial broadcast systems since they can double the spectral efficiency compared to conventional half-duplex communications. The inherent challenge of IBFD communication is self-interference (SI), the power leakage from the co-located transmitter to the receiver. For wireless backhaul among transmitter towers, it\u2019s desirable to employ high-order modulation, e.g., 1024QAM or 4096QAM, for higher spectral efficiency. Furthermore, the transmitter emission power is much higher in low radio frequency (RF) bands. Due to the nonlinearity of the transmitter high-power amplifier (HPA), the nonlinear distorted SI becomes a performance-limiting impairment and must be effectively mitigated. Moreover, the SI channel exhibits a large multipath delay spread in these applications, especially in UHF-band terrestrial broadcasting systems where the transmission frequency is lower and the antenna directivity is limited. In this paper, a novel iterative successive nonlinear SI cancellation scheme, based on the previously proposed frequency-domain RF self-interference cancellation (RF-SIC) technique, is presented. The baseline RF-SIC is capable of cancelling SI with a large multipath delay spread. However, the RF-SIC performance is limited by the presence of the remote signal of interest (SOI) in the received signal. This SOI presence, referred to as \u201cintrinsic noise\u201d in the SI channel estimation process, occurs due to foregoing the training phase requirement. The proposed approach in this paper iteratively cancels the \u201cintrinsic noise\u201d and can suppress the nonlinear SI to the receiver noise floor. The proposed technique can be applied to 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) technology to make it more feasible for deployment at the lower frequency band.",

            "abstract": "We study the distributed multi-robot navigation problem, which refers to a group of mobile robots avoiding collision with each other while navigating from their start positions to the goal positions. Existing works still suffer from two limitations: 1) accurately quantify the risk of collisions for heterogeneous robots and 2) effectively capture the state representation under dynamic environments. These limitations make the heterogeneous robots prone to collisions in high-density and dynamic environments. This work proposes a new time-to-collision force (TTC-force) reward shaping approach, termed Tfresh , incorporating reinforcement learning to learn a policy that adaptively chooses the optimal actions to mitigate the imminent collision. Specifically, we use TTC-force to quantify the risk of each robot exerted by its neighbors and shape the reward signal with TTC-force in applying the reinforcement learning scheme. Meanwhile, we design the spatial attention mechanism involving the dynamic adjacent matrix to capture the state representation effectively. We evaluate the learned policy in numerous simulated scenarios in which groups of mobile robots perform navigation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach out-performs the state-of-the-art methods regarding success rate, travel distance, and travel time.",

We consider learning view-invariant and detection-oriented representations simultaneously through two complementary tasks, i.e., localization and discrimination, in a novel multi-view learning framework. Two self-supervised pretext tasks are designed: (i) Multi-View Region Detection aims at learning to localize regions-of-interest between augmented views of the input, and (ii) Multi-View Semantic Discrimination attempts to improve object-level discrimination for each region.

            "title": "EMO2-DETR: Efficient-Matching Oriented Object Detection With Transformers",
            "abstract": "Object detection in remote sensing is a challenging task due to the arbitrary orientations of objects and the vast variation in the number of objects within a single image. For instance, one image may contain hundreds of small vehicles, while another may only have a single football field. Recently, DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and its variants have achieved great success in object detection by setting a fixed number of object queries and using bipartite graph matching for one-to-one label assignment. However, we have observed that bipartite graph matching can result in relative redundancy of object queries when the number of objects changes dramatically in an image. This relative redundancy can cause two problems: slower convergence during training and redundant bounding boxes during inference. To analyze the aforementioned problems, we proposed a metric, redundancy of object query (ROQ), to quantitatively analyze the redundancy. Through experiments, we discovered that the reason for the two issues is the difficulty in distinguishing between high-quality negative samples and positive samples. In this article, we proposed efficient-matching oriented object detection with transformers (EMO2-DETR) consisting of three dedicated components to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, reassign bipartite graph matching (RBGM) is proposed to extract high-quality negative samples from the negative samples. And ignored sample predicted head (ISPH) is proposed to predict high-quality negative samples. Then, reassigned Hungarian loss is used to better involve high-quality negative samples in the update of model parameters. Extensive experiments on DOTAv1 and DOTAv1.5 datasets demonstrated that our proposed method achieves the competitive results.",

            "title": "Implementation of Wireless Backhaul and Inter-Tower Communications With MIMO in ATSC 3.0",
            "abstract": "Wireless backhaul, i.e., in-band distribution links (IDL) and inter-tower communications networks (ITCN) were previously proposed as key enabling technologies for the next-generation digital broadcasting systems, e.g., the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) 3.0 system. Both ITCN/IDL can be operated in the spectrum-efficient in-band full-duplex (IBFD) mode and the same frequency band is shared between the broadcast service signal and the ITCN/IDL signals. It is desirable to integrate multi-input multi-output (MIMO) into ITCN/IDL transmission to increase the throughput and reduce the portion of spectrum occupation by ITCN/IDL. However, due to the backward compatibility constraint, conventional symmetrical MIMO techniques cannot be applied directly to the existing broadcast infrastructure without affecting legacy receivers. In this paper, the practical implementation of a non-symmetrical MIMO for ITCN/IDL while maintaining backward compatibility is considered. In addition to the existing broadcasting antenna, the non-symmetrical MIMO comprises an additional low-power RF feeder cable and one or more highly directional antennas to achieve low-cost MIMO implementation for high throughput data distribution and inter-tower communications. When the broadcast service signal and the MIMO signal are multiplexed in Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) format, the signal structure is ATSC 3.0 standard compliant. When the broadcast service signal and the MIMO signal are multiplexed in Layer Division Multiplexing (LDM) format, modification of the ATSC 3.0 standard, i.e., introducing a new pilot encoding scheme, is required. Moreover, MIMO self-interference cancellation (SIC) is investigated for IBFD operation.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection, which is aimed at distinguishing anomaly pixels from the surroundings in spatial features and spectral characteristics, has attracted considerable attention due to its various applications. In this article, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm based on adaptive low-rank transform, in which the input hyperspectral image (HSI) is divided into a background tensor, an anomaly tensor, and a noise tensor. To take full advantage of the spatial\u2013spectral information, the background tensor is represented as the product of a transformed tensor and a low-rank matrix. The low-rank constraint is imposed on frontal slices of the transformed tensor to depict the spatial\u2013spectral correlation of the HSI background. Besides, we initialize a matrix with predefined size and then minimize its $l_{2.1}$ -norm to adaptively derive an appropriate low-rank matrix. The anomaly tensor is constrained with the $l_{2.1.1}$ -norm to depict the group sparsity of anomalous pixels. We integrate all regularization terms and a fidelity term into a non-convex problem and develop a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm to solve it. Interestingly, the sequence generated by the PAM algorithm is proven to converge to a critical point. Experimental results conducted on four widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed anomaly detector over several state-of-the-art methods.",

The wealthy spectral information provides potentially powerful identification ability when combining with advanced convolutional neural network (CNN). However, for high-dimensional MHSI, the local connection of CNN makes it difficult to extract the long-range dependencies of spectral bands. Transformer overcomes this problem well because of its self-attention mechanism. Nevertheless, transformer is inferior to CNN in extracting spatial detailed features. Therefore, a classification framework integrating transformer and CNN in parallel, named as Fusion Transformer (FUST), is proposed for MHSI classification tasks. Specifically, the transformer branch is employed to extract the overall semantics and capture the long-range dependencies of spectral bands to highlight the key spectral information. The parallel CNN branch is designed to extract significant multiscale spatial features. Furthermore, the feature fusion module is developed to effectively fuse and process the features extracted by the two branches. Experimental results on three MHSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed FUST achieves superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted increasing attention in the field of multimodal cooperation. Recently, the adoption of CNN-based methods has achieved remarkable performance in multisource remote sensing data classification. However, it is still confronted with challenges in the aspect of complementarity extraction. In this article, the adversarial complementary learning (ACL) strategy is embedded into the CNN model called ACL-CNN, which is employed to extract the complementary information of the multisource data. The proposed ACL-CNN is able to filter out the common patterns and specific patterns from multisource data by conducting the adversarial max\u2013min game. Especially, the modality-independent common patterns constitute the basic representation of the land covers, while the specific patterns are linearly independent of the common patterns that provide the supplementary representation. Therefore, the complementary information is mapped to a compact and discriminative representation. To eliminate the singularity noise, a learnable pattern sampling module (PSM) is designed to extract the mutual-exclusion relationship between specific patterns. Extensive experiments over three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ACL-CNN compared with several classification technologies.",

            "abstract": "Currently, the use of rich spectral and spatial information of hyperspectral images (HSIs) to classify ground objects is a research hotspot. However, the classification ability of existing models is significantly affected by its high data dimensionality and massive information redundancy. Therefore, we focus on the elimination of redundant information and the mining of promising features and propose a novel Bole convolution (BC) neural network with a tandem three-direction attention (TDA) mechanism (BTA-Net) for the classification of HSI. A new BC is proposed for the first time in this algorithm, whose core idea is to enhance effective features and eliminate redundant features through feature punishment and reward strategies. Considering that traditional attention mechanisms often assign weights in a one-direction manner, leading to a loss of the relationship between the spectra, a novel three-direction (horizontal, vertical, and spatial directions) attention mechanism is proposed, and an addition strategy and a maximization strategy are used to jointly assign weights to improve the context sensitivity of spatial\u2013spectral features. In addition, we also designed a tandem TDA mechanism module and combined it with a multiscale BC output to improve classification accuracy and stability even when training samples are small and unbalanced. We conducted scene classification experiments on four commonly used hyperspectral datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. The proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance on small samples and unbalanced data, according to the results of comparison and ablation experiments.

            "title": "SiamBAG: Band Attention Grouping-Based Siamese Object Tracking Network for Hyperspectral Videos",
            "abstract": "A hyperspectral video contains frames with numerous spectral bands, providing fine reflectance information for object identification and tracking. Enriched features can be learned from spectral\u2013spatial data using deep learning models. However, due to the difficulty in hyperspectral video collection, deep model training is often insufficient, causing reduced performance during the testing stage. To address this issue, we present a novel band attention grouping-based Siamese framework (SiamBAG) for hyperspectral object tracking. SiamBAG uses massive color object tracking data to train a deep neural network. Band weights obtained by the band attention module are used to group a hyperspectral image (HSI) into multiple three-channel false-color images with approximate total group weights. Then multiple enhanced images obtained by histogram equalization are fed to the proposed SiamBAG network to generate a classification branch, a regression branch, and a scale-tuning branch. In the classification branch, the response maps of multiple groups are fused by regularized group weights to estimate the position of objects. Then the regression branch is used to obtain the initial object position of objects. The position offsets are fed back to the scale tune branch to relocate and fine-tune the object position by exploiting the similarity between template features and detection features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves superior tracking performance than other methods. The source codes of this article will be released at https://github.com/zephyrhours/Hyperspectral-Object-Tracking-SiamBAG.",
