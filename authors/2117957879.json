            "abstract": "In this article, we describe a general methodology for enhancing sensing accuracy in cyber-physical systems that involve structured human interactions in noisy physical environment. We define structured human interactions as domain-specific workflow. A novel workflow-aware sensing model is proposed to jointly correct unreliable sensor data and keep track of states in a workflow. We also propose a new inference algorithm to handle cases with partially known states and objects as supervision. Our model is evaluated with extensive simulations. As a concrete application, we develop a novel log service called Emergency Transcriber, which can automatically document operational procedures followed by teams of first responders in emergency response scenarios. Evaluation shows that our system has significant improvement over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors and keeps track of workflow states with high accuracy in noisy physical environment.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a general methodology for enhancing measurement accuracy in cyber-physical systems that involve structured human interactions with a noisy physical environment. We define structured human interactions as those that follow a domain-specific workflow. The idea of the paper is simple: we exploit knowledge of the workflow to correct unreliable sensor data. The intellectual contribution lies in an algorithm for joint estimation of the current state of the workflow together with correction of noisy sensor measurements, given only the noisy measurements and an overall workflow description. We demonstrate through simulations and a physical implementation the degree to which knowledge of workflow can increase sensing accuracy. As a specific instantiation of this idea, we present a novel situation-awareness tool called the Emergency Transcriber designed to automatically document operational procedures followed by teams of first responders in emergency-response scenarios. Evaluation shows that our system provides a significant fidelity enhancement over the state of the art, effectively coping with the noisy environment of emergency teams.",

            "abstract": "Federated coalition networks are formed by interconnected nodes belonging to different friendly-but-curious parties cooperating for common objectives. Each party has its policy regarding what information may be accessed by which other parties. Data delivery in coalition networks must provide both confidentiality and robustness. First, data should remain confidential when passing through intermediate nodes belonging to parties not authorized to see its content. Second, data delivery has to be robust against dynamic topology changes caused by frequent node churn and failures. We utilize the technique of linear network coding to transform the original data into multiple coded packets and send them along different paths in a way such that no other party can reconstruct the data. This lightweight approach provides confidentiality and robustness for friendly-but-curious coalitions with much less complexity than cryptography methods. In addition, we formulate an optimization problem to find minimum-cost paths, and use column generation framework to address the huge number of variables. Based on the proposed algorithms, we develop a Robust Confidentiality Preserving (R-CP) data delivery protocol. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can find the optimum solution in several seconds for networks of a few thousands nodes, and deliver data at a high success rate.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we analyze and study the impact of cloudlets in interactive mobile cloud applications. To study the impact we propose the design of cloudlet network and service architectures. Our study focuses on file editing, video streaming and collaborative chatting which are representative enterprise application scenarios. Initial simulation results show the performance gains of using cloudlets over using clouds in terms of data transfer delay and system throughput. When not more than two cloudlet wireless hops are used to transfer data, the cloudlet-based approach outperforms the cloud-based approach for all three application scenarios. With more cloudlet wireless hops under mobility, the cloud-based approach can give a better performance for some of the data transfers even though the cloudlet-based can outperform the cloud-based approach for most of the flows. In such scenarios, we suggest that an adaptive scheme should be used. For example, a scheme making an intelligent decision on either the cloudlet network or the cloud network, whichever gives minimum delay, can be used.",
