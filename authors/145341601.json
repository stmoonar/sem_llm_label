            "title": "PSI/J: A Portable Interface for Submitting, Monitoring, and Managing Jobs",
            "abstract": "It is generally desirable for high-performance computing (HPC) applications to be portable between HPC systems, for example to make use of more performant hardware, make effective use of allocations, and to co-locate compute jobs with large datasets. Unfortunately, moving scientific applications between HPC systems is challenging for various reasons, most notably that HPC systems have different HPC schedulers. We introduce PSI/J, a job management abstraction API intended to simplify the construction of software components and applications that are portable over various HPC scheduler implementations. We argue that such a system is both necessary and that no viable alternative currently exists. We analyze similar notable APIs and attempt to determine the factors that influenced their evolution and adoption by the HPC community. We base the design of PSI/J on that analysis. We describe how PSI/J has been integrated in three workflow systems and one application, and also show via experiments that PSI/J imposes minimal overhead.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of vast amounts of data and the processing of complex computational jobs have traditionally relied upon high performance computing (HPC) systems, which offer reliable and efficient management of large-scale computational and data resources. Understanding these analyses\u2019 needs is paramount for designing solutions that can lead to better science, and similarly, understanding the characteristics of the user behavior on those systems is important for improving user experiences on HPC systems. A common approach to gathering data about user behavior is to extract workload characteristics from system log data available only to system administrators. Recently at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), however, we unveiled user behavior about the Summit supercomputer by collecting data from a user\u2019s point of view with ordinary Unix commands.In this paper, we discuss the process, challenges, and lessons learned while preparing this dataset for publication and submission to an open data challenge. The original dataset contains personal identifiable information (PII) about the users of OLCF which needed be masked prior to publication, and we determined that anonymization, which scrubs PII completely, destroyed too much of the structure of the data to be interesting for the data challenge. We instead chose to pseudonymize the dataset, which reduced the linkability of the dataset to the users\u2019 identities. Pseudonymization is significantly more computationally expensive than anonymization, and the size of our dataset, which is approximately 175 million lines of raw text, necessitated the development of a parallelized workflow that could be reused on different HPC machines. We demonstrate the scaling behavior of the workflow on two leadership class HPC systems at OLCF, and we show that we were able to bring the overall makespan time from an impractical 20+ hours on a single node down to around 2 hours. As a result of this work, we release the entire pseudonymized dataset and make the workflows and source code publicly available.",

To handle the deployment, monitoring, and optimization of workflow executions, many workflow systems have been developed over the past decade. There is a need for workflow benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the performance of workflow systems on current and future software stacks and hardware platforms.We present a generator of realistic workflow benchmark specifications that can be translated into benchmark code to be executed with current workflow systems. Our approach generates workflow tasks with arbitrary performance characteristics (CPU, memory, and I/O usage) and with realistic task dependency structures based on those seen in production workflows. We present experimental results that show that our approach generates benchmarks that are representative of production workflows, and conduct a case study to demonstrate the use and usefulness of our generated benchmarks to evaluate the performance of workflow systems under different configuration scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Bringing the Scientific Workflows Community Together",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains, and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. These executions must be managed using some software infrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for creating and executing workflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. While these efforts are all worthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, many of which are moribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large, still elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or build upon, existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively impacts workflow users, developers, and researchers. The\"Workflows Community Summit\"was held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to stakeholders in the workflow community (including both developers of WMSs and users of workflows) helped to identify key challenges in this community that were translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them being the object of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community. This report documents and organizes the wealth of information provided by the participants before, during, and after the summit.",

We offer recommendations for deploying and scaling DL frameworks on the Summit supercomputer, currently atop the Top500 list, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We discuss DL software deployment in the form of containers, and compare performance of native-built frameworks and containerized deployment. Software containers show no noticeable negative performance impact and exhibit faster Python loading times and promise easier maintenance. To explore strategies for scaling up DL model training campaigns, we assess DL compute kernel performance, discuss and recommend I/O data formats and staging, and identify communication needs for scalable message exchange for DL runs at scale. We recommend that users take a step-wise tuning approach beginning with algorithmic kernel choice, node I/O configuration, and communications tuning as best-practice. We present baseline examples of scaling efficiency 87% for a DL run of ResNet50 running on 1024 nodes (6144 V100 GPUs).",

            "abstract": "New techniques and technologies, such as the use of large-scale computing, influence research approaches, methods, and scales and are rapidly changing the scientific landscape. Research projects in eScience thus start with many assumptions and many unknowns and are often complex. While the scientific process is sometimes viewed, at least in hindsight, as a linear progression from one good idea to the next, it is in fact fraught with false starts, wrong assumptions, and dead ends. The increasing reliance on computation adds to the scope of problems that occur. Researchers invest a significant amount of time and effort in their research. Funding agencies similarly make large investments to support such research, on the assumption that most of the research will be successful. When the research assumptions and hypotheses turn out to be false, causing results that are \u201cnegative\u201d or \u201cnull\u201d, the natural bias is to judge that the research project \u201cfailed.\u201d The history of science, however, shows that negative results may be an opportunity to revolutionize a field of study. For example, Fleming noticed that his flu cultures were contaminated by mold, but that there was infection around that mold, leading to his discovery of Penicillin. Similarly, a project today may fail because of the misuse or failure of computational support. Such \u201cfailures\u201d actually indicate that there is an opportunity for the cyberinfrastructure research community to improve computing resources and tools. The interaction of these modes of failure is multi-faceted. Negative results have been difficult to find in published papers in all scientific domains. We identify three reasons for this. First, negative results may not be identified as such but simply considered mistakes. Such cases may never be investigated further. Secondly, paper referees may demand a higher standard from such results, because they are more difficult to understand or challenge the conventional narrative. Third, researchers may self-select against publishing such results in light of the previous point. Our experience with and observations of numerous projects in the area of eScience inspired us to create a workshop as a forum to initiate the discussion of negative and null results in the context of eScience (Section 4). Our effort attempts to systematically approach problems voiced in the popular media [1, 2] about the importance of negative results. This paper encapsulates the topics presented and lessons learned at this workshop, including efforts to:",

            "abstract": "Commercial clouds bring a great opportunity to the scientific computing area. Scientific applications usually require significant resources, however not all scientists have access to sufficient high-end computing systems. Cloud computing has gained the attention of scientists as a competitive resource to run HPC applications at a potentially lower cost. But as a different infrastructure, it is unclear whether clouds are capable of running scientific applications with a reasonable performance per money spent. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of EC2 cloud in different aspects. We first analyze the potentials of the cloud by evaluating the raw performance of different services of AWS such as compute, memory, network and I/O. Based on the findings on the raw performance, we then evaluate the performance of the scientific applications running in the cloud. Finally, we compare the performance of AWS with a private cloud, in order to find the root cause of its limitations while running scientific applications. This paper aims to assess the ability of the cloud to perform well, as well as to evaluate the cost of the cloud in terms of both raw performance and scientific applications performance. Furthermore, we evaluate other services including S3, EBS and DynamoDB among many AWS services in order to assess the abilities of those to be used by scientific applications and frameworks. We also evaluate a real scientific computing application through the Swift parallel scripting system at scale. Armed with both detailed benchmarks to gauge expected performance and a detailed monetary cost analysis, we expect this paper will be a recipe cookbook for scientists to help them decide where to deploy and run their scientific applications between public clouds, private clouds, or hybrid clouds.",

            "abstract": "Scripting languages such as Python and R have been widely adopted as tools for the productive development of scientific software because of the power and expressiveness of the languages and available libraries. However, deploying scripted applications on large-scale parallel computer systems such as the IBM Blue Gene/Q or Cray XE6 is a challenge because of issues including operating system limitations, interoperability challenges, parallel filesystem overheads due to the small file system accesses common in scripted approaches, and other issues. We present here a new approach to these problems in which the Swift scripting system is used to integrate high-level scripts written in Python, R, and Tcl, with native code developed in C, C++, and Fortran, by linking Swift to the library interfaces to the script interpreters. In this approach, Swift handles data management, movement, and marshaling among distributed-memory processes without direct user manipulation of low-level communication libraries such as MPI. We present a technique to efficiently launch scripted applications on large-scale supercomputers using a hierarchical programming model.",
