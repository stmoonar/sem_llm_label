            "title": "TaskVine: Managing In-Cluster Storage for High-Throughput Data Intensive Workflows",
            "abstract": "Many scientific applications are expressed as high-throughput workflows that consist of large graphs of data assets and tasks to be executed on large parallel and distributed systems. A challenge in executing these workflows is managing data: both datasets and software must be efficiently distributed to cluster nodes; intermediate data must be conveyed between tasks; output data must be delivered to its destination. Scaling problems result when these actions are performed in an uncoordinated manner on a shared filesystem. To address this problem, we introduce TaskVine: a system for exploiting the aggregate local storage and network capacity of a large cluster. TaskVine tracks the lifetime of data in a workflow \u2013from archival sources to final outputs\u2013 making use of local storage to distribute, and re-use data wherever possible. We describe the architecture and novel capabilities of TaskVine, and demonstrate its use with applications in genomics, high energy physics, molecular dynamics, and machine learning.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Distributed data analysis frameworks are widely used for processing large datasets generated by instruments in scientific fields such as astronomy, genomics, and particle physics. Such frameworks partition petabyte-size datasets into chunks and execute many parallel tasks to search for common patterns, locate unusual signals, or compute aggregate properties. When well-configured, such frameworks make it easy to churn through large quantities of data on large clusters. However, configuring frameworks presents a challenge for end users, who must select a variety of parameters such as the blocking of the input data, the number of tasks, the resources allocated to each task, and the size of nodes on which they run. If poorly configured, the result may perform many orders of magnitude worse than optimal, or the application may even fail to make progress at all. Even if a good configuration is found through painstaking observations, the performance may change drastically when the input data or analysis kernel changes. This paper considers the problem of automatically configuring a data analysis application for high energy physics (TopEFT) built upon standard frameworks for physics analysis (Coffea) and distributed tasking (Work Queue). We observe the inherent variability within the application, demonstrate the problems of poor configuration, and then develop several techniques for automatically sizing tasks to meet goals of resource consumption, and overall application completion.",

            "abstract": "An increasing number of distributed applications operate by dispatching function invocations across the nodes of a distributed system. To operate correctly, the code and data dependencies of the function must be distributed along with the invocations in some way. When translating applications to work on large scale distributed systems, managing these dependencies becomes challenging: delivery must be scalable to thousands of nodes; the dependencies must be consistent across the system; and the method must be usable by an unprivileged developer. As a solution, in this paper we present PONCHO, which is a lightweight Python based toolkit which allows users to discover, package, and deploy dependencies as an integral part of distributed applications. PONCHO encapsulates a set of commands to be executed within an environment. PONCHO offers a lightweight solution to create and manage environments increasing the portability of scientific applications as well as reproducibility. In this paper, we evaluate PONCHO with real-world applications in the fields of physics, computational chemistry, and hyperparameter optimization, We observe the challenges that arise when creating and distributing an environment and measure the overheads that emerge as a result.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.

            "abstract": "Python has become a widely used programming language for research, not only for small one-off analyses, but also for complex application pipelines running at supercomputer-scale. Modern parallel programming frameworks for Python present users with a more granular unit of management than traditional Unix processes and batch submissions: the Python function. We review the challenges involved in running native Python functions at scale, and present techniques for dynamically determining a minimal set of dependencies and for assembling a lightweight function monitor (LFM) that captures the software environment and manages resources at the granularity of single functions. We evaluate these techniques in a range of environments, from campus cluster to supercomputer, and show that our advanced dependency management planning and dynamic resource management methods provide superior performance and utilization relative to coarser-grained management approaches, achieving several-fold decrease in execution time for several large Python applications.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Bringing the Scientific Workflows Community Together",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains, and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. These executions must be managed using some software infrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for creating and executing workflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. While these efforts are all worthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, many of which are moribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large, still elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or build upon, existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively impacts workflow users, developers, and researchers. The\"Workflows Community Summit\"was held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to stakeholders in the workflow community (including both developers of WMSs and users of workflows) helped to identify key challenges in this community that were translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them being the object of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community. This report documents and organizes the wealth of information provided by the participants before, during, and after the summit.",

            "abstract": "CMS Tier 3 centers, frequently located at universities, play an important role in the physics analysis of CMS data. Although different computing resources are often available at universities, meeting all requirements to deploy a valid Tier 3 able to run CMS workflows can be challenging in certain scenarios. For instance, providing the right operating system (OS)with access to the CERNVM File System (CVMFS) on the worker nodes or having a Compute Element (CE) on the submit host is not always allowed or possible due to e.g: lack of root access to the nodes, TCP port network policies, maintenance of a C,etc. The Notre Dame group operates a CMS Tier 3 with 1K cores. In addition to this, researchers have access to an opportunistic pool with +25K cores that are used via lobster for CMS jobs, but cannot be used with other standard CMS submission tools on the grid like CRAB, as these resources are not part of the Tier 3 due to its opportunistic nature. This work describes the use of VC3, a service for automating the deployment of virtual cluster infrastructures, in order to provide the environment (user-space CVMFS access and customized OS via singularity containers) needed for CMS workflows to work. Also, we describe its integration with the OSG Hosted CE service, to add these resources to CMS as part of our existing Tier 3 in a seamless way.",

            "title": "Dynamic Sizing of Continuously Divisible Jobs for Heterogeneous Resources",
            "abstract": "Many scientific applications operate on large datasets that can be partitioned and operated on concurrently. The existing approaches for concurrent execution generally rely on statically partitioned data. This static partitioning can lock performance in a sub-optimal configuration, leading to higher execution time and an inability to respond to dynamic resources. We present the Continuously Divisible Job abstraction which allows statically defined applications to have their component tasks dynamically sized responding to system behavior. The Continuously Divisible Job abstraction defines a simple interface that dictates how work can be recursively divided, executed, and merged. Implementing this abstraction allows scientific applications to leverage dynamic job coordinators for execution. We also propose the Virtual File abstraction which allows read-only subsets of large files to be treated as separate files. In exploring the Continuously Divisible Job abstraction, two applications were implemented using the Continuously Divisible Job interface: a bioinformatics application and a high-energy physics event analysis. These were tested using an abstract job interface and several job coordinators. Comparing these against a previous static partitioning implementation we show comparable or better performance without having to make static decisions or implement complex dynamic application handling.",
