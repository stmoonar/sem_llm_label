            "title": "Target Detection Adapting to Spectral Variability in Multi-Temporal Hyperspectral Images Using Implicit Contrastive Learning",
            "abstract": "Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) is a crucial aspect of remote sensing applications, aiming to identify targets in hyperspectral images (HSIs) based on their known prior spectral signatures. However, the spectral variability resulting from various imaging conditions in multi-temporal hyperspectral images poses a challenge to both classical and deep learning (DL) methods. To overcome the limitations imposed by spectral variability, an implicit contrastive learning-based target detector (ICLTD) is proposed to exploit in-scene spectra in an unsupervised way. First, only prior spectra are utilized for explicit supervision, while an implicit contrastive learning module (ICLM) is designed to normalize the feature distributions of prior and in-scene spectra. This paper theoretically demonstrates that the ICLM can transfer the gradients from prior spectral features to those of in-scene spectra based on their feature similarities and differences. Because of transferred gradient signals, the ICLTD is regularized to extract similar representations for the prior and in-scene target spectra, while augmenting feature differences between the target and background spectra. Additionally, a local spectral similarity constraint (LSSC) is proposed to enhance the capability of scene adaptation by leveraging the spectral similarities among in-scene targets. To validate the performance of the ICLTD under spectral variability, multi-temporal HSIs captured under various imaging conditions are collected to generate prior spectra and in-scene spectra. Comparative evaluations against several DL detectors and classical methods reveal the superior performance of the ICLTD in achieving a balance between target detectability and background suppressibility under spectral variability.",

            "abstract": "Spectral feature differences between various materials in hyperspectral images (HSIs) allow detection of targets. In recent years, box-level hyperspectral object detection (HOD) has gained attention owing to improved spatial resolutions of HSIs. However, existing HOD methods mainly rely on spatial features and lack dedicated optimization for spectral feature extraction. Additionally, the limited high-spatial-resolution HSIs restrict their generalization capability. This paper proposes a spectral-spatial feature decoupled detector (SSFDD) to solve the above problems. First, a pixel-level detection module is proposed to decouple spectral features optimized with the dedicated loss. Meanwhile, HSIs are spectral-down-sampled to multispectral images (MSIs) for decoupled spatial features. Then, a Siamese fusion network (SFN) is designed to extract and fuse the decoupled spectral-spatial features for object detection. SBN is initialized with pre-trained models on RGB-image datasets to enhance generalization capability. Experimental results on a high-resolution HSI dataset validate the superior performance of the SSFDD.",

            "abstract": "Super-resolution semantic segmentation (SRSS) based on Convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot establish long-range dependencies due to limited receptive field, which limits the SRSS to obtain accurate high-resolution (HR) segmentation results from the low-resolution (LR) input images. In this paper, we design a Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS network that consists of two branches: Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS branch and super-resolution guided branch. In the Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS branch, Transformer extracts global context information from the feature map of the CNN, while skip connection is used to retain the local context information extracted from the CNN and combines both features to further improve the segmentation performance. In addition, the super-resolution guided branch is designed to supplement rich structure information and guide the semantic segmentation (SS). We test the proposed method on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark data set, and our network is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Siamese Network Ensembles for Hyperspectral Target Detection with Pseudo Data Generation",
            "abstract": "Target detection in hyperspectral images (HSIs) aims to distinguish target pixels from the background using knowledge gleaned from prior spectra. Most traditional methods are based on certain assumptions and utilize handcrafted classifiers. These simple models and assumptions\u2019 failure restrict the detection performance under complicated background interference. Recently, based on the convolutional networks, many supervised deep learning detectors have outperformed the traditional methods. However, these methods suffer from unstable detection, heavy computation burden, and optimization difficulty. This paper proposes a Siamese fully connected based target detector (SFCTD) that comprises nonlinear feature extraction modules (NFEMs) and cosine distance classifiers. Two NFEMs, which extract discriminative spectral features of input spectra-pairs, are based on fully connected layers for efficient computing and share the parameters to ease the optimization. To solve the few samples problem, we propose a pseudo data generation method based on the linear mixed model and the assumption that background pixels are dominant in HSIs. For mitigating the impact of stochastic suboptimal initialization, we parallelly optimize several Siamese detectors with small computation burdens and aggregate them as ensembles in the inference time. The network ensembles outperform every detector in terms of stability and achieve an outstanding balance between background suppression and detection rate. Experiments on multiple data sets demonstrate that the proposed detector is superior to the state-of-the-art detectors.",
