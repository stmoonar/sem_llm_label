            "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle platooning has tremendous potential to relieve the burden of Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) by sharing resources with nearby vehicles. Therefore, fleet formation and resource orchestration within vehicle platoons have recently ignited significant research interest. However, most fleet formation works focus on the intra-platoon configuration and information exchange, but few consider trajectory matching and joining willingness. Likewise, in multi-platoon scenarios, static resource orchestration for a single platoon no longer meets the demand from dynamic resource scheduling. To tackle these problems, we proposed the SFO scheme, an adaptive task <underline>S</underline>cheduling based on incentive fleet <underline>F</underline>ormation and metrizable resource <underline>O</underline>rchestration. First, we design a fleet <underline>F</underline>ormation algorithm based on <underline>T</underline>rajectory matching and <underline>J</underline>oining willingness (FTJ) to ensure the stable underlying architecture. Second, we use the <underline>W</underline>eighted <underline>S</underline>um of <underline>E</underline>nergy <underline>C</underline>onsumption (WSEC) as the performance metric for resource orchestration and formulate the time-average WSEC minimization problem. Third, an <underline>A</underline>daptive task <underline>S</underline>cheduling under <underline>P</underline>artitionable <underline>A</underline>pplications and variable <underline>R</underline>esources (ASPAR) is proposed for an asymptotic optimal solution in reaction to the changeable backlog of the timeout queue. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate that our approach is superior to other latest and classic works in energy consumption and execution latency.",

            "abstract": "FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters are widely used in digital communication systems, digital image processing, and many other fields. A great deal of research has been done on the flexible configuration of FIR filters, particularly on the dynamic adjustment of coefficients and orders. Existing FIR filter structures can be configured to a higher-order filter for a lower-order use, leading to low hardware utilization. This paper presents a dynamically configurable architecture for FIR filters based on a novel architecture with systolic arrays and serial multiply accumulators (MACs). This design can be configured to a higher-order filter or to several independent lower-order filters, thus increasing utilization. We demonstrate a 2048-order FIR filter that can be configured to a minimum of 16 orders and a maximum of 128 channels using only 256 multipliers and adders.",

            "abstract": "With the development of the 5G communication system, research on propagation characteristics of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) band has aroused significant attention. In particular, it is imperative to understand the similarities between the instantaneous channel characteristics of mm-wave band and sub-6 GHz band, which can be leveraged to facilitate beamforming and user scheduling. Towards this end, this paper presents a channel measurement campaign at both 4.9 GHz and 28 GHz in an urban micro-cell scenario using a virtual antenna array and conducts a detailed comparative study on the channel statistics. The measurement includes line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation environments. Parameter extraction and analysis including power delay profiles (PDPs), path loss (PL), root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS), and azimuth of arrival (AOA) shows that the 28 GHz channel has similar statistics compared to 4.9 GHz, while the 28 GHz band exhibits much fewer multipath components (MPCs). These results show that it is possible to leverage low-band channel estimations to facilitate the high-band, or vice versa.",

            "abstract": "Throughout various convolutional neural network (CNN) models, the sparsity increases as the network deepens, which poses significant potential to model compression and hardware acceleration. In this paper, a dual-factor hybrid-grained pruning method is introduced to make a good balance between model compression and accuracy preservation. The pro-posed pruning method combines hardware-friendly unstructured vector-level pruning with structured filter-level pruning to explore multiple grains of sparsity in CNNs. The architecture of the corresponding hardware accelerator is then proposed based on the row-based convolution dataflow, which could fully utilize the hybrid sparsity to accelerate CNN processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method increases the compression rate by 1.08\u00d7 while causing 0.21% accuracy loss compared to the state-of-the-art filter pruning method in VGG16, and 2.39% hardware resource increase compared to the accelerator without sparsity optimization.",

            "abstract": "Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\\times$ and $2.3\\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.",

However, its effectiveness in high-mobility scenarios may significantly deteriorate due to severe channel aging. In this paper, we propose an improved L\u00e9vy induced stochastic differential equation network (LDE-Net) based on the Euler-Maruyama method for channel prediction. The proposed scheme captures the stochastic and rapid changes of wireless channels, by dividing the neural network into fine-grained stages while maintaining a moderate model size by parameter sharing among stages. In order to verify its performance in practice, we conduct channel measurements in Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios on our campus, respectively. In both scenarios, LDE-Net performs better than the conventional and widely-used autoregressive model, long short term memory, and recurrent reural network schemes. In the LoS scenario, its throughput is 19.615% on average higher than all other schemes at various speeds, and 10.64% for NLoS.",

            "abstract": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial for optimizing system performance in wireless communications. One of the current research directions is to extract the CSI from the channel knowledge map (CKM) based on users' location. While such an approach is promising for large-scale CSI acquisition, e.g., pathloss, it is still questionable whether CKM can help to predict instantaneous CSI which is very sensitive to positioning error and scattering environment changes. To answer this question, this paper proposes a channel prediction scheme that combines the CKM with historical user CSI to improve the beamforming performance in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, it utilizes the complex amplitude information of multi-path components (MPCs) and employs a low-complexity method to predict the future MIMO CSI. Through experiments based on real-world channel data, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art ones that use the CKM alone or autoregressive schemes without CKM. In the non-line-of-sight scenarios, when the positioning error exceeds 0.525 m, small-scale CSI in CKM provides little gain. In line-of-sight environments, the threshold for the usability of small-scale CSI in terms of positioning error is approximately 0.725 m or slightly higher. When the positioning error is less than 0.225 m, the CKM is beneficial to predict instantaneous CSI in both scenarios.",

This paper presents the implementation of parallel computing acceleration for an LTE baseband system based on single program multiple data (SPMD) methodology, and proposes detailed optimization strategies for the time-consuming synchronization and OFDM modulation modules in the system. Experiment results based on the implicit SPMD program compiler (ISPC) show that continuous memory access has a significant impact on the final acceleration effect. Moreover, the processing speed of software-based physical layer can be increased up to 10\u201330 times through SPMD.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle-Infrastructure cooperation is an advanced development stage of autonomous driving, which helps to upgrade the capability of vehicles by fully implementing real-time information interaction among vehicles, roads and pedestrians. However, perception, computing and communication are usually decoupled in today\u2019s vehicle-road coordination applications, which significantly adds delay and cost to the system. In this paper, we propose and implement a platform that integrates perception, computing and communication to provide timely roadside feature maps to vehicles for vision fusion. A neural processing unit (NPU) for computing and a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) wireless baseband IP for communication are both implemented on FPGA. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed platform using CoBEVT algorithm on the camera track of the OPV2V perception dataset. The experimental result show that our platform can expand the view of vehicles as well as improve information freshness in terms of end-to-end delay.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNN accelerators have been a research focus and are continuously being developed. Loop tiling is a commonly deployed optimization method to guide hardware architecture design based on hardware resource constraints. However, the potential performance gain of loop tiling at the compiler phase is rarely considered. In this paper, a loop-tiling based compiling scheme is proposed, which could assist a large range of hardware architecture to improve the versatility and performance of inference. A network reorganization scheme is introduced which is customized to the target hardware architecture and reconstructed the network model in a more hardware-friendly manner. At the same time, the weight re-ordering is performed correspondingly to the newly generated network model to guarantee correct data access. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively enlarge the range of supported CNN models for CNN accelerators with various hardware configurations.",
