            "title": "Multi-UAV-Assisted Federated Learning for Energy-Aware Distributed Edge Training",
            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has largely extended the border and capacity of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) by providing a key element for enabling flexible distributed data inputs, computing capacity, and high mobility. To enhance data privacy for AIoT applications, federated learning (FL) is becoming a potential solution to perform training tasks locally on distributed IoT devices. However, with the limited onboard resources and battery capacity of each UAV node, optimization is required to achieve a large-scale and high-precision FL scheme. In this work, an optimized multi-UAV-assisted FL framework is designed, where regular IoT devices are in charge of performing training tasks, and multiple UAVs are leveraged to execute local and global aggregation tasks. An online resource allocation (ORA) algorithm is proposed to minimize the training latency by jointly deciding the selection decisions of clients and a global aggregation server. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization technique, virtual energy queues are studied to depict the energy deficit. With the help of the actor-critic learning framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is designed to improve per-round training performance. A deep neural network (DNN)-based actor module is designed to derive client selection decisions, and a critic module is proposed through a conventional optimization method to evaluate the obtained selection decisions. Moreover, a greedy scheme is developed to find the optimal global aggregation server. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ORA algorithm can achieve optimal training latency and energy consumption under various system settings.",

            "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing services are divided into two categories: opportunistic and participatory. In opportunistic mobile crowdsensing services, users do not need to specify the crowdsensing tasks to be completed. Compared with participatory crowdsensing services, the application scope is wider and more user-friendly. In participatory crowdsensing, the service provider assumes that the user can successfully complete the data collection task. However, such an approach cannot work in an opportunistic crowdsensing service because in opportunistic crowdsensing, the user\u2019s execution of the task is uncertain, which brings great challenges to the quality of the crowdsensing service. This article is based on the assumption of the user coverage probability model and transforms the opportunistic mobile crowdsensing value maximization problem into an ordered submodularity value function model with budget constraints. This model is also good at representing participatory crowdsourcing problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the ordered submodularity feature to a mobile crowdsensing service. Furthermore, we combine the properties of ordered submodular and auction models and propose an ordered submodularity-proportional share mechanism (O-PSM) to solve the allocation and payment problems in opportunistic mobile crowdsensing services. Specifically, in the allocation stage, the winning users are selected based on the proportional share threshold, and in the payment stage, the payment price for the winning users is designed based on critical value theory. We prove that the mechanism satisfies the economic characteristics of individual rationality, truthfulness, and budget feasibility. In the experimental section, the mechanism design based on ordered submodularity is shown to enable the service provider to obtain a higher value and a lower payment.",

A novel aspect is incorporating flight test measurement data, including forward-looking radar measurements and in situ microphysics probes data, into the model and part of the evaluations of modeling. The simulation models assume a dual-polarized, airborne forward-looking radar, while for single-polarized operations, the index-of-dispersion is included as a helpful indicator for HIWC detection. The radar system simulation models are useful for design evaluations for the next generation of airborne aviation hazard monitoring and incorporate HIWC hazard detection algorithms.

Based on the proposed system setup, it is formulated the secrecy rate maximization problem subject to the total transmit power and reflecting phase shift constraints. To solve this problem, we divide it into three sub-problems, i.e., transmit power allocation, AIRS trajectory optimization, and reflecting phase shift optimization. Alternately optimizing these three sub-problems, security aware joint optimal resource allocation schemes are proposed. Numerical simulations show that the joint optimal power allocation, AIRS trajectory, and reflecting phase shift schemes can effectively guarantee security performance for AIRS assisted wireless relay networks.",

Such robots can provide full or partial autonomy when guiding. However, the pros and cons of different forms and autonomy for guiding robots remain unknown. We sought to fill this gap. We designed autonomy-switchable guiding robotic cane and car. We conducted a controlled lab-study (N=12) and a field study (N=9) on BLV. Results showed that full autonomy received better walking performance and subjective ratings in the controlled study, whereas participants used more partial autonomy in the natural environment as demanding more control. Besides, the car robot has demonstrated abilities to provide a higher sense of safety and navigation efficiency compared with the cane robot. Our findings offered empirical evidence about how the BLV community perceived different machine forms and autonomy, which can inform the design of assistive robots.",

We name it PRO-Face S, short for Privacy-preserving Reversible Obfuscation of Face images via Secure flow-based model.

The pre-obfuscation applied can be in diversified form with different strengths and styles specified by users. Along protection, a secret key is injected into the network such that the original image can only be recovered from the protection image via the same model given the correct key provided. Two modes of image recovery are devised to deal with malicious recovery attempts in different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three public image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over multiple state-of-the-art approaches.",

The existing approaches to explainable AI (XAI) are mainly limited to simple machine learning algorithms, and the research regarding the explainability-accuracy tradeoff is still in its infancy especially when we are concerned about complex machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep learning (DL). In this work, we introduce a new approach for complex models based on the co-relation impact which enhances the explainability considerably while also ensuring the accuracy at a high level. We propose approaches for both scenarios of independent features and dependent features. In addition, we study the uncertainty associated with features and output. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound of the computation complexity of our proposed approach for the dependent features. The complexity bound depends on the order of logarithmic of the number of observations which provides a reliable result considering the higher dimension of dependent feature space with a smaller number of observations.",

            "abstract": "Interrupted sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ) is an advanced coherent jamming with both suppression and deception effects. Effective countermeasures have been proposed, but most of these methods only consider ISRJ suppression in the case of single jamming or multiple jammings with the same parameters. In this article, we propose a space\u2013time complex modulation (STCM) technique based on colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar to cope with the threat of multiple ISRJs with different parameters. The STCM refers to encoding the carrier frequency of the signal transmitted by each array element and randomly encoding the initial phase of each pulse emitted by each array element. This modulation method can separate the ISRJ mixed with the target in the transmitting angular frequency-range (TAFR) spectrum. Using this characteristic, we study the waveform parameter design criterion for the sufficient separation of targets and ISRJs. Moreover, the detailed STCM-MIMO waveform processing method is developed for ISRJ suppression. Simulation results are provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed modulation method in ISRJ separation and the significant advantage of the proposed ISRJ suppression method over existing methods in the presence of multiple jammings.",

            "title": "DecomFormer: Decompose Self-Attention Via Fourier Transform for VHR Aerial Image Scene Classification",
            "abstract": "Very high-resolution (VHR) aerial image scene classification is an essential task for aerial image understanding. Although transformer-based models have demonstrated strong ability in natural image classification, transformer-based methods on VHR aerial image tasks are still lack of concern because the complexity of self-attention in the transformer grows quadratically with the image resolution. To address this issue, we decompose the self-attention via Fourier Transform and propose a novel Fourier self-attention (FSA) mechanism. Based on FSA, we design a highly efficient network named DecomFormer, which learns contextual relationships in the real part and imaginary part of the Fourier field, respectively. Theoretically, the DecomFormer reduces the complexity of the naive self-attention mechanism from O(n2) to O(nlog(n)). Universal experiments on public VHR aerial image classification benchmarks demonstrated the DecomFormer\u2019s efficiency, especially on images with very high-resolution.",

            "title": "A Novel Method to Design Steerable Differential Beamformer Using Linear Acoustics Vector Sensor Array",
            "abstract": "Differential beamforming techniques have gained significant attention due to their frequency-independent beampatterns, applicability for small apertures, and super-directivity. It is commonly known that the main lobe of a beam pattern based on a linear array is typically aligned with the end-fire direction. However, in some application scenarios, aligning the main lobe in the end-fire direction may not meet the actual requirements. This article focuses on studying the steering problem of differential beamformers based on linear acoustics vector sensor arrays (LAVSs). We propose a steerable differential beamformer for LAVSs, which addresses the problem of non-steerable beam patterns of linear arrays. Our approach involves approximating the beam pattern using a series expansion of the weighted steering vector to achieve frequency-independent differential directivity. The major contributions of this article include, but are not limited to, the following: First, we derive the first-order to third-order differential directivity based on the acoustics vector sensor (AVS) signal model, and obtain the weights of the corresponding channels using the least squares method. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of the steering differential beamformer, demonstrating that the maximum directivity factor (DF) is a function of the steering angle. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the proposed method.",
