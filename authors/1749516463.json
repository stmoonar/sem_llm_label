            "abstract": "A common method for delineating urban and suburban boundaries is to identify clusters of spatial units that are highly interconnected in a network of commuting flows, each cluster signaling a cohesive economic submarket. It is critical that the clustering methods employed for this task are principled and free of unnecessary tunable parameters to avoid unwanted inductive biases while remaining scalable for high resolution mobility networks. Here we systematically assess the benefits and limitations of a wide array of Stochastic Block Models (SBMs)$\\unicode{x2014}$a family of principled, nonparametric models for identifying clusters in networks$\\unicode{x2014}$for delineating urban spatial boundaries with commuting data. We find that the data compression capability and relative performance of different SBM variants heavily depends on the spatial extent of the commuting network, its aggregation scale, and the method used for weighting network edges. We also construct a new measure to assess the degree to which community detection algorithms find spatially contiguous partitions, finding that traditional SBMs may produce substantial spatial discontiguities that make them challenging to use in general for urban boundary delineation. We propose a fast nonparametric regionalization algorithm that can alleviate this issue, achieving data compression close to that of unconstrained SBM models while ensuring spatial contiguity, benefiting from a deterministic optimization procedure, and being generalizable to a wide range of community detection objective functions.",

            "abstract": "We study the emerging large-scale structures in networks subject to selective pressures that simultaneously drive toward higher modularity and robustness against random failures. We construct maximum-entropy null models that isolate the effects of the joint optimization on the network structure from any kind of evolutionary dynamics. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram of optimized structures, composed of many combinations of modular, core-periphery, and bipartite patterns. Furthermore, we observe parameter regions where the simultaneous optimization can be either synergistic or antagonistic, with the improvement of one criterion directly aiding or hindering the other, respectively. Our results show how interactions between different selective pressures can be pivotal in determining the emerging network structure, and that these interactions can be captured by simple network models.",
