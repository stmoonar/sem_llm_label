            "title": "From Talent Shortage to Workforce Excellence in the CHIPS Act Era: Harnessing Industry 4.0 Paradigms for a Sustainable Future in Domestic Chip Production",
            "abstract": "The CHIPS Act is driving the U.S. towards a self-sustainable future in domestic chip production. Decades of outsourced manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging has diminished the workforce ecosystem, imposing major limitations on semiconductor companies racing to build new fabrication sites as part of the CHIPS Act. In response, a systemic alliance between academic institutions, the industry, government, various consortiums, and organizations has emerged to establish a pipeline to educate and onboard the next generation of talent. Establishing a stable and continuous flow of talent requires significant time investments and comes with no guarantees, particularly factoring in the low workplace desirability in current fabrication houses for U.S workforce. This paper will explore the feasibility of two paradigms of Industry 4.0, automation and Augmented Reality(AR)/Virtual Reality(VR), to complement ongoing workforce development efforts and optimize workplace desirability by catalyzing core manufacturing processes and effectively enhancing the education, onboarding, and professional realms-all with promising capabilities amid the ongoing talent shortage and trajectory towards advanced packaging.",

            "abstract": "The acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has attracted much attention in research. Many critical real-time applications benefit from DNN accelerators but are limited by their compute-intensive nature. This work introduces an accelerator for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), based on a hybrid optoelectronic computing architecture and residue number system (RNS). The RNS reduces the optical critical path and lowers the power requirements. In addition, the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) allows high-speed operation at the system level by enabling high-level parallelism. The proposed RNS compute modules use one-hot encoding, and thus enable fast switching between the electrical and optical domains. We propose a new architecture that combines residue electrical adders and optical multipliers as the matrix-vector multiplication unit. Moreover, we enhance the implementation of different CNN computational kernels using WDM-enabled RNS based integrated photonics. The area and power efficiency of the proposed accelerator are 0.39 TOPS/s/mm2 and 3.22 TOPS/s/W, respectively. In terms of computation capability, the proposed chip is 12.7\u00d7 and 4.02\u00d7 better than other optical implementation and memristor implementation, respectively. Our experimental evaluation using DNN benchmarks illustrates that our architecture can perform on average more than 72 times faster than GPU under the same power budget.",

            "abstract": "Decision-making through artificial neural networks with minimal latency is critical for numerous applications such as navigation, tracking, and real-time machine action systems. This requires machine learning hardware to process multidimensional data at high throughput. Unfortunately, handling convolution operations, the primary computational tool for data classification tasks, obeys challenging runtime complexity scaling laws. However, homomorphically implementing the convolution theorem in a Fourier optics display light processor can achieve a non-iterative O(1) runtime complexity for data inputs beyond 1,000 \u00d7 1,000 large matrices. Following this approach, here we demonstrate data streaming multi-kernel image batching using a Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) accelerator. We show image batch processing of large-scale matrices as 2 million dot product multiplications performed by a digital light processing module in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, we further parallelize this optical FCNN system by exploiting multiple spatially parallel diffraction orders, achieving a 98x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art FCNN accelerators. A comprehensive discussion of the practical challenges associated with working at the edge of system capabilities highlights the problem of crosstalk and resolution scaling laws in the Fourier domain. Accelerating convolution by exploiting massive parallelism in display technology brings non-Van Neumann-based machine learning acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Innovative processor architectures aim to play a critical role in future sustainment of performance improvements under severe limitations imposed by the end of Moore\u2019s Law. The Reconfigurable Optical Computer (ROC) is one such innovative, Post-Moore\u2019s Law processor. ROC is designed to solve partial differential equations in one shot as opposed to existing solutions, which are based on costly iterative computations. This is achieved by leveraging physical properties of a mesh of optical components that behave analogously to lumped electrical components. However, virtualization is required to combat shortfalls of the accelerator hardware. Namely, (1) the infeasibility of building large photonic arrays to accommodate arbitrarily large problems and (2) underutilization brought about by mismatches in problem and accelerator mesh sizes due to future advances in manufacturing technology. In this work, we introduce an architecture and methodology for lightweight virtualization of ROC that exploits advantages borne from optical computing technology. Specifically, we apply temporal and spatial virtualization to ROC and then extend the accelerator scheduling tradespace with the introduction of spectral virtualization. Additionally, we investigate multiple resource scheduling strategies for a system-on-chip (SoC)-based PDE acceleration architecture and show that virtual configuration management offers a speedup of approximately 2\u00d7. Finally, we show that overhead from virtualization is minimal, and our experimental results show two orders of magnitude increased speed as compared to microprocessor execution while keeping errors due to virtualization under 10%.",

Integrated photonics has the potential to dramatically accelerate neural networks because of its low-latency nature.

This \u2018free\u2019 convolution computation provides the theoretical basis of the proposed PhotoFourier JTC-based CNN accelerator. PhotoFourier addresses a myriad of challenges posed by on-chip photonic computing in the Fourier domain including 1D lenses and high-cost optoelectronic conversions.

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks are paramount in image and signal processing, and are responsible for the majority of image recognition power consumption today, concentrated mainly in convolution computations. With convolution operations being computationally intensive, next\u2010generation hardware accelerators need to offer parallelization and high efficiency. Diffractive optics offers the promise of low\u2010latency, highly parallel convolution operations. However, thus far parallelism is only partially harvested, thereby significantly underdelivering in comparison to its throughput potential. Here, a parallelized operation high\u2010throughput Fourier optic convolutional accelerator is demonstrated. For the first time, simultaneous processing of multiple kernels in Fourier domain enabled by optical diffraction orders is achieved alongside input parallelism. The proposed approach can offer \u2248100\u00d7 speedup over the previous generation optical diffraction\u2010based processor and 10\u00d7 speedup over other state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art optical Fourier classifiers.",
