            "title": "Purity-Preserving Kernel Tensor Low-Rank Learning for Robust Subspace Clustering",
            "abstract": "In recent years, multi-kernel learning (MKL) methods have been widely used in performing nonlinear data subspace clustering tasks, benefiting from the fact that they do not require the selection and tuning of predefined kernels. However, the effect of raw noise on the data structure in the feature space has been neglected in most MKL studies so far. In this paper, we propose a robust subspace clustering method called purity kernel tensor low-rank learning (KTLL), which effectively isolates noise transfer from the original data space to the high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, we construct the kernel pool obtained by MKL as a primitive third-order kernel tensor, separate the corrupted information in the feature space, and use the separated pure kernel tensor to learn the optimal affinity matrix. The tensor learning of the kernel pool can effectively mine the higher-order correlations among different kernel matrices, thus improving the clustering performance of KTLL.We have conducted extensive experiments to compare KTLL with state-of-the-art MKL and deep subspace clustering algorithms, and our results demonstrate the superiority of KTLL.",

            "abstract": "Powered by advanced information technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSS). In consideration of the cost, legal, and institutional constraints on the study of CPSS in real world, computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of CPSS. However, with the increase of application scenarios, how to map complex and diverse domain models to artificial society models has become a key challenge to hinder the wide use of computational experiments. In this article, the docking framework between the domain model and the artificial society model was proposed in this article, and the model docking specification is given from three aspects: the agent model, the environmental model, and the rules model. In addition, the effectiveness of the framework was verified by two classic cases: artificial stock market and epidemic prevention and control. The result showed that the proposed model docking framework can provide technical support for the multidisciplinary applications of computational experiments and significantly reduce the difficulty of using the method.",

            "abstract": "Human travel and social contacts are deemed as the key force in driving the transmission of infectious diseases. Consequently, epidemic models should represent individuals\u2019 spatiotemporal contacts in detail to investigate the complex process of epidemic diffusion. Mathematical epidemic models usually assume a homogeneous human population and describe unstructured contacts. Most network-based epidemic models do not synthetically consider the temporal and spatial features of human structured contact behaviors. We here combined a social network with a bipartite network to build a multilayer agent network to model heterogeneous individuals\u2019 temporal and spatial structured contacts. We used the largest collective outbreak of H1N1 influenza at a Chinese university in 2009 as a case study. Experimental results indicate that our models can reproduce individuals\u2019 daily travel and social contact patterns, as well as the H1N1 influenza outbreak. We found that only quarantining dormitories to stop interbuilding transmission could not achieve a great effect in mitigating epidemic outbreaks at a university. The prohibition of students\u2019 visiting across dormitory rooms was indispensable to prevent intrabuilding transmission of infectious diseases. Furthermore, it would be better to quarantine admitted case patients\u2019 close contacts to control potentially latent individuals.",

We contribute: (1) A front-end language where users can write proof statements as imperative programs in a familiar syntax; (2) A compiler architecture and implementation that automatically analyzes the program and compiles it into an optimized IR that can be lifted to a variety of ZKP constructions; and (3) A cutting algorithm, based on Pseudo-Boolean optimization and Integer Linear Programming, that reorders instructions and then partitions the program into efficiently sized chunks for parallel evaluation and efficient state reconciliation.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of curriculum learning in LiDAR-based 3D object detection by proposing a curricular object manipulation (COM) framework. The framework embeds the curricular training strategy into both the loss design and the augmentation process. For the loss design, we propose the COMLoss to dynamically predict object-level difficulties and emphasize objects of different difficulties based on training stages. On top of the widely-used augmentation technique called GT-Aug in Li-DAR detection tasks, we propose a novel COMAug strategy which first clusters objects in ground-truth database based on well-designed heuristics. Group-level difficulties rather than individual ones are then predicted and updated during training for stable results. Model performance and generalization capabilities can be improved by sampling and augmenting progressively more difficult objects into the training samples. Extensive experiments and ablation studies reveal the superior and generality of the proposed framework. The code is available at https://github.com/ZZY816/COM.",

            "abstract": "In real-world applications, deep learning models often run in non-stationary environments where the target data distribution continually shifts over time. There have been numerous domain adaptation (DA) methods in both online and offline modes to improve cross-domain adaptation ability. However, these DA methods typically only provide good performance after a long period of adaptation, and perform poorly on new domains before and during adaptation - in what we call the\"Unfamiliar Period\", especially when domain shifts happen suddenly and significantly. On the other hand, domain generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to improve the model generalization ability on unadapted domains. However, existing DG works are ineffective for continually changing domains due to severe catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. To overcome these limitations of DA and DG in handling the Unfamiliar Period during continual domain shift, we propose RaTP, a framework that focuses on improving models' target domain generalization (TDG) capability, while also achieving effective target domain adaptation (TDA) capability right after training on certain domains and forgetting alleviation (FA) capability on past domains. RaTP includes a training-free data augmentation module to prepare data for TDG, a novel pseudo-labeling mechanism to provide reliable supervision for TDA, and a prototype contrastive alignment algorithm to align different domains for achieving TDG, TDA and FA. Extensive experiments on Digits, PACS, and DomainNet demonstrate that RaTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works from Continual DA, Source-Free DA, Test-Time/Online DA, Single DG, Multiple DG and Unified DA&DG in TDG, and achieves comparable TDA and FA capabilities.",

            "title": "AMatFormer: Efficient Feature Matching via Anchor Matching Transformer",
            "abstract": "Learning based feature matching methods have been commonly studied in recent years. The core issue for learning feature matching is to how to learn (1) discriminative representations for feature points (or regions) within each intra-image and (2) consensus representations for feature points across inter-images. Recently, self- and cross-attention models have been exploited to address this issue. However, in many scenes, features are coming with large-scale, redundant and outliers contaminated. Previous self-/cross-attention models generally conduct message passing on all primal features which thus lead to redundant learning and high computational cost. To mitigate limitations, inspired by recent seed matching methods, in this article, we propose a novel efficient Anchor Matching Transformer (AMatFormer) for the feature matching problem. AMatFormer has two main aspects: First, it mainly conducts self-/cross-attention on some anchor features and leverages these anchor features as message bottleneck to learn the representations for all primal features. Thus, it can be implemented efficiently and compactly. Second, AMatFormer adopts a shared FFN module to further embed the features of two images into the common domain and thus learn the consensus feature representations for the matching problem. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AMatFormer matching approach.",

            "abstract": "Fast and high-accuracy detection of underwater targets based on side scan sonar images has great potential for marine fisheries, underwater security, marine mapping, underwater engineering and other applications. The following problems, however, must be addressed when using low-resolution side scan sonar images for underwater target detection: (1) the detection performance is limited due to the restriction on the input of multi-scale images; (2) the widely used deep learning algorithms have a low detection effect due to their complex convolution layer structures; (3) the detection performance is limited due to insufficient model complexity in training process; and (4) the number of samples is not enough because of the bad dataset preprocessing methods. To solve these problems, an improved neural network for underwater target detection\u2014which is based on side scan sonar images and fully utilizes spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing based on the You Look Only Once version three (YOLO V3) algorithm\u2014is proposed. The methodology of the proposed approach is as follows: (1) the AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet and the ResNet networks and an adopted YOLO V3 algorithm were the backbone networks. The structure of the YOLO V3 model is more mature and compact and has higher target detection accuracy and better detection efficiency than the other models; (2) spatial pyramid pooling was added at the end of the convolution layer to improve detection performance. Spatial pyramid pooling breaks the scale restrictions when inputting images to improve feature extraction because spatial pyramid pooling enables the backbone network to learn faster at high accuracy; and (3) online dataset preprocessing based on YOLO V3 with spatial pyramid pooling increases the number of samples and improves the complexity of the model to further improve detection process performance. Three-side scan imagery datasets were used for training and were tested in experiments. The quantitative evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, mAP and F1-Score metrics indicates that: for the AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet and ResNet algorithms, when spatial pyramid pooling is added to their backbone networks, the average detection accuracy of the three sets of data was improved by 2%, 4%, 2% and 2%, respectively, as compared to their original formulations. Compared with the original YOLO V3 model, the proposed ODP+YOLO V3+SPP underwater target detection algorithm model has improved detection performance through the mAP qualitative evaluation index has increased by 6%, the Precision qualitative evaluation index has increased by 13%, and the detection efficiency has increased by 9.34%. These demonstrate that adding spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing can improve the target detection accuracy of these commonly used algorithms. The proposed, improved neural network with spatial pyramid pooling and online dataset preprocessing based on the YOLO V3 method achieves the highest scores for underwater target detection results for sunken ships, fish flocks and seafloor topography, with mAP scores of 98%, 91% and 96% for the above three kinds of datasets, respectively.",
