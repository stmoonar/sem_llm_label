            "abstract": "Human mobility data is useful for various applications in urban planning, transportation, and public health, but collecting and sharing real-world trajectories can be challenging due to privacy and data quality issues. To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories. In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "Ride-hailing services have skyrocketed in popularity due to their convenience. However, recent research has shown that their pricing strategies can have a disparate impact on some riders, such as those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods with a greater share of residents of color or residents below the poverty line. Analyzing real-world data, we additionally show that these communities tend to be more dependent on ride-hailing services (e.g., for work commutes) due to a lack of adequate public transportation infrastructure. To this end, we present the first thorough study on fair pricing for ride-hailing services by first devising applicable fairness measures to quantify this bias and then proposing novel fair pricing mechanisms to alleviate this bias. We present two pricing mechanisms to provide flexibility and account for different platform needs. By taking affordability into account and potentially providing discounts that may be government-subsidized, our approaches result in an increased number and more affordable rides for the disadvantaged community. Experiments on real-world Chicago ride-hailing data demonstrate worse scores for the proposed fairness metrics for rides corresponding to disadvantaged neighborhoods than those of a control group (random mix of neighborhoods). Subsequently, the results show that our fair pricing mechanisms eliminate this inequality gap. Our mechanisms provide a basis for the government and the ride-hailing platforms to implement fair ride-hailing policies.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasing role in decision-making tasks that directly affect individuals, e.g., loan approvals, or job applicant screening. Significant concerns arise that, without special provisions, individuals from under-privileged backgrounds may not get equitable access to services and opportunities. Existing research studies fairness with respect to protected attributes such as gender, race or income, but the impact of location data on fairness has been largely overlooked. With the widespread adoption of mobile apps, geospatial attributes are increasingly used in ML, and their potential to introduce unfair bias is significant, given their high correlation with protected attributes. We propose techniques to mitigate location bias in machine learning. Specifically, we consider the issue of miscalibration when dealing with geospatial attributes. We focus on spatial group fairness and we propose a spatial indexing algorithm that accounts for fairness. Our KD-tree inspired approach significantly improves fairness while maintaining high learning accuracy, as shown by extensive experimental results on real data.",

            "abstract": "Bike-sharing systems, where people rent bikes typically for last-mile commuting, have gained great popularity in recent years due to the rapid development of mobile networks. Station-based bike-sharing systems have been widely studied in both academia and industry, where problems like bike rental demand prediction and bike redistribution have been discussed. In contrast, not much attention has been paid to the routing algorithms for shared-bike riders. A routing solution consists of two stations, suggesting where to rent and return a bike. Existing routing works generally target a single rider. However, during rush hours, there often exist routing requests from multiple riders simultaneously, which has not been carefully investigated before. In this paper, we study the routing problem for multiple shared-bike riders with hardness analyses and approximation algorithms. The challenge lies in how to allocate the limited resources (bikes/docks at the stations) among the competing riders. We show that this problem is NP-hard, and thus propose two heuristics. We also propose an optimization technique on routing plan generations, to improve the efficiency of the algorithms. Extensive experiments have been carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms. It turns out that the greedy-based routing algorithm, which has an approximation factor of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\frac{1}{3}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zheng-ieq1-3073983.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, is both effective and efficient.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting the number of visits to Points-of-Interest (POI) in an urban area is critical for planning and decision making in various application domains, from urban planning and transportation management to public health and social studies. Although this forecasting problem can be formulated as a multivariate time-series forecasting task, current approaches cannot fully exploit the ever-changing multi-context correlations among POIs. Therefore, we propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation. By incorporating all contextual, temporal, and spatial signals, we observe a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art forecasting models in our experiments with real-world datasets across the United States.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental problem in data management is to find the elements in an array that match a query. Recently, learned indexes are being extensively used to solve this problem, where they learn a model to predict the location of the items in the array. They are empirically shown to outperform non-learned methods (e.g., B-trees or binary search that answer queries in O(logn) time) by orders of magnitude. However, success of learned indexes has not been theoretically justified. Only existing attempt shows the same query time of O(logn), but with a constant factor improvement in space complexity over non-learned methods, under some assumptions on data distribution. In this paper, we significantly strengthen this result, showing that under mild assumptions on data distribution, and the same space complexity as non-learned methods, learned indexes can answer queries in O(loglogn) expected query time. We also show that allowing for slightly larger but still near-linear space overhead, a learned index can achieve O(1) expected query time. Our results theoretically prove learned indexes are orders of magnitude faster than non-learned methods, theoretically grounding their empirical success.",

            "abstract": "Privacy and fairness are two crucial pillars of responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) and trustworthy Machine Learning (ML). Each objective has been independently studied in the literature with the aim of reducing utility loss in achieving them. Despite the significant interest attracted from both academia and industry, there remains an immediate demand for more in-depth research to unravel how these two objectives can be simultaneously integrated into ML models. As opposed to well-accepted trade-offs, i.e., privacy-utility and fairness-utility, the interrelation between privacy and fairness is not well-understood. While some works suggest a trade-off between the two objective functions, there are others that demonstrate the alignment of these functions in certain scenarios. To fill this research gap, we provide a thorough review of privacy and fairness in ML, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. After examining and consolidating the literature on both objectives, we present a holistic survey on the impact of privacy on fairness, the impact of fairness on privacy, existing architectures, their interaction in application domains, and algorithms that aim to achieve both objectives while minimizing the utility sacrificed. Finally, we identify research challenges in achieving privacy and fairness concurrently in ML, particularly focusing on large language models.",

            "abstract": "Location-based alerts have gained increasing popularity in recent years, whether in the context of healthcare (e.g., COVID-19 contact tracing), marketing (e.g., location-based advertising), or public safety. However, serious privacy concerns arise when location data are used in clear in the process. Several solutions employ searchable encryption (SE) to achieve secure alerts directly on encrypted locations. While doing so preserves privacy, the performance overhead incurred is high. We focus on a prominent SE technique in the public-key setting\u2013hidden vector encryption, and propose a graph embedding technique to encode location data in a way that significantly boosts the performance of processing on ciphertexts. We show that the optimal encoding is NP-hard, and we provide three heuristics that obtain significant performance gains: gray optimizer, multi-seed gray optimizer and scaled gray optimizer. Furthermore, we investigate the more challenging case of dynamic alert zones, where the area of interest changes over time. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our solutions can significantly improve computational overhead compared to existing baselines.\n",

            "abstract": "One critical issue in any network systems is failure detection. Failures not only impact the source network but also propagate through other communicating networks due to the butterfly effect, making root causing of failures even more challenging. Therefore, the necessity to detect failures and anomalies in computer networks is fundamental. Given the nature of computer networks, data is received in a time-series format where each time-point has temporal dependencies on others. As a result, time-series analysis stands out as a potential approach to deal with the task of network anomaly detection. In this paper, we conduct studies on multivariate time series anomaly detection, varying from traditional machine learning techniques to deep learning models. We show that the choice of models is not as important as the choice of pre-processing techniques. Interestingly, non-linear normalization can boost the performance of deep detectors by around 20% in terms of F1 score and balance the preference of deep detectors for specific types of anomalies. We also study the bias of anomaly types to deep detectors, time-performance trade-offs, shortage of data, and effects of weakly labeled data on both synthetic and realworld datasets to fill out the missing insights in the literature.",
