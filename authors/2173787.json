            "title": "Give and Take: An End-To-End Investigation of Giveaway Scam Conversion Rates",
            "abstract": "Scams -- fraudulent schemes designed to swindle money from victims -- have existed for as long as recorded history. However, the Internet's combination of low communication cost, global reach, and functional anonymity has allowed scam volumes to reach new heights. Designing effective interventions requires first understanding the context: how scammers reach potential victims, the earnings they make, and any potential bottlenecks for durable interventions. In this short paper, we focus on these questions in the context of cryptocurrency giveaway scams, where victims are tricked into irreversibly transferring funds to scammers under the pretense of even greater returns. Combining data from Twitter, YouTube and Twitch livestreams, landing pages, and cryptocurrency blockchains, we measure how giveaway scams operate at scale. We find that 1 in 1000 scam tweets, and 4 in 100,000 livestream views, net a victim, and that scammers managed to extract nearly \\$4.62 million from just hundreds of victims during our measurement window.",

            "abstract": "One of the defining features of Bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have been derived from it is a globally visible transaction ledger. While Bitcoin uses pseudonyms as a way to hide the identity of its participants, a long line of research has demonstrated that Bitcoin is not anonymous. This has been perhaps best exemplified by the development of clustering heuristics, which have in turn given rise to the ability to track the flow of bitcoins as they are sent from one entity to another. In this paper, we design a new heuristic that is designed to track a certain type of flow, called a peel chain, that represents many transactions performed by the same entity; in doing this, we implicitly cluster these transactions and their associated pseudonyms together. We then use this heuristic to both validate and expand the results of existing clustering heuristics. We also develop a machine learning-based validation method and, using a ground-truth dataset, evaluate all our approaches and compare them with the state of the art. Ultimately, our goal is to not only enable more powerful tracking techniques but also call attention to the limits of anonymity in these systems.",

            "abstract": "Although Bitcoin in its original whitepaper stated that it offers anonymous transactions, de-anonymization techniques have found otherwise. Therefore, alternative cryptocurrencies, like Dash, Monero, and Zcash, were developed to provide better privacy. As Edward Snowden stated, \"Zcash's privacy tech makes it the most interesting Bitcoin alternative (...) because the privacy properties of it are truly unique\". Zcash's privacy is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic constructions, hence it is considered to provide the foundations for the best anonymity. However, even Zcash makes some privacy concessions. It does not protect users' privacy in the presence of a global adversary who is able to observe the whole network, and hence correlate the parties exchanging money, by using their network addresses. The recent empirical analysis of Zcash shows, that users often choose naive ways while performing the protocol operations, not realizing that it degrades their anonymity. In this talk, we will discuss an extension of Zcash using mix networks to enhance the privacy guarantees of users that choose to remain anonymous by tackling two major security challenges: one at the application layer of the scheme and one at its network layer.",

            "abstract": "One of the defining features of a cryptocurrency is that its ledger, containing all transactions that have evertaken place, is globally visible. As one consequenceof this degree of transparency, a long line of recent re-search has demonstrated that even in cryptocurrenciesthat are specifically designed to improve anonymity it is often possible to track money as it changes hands,and in some cases to de-anonymize users entirely. With the recent proliferation of alternative cryptocurrencies, however, it becomes relevant to ask not only whether ornot money can be traced as it moves within the ledgerof a single cryptocurrency, but if it can in fact be tracedas it moves across ledgers. This is especially pertinent given the rise in popularity of automated trading platforms such as ShapeShift, which make it effortless to carry out such cross-currency trades. In this paper, weuse data scraped from ShapeShift over a thirteen-monthperiod and the data from eight different blockchains to explore this question. Beyond developing new heuristics and creating new types of links across cryptocurrency ledgers, we also identify various patterns of cross-currency trades and of the general usage of these platforms, with the ultimate goal of understanding whetherthey serve a criminal or a profit-driven agenda.",

            "abstract": "Among the now numerous alternative cryptocurrencies derived from Bitcoin, Zcash is often touted as the one with the strongest anonymity guarantees, due to its basis in well-regarded cryptographic research. In this paper, we examine the extent to which anonymity is achieved in the deployed version of Zcash. We investigate all facets of anonymity in Zcash's transactions, ranging from its transparent transactions to the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately. We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage.",

The existence of this communication relies on the level of Trust among users and entities. Trust is a complex issue as it lies in the complexity of human behavior. Thus, dynamic trust management is important as it enables the assessment of the trustworthiness of communicating peers. In this paper we present extensions of our previous work, which covered the theory behind a novel 3-D trust model. More specifically, we discuss the design and implementation of the aforementioned 3-D model and link it to a simulation environment for proof or concept verification. Further, we describe the adaptation of this trust model to capture different behaviors in a distributed and dynamic environment. An example application is also provided.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for wireless and mobile networks that guarantee secure and reliable data communication among users. To enable data exchanges, authentication mechanisms need to be in place to dynamically verify the identity of communicating parties. Authentication is used as a base to deploy security mechanisms and exchange information. However, authentication is static and it does not provide any information regarding the trustworthiness of communicating peers. Trust is a complex issue as it lies in the complexity of human behavior. Trust has typically been evaluated by measuring individual performance on a specific functionality or generally measuring specific behavior and translating it to a trust value. In this paper we define properties and requirements for trust at the individual and system level. Contrary to previous work, we consider trust in a non-linear manner that matches behavior in social networks. In addition, trust evaluations do not only take into account individual behavior independently, but also focus on its impact on the system. Finally, we present a novel 3-d trust model that is structured to reflect the overall trustworthiness of a system and responds to changes in node behavior. It provides a simplified and concurrently dynamic way of aggregating and representing trust and can be used to guide network functionalities, such as routing, or more generally evaluate trust in collaborative modes of interaction among individuals.
