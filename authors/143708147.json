            "abstract": "The accurate prediction of lexical relations between words is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The most recent advances in this direction come with the use of pre-trained language models (PTLMs). A PTLM typically needs \u201cwell-formed\u201d verbalized text to interact with it, either to fine-tune it or to exploit it. However, there are indications that commonly used PTLMs already encode enough linguistic knowledge to allow the use of minimal (or none) textual context for some linguistically motivated tasks, thus notably reducing human effort, the need for data pre-processing, and favoring techniques that are language neutral since do not rely on syntactic structures. In this work, we explore this idea for the tasks of lexical relation classification (LRC) and graded Lexical Entailment (LE). After fine-tuning PTLMs for LRC with different verbalizations, our evaluation results show that very simple prompts are competitive for LRC and significantly outperform graded LE SoTA. In order to gain a better insight into this phenomenon, we perform a number of quantitative statistical analyses on the results, as well as a qualitative visual exploration based on embedding projections.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an overview of current technologies for cross-lingual link discovery, and we discuss challenges, experiences and prospects of their application to under-resourced languages. We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

Next, we give a general overview of existing vocabularies and models for different categories of LLD resource. After which we look at some of the latest developments in community standards and initiatives including descriptions of recent work on the OntoLex-Lemon model, a survey of recent initiatives in linguistic annotation and LLD, and a discussion of the LLD metadata vocabularies META-SHARE and lime. In the next part of the paper, we focus on the influence of projects on LLD models and vocabularies, starting with a general survey of relevant projects, before dedicating individual sections to a number of recent projects and their impact on LLD vocabularies and models. Finally, in the conclusion, we look ahead at some future challenges for LLD models and vocabularies. The appendix to the paper consists of a brief introduction to the OntoLex-Lemon model.",

This is the first appearance of CIDER-LM in OAEI where it only participated in MultiFarm, the track for cross-lingual ontology alignment evaluation. The matching system uses a pre-trained multilingual language model based on transformers, fine-tuned using the openly available portion of the MultiFarm dataset. The model calculates the vector embeddings of the labels associated to every ontology entity and its context. The confidence degree between matching entities is computed as the cosine similarity between their associated embeddings. CIDER-LM is novel in the use of multilingual language models for cross-lingual ontology matching. Its initial version obtained promising results in the OAEI\u201922 MultiFarm track, attaining a modest precision but the best overall performance in recall.",

The task evaluation results show that graph exploration is very effective, accomplishing relatively high precision and recall values in comparison with the other participating systems, while cross-lingual embeddings reaches high precision but smaller recall.",

            "abstract": "Bilingual electronic dictionaries contain collections of lexical entries in two languages, with explicitly declared translation relations between such entries. Nevertheless, they are typically developed in isolation, in their own formats and accessible through proprietary APIs. In this paper we propose the use of Semantic Web techniques to make translations available on the Web to be consumed by other semantic enabled resources in a direct manner, based on standard languages and query means. In particular, we describe the conversion of the Apertium family of bilingual dictionaries and lexicons into RDF (Resource Description Framework) and how their data have been made accessible on the Web as linked data. As a result, all the converted dictionaries (many of them covering under-resourced languages) are connected among them and can be easily traversed from one to another to obtain, for instance, translations between language pairs not originally connected in any of the original dictionaries.",

            "title": "Leveraging RDF Graphs for Crossing Multiple Bilingual Dictionaries",
            "abstract": "The experiments presented here exploit the properties of the Apertium RDF Graph, principally cycle density and nodes\u2019 degree, to automatically generate new translation relations between words, and therefore to enrich existing bilingual dictionaries with new entries. Currently, the Apertium RDF Graph includes data from 22 Apertium bilingual dictionaries and constitutes a large unified array of linked lexical entries and translations that are available and accessible on the Web (http://linguistic.linkeddata.es/apertium/). In particular, its graph structure allows for interesting exploitation opportunities, some of which are addressed in this paper. Two \u2018massive\u2019 experiments are reported: in the first one, the original EN-ES translation set was removed from the Apertium RDF Graph and a new EN-ES version was generated. The results were compared against the previously removed EN-ES data and against the Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary. In the second experiment, a new non-existent EN-FR translation set was generated. In this case the results were compared against a converted wiktionary English-French file. The results we got are really good and perform well for the extreme case of correlated polysemy. This lead us to address the possibility to use cycles and nodes degree to identify potential oddities in the source data. If cycle density proves efficient when considering potential targets, we can assume that in dense graphs nodes with low degree may indicate potential errors.",
