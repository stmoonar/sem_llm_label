            "abstract": "Language models have the potential to assess mental health using social media data. By analyzing online posts and conversations, these models can detect patterns indicating mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. They examine keywords, language markers, and sentiment to gain insights into an individual\u2019s mental well-being. This information is crucial for early detection, intervention, and support, improving mental health care and prevention strategies. However, using language models for mental health assessments from social media has two limitations: (1) They do not compare posts against clinicians\u2019 diagnostic processes, and (2) It\u2019s challenging to explain language model outputs using concepts that the clinician can understand, i.e., clinician-friendly explanations. In this study, we introduce Process Knowledge-infused Learning (PK-iL), a new learning paradigm that layers clinical process knowledge structures on language model outputs, enabling clinician-friendly explanations of the underlying language model predictions. We rigorously test our methods on existing benchmark datasets, augmented with such clinical process knowledge, and release a new dataset for assessing suicidality. PKiL performs competitively, achieving a 70% agreement with users, while other XAI methods only achieve 47% agreement (average inter-rater agreement of 0.72). Our evaluations demonstrate that PK-iL effectively explains model predictions to clinicians.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based human activity recognition (HAR) methods have shown promise in the applications of health Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless body sensor networks (BSNs). However, adapting these methods to new users in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the cross-subject issue. To solve this issue, we propose ActiveSelfHAR, a framework that combines active learning\u2019s benefit of sparsely acquiring informative samples with actual labels and self-training\u2019s benefit of effectively utilizing unlabeled data to adapt the HAR model to the target domain, i.e., the new users. ActiveSelfHAR consists of several key steps. First, we utilize the model from the source domain to select and label the domain invariant samples, forming a self-training set. Second, we leverage the distribution information of the self-training set to identify and annotate samples located around the class boundaries, forming a core set. Third, we augment the core set by considering the spatiotemporal relationships among the samples in the nonself-training set. Finally, we combine the self-training set and augmented core set to construct a diverse training set in the target domain and fine-tune the HAR model. Through leave-one-subject-out validation on three IMU-based data sets and one EMG-based data set, our method achieves mean HAR accuracies of 95.20%, 82.06%, 89.52%, and 92.82%, respectively. Our method demonstrates similar HAR accuracies to the upper bound, i.e., fine-tuning framework with approximately 1% labeled data of the target data set, while significantly improving data efficiency and time cost. Our work highlights the potential of implementing user-independent HAR methods into health IoT and BSN.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a training technique that enables client devices to jointly learn a shared model by aggregating locally computed models without exposing their raw data. While most of the existing work focuses on improving the FL model accuracy, in this paper, we focus on the improving the training efficiency, which is often a hurdle for adopting FL in real world applications. Specifically, we design an efficient FL framework which jointly optimizes model accuracy, processing latency and communication efficiency, all of which are primary design considerations for real implementation of FL. Inspired by the recent success of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in solving complex control problems, we present FedMarl, a federated learning framework that relies on trained MARL agents to perform efficient run-time client selection. Experiments show that FedMarl can significantly improve model accuracy with much lower processing latency and communication cost.",

            "abstract": "Improving the performance and natural language explanations of deep learning algorithms is a priority for adoption by humans in the real world. In several domains, such as healthcare, such technology has significant potential to reduce the burden on humans by providing quality assistance at scale. However, current methods rely on the traditional pipeline of predicting labels from data, thus completely ignoring the process and guidelines used to obtain the labels. Furthermore, post hoc explanations on the data to label prediction using explainable AI (XAI) models, while satisfactory to computer scientists, leave much to be desired to the end-users due to lacking explanations of the process in terms of human-understandable concepts. We \\textit{introduce}, \\textit{formalize}, and \\textit{develop} a novel Artificial Intelligence (A) paradigm -- Process Knowledge-infused Learning (PK-iL). PK-iL utilizes a structured process knowledge that explicitly explains the underlying prediction process that makes sense to end-users. The qualitative human evaluation confirms through a annotator agreement of 0.72, that humans are understand explanations for the predictions. PK-iL also performs competitively with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.",

            "abstract": "When patients need to take medicine, particularly taking more than one kind of drug simultaneously, they should be alarmed that there possibly exists drug-drug interaction. Interaction between drugs may have a negative impact on patients or even cause death. Generally, drugs that conflict with a specific drug (or label drug) are usually described in its drug label or package insert. Since more and more new drug products come into the market, it is difficult to collect such information by manual. We take part in the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Extraction from Drug Labels challenge of Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2018, choosing task1 and task2 to automatically extract DDI related mentions and DDI relations respectively. Instead of regarding task1 as named entity recognition (NER) task and regarding task2 as relation extraction (RE) task then solving it in a pipeline, we propose a two step joint model to detect DDI and it's related mentions jointly. A sequence tagging system (CNN-GRU encoder-decoder) finds precipitants first and search its fine-grained Trigger and determine the DDI for each precipitant in the second step. Moreover, a rule based model is built to determine the sub-type for pharmacokinetic interation. Our system achieved best result in both task1 and task2. F-measure reaches 0.46 in task1 and 0.40 in task2.",
