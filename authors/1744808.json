            "abstract": "Our study focuses on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action, by identifying public attitudes on Twitter about climate change. Public consent and participation is the key factor in dealing with climate crises. However, discussions about climate change on Twitter are often influenced by the polarised beliefs that shape the discourse and divide it into communities of climate change deniers and believers. In our work, we propose a framework that helps identify different attitudes in tweets about climate change (deny, believe, ambiguous). Previous literature often lacks an efficient architecture or ignores the characteristics of climate-denier tweets. Moreover, the presence of various emotions with different levels of intensity turns out to be relevant for shaping discussions on climate change. Therefore, our paper utilizes emotion recognition and emotion intensity prediction as auxiliary tasks for our main task of stance detection. Our framework injects the words affecting the emotions embedded in the tweet to capture the overall representation of the attitude in terms of the emotions associated with it. The final task-specific and shared feature representations are fused with efficient embedding and attention techniques to detect the correct attitude of the tweet. Extensive experiments on our novel curated dataset, two publicly available climate change datasets (ClimateICWSM-2023 and ClimateStance-2022), and a benchmark dataset for stance detection (SemEval-2016) validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale language models such as DNABert and LOGO aim to learn optimal gene representations and are trained on the entire Human Reference Genome. However, standard tokenization schemes involve a simple sliding window of tokens like k-mers that do not leverage any gene-based semantics and thus may lead to (trivial) masking of easily predictable sequences and subsequently inefficient Masked Language Modeling (MLM) training. Therefore, we propose a novel masking algorithm, GeneMask, for MLM training of gene sequences, where we randomly identify positions in a gene sequence as mask centers and locally select the span around the mask center with the highest Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) to mask. We observe that in the absence of human-understandable semantics in the genomics domain (in contrast, semantic units like words and phrases are inherently available in NLP), GeneMask-based models substantially outperform the SOTA models (DNABert and LOGO) over four benchmark gene sequence classification datasets in five few-shot settings (10 to 1000-shot). More significantly, the GeneMask-based DNABert model is trained for less than one-tenth of the number of epochs of the original SOTA model. We also observe a strong correlation between top-ranked PMI tokens and conserved DNA sequence motifs, which may indicate the incorporation of latent genomic information. The codes (including trained models) and datasets are made publicly available at https://github.com/roysoumya/GeneMask.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action by focusing on identifying public attitudes toward climate change on social media platforms such as Twitter. Climate change is threatening the health of the planet and humanity. Public engagement is critical to address climate change. However, climate change conversations on Twitter tend to polarize beliefs, leading to misinformation and fake news that influence public attitudes, often dividing them into climate change believers and deniers. Our paper proposes an approach to classify the attitude of climate change tweets (believe/deny/ambiguous) to identify denier statements on Twitter. Most existing approaches for detecting stances and classifying climate change tweets either overlook deniers\u2019 tweets or do not have a suitable architecture. The relevant literature suggests that emotions and higher levels of toxicity are prevalent in climate change Twitter conversations, leading to a delay in appropriate climate action. Therefore, our work focuses on learning stance detection (main task) while exploiting the auxiliary tasks of recognizing emotions and offensive utterances. We propose a multimodal multitasking framework MEMOCLiC that captures the input data using different embedding techniques and attention frameworks, and then incorporates the learned emotional and offensive expressions to obtain an overall representation of the features relevant to the stance of the input tweet. Extensive experiments conducted on a novel curated climate change dataset and two benchmark stance detection datasets (SemEval-2016 and ClimateStance-2022) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs and Neural Flows have shown promising results in analyzing irregularly sampled time series frequently encountered in electronic health records. Based on these models, time series are typically processed with a hybrid of an initial value problem (IVP) solver and a recurrent neural network within the variational autoencoder architecture. Sequentially solving IVPs makes such models computationally less efficient. In this paper, we propose to model time series purely with continuous processes whose state evolution can be approximated directly by IVPs. This eliminates the need for recurrent computation and enables multiple states to evolve in parallel. We further fuse the encoder and decoder with one IVP solver utilizing its invertibility, which leads to fewer parameters and faster convergence. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed method can systematically outperform its predecessors, achieve state-of-the-art results, and have significant advantages in terms of data efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Given a network, it is well recognized that attributed network embedding represents each node of the network in a low-dimensional space, and, thus, brings considerable benefits for numerous graph mining tasks. In practice, a diverse set of graph tasks can be processed efficiently via the compact representation that preserves content and structure information. The majority of attributed network embedding approaches, especially, the graph neural network (GNN) algorithms, are substantially costly in either time or space due to the expensive learning process, while the randomized hashing technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which does not need learning, can speedup the embedding process at the expense of losing some accuracy. In this article, we propose the MPSketch model, which bridges the performance gap between the GNN framework and the LSH framework by adopting the LSH technique to pass messages and capture high-order proximity in a larger aggregated information pool from the neighborhood. The extensive experimental results confirm that in node classification and link prediction, the proposed MPSketch algorithm enjoys performance comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms and outperforms the existing LSH algorithms, while running faster than the GNN algorithms by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude. More precisely, MPSketch runs 2121, 1167, and 1155 times faster than GraphSAGE, GraphZoom, and FATNet on average, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of respiratory sounds is an area where deep neural networks (DNNs) may benefit clinicians and patients for diagnostic purposes due to their classification power. However, explaining the predictions made by DNNs remains a challenge. Currently, most explanation methods focus on post-hoc explanations, where a separate explanatory model is used to explain a trained DNN. Due to the complex nature of respiratory sound classification pipeline involving signal processing such as frequency analysis and wavelet analysis, post-hoc methods cannot uncover the underlying inference process of DNNs, highlighting the importance of designing DNNs with intrinsic interpretability. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining DNN for respiratory sound classification based on prototype learning. Our model explains its behavior by generating sample prototypes while attaching these prototypes to a layer inside the neural network. Furthermore, we design a scale-free interpretability mechanism, in which the model reaches its final decision by dissecting the input and looking for similarities between several parts of the input and the prototypes. The experimental findings on the largest public respiratory sound database demonstrate that our method achieves comparable, sometimes better, performance with the non-interpretable counterparts while offering state-of-the-art interpretability. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

The use of wearable devices embedded with automatic and timely AF assessment from electrocardiograms (ECGs) has shown to be promising in preventing life-threatening situations. Although deep neural networks have demonstrated superiority in model performance, their use on wearable devices is limited by the trade-off between model performance and complexity. In this work, we propose to use lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with parameterised hypercomplex (PH) layers for AF detection based on ECGs. The proposed approach trains small-scale CNNs, thus overcoming the limited computing resources on wearable devices. We show comparable performance to corresponding real-valued CNNs on two publicly available ECG datasets using significantly fewer model parameters. PH models are more flexible than other hypercomplex neural networks and can operate on any number of input ECG leads.",

Contrarily, our study attempts to identify the various stages of their journey from displacement to emplacement in the host nation. We draw insights from Gennep's seminal work, i.e., Les Rites de Passage, to identify four phases of the refugee journey: Arrival of Refugees, Temporal stay at Asylums, Rehabilitation, and Integration of Refugees into the host nation. To test our proposed framework, we have collected multimodal tweets from April 15, 2020, to March 15, 2021. A fusion of BERT+LSTM (for text inputs) and InceptionV4 (for image inputs) has reported an F1-score of 80.93%. Subsequently, to test the practical implication of our proposed model in real-time, we have considered the multimodal tweets related to the 2022 Ukrainian refugee crisis. An F1-score of 71.88 % for this 2022 crisis confirms the generalizability of our proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has become one of the biggest challenges of our time. Social media platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public awareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate crisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate change through social media, the information could create more awareness and reach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter communications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies, and often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers. In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on Twitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two attitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of Twitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes toward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely related tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change tweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection (primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The proposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention frameworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for both tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases the performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from the auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and single-task variants.",
