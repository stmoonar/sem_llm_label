            "title": "Multiresolution Fusion Convolutional Network for Open Set Human Activity Recognition",
            "abstract": "In recent years, sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) technology has been the focus of extensive research and has been successfully applied to many aspects of people\u2019s lives, but there are still some deficiencies. Most studies only distinguish daily activities and have low accuracy for easy confusing activities. In addition, many deep learning models only consider closed set HAR, but the real world contains unknown class (UC) activities that cannot be foreseen, which makes it challenging to apply these models to practice. In view of the above problems, this article proposes a multiresolution fusion convolution network (MRFC-Net) to cover the shortcoming that confusing activities are difficult to correctly identify, thus improving the accuracy of recognition. Furthermore, a multiresolution fusion convolution variational auto-encoder network (MRFC-VAE-Net) for open set HAR is proposed. According to the reconstruction loss of the network, the corresponding threshold is set to effectively classify the known and UC activities in the open set. At the same time, a rich data set named daily-abnormal activity of special group (DAASG) is constructed, which can be applied to the daily monitoring of special groups, such as prisoners and the elderly. Experiments and analyses are carried out on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM), physical activity monitoring for aging people (PAMAP2) and DAASG data sets, to prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed networks.",

            "abstract": "In recommender systems, reinforcement learning solutions have effectively boosted recommendation performance because of their ability to capture long-term user-system interaction. However, the action space of the recommendation policy is a list of items, which could be extremely large with a dynamic candidate item pool. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hyper-actor and critic learning framework where the policy decomposes the item list generation process into a hyper-action inference step and an effect-action selection step. The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to stabilize the learning process. We build simulated environments on public datasets and empirically show that our framework is superior in recommendation compared to standard RL baselines.",

            "abstract": "Aiming at the diversity of the entity mentions in the field of animal husbandry in Tibet, the reference resolution model Att-GRU-CNN based on multi-level attention mechanism is proposed. The model uses GRU network for global semantic feature learning and knowledge memory, and uses CNN network to further extract local high-level semantic features. A word-level attention layer is added on the GRU hidden layer, the feature vector of entity mention does dot product operation with the feature vector of each word, and the result is normalized and used as the weight value distribution of the words, thus, the prior knowledge that the mention is the most important in the context is given to the network; A sentence-level attention layer is added on the CNN convolution layer, the convolutional layer output and entity name library matrix do association operation, and the result is used as the weight value distribution of the sentence, so as to strengthen the relation between the sentence where the mention is located and the entity scientific name. At the same time, the data enhancement technology is used to improve the generalization ability of the model. Finally, the ablation experiment on Tibetan animal husbandry dataset verified the effectiveness of each component of the model and the superposition effect after combination; the performance comparison experiment is carried out on public datasets MUC, B3 and CEAF $\\varphi _{4}$ . The experimental results show that this model has a significant improvement over other models in the accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 score.",

It is an important topic in recommendation due to the demand for multi-task prediction considering performance and efficiency. Although MTL has been well studied and developed, there is still a lack of systematic review in the recommendation community. To fill the gap, we provide a comprehensive review of existing multi-task deep recommender systems (MTDRS) in this survey. To be specific, the problem definition of MTDRS is first given, and it is compared with other related areas. Next, the development of MTDRS is depicted and the taxonomy is introduced from the task relation and methodology aspects. Specifically, the task relation is categorized into parallel, cascaded, and auxiliary with main, while the methodology is grouped into parameter sharing, optimization, and training mechanism. The survey concludes by summarizing the application and public datasets of MTDRS and highlighting the challenges and future directions of the field.",

            "abstract": "The advances in deep learning with the ability to automatically extract advanced features have achieved a bright prospect for human activity recognition (HAR). However, the traditional HAR methods still have the deficiencies of incomplete feature extraction, which may lead to incorrect recognition results. To resolve the above problem, a novel framework for spatiotemporal multi-feature extraction on HAR called CapsGaNet is propounded, which is based on capsule and gated recurrent units (GRU) with attention mechanisms. The proposed framework involves a spatial feature extraction layer consisting of capsule blocks, a temporal feature extraction layer consisting of GRU with attention mechanisms, and an output layer. At the same time, considering the actual demands for recognizing aggressive activities in some specific scenarios like smart prison, we constructed a daily and aggressive activity dataset (DAAD). Moreover, based on the acceleration characteristics of aggressive activity, a threshold-based approach for aggressive activity detection is propounded to meet the needs of high real-time and low computational complexity in prison scenarios. The experiments are performed on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) dataset and the DAAD dataset, and the results verify that the propounded CapsGaNet could effectually improve the recognition accuracy. The proposed threshold-based approach for aggressive activity detection provides a more effective HAR way by using smart sensor devices in smart prison scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is indispensable in enhancing the richness of users\u2019 lives and helping service providers achieve more economic earnings. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based methods are remarkable in learning users\u2019 long-term or short-term behavioral dependencies. However, existing RNN-based methods lack sufficient interaction with their contexts, and at the same time, ignore the importance of non-consecutive POIs with different degrees for understanding users\u2019 behaviors. In order to solve these problems, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal model based on mogrifier LSTM and attention network (named STMLA) for next POI recommendation. The STMLA model builds a parallel structure to process the users\u2019 check-in sequences through the mogrifier LSTM and the multi-head attention network, which can achieve better contextual interaction while selectively considering nonconsecutive factors with different degrees of significance. Our STMLA algorithm explicitly integrates temporal and spatial information to capture users\u2019 long-term and short-term preferences, incorporating spatial information to build the Location-Saltant algorithm. Through extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in the next POI recommendation task.",

            "abstract": "We show how factoring the RNN-T\u2019s output distribution can significantly reduce the computation cost and power consumption for on-device ASR inference with no loss in accuracy. With the rise in popularity of neural-transducer type models like the RNN-T for on-device ASR, optimizing RNN-T\u2019s runtime efficiency is of great interest. While previous work has primarily focused on the optimization of RNN-T\u2019s acoustic encoder and predictor, this paper focuses the attention on the joiner. We show that despite being only a small part of RNN-T, the joiner has a large impact on the overall model\u2019s runtime efficiency. We propose to utilize HAT-style joiner factorization for the purpose of skipping the more expensive non-blank computation when the blank probability exceeds a certain threshold. Since the blank probability can be computed very efficiently and the RNN-T output is dominated by blanks, our proposed method leads to a 26-30% decoding speed-up and 43-53% reduction in on-device power consumption, all the while incurring no accuracy degradation and being relatively simple to implement.",
