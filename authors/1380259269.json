            "title": "Detecting Harmful Online Conversational Content towards LGBTQIA+ Individuals",
            "abstract": "Online discussions, panels, talk page edits, etc., often contain harmful conversational content i.e., hate speech, death threats and offensive language, especially towards certain demographic groups. For example, individuals who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community and/or BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) are at higher risk for abuse and harassment online. In this work, we first introduce a real-world dataset that will enable us to study and understand harmful online conversational content. Then, we conduct several exploratory data analysis experiments to gain deeper insights from the dataset. We later describe our approach for detecting harmful online Anti-LGBTQIA+ conversational content, and finally, we implement two baseline machine learning models (i.e., Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression), and fine-tune 3 pre-trained large language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and HateBERT). Our findings verify that large language models can achieve very promising performance on detecting online Anti-LGBTQIA+ conversational content detection tasks.",

            "title": "Towards a Deep Multi-layered Dialectal Language Analysis: A Case Study of African-American English",
            "abstract": "Currently, natural language processing (NLP) models proliferate language discrimination leading to potentially harmful societal impacts as a result of biased outcomes. For example, part-of-speech taggers trained on Mainstream American English (MAE) produce non-interpretable results when applied to African American English (AAE) as a result of language features not seen during training. In this work, we incorporate a human-in-the-loop paradigm to gain a better understanding of AAE speakers\u2019 behavior and their language use, and highlight the need for dialectal language inclusivity so that native AAE speakers can extensively interact with NLP systems while reducing feelings of disenfranchisement.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies show that NLP models trained on standard English texts tend to produce biased outcomes against underrepresented English varieties. In this work, we conduct a pioneering study of the English variety use of African American English (AAE) in NLI task. First, we propose CodeSwitch, a greedy unidirectional morphosyntactically-informed rule-based translation method for data augmentation. Next, we use CodeSwitch to present a preliminary study to determine if demographic language features do in fact influence models to produce false predictions. Then, we conduct experiments on two popular datasets and propose two simple, yet effective and generalizable debiasing methods. Our findings show that NLI models (e.g. BERT) trained under our proposed frameworks outperform traditional large language models while maintaining or even improving the prediction performance. In addition, we intend to release CodeSwitch, in hopes of promoting dialectal language diversity in training data to both reduce the discriminatory societal impacts and improve model robustness of downstream NLP tasks.",

            "abstract": "Since the fatal shooting of 17-year old Black teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012 by a White neighborhood watchman, George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, there has been a significant increase in digital activism addressing police-brutality related and racially-motivated incidents in the United States. In this work, we administer an innovative study of digital activism by exploiting social media as an authoritative tool to examine and analyze the linguistic cues and thematic relationships in these three mediums. We conduct a multi-level text analysis on 36,984,559 tweets to investigate users' behaviors to examine the language used and understand the impact of digital activism on social media within each social movement on a sentence-level, word-level, and topic-level. Our results show that excessive use of racially-related or prejudicial hashtags were used by the counter protests which portray potential discriminatory tendencies. Consequently, our findings highlight that social activism done by Black Lives Matter activists does not diverge from the social issues and topics involving police-brutality related and racially-motivated killings of Black individuals due to the shape of its topical graph that topics and conversations encircling the largest component directly relate to the topic of Black Lives Matter. Finally, we see that both Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter movements depict a different directive, as the topics of Blue Lives Matter or All Lives Matter do not reside in the center. These findings suggest that topics and conversations within each social movement are skewed, random or possessed racially-related undertones, and thus, deviating from the prominent social injustice issues.",

            "abstract": "To attract unsuspecting readers, news article headlines and abstracts are often written with speculative sentences or clauses. Male dominance in the news is very evident, whereas females are seen as \u201ceye candy\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d, and are underrepresented and under-examined within the same news categories as their male counterparts. In this paper, we present an initial study on gender bias in news abstracts in two large English news datasets used for news recommendation and news classification. We perform three large-scale, yet effective text-analysis fairness measurements on 296,965 news abstracts. In particular, to our knowledge we construct two of the largest benchmark datasets of possessive (gender-specific and gender-neutral) nouns and attribute (career-related and family-related) words datasets1 which we will release to foster both bias and fairness research aid in developing fair NLP models to eliminate the paradox of gender bias. Our studies demonstrate that females are immensely marginalized and suffer from socially-constructed biases in the news. This paper individually devises a methodology whereby news content can be analyzed on a large scale utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques from machine learning (ML) to discover both implicit and explicit gender biases.",

            "abstract": "Recently there are increasing concerns about the fairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in real-world applications such as computer vision and recommendations. For example, recognition algorithms in computer vision are unfair to black people such as poorly detecting their faces and inappropriately identifying them as \u201cgorillas\u201d. As one crucial application of AI, dialogue systems have been extensively applied in our society. They are usually built with real human conversational data; thus they could inherit some fairness issues which are held in the real world. However, the fairness of dialogue systems has not been well investigated. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study about the fairness issues in dialogue systems. In particular, we construct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand fairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue models show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides, to mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective debiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in dialogue systems significantly. The dataset and the implementation are released to foster fairness research in dialogue systems.",

            "abstract": "Social media has been widely adopted by online users to share their opinions. Among users in signed networks, two types of opinions can be expressed. They can directly specify opinions to others via establishing positive or negative links; and they also can give opinions to content generated by others via a variety of social interactions such as commenting and rating. Intuitively these two types of opinions should be related. For example, users are likely to give positive (or negative) opinions to content from those with positive (or negative) links; and users tend to create positive (or negative) links with those that they frequently positively (or negatively) interact with. Therefore we can leverage one type of opinions to power the other. Meanwhile, they can enrich each other that can help mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start problems in the corresponding predictive tasks - link and interaction polarity predictions, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint link and interaction polarity predictions in signed networks. We first understand the correlation between these two types of opinions; and then propose a framework that can predict signed links and the polarities of interactions simultaneously. The experimental results on a real-world signed network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
