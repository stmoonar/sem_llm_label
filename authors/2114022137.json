            "title": "Distilling Causal Metaknowledge from Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the explosive increase of information facilitates the massive knowledge graphs, which in turn increase burden of people to understand and leverage the regularity behind these superficial facts. Therefore, the metaknowledge, defined as the knowledge about knowledge, is proposed to identify complex processes of knowledge production and consumption. Unfortunately, even though the current correlation-based rule mining methods in knowledge graph distill the rule-formed metaknowledge, they can not explain the processes of knowledge production. In this paper, we focus on capturing the metaknowledge with causality which is generally regarded as one of the most promising techniques to reveal the interactions between components in the complex system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to interpret the knowledge graph from the causal perspective. For this purpose, we propose a causal metaknowledge method for link prediction, which achieves entity-level link prediction by discovering concept-level topological causality. Specifically, we first formalize causal metaknowledge as causal rule, following the form of logical rule. Then, we transform the relational data into propositional data to learn the causal relationships between topological structures. And an efficient algorithm for discovering local causal relationships is proposed using the d -seperation criterion. Eventually, the causal rules generated based on the mined relationships are used for link prediction. Both simulation-based and real data-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially under the Out-of-Distribution(OoD) settings.",

            "abstract": "In an ideal world, evidence of disparities motivates people to fight them; in reality, disparities often \u201creproduce\u201d themselves. Upon seeing the police stopping some groups at higher rates, people may believe members of these groups are more prone to crime and therefore seek more punitive measures against them. In this paper, we argue that even without stereotypic associations linking some groups with crime, people may still reproduce observed disparities via rational inference: Assuming an agent is knowledgeable about a target trait\u2019s \u201chit rates\u201d in different groups and acts to maximize the expected utility of checking, you may infer that groups checked more often have higher hit rates. In Experiment 1, this \u201cNa\u0131\u0308ve Utility Calculus\u201d successfully captured how people inferred the hit rate in a population based on how often an agent sampled from it (\u201ccheck rate\u201d). In Experiment 2, when hit rates in the samples were revealed, people predominantly relied on this new information more heavily than the agent\u2019s check rates. Our work both provided a novel explanation for why people reproduce disparities and a potential intervention to combat such a tendency.",

            "abstract": "Intervention selection is at once crucial in causal learning and challenging for causal learners. While the optimal strategy is maximizing the expected information gain (EIG), both children and adults often combine it with suboptimal ones such as the positive test strategy (PTS). In the current study, we sought to facilitate causal learning from intervention by asking 5to 7-year-olds to explain why they chose a certain intervention to identify the true structure of a three-node causal system that might work in one of two ways. Our findings suggest that while engaging in self-explaining did not help children select more informative interventions, asking them to think about their intervention choices (explaining or reporting) might help them better utilize interventional data to infer causal structures.",

            "abstract": "Like scientists, children have a sharp sense of when and how to seek evidence, but when it comes to generating causal interventions, their performance often falls short of normative information-theoretic metrics such as the expected information gain (EIG). We looked at whether this deviation resulted from mixing discriminatory strategies such as maximizing EIG with confirmatory strategies such as the positive test strategy (PTS). Thirty-nine 5to -7-year-olds solved 6 puzzles where they had one opportunity to intervene on a three-node causal system to identify the correct structure from two possibilities. Children\u2019s intervention choices were better fit by a Bayesian model that incorporated EIG and PTS compared to alternative models that only considered a single strategy or selected interventions at random. Our findings suggest that children\u2019s intervention strategy may be a combination of discrimination and confirmation.",

            "abstract": "Humans have a strong \u201ccognitive compulsion\u201d to infer intentional agents from violation of randomness and such an agency\u2013nonrandomness link emerges early in development. In two studies, we directly quantified, formalized, and compared both ends of this link for the first time. In Experiment 1, two groups of participants viewed the same 256 binary sequences (e.g., AABAAABA) and classified each as generated by agents/non-agents or by nonrandom/random processes. We found a strong correlation between two judgments: sequences viewed as more agentive also tended to be judged as less random. In Experiment 2, another two groups were asked to produce sequences that others might appreciate as agentive or nonrandom. Participant-generated sequences in the two conditions had a substantial overlap, indicating common guiding principles of agency and nonrandomness generation. Taken together, the present studies provide evidence for a shared cognitive basis of agency detection and subjective randomness.",
