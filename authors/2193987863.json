            "title": "Parallel Training: An ACP-Based Training Framework for Iterative Learning in Uncertain Driving Spaces",
            "abstract": "The traffic environment and driving behaviors are of great complexity and uncertainty in our physical world. Therefore, training in the digital world with low cost and diverse complexities become popular for autonomous driving in recent years. However, the current training methods tend to be limited to static data sets and deterministic models that do not sufficiently take into account the uncertainty and diversity prevalent in real traffic scenarios. These approaches also limit more possibilities for the comprehensive development and optimization of vision systems. In this paper, we develop a parallel training method based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) for the intelligent optimization and learning of the aforementioned agents in uncertain driving spaces. Parallel training creates a virtual driving space following the instruction of the ACP approach and conducts large-scale rehearsal experiments for possible scenarios. By enhancing the diversity of virtual scenarios, intelligent vehicles are trained to respond and adapt to the diverse uncertainties in the physical real-world driving space. Specifically, parallel training first proposes a standard operating procedure for intelligent driving systems, namely the projection-emergence-convergence-operation (PECO) loop. Digital quadruplets for parallel training, i.e., physical, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive coaches, are also proposed. With the guidance of parallel training, virtual and real-world driving spaces are set up in parallel and interact frequently. They are closely linked and unified in opposition to each other, ultimately building a parallel driving system that fulfills safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness (6S).",

            "abstract": "Aiming to provide a novel paradigm of oil fields, metaverses-based parallel oil fields are proposed in this article. Compared with the existing smart/intelligent oil fields in cyber\u2013physical systems (CPS), parallel oil fields can take human factors into full consideration and expand the operation space to cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSS), which can be regarded as the abstract and scientific explanation of metaverses. In the proposed parallel oil fields, there are three kinds of workers (human workers, digital workers, and robotic workers) coordinating to construct a more reliable and intelligent oil field. Furthermore, the framework and methodology of parallel oil fields are illustrated by parallel systems and the artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel executions (ACP) approach. Based on the proposed framework, parallel oil fields are capable of generating a more trustworthy artificial system and guaranteeing the realization of the 6S (safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness) goal. Finally, based on dynamometer cards, fault diagnosis of sucker rod pumping systems (SRPS) is investigated in parallel oil fields.",

            "abstract": "The printed circuit boards (PCBs) industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in recent decades. The PCB manufacturing process is highly complicated and severely affected by social factors, which makes it very important to conduct integrated inspection, assuring and improving the production quality. In this article, we propose an artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution-based integrated inspection method in cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSS) to realize smart manufacturing. In this inspection system, rather than simply performing modeling, analysis, and control, we perform descriptive intelligence to construct production processes with limited multimodal information, perform predictive intelligence to conduct defect detection and defect prediction, and perform prescriptive intelligence to achieve defect diagnosis and defect management. In this way, our inspection system could offer a learning and training platform for workers to master professional inspection skills, provide an experimentation and evaluation platform for product defect monitoring and early warnings, and supply guidance about defect management and control to improve manufacturing processes. For technical implementation, we leverage a Transformer-based foundation model to achieve knowledge reasoning and human\u2013computer interaction. As a result, we provide an innovative solution to cope with the challenges of quality inspection in current smart manufacturing, and expect its further applications in the PCB industry.",

            "abstract": "Industrial processes are typical cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSSs), where the effective management of employees and the efficient control of machines play important roles. Traditional industries heavily rely on human labor and neglect the development of collection\u2013utilization\u2013transmission integrated information loops, thereby leading to high costs and low efficiency in operational procedures. To facilitate the natural interactions and smart operations for humans and machines, industrial foundation models (IFMs) based on metaverses are proposed in this article, serving as the operating systems of industrial parallel machines that provide sustainable data resources and scenarios for management and control experiments. On this basis, IFM comprised of vision foundation models, language foundation models, as well as operational foundation models, are constructed to manage resources in industrial parallel machines and provides comprehensive services for industrial procedures. On the one hand, IFM can efficiently manage various resources including computing power, digital assets, enterprise resources, and platform I/O via the proposed CPSS-based competing, sharing, scheduling, monitoring, allocating, and recovering mechanisms. On the other hand, imaginative intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and algorithmic intelligence can be achieved through vivid visualization of vision foundation models, natural conversations of language foundation models, and smart manipulation of operational foundation models. With the proposed IFM, cyber\u2013physical\u2013social intelligence (CPSI) can be achieved to enhance the efficient management and control of industrial processes.",
