            "title": "Disentangling Degree-related Biases and Interest for Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding",
            "abstract": "The goal of directed network embedding is to represent the nodes in a given directed network as embeddings that preserve the asymmetric relationships between nodes. While a number of directed network embedding methods have been proposed, we empirically show that the existing methods lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities against degree-related distributional shifts. To mitigate this problem, we propose ODIN (Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding), a new directed NE method where we model multiple factors in the formation of directed edges. Then, for each node, ODIN learns multiple embeddings, each of which preserves its corresponding factor, by disentangling interest factors and biases related to in- and out-degrees of nodes. Our experiments on four real-world directed networks demonstrate that disentangling multiple factors enables ODIN to yield out-of-distribution generalized embeddings that are consistently effective under various degrees of shifts in degree distributions. Specifically, ODIN universally outperforms 9 state-of-the-art competitors in 2 LP tasks on 4 real-world datasets under both identical distribution (ID) and non-ID settings.

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn the representation of graph-structured data, and their expressiveness can be further enhanced by inferring node relations for propagation. Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the weight of its propagation. Despite their popularity, the discussion on deep graph attention and its unique challenges has been limited. In this work, we investigate some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AEROGNN, a novel GNN architecture designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64). On 9 out of 12 node classification benchmarks, AERO-GNN outperforms the baseline GNNs, highlighting the advantages of deep graph attention.

            "abstract": "Graphs are a powerful mathematical model, and they are used to represent real-world structures in various fields. In many applications, real-world structures with high connectivity and robustness are preferable. For enhancing the connectivity and robustness of graphs, two operations, adding edges and anchoring nodes, have been extensively studied. However, merging nodes, which is a realistic operation in many scenarios (e.g., bus station reorganization, multiple team formation), has been overlooked. In this work, we study the problem of improving graph cohesiveness by merging nodes. First, we formulate the problem mathematically using the size of the k-truss, for a given k, as the objective. Then, we prove the NP-hardness and non-modularity of the problem. After that, we develop BATMAN, a fast and effective algorithm for choosing sets of nodes to be merged, based on our theoretical findings and empirical observations. Lastly, we demonstrate the superiority of BATMAN over several baselines, in terms of speed and effectiveness, through extensive experiments on fourteen real-world graphs.",

            "abstract": "Real-world graphs are dynamic, constantly evolving with new interactions, such as financial transactions in financial networks. \nTemporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have been developed to effectively capture the evolving patterns in dynamic graphs.\nWhile these models have demonstrated their superiority, being widely adopted in various important fields, their vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks remain largely unexplored.\nIn this paper, we propose T-SPEAR, a simple and effective adversarial attack method for link prediction on continuous-time dynamic graphs, focusing on investigating the vulnerabilities of TGNNs.\nSpecifically, before the training procedure of a victim model, which is a TGNN for link prediction, we inject edge perturbations to the data that are unnoticeable in terms of the four constraints we propose, and yet effective enough to cause malfunction of the victim model. \nMoreover, we propose a robust training approach T-SHIELD to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks.\nBy using edge filtering and enforcing temporal smoothness to node embeddings, we enhance the robustness of the victim model.\nOur experimental study shows that T-SPEAR significantly degrades the victim model's performance on link prediction tasks, and even more, our attacks are transferable to other TGNNs, which differ from the victim model assumed by the attacker.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that T-SHIELD effectively filters out adversarial edges and exhibits robustness against adversarial attacks, surpassing the link prediction performance of the naive TGNN by up to 11.2% under T-SPEAR.\nThe code and datasets are available at https://github.com/wooner49/T-spear-shield",

            "title": "Graphlets over Time: A New Lens for Temporal Network Analysis",
            "abstract": "Graphs are widely used for modeling various types of interactions, such as email communications and online discussions. Many of such real-world graphs are temporal, and specifically, they grow over time with new nodes and edges. Counting the instances of each graphlet (i.e., an induced subgraph isomorphism class) has been successful in characterizing local structures of graphs, with many applications. While graphlets have been extended for temporal graphs, the extensions are designed for examining temporally-local subgraphs composed of edges with close arrival times, instead of long-term changes in local structures. In this paper, as a new lens for temporal graph analysis, we study the evolution of distributions of graphlet instances over time in real-world graphs at three different levels (graphs, nodes, and edges). At the graph level, we first discover that the evolution patterns are significantly different from those in random graphs. Then, we suggest a graphlet transition graph for measuring the similarity of the evolution patterns of graphs, and we find out a surprising similarity between the graphs from the same domain. At the node and edge levels, we demonstrate that the local structures around nodes and edges in their early stage provide a strong signal regarding their future importance. In particular, we significantly improve the predictability of the future importance of nodes and edges using the counts of the roles (a.k.a., orbits) that they take within graphlets.",

            "abstract": "A hypergraph is a data structure composed of nodes and hyperedges, where each hyperedge is an any-sized subset of nodes. Due to the flexibility in hyperedge size, hypergraphs represent group interactions (e.g., co-authorship by more than two authors) more naturally and accurately than ordinary graphs. Interestingly, many real-world systems modeled as hypergraphs contain edge-dependent node labels, i.e., node labels that vary depending on hyperedges. For example, on co-authorship datasets, the same author (i.e., a node) can be the primary author in a paper (i.e., a hyperedge) but the corresponding author in another paper (i.e., another hyperedge). In this work, we introduce a classification of edge-dependent node labels as a new problem. This problem can be used as a benchmark task for hypergraph neural networks, which recently have attracted great attention, and also the usefulness of edge-dependent node labels has been verified in various applications. To tackle this problem, we propose WHATsNet, a novel hypergraph neural network that represents the same node differently depending on the hyperedges it participates in by reflecting its varying importance in the hyperedges. To this end, WHATsNet models the relations between nodes within each hyperedge, using their relative centrality as positional encodings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that WHATsNet significantly and consistently outperforms ten competitors on six real-world hypergraphs, and we also show successful applications of WHATsNet to (a) ranking aggregation, (b) node clustering, and (c) product return prediction.",

To address the problem, we propose an algorithm named REALS for robust and efficient batch image alignment through simultaneous transformation and low rank and sparse decomposition. REALS is constructed upon our finding that the low rank subspace can be recovered via linear projection, which allows us to perform simultaneous image alignment and decomposition with gradient-based updates. REALS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in terms of accuracy and speed compared to the state-of-the-art robust image alignment algorithms.",

            "abstract": "How can we find meaningful clusters in a graph robustly against noise edges? Graph clustering (i.e., dividing nodes into groups of similar ones) is a fundamental problem in graph analysis with applications in various fields. Recent studies have demonstrated that graph neural network (GNN) based approaches yield promising results for graph clustering. However, we observe that their performance degenerates significantly on graphs with noise edges, which are prevalent in practice. In this work, we propose MetaGC for robust GNN-based graph clustering. MetaGC employs a decomposable clustering loss function, which can be rephrased as a sum of losses over node pairs. We add a learnable weight to each node pair, and MetaGC adaptively adjusts the weights of node pairs using meta-weighting so that the weights of meaningful node pairs increase and the weights of less-meaningful ones (e.g., noise edges) decrease. We show empirically that MetaGC learns weights as intended and consequently outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based competitors, even when they are equipped with separate denoising schemes, on five real-world graphs under varying levels of noise.

            "abstract": "Many real-world interactions (e.g., researcher collaborations and email communication) occur among multiple entities. These group interactions are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. In graphs, transitivity is helpful to understand the connections between node pairs sharing a neighbor, and it has extensive applications in various domains. Hypergraphs, an extension of graphs, are designed to represent group relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no examination regarding the transitivity of real-world group interactions. In this work, we investigate the transitivity of group interactions in real-world hypergraphs. We first suggest intuitive axioms as necessary characteristics of hypergraph transitivity measures. Then, we propose a principled hypergraph transitivity measure HyperTrans, which satisfies all the proposed axioms, with a fast computation algorithm Fast-HyperTrans. After that, we analyze the transitivity patterns in real-world hypergraphs distinguished from those in random hypergraphs. Lastly, we propose a scalable hypergraph generator THera. It reproduces the observed transitivity patterns by leveraging community structures, which are pervasive in real-world hypergraphs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kswoo97/hypertrans.",
