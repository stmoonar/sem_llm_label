            "title": "Lessons Lost: Incident Response in the Age of Cyber Insurance and Breach Attorneys",
            "abstract": "Incident Response (IR) allows victim \ufb01rms to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents. It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly in\ufb02uenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The \ufb01rst stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR \ufb01rms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing initiatives to offer central bank money to consumers in the form of retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) have triggered discussions on its optimal design. So far, the perspective of potential users has not been considered widely. To strengthen this, we survey 2006 Austrian residents using a tailored questionnaire on attitudes towards a digital euro, selected technical features as well as potential security and privacy concerns. Only about half of the surveyed respondents express at least some interest in a digital euro. This subsample tends to attribute more importance to security aspects than to transaction data privacy. Similarly, offline functionality is preferred over a feature to make direct payments between persons. Our findings suggest central banks to embrace a more user-centric design of CBDC. This effort should include communicating the key concepts and benefits to the potential users.",

            "abstract": "Media reports show an alarming increase of data breaches at providers of cybersecurity products and services. Since the exposed records may reveal security-relevant data, such incidents cause undue burden and create the risk of re-victimization to individuals whose personal data gets exposed. In pursuit of examining a broad spectrum of the downstream effects on victims, we surveyed 104 persons who purchased specialized devices for the secure storage of crypto-assets and later fell victim to a breach of customer data. Our case study reveals common nuisances (i.e., spam, scams, phishing e-mails) as well as previously unseen attack vectors (e.g., involving tampered devices), which are possibly tied to the breach. A few victims report losses of digital assets as a form of the harm. We find that our participants exhibit heightened safety concerns, appear skeptical about litigation efforts, and demonstrate the ability to differentiate between the quality of the security product and the circumstances of the breach. We derive implications for the cybersecurity industry at large, and point out methodological challenges in data breach research.",

            "abstract": "Introduced in 1991, libjpeg has become a well-established library for processing JPEG images. Many libraries in high-level languages use libjpeg under the hood. So far, little attention has been paid to the fact that different versions of the library produce different outputs for the same input. This may have implications on security-related applications, such as image forensics or steganalysis, where evidence is generated by tracking small, imperceptible changes in JPEG-compressed signals. This paper systematically analyses all libjpeg versions since 1998, including the forked libjpeg-turbo (in its latest version). It compares the outputs of compression and decompression operations for a range of parameter settings. We identify up to three distinct behaviors for compression and up to six for decompression.",

This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program features a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Workshop topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

            "abstract": "Authorization is challenging in distributed systems that cannot rely on the identification of nodes. Proof-of-work offers an alternative gate-keeping mechanism, but its probabilistic nature is incompatible with conventional security definitions. Recent related work establishes concrete bounds for the failure probability of Bitcoin's sequential proof-of-work mechanism. We propose a new family of state replication protocols that use parallel proof-of-work. Our bottom-up design from an agreement sub-protocol allows us to give concrete bounds for the failure probability in adversarial synchronous networks. State updates can be sufficiently secure to support commits after one block, removing the risk of double-spending in many applications. We offer guidance on the optimal choice of parameters for a wide range of network and attacker assumptions. Simulations show that the proposed construction is robust even against partial violations of our design assumptions.",

            "abstract": "One of the challenges in steganalysis based on machine learning is cover-source mismatch (CSM). It occurs when a detector is trained on cover and stego pairs generated from one data source and then applied to data of unknown type from a different source. The mismatch leads to an increase of the classification error, which corresponds to a loss of detection performance. This paper studies how much the implementation of the JPEG compression and decompression contributes to the CSM of color image steganalysis. Specifically, it studies the differences between libjpeg versions 6b and 7. The impact on the CSM is measured for J-UNIWARD embedding using JPEG and spatial rich models with an ensemble classifier. It is observed that the use of different libjpeg versions may cause CSM. The error is large when different libjpeg versions are used for feature extraction, and barely measurable when different versions are used for the generation of cover and stego pairs.",
