            "title": "CADRL: Category-aware Dual-agent Reinforcement Learning for Explainable Recommendations over Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely adopted to mitigate data sparsity and address cold-start issues in recommender systems. While existing KGs-based recommendation methods can predict user preferences and demands, they fall short in generating explicit recommendation paths and lack explainability. As a step beyond the above methods, recent advancements utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to find suitable items for a given user via explainable recommendation paths. However, the performance of these solutions is still limited by the following two points. (1) Lack of ability to capture contextual dependencies from neighboring information. (2) The excessive reliance on short recommendation paths due to efficiency concerns. To surmount these challenges, we propose a category-aware dual-agent reinforcement learning (CADRL) model for explainable recommendations over KGs. Specifically, our model comprises two components: (1) a category-aware gated graph neural network that jointly captures context-aware item representations from neighboring entities and categories, and (2) a dual-agent RL framework where two agents efficiently traverse long paths to search for suitable items. Finally, experimental results show that CADRL outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.",

            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-hop reasoning has become an interpretable way for knowledge graph reasoning owing to its persuasive explanations for the predicted results, but the reasoning performance of these methods drops significantly over few-shot relations (only contain few triplets). To address this problem, recent studies introduce meta-learning into RL-based reasoning methods. However, the performance of these studies is still limited due to the following points: (1) the overall reasoning accuracy is impaired due to the low reasoning accuracies over some hard relations; (2) the reasoning process becomes laborious and ineffective owing to the existence of noisy data; (3) the generalizability is negatively affected due to the lack of knowledge-sharing. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel model HMLS consisting of two modules HHML (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Meta-reinforcement Learning) and HHS (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Sampling). Specifically, HHML contains the following two components: (1) a hardness-aware RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by training hardness-aware batches and reducing noise; (2) a knowledge-sharing meta-learning adapts to few-shot relations by exploiting common features in the hierarchical relation structure. The other module HHS generates hardness-aware batches from relation and relation-cluster levels.

            "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) model the temporal evolution of events and have recently attracted increasing attention. Since TKGs are intrinsically incomplete, it is necessary to reason out missing elements. Although existing TKG reasoning methods have the ability to predict missing future events, they fail to generate explicit reasoning paths and lack explainability. As reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-hop reasoning on traditional knowledge graphs starts showing superior explainability and performance in recent advances, it has opened up opportunities for exploring RL techniques on TKG reasoning. However, the performance of RL-based TKG reasoning methods is limited due to: (1) lack of ability to capture temporal evolution and semantic dependence jointly; (2) excessive reliance on manually designed rewards. To overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptive reinforcement learning model based on attention mechanism (DREAM) to predict missing elements in the future. Specifically, the model contains two components: (1) a multi-faceted attention representation learning method that captures semantic dependence and temporal evolution jointly; (2) an adaptive RL framework that conducts multi-hop reasoning by adaptively learning the reward functions. Experimental results demonstrate DREAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on public datasets.",

However, the natural incompleteness has significantly hindered the applications of MKGs. To tackle the problem, existing studies employ the embedding-based reasoning models to infer the missing knowledge after fusing the multi-modal features. However, the reasoning performance of these methods is limited due to the following problems: (1) ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex reasoning ability as well as inability to conduct the multi-hop reasoning which is able to infer more missing knowledge. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel model entitled MMKGR (Multi-hop Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Reasoning).

            "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proved to be more suitable than reinforcement learning for path planning in large-scale scenarios. In order to more effectively complete the DRL-based collaborative path planning in crowd evacuation, it is necessary to consider the space expansion problem brought by the increase of the number of agents. In addition, it is often faced with complicated circumstances, such as exit selection and congestion in crowd evacuation. However, few existing works have integrated these two aspects jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a planning approach for crowd evacuation based on the improved DRL algorithm, which will improve evacuation efficiency for large-scale crowd path planning. First, we propose a framework of congestion detection-based multi-agent reinforcement learning, the framework divides the crowd into leaders and followers and simulates leaders with a multi-agent system, it considers the congestion detection area is set up to evaluate the degree of congestion at each exit. Next, under the specification of this framework, we propose the improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, which adds the mean field network to maximize the returns of other agents, enables all agents to maximize the performance of a collaborative planning task in our training period. Then, we implement the hierarchical path planning method, which upper layer is based on the IMADDPG algorithm to solve the global path, and lower layer uses the reciprocal velocity obstacles method to avoid collisions in crowds. Finally, we simulate the proposed method with the crowd simulation system. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",
