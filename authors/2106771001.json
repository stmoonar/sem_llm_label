            "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention because it can self-supervisedly extract low-dimensional representation of graph data. InfoNCE-based loss function is widely used in graph contrastive learning, which pulls the representations of positive pairs close to each other and pulls the representations of negative pairs away from each other. Recent works mainly focus on designing new augmentation methods or sampling strategies. However, we argue that the widely used InfoNCE-based methods may contain an implicit conflict which seriously confuses models when learning from negative pairs. This conflict is engendered by the encoder's message-passing mechanism and the InfoNCE loss function. As a result, the learned representations between negative samples cannot be far away from each other, compromising the model performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to report and analysis this conflict of GCL. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective method called Partial ignored Graph Contrastive Learning (PiGCL). Specifically, PiGCL first dynamically captures the conflicts during training by detecting the gradient of representation similarities. It then enables the loss function to ignore the conflict, allowing the encoder to adaptively learn the ignored information without self-supervised samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Social Internet of Things (SIoT), a promising and emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (i.e., things), paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation. Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward way such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node characteristics, which ignores the valuable semantic knowledge attached to nodes. Moreover, the underlying structure of SIoT is usually complex, including both the heterogeneous graph structure and pairwise trust relationships, which renders hard to preserve the properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. To address these aforementioned problems, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced graph neural network (KGTrust) for better trust evaluation in SIoT. Specifically, we first extract useful knowledge from users\u2019 comment behaviors and external structured triples related to object descriptions, in order to gain a deeper insight into the semantics of users and objects. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative convolutional layer that utilizes heterogeneous graph structure, node semantics, and augmented trust relationships to learn node embeddings from the perspective of a user as a trustor or a trustee, effectively capturing multi-aspect properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. Finally, a trust prediction layer is developed to estimate the trust relationships between pairwise nodes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of KGTrust over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "T2-GNN: Graph Neural Networks for Graphs with Incomplete Features and Structure via Teacher-Student Distillation",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a prevailing technique for tackling various analysis tasks on graph data. A key premise for the remarkable performance of GNNs relies on complete and trustworthy initial graph descriptions (i.e., node features and graph structure), which is often not satisfied since real-world graphs are often incomplete due to various unavoidable factors. In particular, GNNs face greater challenges when both node features and graph structure are incomplete at the same time. The existing methods either focus on feature completion or structure completion. They usually rely on the matching relationship between features and structure, or employ joint learning of node representation and feature (or structure) completion in the hope of achieving mutual benefit. However, recent studies confirm that the mutual interference between features and structure leads to the degradation of GNN performance. When both features and structure are incomplete, the mismatch between features and structure caused by the missing randomness exacerbates the interference between the two, which may trigger incorrect completions that negatively affect node representation. To this end, in this paper we propose a general GNN framework based on teacher-student distillation to improve the performance of GNNs on incomplete graphs, namely T2-GNN. To avoid the interference between features and structure, we separately design feature-level and structure-level teacher models to provide targeted guidance for student model (base GNNs, such as GCN) through distillation. Then we design two personalized methods to obtain well-trained feature and structure teachers. To ensure that the knowledge of the teacher model is comprehensively and effectively distilled to the student model, we further propose a dual distillation mode to enable the student to acquire as much expert knowledge as possible. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new framework on graphs with incomplete features and structure.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are potent models of complex systems. In practice, many nodes in an HIN have their attributes unspecified, resulting in significant performance degradation for supervised and unsupervised representation learning. We developed an unsupervised heterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach for analyzing HINs with missing attributes (HGCA). HGCA adopts a contrastive learning strategy to unify attribute completion and representation learning in an unsupervised heterogeneous framework. To deal with a large number of missing attributes and the absence of labels in unsupervised scenarios, we proposed an augmented network to capture the semantic relations between nodes and attributes to achieve a fine-grained attribute completion. Extensive experiments on three large real-world HINs demonstrated the superiority of HGCA over several state-of-the-art methods. The results also showed that the complemented attributes by HGCA can improve the performance of existing HIN models.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) is a very popular technique for the modeling and analysis of heterogeneous graphs. Most existing HGNN-based approaches are supervised or semi-supervised learning methods requiring graphs to be annotated, which is costly and time-consuming. Self-supervised contrastive learning has been proposed to address the problem of requiring annotated data by mining intrinsic information hidden within the given data. However, the existing contrastive learning methods are inadequate for heterogeneous graphs because they construct contrastive views only based on data perturbation or pre-defined structural properties (e.g., meta-path) in graph data while ignore the noises that may exist in both node attributes and graph topologies. We develop for the first time a novel and robust heterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach, namely HGCL, which introduces two views on respective guidance of node attributes and graph topologies and integrates and enhances them by reciprocally contrastive mechanism to better model heterogeneous graphs. In this new approach, we adopt distinct but most suitable attribute and topology fusion mechanisms in the two views, which are conducive to mining relevant information in attributes and topologies separately. We further use both attribute similarity and topological correlation to construct high-quality contrastive samples. Extensive experiments on three large real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the superiority and robustness of HGCL over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Trust evaluation is critical for many applications such as cyber security, social communication, and recommender systems. Users and trust relationships among them can be seen as a graph. Graph neural networks (GNNs) show their powerful ability for analyzing graph-structural data. Very recently, existing work attempted to introduce the attributes and asymmetry of edges into GNNs for trust evaluation, while failed to capture some essential properties (e.g., the propagative and composable nature) of trust graphs. In this work, we propose a new GNN-based trust evaluation method named TrustGNN, which integrates smartly the propagative and composable nature of trust graphs into a GNN framework for better trust evaluation. Specifically, TrustGNN designs specific propagative patterns for different propagative processes of trust, and distinguishes the contribution of different propagative processes to create new trust. Thus, TrustGNN can learn comprehensive node embeddings and predict trust relationships based on these embeddings. Experiments on some widely-used real-world datasets indicate that TrustGNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We further perform analytical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the key designs in TrustGNN.",

            "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), aiming to obtain the representation of a node by aggregating its neighbors, have demonstrated great power in tackling various analytics tasks on graph (network) data. The remarkable performance of GCNs typically relies on the homophily assumption of networks, while such assumption cannot always be satis\ufb01ed, since the heterophily or randomness are also widespread in real-world. This gives rise to one fundamental question: whether networks with different structural properties should adopt different propagation mechanisms? In this paper, we \ufb01rst conduct an experimental investigation. Surprisingly, we discover that there are actually segmentation rules for the propagation mechanism, i.e., 1-hop, 2-hop and k -nearest neighbor ( k NN) neighbors are more suitable as neighborhoods of network with complete homophily, complete heterophily and randomness, respectively. However, the real-world networks are complex, and may present diverse structural properties, e.g., the network dominated by homophily may contain a small amount of randomness. So can we reasonably utilize these segmentation rules to design a universal propagation mechanism independent of the network structural assumption? To tackle this challenge, we develop a new universal GCN framework, namely U-GCN. It \ufb01rst introduces a multi-type convolution to extract information from 1-hop, 2-hop and k NN networks simultaneously, and then designs a discriminative aggregation to suf\ufb01ciently fuse them aiming to given learning objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of U-GCN over state-of-the-arts. The code and data are available at https://github.com/jindi-tju.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs), also called heterogeneous graphs, are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, and contain comprehensive information and rich semantics. Graph neural networks (GNNs), as powerful tools for graph data, have shown superior performance on network analysis. Recently, many excellent models have been proposed to process hetero-graph data using GNNs and have achieved great success. These GNN-based heterogeneous models can be interpreted as smooth node attributes guided by graph structure, which requires all nodes to have attributes. However, this is not easy to satisfy, as some types of nodes often have no attributes in heterogeneous graphs. Previous studies take some handcrafted methods to solve this problem, which separate the attribute completion from the graph learning process and, in turn, result in poor performance. In this paper, we hold that missing attributes can be acquired by a learnable manner, and propose a general framework for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network via Attribute Completion (HGNN-AC), including pre-learning of topological embedding and attribute completion with attention mechanism. HGNN-AC first uses existing HIN-Embedding methods to obtain node topological embedding. Then it uses the topological relationship between nodes as guidance to complete attributes for no-attribute nodes by weighted aggregation of the attributes from these attributed nodes. Our complement mechanism can be easily combined with an arbitrary GNN-based heterogeneous model making the whole system end-to-end. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art baselines.",
