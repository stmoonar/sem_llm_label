            "abstract": "Abstract Large metabolomics datasets inevitably contain unwanted technical variations which can obscure meaningful biological signals and affect how this information is applied to personalized healthcare. Many methods have been developed to handle unwanted variations. However, the underlying assumptions of many existing methods only hold for a few specific scenarios. Some tools remove technical variations with models trained on quality control (QC) samples which may not generalize well on subject samples. Additionally, almost none of the existing methods supports datasets with multiple types of QC samples, which greatly limits their performance and flexibility. To address these issues, a non-parametric method TIGER (Technical variation elImination with ensemble learninG architEctuRe) is developed in this study and released as an R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TIGERr). TIGER integrates the random forest algorithm into an adaptable ensemble learning architecture. Evaluation results show that TIGER outperforms four popular methods with respect to robustness and reliability on three human cohort datasets constructed with targeted or untargeted metabolomics data. Additionally, a case study aiming to identify age-associated metabolites is performed to illustrate how TIGER can be used for cross-kit adjustment in a longitudinal analysis with experimental data of three time-points generated by different analytical kits. A dynamic website is developed to help evaluate the performance of TIGER and examine the patterns revealed in our longitudinal analysis (https://han-siyu.github.io/TIGER_web/). Overall, TIGER is expected to be a powerful tool for metabolomics data analysis.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple biological processes. However, only a few ncRNAs\u2019 functions have been well studied. Given the significance of ncRNAs classification for understanding ncRNAs\u2019 functions, more and more computational methods have been introduced to improve the classification automatically and accurately. In this paper, based on a convolutional neural network and a deep forest algorithm, multi-grained cascade forest (GcForest), we propose a novel deep fusion learning framework, GcForest fusion method (GCFM), to classify alignments of ncRNA sequences for accurate clustering of ncRNAs. GCFM integrates a multi-view structure feature representation including sequence-structure alignment encoding, structure image representation and shape alignment encoding of structural subunits, enabling us to capture the potential specificity between ncRNAs. For the classification of pairwise alignment of two ncRNA sequences, the F-value of GCFM improves 6% than an existing alignment-based method. Furthermore, the clustering of ncRNA families is carried out based on the classification matrix generated from GCFM. Results suggest better performance (with 20% accuracy improved) than existing ncRNA clustering methods (RNAclust, Ensembleclust and CNNclust). Additionally, we apply GCFM to construct a phylogenetic tree of ncRNA and predict the probability of interactions between RNAs. Most ncRNAs are located correctly in the phylogenetic tree, and the prediction accuracy of RNA interaction is 90.63%. A web server (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/gcfm/) is developed to maximize its availability, and the source code and related data are available at the same URL.",

            "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple fundamental biological processes, such as post-transcriptional gene regulation, and are implicated in many complex human diseases. Mostly ncRNAs function by interacting with corresponding RNA-binding proteins. The research on ncRNA\u2013protein interaction is the key to understanding the function of ncRNA. However, the biological experiment techniques for identifying RNA\u2013protein interactions (RPIs) are currently still expensive and time-consuming. Due to the complex molecular mechanism of ncRNA\u2013protein interaction and the lack of conservation for ncRNA, especially for long ncRNA (lncRNA), the prediction of ncRNA\u2013protein interaction is still a challenge. Deep learning-based models have become the state-of-the-art in a range of biological sequence analysis problems due to their strong power of feature learning. In this study, we proposed a hierarchical deep learning framework RPITER to predict RNA\u2013protein interaction. For sequence coding, we improved the conjoint triad feature (CTF) coding method by complementing more primary sequence information and adding sequence structure information. For model design, RPITER employed two basic neural network architectures of convolution neural network (CNN) and stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Comprehensive experiments were performed on five benchmark datasets from PDB and NPInter databases to analyze and compare the performances of different sequence coding methods and prediction models. We found that CNN and SAE deep learning architectures have powerful fitting abilities for the k-mer features of RNA and protein sequence. The improved CTF coding method showed performance gain compared with the original CTF method. Moreover, our designed RPITER performed well in predicting RNA\u2013protein interaction (RPI) and could outperform most of the previous methods. On five widely used RPI datasets, RPI369, RPI488, RPI1807, RPI2241 and NPInter, RPITER obtained AUC of 0.821, 0.911, 0.990, 0.957 and 0.985, respectively. The proposed RPITER could be a complementary method for predicting RPI and constructing RPI network, which would help push forward the related biological research on ncRNAs and lncRNAs.",

In recent years, some lncRNAs are discovered to be dysregulated in many cancers. The study on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) relationship with cancers has attracted increasing attention. The molecular mechanism of gastric cancer remains largely unclear factors, especially for lncRNAs. Experiments are feasible to obtain related information, however, experimental identification of cancer-related lncRNAs usually possesses high time complexity and high cost. In this paper, a computational method is proposed to determine the relationship between lncRNA and gastric cancer by reusing the exon-based array of gastric cancer. One specific lncRNAs LINC00365 and its target differentially expressed genes whose products are predicted as blood, urine, or salvia-excretory are identified to be candidates for a combined biomarker for gastric cancer.

            "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs with a length of more than 200 nucleotides are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have gained tremendous attention in recent decades. Many studies have confirmed that lncRNAs have important influence in post-transcriptional gene regulation; for example, lncRNAs affect the stability and translation of splicing factor proteins. The mutations and malfunctions of lncRNAs are closely related to human disorders. As lncRNAs interact with a variety of proteins, predicting the interaction between lncRNAs and proteins is a significant way to depth exploration functions and enrich annotations of lncRNAs. Experimental approaches for lncRNA\u2013protein interactions are expensive and time-consuming. Computational approaches to predict lncRNA\u2013protein interactions can be grouped into two broad categories. The first category is based on sequence, structural information and physicochemical property. The second category is based on network method through fusing heterogeneous data to construct lncRNA related heterogeneous network. The network-based methods can capture the implicit feature information in the topological structure of related biological heterogeneous networks containing lncRNAs, which is often ignored by sequence-based methods. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the materials, interaction score calculation algorithms, advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art algorithms of lncRNA\u2013protein interaction prediction based on network methods to assist researchers in selecting a suitable method for acquiring more dependable results.

            "abstract": "Abstract Discovering new long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been a fundamental step in lncRNA-related research. Nowadays, many machine learning-based tools have been developed for lncRNA identification. However, many methods predict lncRNAs using sequence-derived features alone, which tend to display unstable performances on different species. Moreover, the majority of tools cannot be re-trained or tailored by users and neither can the features be customized or integrated to meet researchers\u2019 requirements. In this study, features extracted from sequence-intrinsic composition, secondary structure and physicochemical property are comprehensively reviewed and evaluated. An integrated platform named LncFinder is also developed to enhance the performance and promote the research of lncRNA identification. LncFinder includes a novel lncRNA predictor using the heterologous features we designed. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art tools on multiple species with more robust and satisfactory results. Researchers can additionally employ LncFinder to extract various classic features, build classifier with numerous machine learning algorithms and evaluate classifier performance effectively and efficiently. LncFinder can reveal the properties of lncRNA and mRNA from various perspectives and further inspire lncRNA\u2013protein interaction prediction and lncRNA evolution analysis. It is anticipated that LncFinder can significantly facilitate lncRNA-related research, especially for the poorly explored species.
