            "abstract": "Early detection plays a key role to enhance the outcome for Coronary Artery Disease. We utilized a big data analytics platform on ~32,000 patients to trace patients from the first encounter to CAD treatment. There are significant gender-based differences in patients younger than 60 from the time of the first encounter to Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting with a p-value=0.03. This recognition makes significant changes in outcome by avoiding delay in treatment.",

            "abstract": "The study of precision medicine that measures the effects of social, cultural, and environmental influences on health is essential to improve health outcomes. Race is a social concept used historically to divide, track, control populations, and reinforce social hierarchies. Beyond genetics, race is also a surrogate for other socioeconomic factors affecting patient outcomes. Our data analytics study aims to analyze the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to study patients of different races in diagnosing and treating Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). We found no race discrepancies at the University of California San Francisco Medical Centers. This study opens several new hypotheses for further research in this crucial field.",

            "abstract": "It is likely that arrhythmias should be avoided for therapies based on human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CM) to be effective. Towards achieving this goal, we introduced light-activated channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a cation channel activated with 480 nm light, into human embryonic stem cells (hESC). By using in vitro approaches, hESC-CM are able to be activated with light. ChR2 is stably transduced into undifferentiated hESC via a lentiviral vector. Via directed differentiation, hESCChR2-CM are produced and subjected to optical stimulation. hESCChR2-CM respond to traditional electrical stimulation and produce similar contractility features as their wild-type counterparts but only hESCChR2-CM can be activated by optical stimulation. Here it is shown that a light sensitive protein can enable in vitro optical control of hESC-CM and that this activation occurs optimally above specific light stimulation intensity and pulse width thresholds. For future therapy, in vivo optical stimulation along with optical inhibition could allow for acute synchronization of implanted hPSC-CM with patient cardiac rhythms.",
