            "abstract": "Water molecules are integral to the structural stability of proteins and vital for facilitating molecular interactions. However, accurately predicting their precise position around protein structures remains a significant challenge, making it a vibrant research area. In this paper, we introduce HydraProt (deep Hydration of Proteins), a novel methodology for predicting precise positions of water molecule oxygen atoms around protein structures, leveraging two interconnected deep learning architectures: a 3D U-net and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our approach starts by introducing a coarse voxel-based representation of the protein, which allows for rapid sampling of candidate water positions via the 3D U-net. These water positions are then assessed by embedding the water\u2013protein relationship in the Euclidean space by means of an MLP. Finally, a postprocessing step is applied to further refine the MLP predictions. HydraProt surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and recall and has been validated on large data sets of protein structures. Notably, our method offers rapid inference runtime and should constitute the method of choice for protein structure studies and drug discovery applications. Our pretrained models, data, and the source code required to reproduce these results are accessible at https://github.com/azamanos/HydraProt.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we present Fairness Aware Counterfactuals for Subgroups (FACTS), a framework for auditing subgroup fairness through counterfactual explanations. We start with revisiting (and generalizing) existing notions and introducing new, more refined notions of subgroup fairness. We aim to (a) formulate different aspects of the difficulty of individuals in certain subgroups to achieve recourse, i.e. receive the desired outcome, either at the micro level, considering members of the subgroup individually, or at the macro level, considering the subgroup as a whole, and (b) introduce notions of subgroup fairness that are robust, if not totally oblivious, to the cost of achieving recourse. We accompany these notions with an efficient, model-agnostic, highly parameterizable, and explainable framework for evaluating subgroup fairness. We demonstrate the advantages, the wide applicability, and the efficiency of our approach through a thorough experimental evaluation of different benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Impressive progress in generative models and implicit representations gave rise to methods that can generate 3D shapes of high quality. However, being able to locally con-trol and edit shapes is another essential property that can unlock several content creation applications. Local control can be achieved with part-aware models, but existing meth-ods require 3D supervision and cannot produce textures. In this work, we devise PartNeRF, a novel part-aware gener-ative model for editable 3D shape synthesis that does not require any explicit 3D supervision. Our model generates objects as a set of locally defined NeRFs, augmented with an affine transformation. This enables several editing op-erations such as applying transformations on parts, mixing parts from different objects etc. To ensure distinct, manip-ulable parts we enforce a hard assignment of rays to parts that makes sure that the color of each ray is only determined by a single NeRF. As a result, altering one part does not af-fect the appearance of the others. Evaluations on various ShapeNet categories demonstrate the ability of our model to generate editable 3D objects of improved fidelity, compared to previous part-based generative approaches that require 3D supervision or models relying on NeRFs.",

After tuning several parameters of our proposed method, we present a detailed experimental evaluation of our tuned algorithm using a rich dataset containing Birkhoff polytopes and polytopes from structural biology. Our open-source implementation tackles problems that have been intractable so far, offering the first software to scale up in thousands of dimensions for H-polytopes and in the hundreds for V- and Z-polytopes on moderate hardware. Last, we illustrate our software in evaluating Z-polytope approximations.",

The most complete proof of the formula was given by D'Andrea et al. in [9] under general conditions on the underlying mixed subdivision. Before the proof, Canny and Pedersen had proposed [5] a greedy algorithm which provides smaller matrices, in general. The goal of this paper is to give an explicit class of mixed subdivisions for the greedy approach such that the formula holds, and the dimensions of the matrices are reduced compared to the subdivision algorithm. We measure this reduction for the case when the Newton polytopes are zonotopes generated by n line segments (where n is the rank of the underlying lattice), and for the case of multihomogeneous systems. This article comes with a JULIA implementation of the treated cases.",

The multi-homogeneous B\u00e9zout (m-B\u00e9zout) number bounds from above the number of non-singular solutions of a multi-homogeneous system, but its computation is a #P>-hard problem. Recent work related the m-B\u00e9zout number of certain multi-homogeneous systems derived from rigidity theory with graph orientations, cf Bartzos et al. (2020). A first generalization applied graph orientations for bounding the root count of a multi-homogeneous system that can be modeled by simple undirected graphs, as shown by three of the authors (Bartzos et al., 2021). Here, we prove that every multi-homogeneous system can be modeled by hypergraphs and the computation of its m-B\u00e9zout bound is related to constrained hypergraph orientations. Thus, we convert the algebraic problem of bounding the number of roots of a polynomial system to a purely combinatorial problem of analyzing the structure of a hypergraph. We also provide a formulation of the orientation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), hence leading to an algorithm that computes the multi-homogeneous bound by finding constrained hypergraph orientations.",

            "abstract": "This paper aims to develop new mathematical and computational tools for modeling the distribution of portfolio returns across portfolios. We establish relevant mathematical formulas and propose efficient algorithms, drawing upon powerful techniques in computational geometry and the literature on splines, to compute the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, and the k-th moment of the probability function. Our algorithmic tools and implementations efficiently handle portfolios with 10000 assets, and compute moments of order k up to 40 in a few seconds, thus handling real-life scenarios. We focus on the long-only strategy which is the most common type of investment, i.e. on portfolios whose weights are non-negative and sum up to 1; our approach is readily generalizable. Thus, we leverage a geometric representation of the stock market, where the investment set defines a simplex polytope. The cumulative distribution function corresponds to a portfolio score capturing the percentage of portfolios yielding a return not exceeding a given value. We introduce closed-form analytic formulas for the first 4 moments of the cross-sectional returns distribution, as well as a novel algorithm to compute all higher moments. We show that the first 4 moments are a direct mapping of the asset returns' moments. All of our algorithms and solutions are fully general and include the special case of equal asset returns, which was sometimes excluded in previous works. Finally, we apply our portfolio score in the design of new performance measures and asset management. We found our score-based optimal portfolios less concentrated than the mean-variance portfolio and much less risky in terms of ranking.",

The ambient space has dimension equal to the number of stocks, or assets. Although our statistical tools are quite general, in this paper we focus on the problem of portfolio scoring. Our contribution is to introduce an original computational framework to model portfolio allocation strategies, which is of independent interest for computational finance. To model asset allocation strategies, we employ log-concave distributions centered on portfolio benchmarks. Our approach addresses the crucial question of evaluating portfolio management, and is relevant to the individual private investors as well as financial organizations. We evaluate the performance of an allocation, in a certain time period, by providing a new portfolio score, based on the aforementioned framework and concepts. In particular, it relies on the expected proportion of actually invested portfolios that it outperforms when a certain set of strategies take place in that time period. We also discuss how this set of strategies -- and the knowledge one may have about them -- could vary in our framework, and we provide additional versions of our score in order to obtain a more complete picture of its performance. In all cases, we show that the score computations can be performed efficiently. Last but not least, we expect this framework to be useful in portfolio optimization and in automatically identifying extreme phenomena in a stock market.",
