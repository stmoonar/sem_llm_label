            "title": "Beyond Labels: Empowering Human Annotators with Natural Language Explanations through a Novel Active-Learning Architecture",
            "abstract": "Real-world domain experts (e.g., doctors) rarely annotate only a decision label in their day-to-day workflow without providing explanations. Yet, existing low-resource learning techniques, such as Active Learning (AL), that aim to support human annotators mostly focus on the label while neglecting the natural language explanation of a data point. This work proposes a novel AL architecture to support experts' real-world need for label and explanation annotations in low-resource scenarios. Our AL architecture leverages an explanation-generation model to produce explanations guided by human explanations, a prediction model that utilizes generated explanations toward prediction faithfully, and a novel data diversity-based AL sampling strategy that benefits from the explanation annotations. Automated and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating explanations into AL sampling and the improved human annotation efficiency and trustworthiness with our AL architecture. Additional ablation studies illustrate the potential of our AL architecture for transfer learning, generalizability, and integration with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs exhibit exceptional explanation-generation capabilities for relatively simple tasks, their effectiveness in complex real-world tasks warrants further in-depth study.",

In this paper, we present an application-focused empirical survey of neural OpenIE models, training sets, and benchmarks in an effort to help users choose the most suitable OpenIE systems for their applications. We find that the different assumptions made by different models and datasets have a statistically significant effect on performance, making it important to choose the most appropriate model for one\u2019s applications.

            "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) identifies the predicate-argument structure in a sentence. This task is usually accomplished in four steps: predicate identification, predicate sense disambiguation, argument identification, and argument classification. Errors introduced at one step propagate to later steps. Unfortunately, the existing SRL evaluation scripts do not consider the full effect of this error propagation aspect. They either evaluate arguments independent of predicate sense (CoNLL09) or do not evaluate predicate sense at all (CoNLL05), yielding an inaccurate SRL model performance on the argument classification task. In this paper, we address key practical issues with existing evaluation scripts and propose a more strict SRL evaluation metric PriMeSRL. We observe that by employing PriMeSRL, the quality evaluation of all SoTA SRL models drops significantly, and their relative rankings also change. We also show that PriMeSRLsuccessfully penalizes actual failures in SoTA SRL models.",

            "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) represents the meaning of a sentence in the form of predicate-argument structures. Such shallow semantic analysis is helpful in a wide range of downstream NLP tasks and real-world applications. As treebanks enabled the development of powerful syntactic parsers, the accurate predicate-argument analysis demands training data in the form of propbanks. Unfortunately, most languages simply do not have corresponding propbanks due to the high cost required to construct such resources. To overcome such challenges, Universal Proposition Bank 1.0 (UP1.0) was released in 2017, with high-quality propbank data generated via a two-stage method exploiting monolingual SRL and multilingual parallel data. In this paper, we introduce Universal Proposition Bank 2.0 (UP2.0), with significant enhancements over UP1.0: (1) propbanks with higher quality by using a state-of-the-art monolingual SRL and improved auto-generation of annotations; (2) expanded language coverage (from 7 to 9 languages); (3) span annotation for the decoupling of syntactic analysis; and (4) Gold data for a subset of the languages. We also share our experimental results that confirm the significant quality improvements of the generated propbanks. In addition, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation on how different implementation choices impact the quality of the resulting data. We release these resources to the research community and hope to encourage more research on cross-lingual SRL.",

            "abstract": "Argument classification is at the core of Semantic Role Labeling. Given a sentence and the predicate, a semantic role label is assigned to each argument of the predicate. While semantic roles come with meaningful definitions, existing work has treated them as symbolic. Learning symbolic labels usually requires ample training data, which is frequently unavailable due to the cost of annotation. We instead propose to retrieve and leverage the definitions of these labels from the annotation guidelines. For example, the verb predicate \u201cwork\u201d has arguments defined as \u201cworker\u201d, \u201cjob\u201d, \u201cemployer\u201d, etc. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL09 dataset injected with label definitions given the predicate senses.

Inspired by instance-based learning that utilizes nearest neighbors to handle low-frequency context-specific training samples, we investigate the use of memory adaptation techniques in deep neural models. We propose a parameterized neighborhood memory adaptive (PNMA) method that uses a parameterized representation of the nearest neighbors of tokens in a memory of activations and makes predictions based on the most similar samples in the training data. We empirically show that PNMA consistently improves the SRL performance of the base model irrespective of types of word embeddings. Coupled with contextualized word embeddings derived from BERT, PNMA improves over existing models for both span and dependency semantic parsing datasets, especially on out-of-domain text, reaching F1 scores of 80.2, and 84.97 on CoNLL2005, and CoNLL2009 datasets, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) identifies predicate-argument structure(s) in a given sentence. Although different languages have different argument annotations, polyglot training, the idea of training one model on multiple languages, has previously been shown to outperform monolingual baselines, especially for low resource languages. In fact, even a simple combination of data has been shown to be effective with polyglot training by representing the distant vocabularies in a shared representation space. Meanwhile, despite the dissimilarity in argument annotations between languages, certain argument labels do share common semantic meaning across languages (e.g. adjuncts have more or less similar semantic meaning across languages). To leverage such similarity in annotation space across languages, we propose a method called Cross-Lingual Argument Regularizer (CLAR). CLAR identifies such linguistic annotation similarity across languages and exploits this information to map the target language arguments using a transformation of the space on which source language arguments lie. By doing so, our experimental results show that CLAR consistently improves SRL performance on multiple languages over monolingual and polyglot baselines for low resource languages.",

Large datasets are typically generated via human annotation, which results in human errors that cannot be eliminated at scale. Existing techniques for dealing with noisy datasets do not exploit the multi-dimensional structures of the signals, which could be used to improve the overall classification and representation performance of the model. In this thesis, we develop a Kronecker-structure (K-S) subspace model that exploits the multi-dimensional structure of the signal. First, we study the classification performance of K-S subspace models in two asymptotic regimes when the signal dimensions go to infinity and when the noise power tends to zero. We characterize the misclassification probability in terms of diversity order and we drive an exact expression for the diversity order. We further derive a tighter bound on misclassification probability in terms of pairwise geometry of the subspaces. The proposed scheme is optimal in most of the signal dimension regimes except in one regime where the signal dimension is less than twice the subspace dimension,",
