            "title": "Energy-Efficiency Strategy for Soft Synchronization FMCW Radar",
            "abstract": "Soft synchronization frequency-modulated continuous-wave (SS-FMCW) radars not only have the advantage of transmit signal diversity but also greatly reduce the complexity of hardware structure design. Interestingly, the SS-FMCW radar is implemented based on intermittent ramp signals and soft synchronization algorithms. This article proposes a new energy-efficiency strategy, i.e., the soft synchronization constrained energy-efficiency (SSC-EE) strategy. First, based on the principle behind the SS-FMCW radar, we analyze its energy consumption model. Second, an optimization problem is built with transmit signal parameters as the independent variables, soft synchronization performance and radar performances as the constraints, and radar energy consumption as the optimization objective. Furthermore, by formulating the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tuckers (KKT) conditions, we obtain a closed-form solution. The study on minimizing the theoretical energy consumption sheds light on the design of radar transmit signal parameters in practice. Finally, experimental results show that the SSC-EE strategy can reduce the energy consumption of the SS-FMCW radar without reducing the soft synchronization performance and the radar performances. Specifically, compared to the deterministic strategy, the SSC-EE strategy can reduce the radar energy consumption by 28.3%.",

            "title": "Amer: A New Attribute-Missing Network Embedding Approach",
            "abstract": "Network embedding which aims to learn a low dimensional representation of nodes is a powerful technique for network analysis. While network embedding for networks with complete attributes has been widely investigated, in many real-world applications the attributes of partial nodes are unobserved (i.e., missing) due to privacy concern or resource limit. Very recently, several network embedding methods have been proposed for attribute-missing networks. They first complete the missing attributes and then use the complemented network to learn network embedding. The parameters of these two processes cannot be adjusted by each other, resulting in compromised results. To address this problem, we propose a unified model in which the process of completing missing attributes and the process of learning embedding are not separated but closely intertwined. Being specific, completing missing attributes is under the guidance of learning network representation via mutual information maximization, and the complemented attributes directly enter network representation module which will generate further feedback for completing missing attributes. We further impose attribute-structure relationship constraint for completing missing attributes by designing a new generative adversarial networks (GANs) model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified model for attribute-missing network embedding. Empirical results on real-world datasets show the superiority of our new method over other state-of-the-art methods on four network analysis tasks, including node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and network visualization.",

            "abstract": "Whether in military or civilian use, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars play a very important role, but common FMCW radars need to collect both radar echo signals and hardware synchronization signals during echo signal processing. Therefore, this article proposes a new synchronization algorithm, i.e., the four-threshold frequency band variance (FFBV) synchronization algorithm. Then, we combine theoretical derivation and experimental verification to analyze the performance of the FFBV synchronization algorithm. With assistance of the FFBV synchronization algorithm, the soft synchronization FMCW radar can achieve the same functions without hardware synchronization signals. First, we analyze the principle behind the FMCW radar based on intermittent ramp signals. Second, we analyze the design of the FFBV synchronization algorithm. In addition, we verify the performance of the algorithm when the received signal is corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Then, we analyze the performance from two aspects, including the performance of the algorithm under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, as well as the performance comparison with other common synchronization algorithms. Finally, experimental results show that the FFBV synchronization algorithm has achieved good performance in solving the signal synchronization issue of the FMCW radar under the condition of low SNR. Especially, the SNR required by the FFBV synchronization algorithm is 2 and 6.5 dB lower than that required by the three-threshold synchronization algorithm and variance synchronization algorithm, respectively, under the same condition that the accuracy is 90%.",

            "title": "A Software-Synchronization Based, Flexible, Low-Cost FMCW Radar",
            "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things, FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radars are widely used in medical treatment, human behavior detection, Internet of Vehicles and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) detection. However, the existing systems have some shortcomings, such as high requirements for synchronization signal, lack of flexibility and high design cost. In this paper, to address these problems, a software-synchronization based, flexible, low-cost FMCW radar is proposed. Firstly, the radar uses periodic intermittent slope signal as modulation signal, and analyze echo signal to detect a target with a software synchronization algorithm. Most interestingly, hardware synchronization signal is not needed in the proposed radar as in conventional designs, which greatly facilitate implementation. Secondly, the radar system has a high flexibility due to the use of a software waveform generator and a software data processor. The system is built without expensive integrated chips and equipment, which greatly reduces the design cost. Finally, two groups of experiments under different environments are designed. Through the analysis of the results, it can be seen that the radar system designed in this paper achieves a good accuracy while greatly reduces the design cost and complexity.",
