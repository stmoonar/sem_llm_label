            "title": "STERLING: Synergistic Representation Learning on Bipartite Graphs",
            "abstract": "A fundamental challenge of bipartite graph representation learning is how to extract informative node embeddings. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising paradigm to address this challenge. Most recent bipartite graph SSL methods are based on contrastive learning which learns embeddings by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. Contrastive learning usually requires a large number of negative node pairs, which could lead to computational burden and semantic errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel synergistic representation learning model (STERLING) to learn node embeddings without negative node pairs. STERLING preserves the unique local and global synergies in bipartite graphs. The local synergies are captured by maximizing the similarity of the inter-type and intra-type positive node pairs, and the global synergies are captured by maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that STERLING could improve the connectivity between different node types in the embedding space. Extensive empirical evaluation on various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of STERLING for extracting node embeddings.",

            "abstract": "In the context of long-tail classification on graphs, the vast majority of existing work primarily revolves around the development of model debiasing strategies, intending to mitigate class imbalances and enhance the overall performance. Despite the notable success, there is very limited literature that provides a theoretical tool for characterizing the behaviors of long-tail classes in graphs and gaining insight into generalization performance in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a generalization bound for long-tail classification on graphs by formulating the problem in the fashion of multi-task learning, i.e., each task corresponds to the prediction of one particular class. Our theoretical results show that the generalization performance of long-tail classification is dominated by the overall loss range and the task complexity. Building upon the theoretical findings, we propose a novel generic framework HierTail for long-tail classification on graphs. In particular, we start with a hierarchical task grouping module that allows us to assign related tasks into hypertasks and thus control the complexity of the task space; then, we further design a balanced contrastive learning module to adaptively balance the gradients of both head and tail classes to control the loss range across all tasks in a unified fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HierTail in characterizing long-tail classes on real graphs, which achieves up to 12.9% improvement over the leading baseline method in accuracy.",

            "abstract": "There have been tremendous efforts over the past decades dedicated to the generation of realistic graphs in a variety of domains, ranging from social networks to computer networks, from gene regulatory networks to online transaction networks. Despite the remarkable success, the vast majority of these works are unsupervised in nature and are typically trained to minimize the expected graph reconstruction loss, which would result in the representation disparity issue in the generated graphs, i.e., the protected groups (often minorities) contribute less to the objective and thus suffer from systematically higher errors. In this paper, we aim to tailor graph generation to downstream mining tasks by leveraging label information and user-preferred parity constraints. In particular, we start from the investigation of representation disparity in the context of graph generative models. To mitigate the disparity, we propose a fairness-aware graph generative model named Fairgen. Our model jointly trains a label-informed graph generation module and a fair representation learning module by progressively learning the behaviors of the protected and unprotected groups, from the \u2018easy\u2019 concepts to the \u2018hard\u2019 ones. In addition, we propose a generic context sampling strategy for graph generative models, which is proven to be capable of fairly capturing the contextual information of each group with a high probability. Experimental results on seven real-world data sets demonstrate that Fairgen (1) obtains performance on par with state-of-the-art graph generative models across nine network properties, (2) mitigates the representation disparity issues in the generated graphs, and (3) substantially boosts the model performance by up to 17% in downstream tasks via data augmentation.",

            "abstract": "In the era of big data, we are often facing the challenge of data heterogeneity and the lack of label information simultaneously. In the financial domain (e.g., fraud detection), the heterogeneous data may include not only numerical data (e.g., total debt and yearly income), but also text and images (e.g., financial statement and invoice images). At the same time, the label information (e.g., fraud transactions) may be missing for building predictive models. To address these challenges, many state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods have been proposed and achieved outstanding performance. However, these methods typically do not take into consideration the fairness aspect and are likely to generate biased results using sensitive information such as race and gender. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fairness-aware multi-view clustering method named FairMVC. It incorporates the group fairness constraint into the soft membership assignment for each cluster to ensure that the fraction of different groups in each cluster is approximately identical to the entire data set. Meanwhile, we adopt the idea of both contrastive learning and non-contrastive learning and propose novel regularizers to handle heterogeneous data in complex scenarios with missing data or noisy features. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. We also derive insights regarding the relative performance of the proposed regularizers in various scenarios.",

Most existing studies are rooted in a class-rebalancing (CR) perspective and address class imbalance with class-wise reweighting or resampling. In this work, we approach the root cause of class-imbalance bias from an topological paradigm. Specifically, we theoretically reveal two fundamental phenomena in the graph topology that greatly exacerbate the predictive bias stemming from class imbalance. On this basis, we devise a lightweight topological augmentation framework BAT to mitigate the class-imbalance bias without class rebalancing. Being orthogonal to CR, BAT can function as an efficient plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly combined with and significantly boost existing CR techniques. Systematic experiments on real-world imbalanced graph learning tasks show that BAT can deliver up to 46.27% performance gain and up to 72.74% bias reduction over existing techniques.

            "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) imputation is a widely studied problem in recent years. Existing methods can be divided into two main groups, including (1) deep recurrent or generative models that primarily focus on time series features, and (2) graph neural networks (GNNs) based models that utilize the topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational inductive bias for imputation. Nevertheless, these methods either neglect topological information or assume the graph structure is fixed and accurately known. Thus, they fail to fully utilize the graph dynamics for precise imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS), where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing values in both node time series features and graph structures. Then, we design a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to predict missing values over both node time series features and graph structures. In particular, we propose a new node position embedding based on random walk with restart (RWR) in the encoder with provable higher expressive power compared with message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs). We further design a decoder with 3-stage predictions from the perspective of multi-task learning to impute missing values in both time series and graph structures reciprocally. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baselines.",

Recently, the data augmentation based contrastive learning method has been extended from images to graphs. However, most prior works are directly adapted from the models designed for images. Unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality contrastive samples, which are the key to the performance of contrastive learning models. This leaves much space for improvement over the existing graph contrastive learning frameworks. In this work, by introducing an adversarial graph view and an information regularizer, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ArieL), to extract informative contrastive samples within a reasonable constraint. It consistently outperforms the current graph contrastive learning methods in the node classification task over various real-world datasets and further improves the robustness of graph contrastive learning.",

Despite the success of recent self-supervised learning methods on bipartite graphs, their objectives are discriminating instance-wise positive and negative node pairs, which could contain cluster-level errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel co-cluster infomax (COIN) framework, which captures the cluster-level information by maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters. Different from previous infomax methods which estimate mutual information by neural networks, COIN could easily calculate mutual information. Besides, COIN is an end-to-end coclustering method which can be trained jointly with other objective functions and optimized via back-propagation. Furthermore, we also provide theoretical analysis for COIN. We theoretically prove that COIN is able to effectively maximize the mutual information of node embeddings and COIN is upper-bounded by the prior distributions of nodes. We extensively evaluate the proposed COIN framework on various benchmark datasets and tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN.",

            "abstract": "Financial time series forecasting is challenging due to limited sample size, correlated samples, low signal strengths, among others. Additional information with knowledge graphs (KGs) can allow for improved prediction and decision making. In this work, we explore a framework GregNets for jointly learning forecasting models and correlations structures that exploit graph connectivity from KGs. We propose novel regularizers based on KG relations to guide estimation of correlation structure. We develop a pseudo-likelihood layer that can learn the error residual structure for any multivariate time-series forecasting architecture in deep learning APIs (e.g. Tensorflow). We evaluate our modeling and algorithmic proposals in small sample regimes in real-world financial markets with two types of KGs. Our empirical results demonstrate sparser connectivity structures, runtime improvements and high-quality predictions.",

            "abstract": "Learning a high-performance trade execution model via reinforcement learning (RL) requires interaction with the real dynamic market. However, the massive interactions required by direct RL would result in a significant training overhead. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) approach called Deep Dyna-Double Q-learning (D3Q), which integrates deep reinforcement learning and planning to reduce the training overhead while improving the trading performance. Specifically, D3Q includes a learnable market environment model, which approximates the market impact using real market experience, to enhance policy learning via the learned environment. Meanwhile, we propose a novel state-balanced exploration scheme to solve the exploration bias caused by the non-increasing residual inventory during the trade execution to accelerate model learning. As demonstrated by our extensive experiments, the proposed D3Q framework significantly increases sample efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average trading cost as well.",
