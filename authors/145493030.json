            "abstract": "Conversational agents have gained widespread popularity due to their ability to simulate and sustain contextual conversations. Prior works predominantly focused on computational challenges. However, avatars \u2014 the representation of the agent \u2014 impact user interactions and perception of conversational agents\u2019 trustworthiness and usefulness. Despite their importance, we lack a holistic understanding of conversational agent avatar design space. In this work, we address this gap by defining a categorization of 10 dimensions that is based on the analysis and iterative coding of 266 conversational agent papers from 160 venues spanning 2003 to the present. In addition, we built an interactive browser to facilitate exploration and interaction with these dimensions and their interrelationships. Our categorization lays the groundwork for researchers, designers, and practitioners to discern task-specific and contextual aspects of conversational agent avatar design. Our work fosters innovative ideas to facilitate new interactions with avatars by surfacing current patterns and highlighting open challenges.",

            "title": "CommunityBots: Creating and Evaluating A Multi-Agent Chatbot Platform for Public Input Elicitation",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the popularity of AI-enabled conversational agents or chatbots has risen as an alternative to traditional online surveys to elicit information from people. However, there is a gap in using single-agent chatbots to converse and gather multi-faceted information across a wide variety of topics. Prior works suggest that single-agent chatbots struggle to understand user intentions and interpret human language during a multi-faceted conversation. In this work, we investigated how multi-agent chatbot systems can be utilized to conduct a multi-faceted conversation across multiple domains. To that end, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study to investigate the design of a multi-agent chatbot for gathering public input across multiple high-level domains and their associated topics. Next, we designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots - a multi-agent chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain individually. To manage conversation across multiple topics and chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management (CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. We conducted a between-subject study comparing CommunityBots to a single-agent chatbot baseline with 96 crowd workers. The results from our evaluation demonstrate that CommunityBots participants were significantly more engaged, provided higher quality responses, and experienced fewer conversation interruptions while conversing with multiple different chatbots in the same session. We also found that the visual cues integrated with the interface helped the participants better understand the functionalities of the CTM mechanism, which enabled them to perceive changes in textual conversation, leading to better user satisfaction. Based on the empirical insights from our study, we discuss future research avenues for multi-agent chatbot design and its application for rich information elicitation.",

            "abstract": "Keeping up with the research literature plays an important role in the workflow of scientists \u2013 allowing them to understand a field, formulate the problems they focus on, and develop the solutions that they contribute, which in turn shape the nature of the discipline. In this paper, we examine the literature review practices of data scientists. Data science represents a field seeing an exponential rise in papers, and increasingly drawing on and being applied in numerous diverse disciplines. Recent efforts have seen the development of several tools intended to help data scientists cope with a deluge of research and coordinated efforts to develop AI tools intended to uncover the research frontier. Despite these trends indicative of the information overload faced by data scientists, no prior work has examined the specific practices and challenges faced by these scientists in an interdisciplinary field with evolving scholarly norms. In this paper, we close this gap through a set of semi-structured interviews and think-aloud protocols of industry and academic data scientists (N = 20). Our results while corroborating other knowledge workers\u2019 practices uncover several novel findings: individuals (1) are challenged in seeking and sensemaking of papers beyond their disciplinary bubbles, (2) struggle to understand papers in the face of missing details and mathematical content, (3) grapple with the deluge by leveraging the knowledge context in code, blogs, and talks, and (4) lean on their peers online and in-person. Furthermore, we outline future directions likely to help data scientists cope with the burgeoning research literature.",

            "abstract": "Methods for making high-quality recommendations often rely on learning latent representations from interaction data. These methods, while performant, do not provide ready mechanisms for users to control the recommendation they receive. Our work tackles this problem by proposing LACE, a novel concept value bottleneck model for controllable text recommendations. LACE represents each user with a succinct set of human-readable concepts through retrieval given user-interacted documents and learns personalized representations of the concepts based on user documents. This concept based user profile is then leveraged to make recommendations. The design of our model affords control over the recommendations through a number of intuitive interactions with a transparent user profile. We first establish the quality of recommendations obtained from LACE in an offline evaluation on three recommendation tasks spanning six datasets in warm-start, cold-start, and zero-shot setups. Next, we validate the controllability of LACE under simulated user interactions. Finally, we implement LACE in an interactive controllable recommender system and conduct a user study to demonstrate that users are able to improve the quality of recommendations they receive through interactions with an editable user profile.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in critical information visualization have brought the field's attention to political, feminist, ethical, and rhetorical aspects of data visualization. However, less work has explored the interplay between design decisions and political ramifications\u2014structures of authority, means of representation, etc. In this paper, we build upon these critical perspectives and highlight the political aspect of civic text visualization especially in the context of democratic decision\u2010making. Based on a critical analysis of survey papers about text visualization in general, followed by a review on the status quo of text visualization in civics, we argue that civic text visualization inherits an exclusively analytic framing. This framing leads to a series of issues and challenges in the fundamentally political context of civics, such as misinterpretation of data, missing minority voices, and excluding the public from decision making processes. To span this gap between political context and analytic framing, we provide a series of two\u2010pole conceptual dimensions, such as from singular user to multiple relationships, and from complexity to inclusivity of visualization design. For each dimension, we discuss how the tensions between these poles can help surface the political ramifications of design decisions in civic text visualization. These dimensions can thus help visualization researchers, designers, and practitioners attend more intentionally to these political aspects and inspire their design choices. We conclude by suggesting that these dimensions may be useful for visualization design across a variety of application domains, beyond civic text visualization.",

We propose two interventions \u2014 Exploration Metrics that can help readers understand and track their exploration patterns through visual indicators and a Bias Mitigation Model that intends to maximize knowledge discovery by suggesting sentiment and semantically diverse reviews. We designed, developed, and evaluated a text analytics system called Serendyze, where we integrated these interventions. We asked 100 crowd workers to use Serendyze to make purchase decisions based on product reviews. Our evaluation suggests that exploration metrics enabled readers to efficiently cover more reviews in a balanced way, and suggestions from the bias mitigation model influenced readers to make confident data-driven decisions. We discuss the role of user agency and trust in text-level analysis systems and their applicability in domains beyond review exploration.",

However, sensemaking of such input remains a challenge due to the unstructured nature of text comments and ambiguity of human language. Hence, community input is often left unanalyzed and unutilized in policymaking. To address this problem, we interviewed 14 civic leaders to understand their practices and requirements. We identified challenges around organizing the unstructured community input and surfacing community\u2019s reflections beyond binary sentiments. Based on these insights, we built CommunityPulse, an interactive system that combines text analysis and visualization to scaffold different facets of community input. Our evaluation with another 15 experts suggests CommunityPulse\u2019s efficacy in surfacing multiple facets such as reflections, priorities, and hidden insights while reducing the required time, effort, and expertise for community input analysis.",

To address this challenge, we designed and implemented RisingEMOTIONS, a site-specific collaborative art installation situated in East Boston that combines public art with digital technology. The installation depicts the impacts of sea-level rise by visualizing local projected flood levels and the public\u2019s emotions toward this threat. The community\u2019s engagement with our project demonstrated the potential for public art to create interest and raise awareness of climate change.

            "abstract": "Despite the lack of inclusive participation from attendees and civic organizers struggle to capture their feedback in reports, local governments continue to depend on traditional methods such as town halls for community consultation. We present CommunityClick, a community-sourcing system that uses modified iClickers to enable silent attendees' to provide real-time feedback and records meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback. These feedbacks are combined to generate an augmented meeting transcript and feedback-weighted summary, incorporated into an interactive tool for organizers to author reports. Our field deployment at a town hall and interviews with 8 organizers demonstrate CommunityClick's utility in improving inclusivity and authoring more comprehensive reports.",
