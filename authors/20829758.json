            "abstract": "SPARQL query services that balance processing between clients and servers become more and more essential to handle the increasing load for open and decentralized knowledge graphs on the Web. To this end, Linked Data Fragments (LDF) have introduced a foundational framework that has sparked research exploring a spectrum of potential Web querying interfaces in between server-side query processing via SPARQL endpoints and client-side query processing of data dumps. Current proposals in between typically suffer from imbalanced load on either the client or the server. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first work that combines both client-side and server-side query optimization techniques in a truly dynamic fashion: we introduce WiseKG, a system that employs a cost model that dynamically delegates the load between servers and clients by combining client-side processing of shipped partitions with efficient server-side processing of star-shaped sub-queries, based on current server workload and client capabilities. Our experiments show that WiseKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of average total query execution time per client, while at the same time decreasing network traffic and increasing server-side availability.",

            "abstract": "While Linked Data (LD) provides standards for publishing (RDF) and (SPARQL) querying Knowledge Graphs (KGs) on the Web, serving, accessing and processing such open, decentralized KGs is often practically impossible, as query timeouts on publicly available SPARQL endpoints show. Alternative solutions such as Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) attempt to tackle the problem of availability by pushing query processing workload to the client side, but suffer from unnecessary transfer of irrelevant data on complex queries with large intermediate results. In this paper we present smart-KG, a novel approach to share the load between servers and clients, while significantly reducing data transfer volume, by combining TPF with shipping compressed KG partitions. Our evaluations show that smart-KG outperforms state-of-the-art client-side solutions and increases server-side availability towards more cost-effective and balanced hosting of open and decentralized KGs.",

            "abstract": "Linked Open Data (LOD) is the publicly available RDF data in the Web. Each LOD entity is identfied by a URI and accessible via HTTP. LOD encodes globalscale knowledge potentially available to any human as well as artificial intelligence that may want to benefit from it as background knowledge for supporting their tasks. LOD has emerged as the backbone of applications in diverse fields such as Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, and many more. Nevertheless, regardless of the specific tasks that LOD-based tools aim to address, the reuse of such knowledge may be challenging for diverse reasons, e.g. semantic heterogeneity, provenance, and data quality. As aptly stated by Heath et al. Linked Data might be outdated, imprecise, or simply wrong\": there arouses a necessity to investigate the problem of linked data validity. This work reports a collaborative effort performed by nine teams of students, guided by an equal number of senior researchers, attending the International Semantic Web Research School (ISWS 2018) towards addressing such investigation from different perspectives coupled with different approaches to tackle the issue.",

            "abstract": "Cyber-physical Social System (CPSS) are complex systems that span \nthe boundaries of the cyber, physical and social spheres. They play \nan important role in a variety of domains ranging from industry \nto smart city applications. As such, these systems necessarily need \nto take into account, combine and make sense of heterogeneous \ndata sources from legacy systems, from the physical layer and also \nthe social groups that are part of/use the system. The collection, \ncleansing and integration of these data sources represents a major \neffort not only during the operation of the system, but also during \nits engineering and design. Indeed, while ongoing efforts are \nconcerned primarily with the operation of such systems, limited \nfocus has been put on supporting the engineering phase of CPSS. \nTo address this shortcoming, within the CitySPIN project we aim to \ncreate a platform that supports stakeholders involved in the design \nof these systems especially in terms of support for data management. \nTo that end, we develop methods and techniques based on \nSemantic Web and Linked Data technologies for the acquisition \nand integration of heterogeneous data from disparate structured, \nsemi-structured and unstructured sources, including open data and \nsocial data. In this paper we present the overall system \narchitecturewith a core focus on data acquisition and integration.We \ndemon-strate our approach through a prototypical implementation \nof an adaptive planning use case for public transportation \nscheduling.",

            "abstract": "The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brings new challenges for companies, who must demonstrate that their systems and business processes comply with usage constraints specified by data subjects. However, due to the lack of standards, tools, and best practices, many organizations struggle to adapt their infrastructure and processes to ensure and demonstrate that all data processing is in compliance with users\u2019 given consent. The SPECIAL EU H2020 project has developed vocabularies that can formally describe data subjects\u2019 given consent as well as methods that use this description to automatically determine whether processing of the data according to a given policy is compliant with the given consent. Whereas this makes it possible to determine whether processing was compliant or not, integration of the approach into existing line of business applications and ex-ante compliance checking remains an open challenge. In this short paper, we demonstrate how the SPECIAL consent and compliance framework can be integrated into Linked Widgets, a mashup platform, in order to support privacy-aware ad-hoc integration of personal data. The resulting environment makes it possible to create data integration and processing workflows out of components that inherently respect usage policies of the data that is being processed and are able to demonstrate compliance. We provide an overview of the necessary meta data and orchestration towards a privacy-aware linked data mashup platform that automatically respects subjects\u2019 given consents. The evaluation results show the potential of our approach for ex-ante usage policy compliance checking within the Linked Widgets Platforms and beyond.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) has become the de-facto standard for publishing semantic data on the Web. This steady adoption has led to a significant increase in the number and volume of available RDF datasets, exceeding the capabilities of traditional RDF stores. This scenario has introduced severe big semantic data challenges when it comes to managing and querying RDF data at Web scale. Despite the existence of various off-the-shelf Big Data platforms, processing RDF in a distributed environment remains a significant challenge. In this position paper, based on an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, we propose to manage large RDF datasets in Flink, a well-known scalable distributed Big Data processing framework.",

            "abstract": "Online Communities for Question Answering (CQA) such as Quora and Stack Overflow face the challenge of providing sufficient answers for the questions asked by users. The exponential growing rate of the unanswered questions compromises the effectiveness of the CQA frameworks as knowledge sharing platforms. The main reason for this issue is the inefficient routing of the questions to the potential answerers, who are the field experts and interested users. This paper proposes the deep-learning-based technique QR-DSSM to increase the accuracy of the question routing process. This technique uses deep semantic similarity model (DSSM) to extract semantic similarity features using deep neural networks and use the features to rank users' profiles. QR-DSSM maps the asked questions and the profiles of the users into a latent semantic space where the ability to answer is measured using the cosine similarity between the questions and the profiles of the users. QR-DSSM experiments outperformed the baseline models such as LDA, SVM, and Rank-SVM techniques and achieved an MRR score of 0.1737.",
