            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

We analyze some existing data integration solutions, to uncover their features and limitations. Based on these results, we propose a new microservice architecture to support the development of software platforms for integrating smart cities\u2019 heterogeneous data and a guideline to assess their performance. We also present details of a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed architecture and its performance evaluation. The results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle the highly dynamic demands of a smart city while maintaining low response times.",

A new metadata schema is being created based on a community-based approach. This method relies on knowledge from specialists to define a list of relevant metadata properties for a given domain. In the first step of the research, we extracted metadata from three datasets maintained by three Brazilian public institutions: the Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics (Cepea), the Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea), and The National Supply Company (Conab). The extracted metadata were the input to the definition of a list of 15 potential metadata properties that specialists are validating.",

More than helping researchers to manage the complexity of experimental data, these tools can increase the value of experiments by enabling reproducibility and supporting the sharing and reuse of data. Despite the remarkable advances made in the Neuroinformatics field in recent years, there is still a lack of open-source computational tools to cope with the heterogeneity and volume of neuroscientific data and the related metadata that needs to be collected during an experiment and stored for posterior analysis. In this work, we present the Neuroscience Experiments System (NES), a free software to assist researchers in data collecting routines of clinical, electrophysiological, and behavioral experiments. NES enables researchers to efficiently perform the management of their experimental data in a secure and user-friendly environment, providing a unified repository for the experimental data of an entire research group. Furthermore, its modular software architecture is aligned with several initiatives of the neuroscience community and promotes standardized data formats for experiments and analysis reporting.",

            "abstract": "In developing countries, road surface quality monitoring, especially pothole detection, is performed manually by the concerned authorities. Such a traditional method of road surface assessment is expensive and requires a lot of time and human resources. The timely detection of potholes is critical, as they may lead to vehicle damage, road accidents, and injuries. To address this issue, this paper presents a pothole warning system based on algorithms using Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The proposed solution uses an accelerometer to collect pothole-related data and warns drivers and authorities about potholes. We developed simulations and performed experiments to test and evaluate the global efficiency rate of the proposed method. The simulations show it can reduce pothole hits on highways by 73.65%. To allow for the replication of the experiments, the simulation code is being made publicly available.",

            "abstract": "Natural disasters cause a high impact in society, resulting in human and economic losses, so much so that increasing the efficiency in monitoring these phenomena becomes a necessity. The integration of cyber-physical systems and their IoT devices, connectivity, machine learning, and Big Data can help to achieve this efficiency. This paper presents key points of the phenomenology of these processes, with challenges and opportunities for applied computing in urban environmental studies in Brazil, as well as investigates studies and techniques that have been used to monitor landslides and floods.",

            "abstract": "Executing scientific workflows in high-performance cloud computing platforms requires the use of scheduling algorithms that allow workflows execution as fast as possible, while minimizing the monetary cost of such executions. In this work we study how the use of supporting information can offer guidance to scheduling algorithms, helping them to devise more efficient execution plans in terms of the total execution time (makespan) and the total monetary cost. Using two large-scale scientific workflows, our experiments showed that simple modifications on a classical scheduling algorithm (HEFT), in conjunction with the appropriate supporting information, could reduce the monetary cost of an execution in up to 59% and reduce the makespan in up to 8.6%.",

            "abstract": "A considerable volume of data is collected from sensors today and needs to be processed in real time. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one of the most important techniques developed for this purpose. In CEP, each new sensor measurement is considered an event and new event types can be defined based on other events occurrence. There exists several open-source CEP implementations currently available, but all of them use orchestration to distribute event processing. This kind of architectural organization may harm system resilience, since it relies on a central core (i.e. the orchestrator). Any failures in the core might impact the whole system. Moreover, the core can become a bottleneck on system performance. In this work, a choreography-based microservices architecture is proposed for distributed CEP, in order to benefit from the low coupling and greater horizontal scalability this kind of architecture provides.",
