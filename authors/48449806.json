            "title": "Declarative Generation of React.js-based Modern Web Pages Using SuperSQL",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of the modern web has become widespread. This is based on a single page that contains multiple contents in one web page and can switch contents smoothly without page transition, and is excellent in user interface and user experience. In this paper, we propose a system that generates React.js-based modern web pages using SuperSQL. SuperSQL is an extension language of SQL, and it is possible to realize various layout expressions by structuring the output results of relational databases. The system we propose in this paper makes it possible to generate modern web pages declaratively with a smaller amount of code than before. This leads to providing users with a rich web experience while reducing the burden on web page developers.",

This system allows group members to view all the written annotations by simply mousing over the keyword when it appears on a web page, facilitating sharing information and awareness in collaborative research and work. In this study, we define our system as a sticky note type annotation sharing system. In contrast to the sticky note type, our system is positioned as a functional type, but it may display annotations that are not necessary since it allows browsing on any page. To improve this point, we propose a usability judgment method that shows only the most useful posts.",

However, the existing recommendation systems research has not studied serendipity much. Hence, the serendipitous item recommendation has received more attention in recent years. The serendipitous recommendation of our research is not included in the area that the user predict easily but recommends the keywords that match the potential preferences. Potential preferences are those that are present in the user profile, which the user may not know. In this research, we recommend keywords that can express serendipity by intersecting the relation between keywords mainly. Furthermore, we propose the related page recommendation method on Web IndeX System for recommending linked pages related to these serendipitous keywords based on the user's potential preferences.",

However, this method is not suitable for data with high update frequency, such as stream data, because the information in the database refers to the data at the time of SuperSQL execution. In this study, we propose an implementation of a web page generation function that asynchronously updates a web page with the latest information for frequently updated data, using PipelineDB and SuperSQL, both of which are DBMSs capable of processing streams. You can specify the dynamic part of the stream by specifying the stream in the \"decorator\" which is a feature of SuperSQL. At the same time, you can specify \"pull\" and \"push\" in the stream decorator to select how the dynamic part is updated. This makes it possible to create a web page that displays the latest stock prices at any time in a page that displays a list of stock prices.",

By structuring the output of relational databases, SuperSQL enables the user to generate various types of structured documents with various layouts which are not represented in SQL. There is a problem that the larger and more complicated the SuperSQL query is, the more difficult it is to detect errors and the more time is spent on debugging. In this study, we propose a system that automatically detects and corrects syntax errors in user queries. When a query parsing fails, the system reanalyzes the query and predicts a correction by using deep learning. To modify the query, we use recurrent neural network and attention mechanism. By presenting the predicted modifications to users, the burden of debugging can be reduced and the efficiency of user's work can be improved.",

WIX replaces keywords in Web documents hyperlinks to other web pages based on a WIX file that a user chose. WIX file is a kind of a dictionary that have a set of WIX entries (keyword and target URL). Using WIX, users can join any Web contents and arbitrary dictionaries. In conventional WIX, matching and linking are executed only for fixed character strings between the keyword set and the input text. However, when a user wants to search for phrases like idioms, this matching system is not sufficient because of the declension of words, change of the verb tense, and so on. Therefore, we propose a phrasal pattern matching mechanism on WIX. This helps users easily find idiom expressions in the text on the web and get more information.",

The Remote Table Access (RTA) system allows the easy publication of data from a relational database, and its use through SQL-like queries by remote users. Still, the data currently being shared as open data comes in many formats, not always directly integrable with relational databases, and many sources publish data as raw CSV, XML or even PDF files. These files then need to be downloaded, parsed, and integrated with the final user's data, often in a relational database. In this work, we present Table on Top (ToT) for CSV, an extension of the RTA system that allows the easy publication and access of data contained in CSV files through RTA.",

Still, when representing large amounts of data in 3D, a fine control of the layout becomes a must. Current tools for 3D visualization do not allow for easy and fine tuned control of this layout. SuperSQL is an extension of the SQL language allowing users to declaratively and concisely specify the layout of, and generate structured documents such as web pages. In this work we extend SuperSQL to allow the generation of 3D data representations in the Unity game engine.

When creating a virtual museum, if there are too many exhibitions or when changing the layout, the burden on the user will be high. But in this system, it is possible to automatically generate various virtual museums easily and reduce the burden on users.\n",

            "abstract": "We study task composition in crowdsourcing and the effect of personalization and diversity on performance. A central process in crowdsourcing is task assignment, the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, task assignment is facilitated by the ability to sort tasks by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount. Task composition improves task assignment by producing for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks, referred to as a Composite Task (CT). We propose different ways of producing CTs and formulate an optimization problem that finds for a worker, the most relevant and diverse CTs. We show empirically that workers\u2019 experience is greatly improved due to personalization that enforces an adequation of CTs with workers\u2019 skills and preferences. We also study and formalize various ways of diversifying tasks in each CT. Task diversity is grounded in organization studies that have shown its impact on worker motivation\u00a0 [33] . Our experiments show that diverse CTs contribute to improving outcome quality. More specifically, we show that while task throughput and worker retention are best with ranked lists, crowdwork quality reaches its best with CTs diversified by requesters, thereby confirming that workers look to expose their \u201cgood\u201d work to many requesters.",

            "abstract": "The Rule-based e-Mail eXchange system, also known as RMX, is an email transfer agent that transfers email based on user-defined delivery rules which are expressed as parameterized SQL queries. In this paper, we introduce insertion rules, which are also expressed as parameterized SQL queries based on the recipient's email address to derive values such as recipient's name or the list of purchase records to be embedded in the email body and header. By using the full expressive power of SQL, RMX allows arbitrary information in a relational database to be embedded at the moment of delivery. A straightforward implementation of insertion rules, however, invokes numerous SQL executions which are proportional both to the number of inserted items K and the number of recipients N. We have developed a query synthesis algorithm which derives a single SQL query from the delivery rule query and the K insertion rule queries. The 1 + N \u00d7 K original query executions will be replaced by a single execution of the resulting query. Furthermore, we introduce a heuristic query simplification algorithm to reduce redundant references to the same relation and the joins between them generated by the naive synthesis algorithm. As an example, delivering 5000 emails each containing four embedded items with the straightforward implementation required 20001 SQL query executions that took 650.50 seconds to complete. This overhead was reduced to a single execution taking 304.69 milliseconds to complete with the naive query synthesis. The query simplification further reduced the time to 148.74 milliseconds by reducing four joins to one.",

            "abstract": "In our research, we focus on ways to crawl and scrape structured data embedded in web pages and collect it as an available data set. To realize large-scale structured data collection, we develop SDC, specialized structured data extraction crawler.\n SDC integrates the three modules required for extracting structured data: crawling, scraping, and output generation. In particular, we are paying attention to the fact that only simple syntax and semantics are used for structured data. In this way, information extraction from web pages that exist in multiple domains is realized with a simple single setting. It is not necessary to consider the hierarchical structure of websites and the DOM structure of web pages. The users can also display a part of it as a preview to see if the extracted data is what they need.\n However, even if structured data is used, there are cases where how elements are written differently for each domain. For example, in an e-book sales website, one element is given to each author of the book, but in another site, the list of multiple authors is described as a comma-separated string. Also, there is a website that implements navigation such as pagination using Ajax, and it is necessary to execute the corresponding JavaScript to obtain hyperlink from this site. To cope with the difference between these domains, it is possible for users to quickly specify the data extraction mechanism corresponding to individual websites complementary.\n As the experiment, we extracted 500 top domains with a large number of links on the websites by our system, that 254 sites where structured data are present, and we have been successfully extracted from 243 sites.",

This feature allows contents of a webpage to be divided and loaded automatically as a user scrolls through the page. Integrating infinite scroll in webpages, however, can be a complex task. A developer needs to be proficient in client-side programming to design the webpages and server-side programming to be able to load data dynamically. In this study, we propose an approach based on SuperSQL to simplify the integration of infinite scroll in web pages. SuperSQL is an extension of SQL that outputs data extracted from a database in various types of structured documents such as HTML, directly as a result of a declarative query. We extend SuperSQL to implement infinite scrolling in an HTML query output. As a result, developing web pages with the infinite scroll feature can be achieved by running a single SuperSQL query.",

However, such data is distributed in a variety of ways, such as downloadable files like CSV or XML files, or through API calls to web services. Each data source thus requires a specific workflow, making it a burden for the users to process and use this data. This barrier to use diminishes the openness of this data We thus propose the Remote Table Access (RTA) system, a simple and safe architecture for publishing, i.e. giving open read only access to relational data, and easily integrating it with the user's local data. RTA enables the user to query relational open data and their own local data seamlessly through a single SQL query. To allow this, we designed a three parties architecture featuring a client-side application, an optional server-side module and a \"Public Table Library\" (PTL). The client side application processes the RTA query and fetches the necessary data, the server side system acts as an agent between the remote database and the client, offering added security as well as scalability in terms of connections, and the PTL list all the published data and stores its access information. We implemented an early prototype of this architecture as a proof of concept. We validated it against two datasets, including data from the TPC-C benchmark and make it available1. Our results show the feasability of RTA and possible significant reduction of query processing time mainly because of the reduction on transmission volume by condition pushing and semijoin.",

            "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has gained popularity in a variety of domains as an increasing number of jobs are \"taskified\" and completed independently by a set of workers. A central process in crowdsourcing is the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, tasks can be sorted by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount. Research efforts on task assignment have focused on adopting a requester-centric approach whereby tasks are proposed to workers in order to maximize overall task throughput, result quality and cost. In this paper, we advocate the need to complement that with a worker-centric approach to task assignment, and examine the problem of producing, for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks that preserves overall task throughput. We formalize task composition for workers as an optimization problem that finds a representative set of k valid and relevant Composite Tasks (CTs). Validity enforces that a composite task complies with the task arrival rate and satisfies the worker's expected wage. Relevance imposes that tasks match the worker's qualifications. We show empirically that workers' experience is greatly improved due to task homogeneity in each CT and to the adequation of CTs with workers' skills. As a result task throughput is improved.",

While quality control in crowdsourcing has been widely studied, established mechanisms may still be improved to take into account other factors that affect quality. However, since crowdsourcing relies on humans, it is difficult to identify and consider all factors affecting quality. In this study, we conduct an initial investigation on the effect of crowd type and task complexity on work quality by crowdsourcing a simple and more complex version of a data extraction task to paid and unpaid crowds. We then measure the quality of the results in terms of its similarity to a gold standard data set. Our experiments show that the unpaid crowd produces results of high quality regardless of the type of task while the paid crowd yields better results in simple tasks. We intend to extend our work to integrate existing quality control mechanisms and perform more experiments with more varied crowd members.",

However, building responsive UIs is a very challenging task, requiring deep knowledge of HTML and CSS. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate responsive web pages using SuperSQL, which is an extension of SQL that can format data retrieved from a database into various kinds of structured documents. Our approach applies the methodology of Bootstrap, a grid-based framework for front-end development, to generate responsive web pages from SuperSQL queries. By combining SuperSQL's capability of expressing complex layout structure with the systematic use of Bootstrap, we aim to establish an uncomplicated method of developing responsive web pages that do not require expertise in front-end web development.",

This mechanism enables sending limitation, and if a sender tries to send to unauthorized recipients, a warning message is returned to the sender.",

Furthermore, in order to use the system, users usually configurate the system using a command line interface. Consequently, RMX users cannot perform intuitive operations.

Crowdsourcing is a problem solving approach that uses the cognitive power of people to achieve specific computational goals. It is implemented through an online platform, which can either be paid or volunteer-based. We deploy crowdsourcing applications in paid and volunteer-based platforms to classify teaching evaluation comments from students. We present a comparison of the results produced by crowdsourcing, manual sentiment analysis, and an existing automatic sentiment analysis system. Our findings show that the crowdsourced sentiment analysis in both paid and volunteer-based platforms are considerably more accurate than the automatic sentiment analysis algorithm but still fail to achieve high accuracy compared to the manual method. To improve accuracy, the effect of increasing the size of the crowd could be explored in the future.",

However, these processes can be tedious and complicated. To address these, we have proposed Ducky, which is a Web data extraction system including a web wrapper that extracts data from web sources and translates them into structured data based on user-defined data extraction rules. Ducky can extract data flexibly from various structured web pages, remove noise from extracted data and integrate data distributed to multiple pages from different sites. In this paper, we propose a browser GUI for Ducky. Instead of manually writing a configuration file, users can just click or point a cursor (mouse over) to objective elements. The users' actions are then automatically converted to data extraction rules and saved in a configuration file. Thus, we help users to extract the data by allowing intuitive operations and reduce users' burden in write the configuration file.",

The WIX system takes a set of pairs of keywords and URLs written in XML (called WIX Files) and join it to the text content of a web page in order to transform keywords into hyperlinks to a specific web page group of the user's choice. In the previous WIX system, synonymous expressions of the same entity had to be directly added to the WIX File in order to generate hyperlinks for such expressions. In this paper, we propose a synonym processing mechanism, which generates the hyperlink for synonyms without adding them to the WIX File directly. We collected synonymous relations from the redirection function of the Japanese version of Wikipedia and constructed a synonym database for our system. We incorporated the information of the Synonym database into the automaton based on the Aho-Corasick algorithm used for the lexicographic matching process of the WIX system, and achieved to generate hyperlinks on synonymous expressions without barely changing the size of our WIX File database.",

            "abstract": "In general, a search engine is used to obtain information about specified keywords of interest. However, users must go through the list of web pages presented by the search engine in order to find the page that meets the purpose. In order to reduce this burden, we propose Web Index (WIX), a hyperlink generation system that achieves joining information resources on the web. The WIX system replaces keywords that appear in Web documents on browser into hyperlinks to a specific web page group of the user's choice. However, when there are multiple URLs paired up with a keyword, there is a need to choose the web page that meets the user's purpose. In this paper, we propose WIX System and an architecture that decides and presents likely candidates for hyperlink destination based on similarity of URLs and the content of each candidate.",

By using this rule-based mailing approach, the administrator need not manage mailing lists since it guarantees a single point of administration by involving the organization's database and rules defined in SQL.",

It is a novel way of sending email to various groups of people, compared to conventional email. However, the creation of the RMX operating environment is not simple and is relatively costly. Furthermore, in order to use the system, users must have a knowledge of the database and invoke the system using a command line interface. Consequently, RMX users cannot perform operations intuitively. To address these concerns, we develop two web applications to easily provide RMX as a service and RMX as a platform. As a result, users can intuitively deploy mailing lists using RMX and incorporate RMX to other web applications and utilize RMX with considerably reduced cost in the operating environment.",

Ducky is able to extract data flexibly from various structured web pages, remove noise from extracted data and integrate multiple pages from different sites.

Current developments lead us to identify improvement points and remodel the design of the SuperSQL architecture. Among them, in the current SuperSQL version, the emptiness of one single relation leads to the emptiness of the entire table forming the output data. This is because the process handling the retrieval of desired data does not consider the schema representation of the data and thus does not identify independence between data lists. In this paper, we propose a new process of data retrieval based on a three layers model: the definition layer, the equivalence layer and the optimisation layer. As a result, our proposed architecture is able to manage empty sets and allows easier integration to support future developments.",

Complex queries may result from the inclusion of formatting data and when errors occur in such queries, debugging could be difficult.

We propose an adaptive data presentation system (ACTIVIEW) which is an extension of SuperSQL which creates HTML pages dynamically adapting to the size of screen. However, there are too many patterns of layout which meets browser size restriction. Therefore, to optimize the layout, we introduce the cost function and propose the optimization algorithm for layouts. We also incorporate the idea of personalization to create the page which consists of personal data and to change the layout according to user\u2019s preference. In ACTIVIEW, the three basic rules for the layout conversion are provided and applying these rules, an efficient layout conversion technique optimized to user environment is proposed. Moreover, we propose a standard for converting layouts and a layout optimization algorithm for adaptive conversion of layouts.",

            "abstract": "An organization usually operates its own mailing system to provide each person with an e-mail address under its domain name. There may exist a number of mailing lists in use, each of which refers to a group of its subscribers. The problem entailed in this conventional mailing scheme is that it requires constant administration from its initiation to its maintenance. This paper proposes a rule-based mailing system where e-mail is delivered based on rules, instead of its recipients' e-mail addresses. With this rule-based mailing approach, the administrator need not any more manage individual e-mail addresses and mailing lists respectively since it guarantees a single point of administration by involving the organization's database. Furthermore, it virtually offers numerous mailing lists without actually having them. Our rule-based mailing scheme is straightforward to establish, fully compatible with any existing mailing systems, yet achieves an efficient way to construct an organization's internal mailing system.",

SuperSQL is an enhanced query-processing system that converts database records into a variety of formats such as XML, HTML, PDF and etc. However, the existing SuperSQL media generator would require creation of a different processor for each medium, causing duplicated development cost. This research makes three main contributions: First, it analyzes the structures of various media, examining any possibility of integration based on their common structure. Second, it also facilitates the addition of a new output media generator by separating constructors and decorators from each medium. Last, it provides an integrated user interface to each media by method of the Media Abstraction Table Concept. We also show the performance and feasibility of our system using experimental results.",

To provide persistence, a disk based logging method has been widely used, however it is not applicable for sensor streams because of its tardiness. In this paper, we propose the light neighbor write ahead logging protocol(L-WAL) for sensor streams. The L-WAL is a refinement of the neighbor-WAL (N-WAL). The L-WAL needs two network interfaces and applies a relaxed protocol rather than a two phase commit protocol. Since the relaxed protocol weakens the guarantee of logging successes, we have incorporated a repair system and checker system to enhance the guarantee. The result of experiments shows that the L-WAL is about 2.13 times faster than the N-WAL when the number of concurrent sensor streams is 250 and the L-WAL can enhance the persistence of data almost for free, while the N-WAL needs to pay high cost.",

Consequently, the legacy data currently stored in a relational database need to be migrated by adding more structures onto them.SuperSQL is a database publishing/presentation extension of SQL to yield a query result presented as a document in any of several target media, for example, HTML, Java, LaTeX and Excel work sheets. When a Web (HTML) document is the target medium, SuperSQL produces intra-page and inter-page (hyper-link) structures in arbitrary size and complexity.In this paper, we further extend the SuperSQL so that it could also generate O2C language source code as the result of a query in order to migrate data to O2.

When some of the dimension tables are also very large, it may take too much time and storage to join the fact table with these dimension tables. The performance of the join algorithm becomes critical under such a condition. The fluent join is a join algorithm that operates on relations organized as multidimensional linear hash files. Like a merge join on relations which are already sorted on the joining key, its execution reads each page in the operand relations no more than once and does not create intermediate result files. Unlike sorting, the multi-dimensional linear hash can cluster records in several keys symmetrically. In this paper, the concept of the fluent join is applied to an OLAP system to cluster records in each table on the joining keys. As a result, the algorithm yields symmetric performances on joins with different dimension tables.",
