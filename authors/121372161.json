However, the reported data were incomplete.We propose a novel surveillance system based on data from multiple sources to accurately assess the epidemic status of different countries, especially for those with missing surveillance data in some periods. The proposed method can automatically select a small set of reliable and informative indicators for assessing the underlying epidemic status and proper supporting data to train the predictive model. Our proactive selection method outperforms three other out-of-box methods (linear regression, multilayer perceptron, and long-short term memory) to make accurate predictions.",

Hong Kong has implemented stringent public health and social measures (PHSMs) to curb COVID-19 epidemic waves since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on 22 January 2020. People are likely to engage in collective behaviour online during extreme events, such as the COVID-19 crisis, to express their awareness, actions and concerns. Here, we offer a framework to evaluate interactions among individuals emotions, perception, and online behaviours in Hong Kong during the first two waves (February to June 2020) and found a strong correlation between online behaviours of Google search and the real-time reproduction numbers. To validate the model output of risk perception, we conducted 10 rounds of cross-sectional telephone surveys from February 1 through June 20 in 2020 to quantify risk perception levels over time. Compared with the survey results, the estimates of the risk perception of individuals using our network-based mechanistic model capture 80% of the trend of people risk perception (individuals who worried about being infected) during the studied period. We may need to reinvigorate the public by engaging people as part of the solution to live their lives with reduced risk.",

In this study, the effectiveness and cost of digital contact tracing (DCT) technology-based on-campus mitigation strategy are studied through epidemic simulations using high-resolution empirical contact networks of teachers and students. Compared with traditional class, grade, and school closure strategies, the DCT-based strategy offers a practical yet much more efficient way of mitigating COVID-19 spreading in the crowded campus. Specifically, the strategy based on DCT can achieve the same level of disease control as rigid school suspensions but with significantly fewer students quarantined. We further explore the necessary conditions to ensure the effectiveness of DCT-based strategy and auxiliary strategies to enhance mitigation effectiveness and make the following recommendation: social distancing should be implemented along with DCT, the adoption rate of DCT devices should be assured, and swift virus tests should be carried out to discover asymptomatic infections and stop their subsequent transmissions. We also argue that primary schools have higher disease transmission risks than high schools and, thereby, should be alerted when considering reopenings.",

            "abstract": "Various measures have been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even with widespread vaccination, the control of the epidemic is still difficult due to the mutation of the virus. When an epidemic breaks out, the simplest and most efficient method of control is still social isolation, which greatly affects daily lives and mobility patterns. To study mobility patterns, we leveraged mobile base station data in Shulan, China, during the epidemic. Our main discoveries are as follows: (1) With the development of COVID-19, travel volumes and the scopes of trips were gradually reduced. (2) In addition to the government\u2019s prevention policy, media coverage of COVID-19 had a huge impact on mobility patterns. (3) Previous studies focused on morning and evening rush hours. However, our results show that humans tend to intensively travel at noon. (4) The travel network was significantly more active in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak; hence, the possibility of disease transmission was greater. (5) With the development of the epidemic, travel intervals became increasingly longer, and the number of contacts between base stations decreased. (6) By analyzing the temporal path length, we found that some nodes were still active during the epidemic.",

            "abstract": "The robustness is a crucial and essential problem of a subway network (SN), which can help us improve the efficiency of a transportation system. Several existing researches have analyzed the SN robustness based on the rail structure or the static distribution of passenger flow. However, the spatiotemporal characteristic of passenger flow also plays an important role in the SN robustness, since it can trigger some unexpected cascading failures in SN. Therefore, how to characterize the effect of this cascading failure on the SN robustness still remains an important and open problem. In this paper, we address the above problem as follows: (1) we propose a temporal subway network (TSN) to consider the dynamics of passenger flow in SN; (2) we adopt the linear threshold (LT) model to simulate the cascading failure process of TSN and propose a new robustness metric $R(t)$ to evaluate the effect of this cascading failure on SN robustness. Based on the Shanghai subway smart card data, we carry out extensive experiments to analyze the effects of the cascading failure on the Shanghai SN robustness. Experiments show that the Shanghai TSN robustness varies over time. More significantly, the large volume of passenger flow can increase the impact of failure modes (i.e., random and malicious failure modes) on the Shanghai TSN robustness.",

With a highly mobile population exceeding 24 million people, Shanghai, China is a transportation hub at high risk for the importation and subsequent global propagation of infectious diseases. Here, we use a dynamic metapopulation model informed by hourly transit data for Shanghai to estimate epidemic risks across thousands of outbreak scenarios. We find that the rate of initial epidemic growth varies by more than twenty-fold, depending on the hour and neighborhood of disease introduction. The riskiest introductions are those occurring close to the city center and on Fridays--which bridge weekday and weekend transit patterns and thereby connect otherwise disconnected portions of the population. The identification of these spatio-temporal hotspots can inform more efficient targets for sentinel surveillance and strategies for mitigating transmission.",

            "title": "Understanding the Spatial and Temporal Activity Patterns of Subway Mobility Flows",
            "abstract": "In urban transportation systems, mobility flows in the subway system reflect the spatial and temporal dynamics of working days. To investigate the variability of mobility flows, we analyse the spatial community through a series of snapshots of subway stations over sequential periods. Using Shanghai as a case study, we find that the spatial community snapshots reveal dynamic passenger activities. Adopting a dual-perspective, we apply spatial and temporal models separately to explore where and when individuals travel for entertainment. In the two models, microblog topics and spatial facilities such as food venues and entertainment businesses are used to characterise the spatial popularity of each station and people's travelling perceptions. In the studied case, the city centre is characterised by greater social influence, and it is better described by the spatial model. In the temporal model, shorter travel distances motivate individuals to start their trips earlier. Interestingly, as the number of food-related facilities near the starting station increases, until it exceeds 1563, the speed of people's journeys slows down. This study provides a method for modelling the effects of social features on mobility flows and for predicting the spatial-temporal mobility flows of newly built subway stations.",
