            "abstract": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) seeks to build ML models with minimal human effort. While considerable research has been conducted in the area of AutoML in general, aiming to take humans out of the loop when building artificial intelligence (AI) applications, scant literature has focused on how AutoML works well in open-environment scenarios such as the process of training and updating large models, industrial supply chains or the industrial metaverse, where people often face open-loop problems during the search process: they must continuously collect data, update data and models, satisfy the requirements of the development and deployment environment, support massive devices, modify evaluation metrics, etc. Addressing the open-environment issue with pure data-driven approaches requires considerable data, computing resources, and effort from dedicated data engineers, making current AutoML systems and platforms inefficient and computationally intractable. Human-computer interaction is a practical and feasible way to tackle the problem of open-environment AI. In this paper, we introduce OmniForce, a human-centered AutoML (HAML) system that yields both human-assisted ML and ML-assisted human techniques, to put an AutoML system into practice and build adaptive AI in open-environment scenarios. Specifically, we present OmniForce in terms of ML version management; pipeline-driven development and deployment collaborations; a flexible search strategy framework; and widely provisioned and crowdsourced application algorithms, including large models. Furthermore, the (large) models constructed by OmniForce can be automatically turned into remote services in a few minutes; this process is dubbed model as a service (MaaS). Experimental results obtained in multiple search spaces and real-world use cases demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of OmniForce.",

            "abstract": "The standard option framework is developed on the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) which is unstable to optimize and sample inefficient. To this end, we propose the Hidden Temporal MDP (HiT-MDP) and prove that the option-induced HiT-MDP is homomorphic equivalent to the option-induced SMDP. A novel transformer-based framework is introduced to learn options\u2019 embedding vectors (rather than conventional option tuples) on HiT-MDPs. We then derive a stable and sample efficient option discovering method under the maximum-entropy policy gradient framework. Extensive experiments on challenging Mujoco environments demonstrate HiT-MDP\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness: under widely used configurations, HiT-MDP achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines on all finite horizon and transfer learning environments. Moreover, HiT-MDP significantly outperforms all baselines on infinite horizon environments while exhibiting smaller variance, faster convergence, and better interpretability. Our work potentially sheds light on the theoretical ground of extending the option framework into a large scale foundation model.",

            "title": "3DDesigner: Towards Photorealistic 3D Object Generation and Editing with Text-guided Diffusion Models",
            "abstract": "Text-guided diffusion models have shown superior performance in image/video generation and editing. While few explorations have been performed in 3D scenarios. In this paper, we discuss three fundamental and interesting problems on this topic. First, we equip text-guided diffusion models to achieve 3D-consistent generation. Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like neural field to generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view. Such results can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to two different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study 3D local editing and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360-degree manipulated results by editing an object from a single view. Step 1, we propose to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted noises. Step 2, we conduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D blended noises into the view-independent text embedding space. Once the corresponding text embedding is obtained, 360-degree images can be generated. Last but not least, we extend our model to perform one-shot novel view synthesis by fine-tuning on a single image, firstly showing the potential of leveraging text guidance for novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments and various applications show the prowess of our 3DDesigner. The project page is available at https://3ddesigner-diffusion.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks have emerged as a leading architecture for many graph-level tasks, such as graph classification and graph generation. As an essential component of the architecture, graph pooling is indispensable for obtaining a holistic graph-level representation of the whole graph. Although a great variety of methods have been proposed in this promising and fast-developing research field, to the best of our knowledge, little effort has been made to systematically summarize these works. To set the stage for the development of future works, in this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by providing a broad review of recent methods for graph pooling. Specifically, 1) we first propose a taxonomy of existing graph pooling methods with a mathematical summary for each category; 2) then, we provide an overview of the libraries related to graph pooling, including the commonly used datasets, model architectures for downstream tasks, and open-source implementations; 3) next, we further outline the applications that incorporate the idea of graph pooling in a variety of domains; 4) finally, we discuss certain critical challenges facing current studies and share our insights on future potential directions for research on the improvement of graph pooling.",

            "abstract": "Stock price movement not only depends on the history of individual stock movements, but also complex hidden dynamics associated with other correlated stocks. Despite the substantial effort made to understand the principles of stock price movement, few attempts have been made to predict movement direction based upon a single stock's historical records together with its correlated stocks. Here, we present a multi-task recurrent neural network (RNN) with high-order Markov random fields (MRFs) to predict stock price movement direction. Specifically, we first design a multi-task RNN framework to extract informative features from the raw market data of individual stocks without considering any domain knowledge. Next, we employ binary MRFs with unary features and weighted lower linear envelopes as the higher-order energy function to capture higher-order consistency within the same stock clique (group). We also derive a latent structural SVM algorithm to learn higher-order MRFs in a polynomial number of iterations. Finally, a sub-gradient algorithm is employed to perform end-to-end training of the RNN and high-order MRFs. We conduct thorough empirical studies on three popular Chinese stock market indexes and the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches. To our best knowledge, the proposed technique is the first to investigate intra-clique relationships with higher-order MRFs for stock price movement prediction.",

An important class of works are focusing on exploiting the structural relationships between companies for accurate stock price prediction. In this paper we develop an algorithm for learning the parameters of unary and binary potentials in binary markov random fields (MRFs) under the max-margin framework. We first show how to train unary potentials using market price data and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Then, we developed a graph-cut based algorithm to solve the inference problem exactly. We demonstrate the learning of potentials' parameters using a max-margin learning framework. Experiment is conducted by comparing performances between our formulation and conventional SVM method. Results show that our method outperforms SVM by 27.9% on train set and 40.5% on test set.",
