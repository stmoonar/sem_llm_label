            "title": "PaCEr: Network Embedding From Positional to Structural",
            "abstract": "Network embedding plays an important role in a variety of social network applications. Existing network embedding methods, explicitly or implicitly, can be categorized into positional embedding (PE) methods or structural embedding (SE) methods. Specifically, PE methods encode the positional information and obtain similar embeddings for adjacent/close nodes, while SE methods aim to learn identical representations for nodes with the same local structural patterns, even if the two nodes are far away from each other. The disparate designs of the two types of methods lead to an apparent dilemma in that no embedding could perfectly capture both positional and structural information. In this paper, we seek to demystify the underlying relationship between positional embedding and structural embedding. We first point out that the positional embedding can produce the structural embedding with simple transformations, while the opposite direction cannot hold. Based on this finding, a novel network embedding model PACER is proposed, which optimizes the positional embedding with the help of random walk with restart (RWR) proximity distribution, and such positional embedding is then used to seamlessly obtain the structural embedding with simple transformations. Furthermore, two variants of PACER are proposed to handle node classification task on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Extensive experiments on 17 datasets show that PACER achieves comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-arts.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become core building blocks behind a myriad of graph learning tasks. The vast majority of the existing GNNs are built upon, either implicitly or explicitly, the homophily assumption, which is not always true and could heavily degrade the performance of learning tasks. In response, GNNs tailored for heterophilic graphs have been developed. However, most of the existing works are designed for the specific GNN models to address heterophily, which lacks generality. In this paper, we study the problem from the structure learning perspective and propose a family of general solutions named ALT. It can work hand in hand with most of the existing GNNs to handle graphs with either low or high homophily. At the core of our method is learning to (1) decompose a given graph into two components, (2) extract complementary graph signals from these two components, and (3) adaptively integrate the graph signals for node classification. Moreover, analysis based on graph signal processing shows that our framework can empower a broad range of existing GNNs to have adaptive filter characteristics and further modulate the input graph signals, which is critical for handling complex homophilic/heterophilic patterns. The proposed ALT brings significant and consistent performance improvement in node classification for a wide range of GNNs over a variety of real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection aims to identify the atypical substructures and has attracted an increasing amount of research attention due to its profound impacts in a variety of application domains, including social network analysis, security, finance, and many more. The lack of prior knowledge of the ground-truth anomaly has been a major obstacle in acquiring fine-grained annotations (e.g., anomalous nodes), therefore, a plethora of existing methods have been developed either with a limited number of node-level supervision or in an unsupervised manner. Nonetheless, annotations for coarse-grained graph elements (e.g., a suspicious group of nodes), which often require marginal human effort in terms of time and expertise, are comparatively easier to obtain. Therefore, it is appealing to investigate anomaly detection in a weakly-supervised setting and to establish the intrinsic relationship between annotations at different levels of granularity. In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of weakly-supervised graph anomaly detection with coarse-grained supervision by (1) proposing a novel architecture of graph neural network with attention mechanism named WEDGE that can identify the critical node-level anomaly given a few labels of anomalous subgraphs, and (2) designing a novel objective with contrastive loss that facilitates node representation learning by enforcing distinctive representations between normal and abnormal graph elements. Through extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, we corroborate the efficacy of our proposed method, improving AUC-ROC by up to 16.48% compared to the best competitor.",

            "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has exhibited strong empirical performance in many real-world applications. The vast majority of existing works on GCN primarily focus on the accuracy while ignoring how confident or uncertain a GCN is with respect to its predictions. Despite being a cornerstone of trustworthy graph mining, uncertainty quantification on GCN has not been well studied and the scarce existing efforts either fail to provide deterministic quantification or have to change the training procedure of GCN by introducing additional parameters or architectures. In this paper, we propose the first frequentist-based approach named JuryGCN in quantifying the uncertainty of GCN, where the key idea is to quantify the uncertainty of a node as the width of confidence interval by a jackknife estimator. Moreover, we leverage the influence functions to estimate the change in GCN parameters without re-training to scale up the computation. The proposed JuryGCN is capable of quantifying uncertainty deterministically without modifying the GCN architecture or introducing additional parameters. We perform extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets in the tasks of both active learning and semi-supervised node classification, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Subteam replacement is defined as finding the optimal candidate set of people who can best function as an unavailable subset of members (i.e., subteam) for certain reasons (e.g., conflicts of interests, employee churn), given a team of people embedded in a social network working on the same task. Prior investigations on this problem incorporate graph kernel as the optimal criteria for measuring the similarity between the new optimized team and the original team. However, the increasingly abundant social networks reveal fundamental limitations of existing methods, including (1) the graph kernel-based approaches are powerless to capture the key intrinsic correlations among node features, (2) they generally search over the entire network for every member to be replaced, making it extremely inefficient as the network grows, and (3) the requirement of equal-sized replacement for the unavailable subteam can be inapplicable due to limited hiring budget. In this work, we address the limitations in the state-of-the-art for subteam replacement by (1) proposing GENIUS, a novel clustering-based graph neural network (GNN) framework that can capture team network knowledge for flexible subteam replacement, and (2) equipping the proposed GENIUS with self-supervised positive team contrasting training scheme to improve the team-level representation learning and unsupervised node clusters to prune candidates for fast computation. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method (1) effectiveness: being able to select better candidate members that significantly increase the similarity between the optimized and original teams, and (2) efficiency: achieving more than 600 times speed-up in average running time.",

            "abstract": "Multi-layered inter-dependent networks have emerged in a wealth of high-impact application domains. Cross-layer dependency inference, which aims to predict the dependencies between nodes across different layers, plays a pivotal role in such multi-layered network systems. Most, if not all, of existing methods exclusively follow a coupling principle of design and can be categorized into the following two groups, including (1) heterogeneous network embedding based methods (data coupling), and (2) collaborative filtering based methods (module coupling). Despite the favorable achievement, methods of both types are faced with two intricate challenges, including (1) the sparsity challenge where very limited observations of cross-layer dependencies are available, resulting in a deteriorated prediction of missing dependencies, and (2) the dynamic challenge given that the multi-layered network system is constantly evolving over time. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the inability of existing methods to resolve the sparsity challenge roots in the coupling principle from the perspectives of both data coupling and module coupling. Armed with such theoretical analysis, we pursue a new principle where the key idea is to decouple the within-layer connectivity from the observed cross-layer dependencies. Specifically, to tackle the sparsity challenge for static networks, we propose FITO-S, which incorporates a position embedding matrix generated by random walk with restart and the embedding space transformation function. More essentially, the decoupling principle ameliorates the dynamic challenge, which naturally leads to FITO-D, being capable of tracking the inference results in the dynamic setting through incrementally updating the position embedding matrix and fine-tuning the space transformation function. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework FITO for cross-layer dependency inference.",

            "abstract": "Network anomaly detection, also known as graph anomaly detection, aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority. It has a profound impact in a variety of applications ranging from finance, healthcare to social network analysis. Due to the unbearable labeling cost, existing methods are predominately developed in an unsupervised manner. Nonetheless, the anomalies they identify may turn out to be data noises or uninteresting data instances due to the lack of prior knowledge on the anomalies of interest. Hence, it is critical to investigate and develop few-shot learning for network anomaly detection. In real-world scenarios, few labeled anomalies are also easy to be accessed on similar networks from the same domain as of the target network, while most of the existing works omit to leverage them and merely focus on a single network. Taking advantage of this potential, in this work, we tackle the problem of few-shot network anomaly detection by (1) proposing a new family of graph neural networks \u2013 Graph Deviation Networks (GDN) that can leverage a small number of labeled anomalies for enforcing statistically significant deviations between abnormal and normal nodes on a network; and (2) equipping the proposed GDN with a new cross-network meta-learning algorithm to realize few-shot network anomaly detection by transferring meta-knowledge from multiple auxiliary networks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on few-shot or even one-shot network anomaly detection.",

            "title": "Attent: Active Attributed Network Alignment",
            "abstract": "Network alignment finds node correspondences across multiple networks, where the alignment accuracy is of crucial importance because of its profound impact on downstream applications. The vast majority of existing works focus on how to best utilize the topology and attribute information of the input networks as well as the anchor links when available. Nonetheless, it has not been well studied on how to boost the alignment performance through actively obtaining high-quality and informative anchor links, with a few exceptions. The sparse literature on active network alignment introduces the human in the loop to label some seed node correspondence (i.e., anchor links), which are informative from the perspective of querying the most uncertain node given few potential matchings. However, the direct influence of the intrinsic network attribute information on the alignment results has largely remained unknown. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose an active network alignment method (Attent) to identify the best nodes to query. The key idea of the proposed method is to leverage effective and efficient influence functions defined over the alignment solution to evaluate the goodness of the candidate nodes for query. Our proposed query strategy bears three distinct advantages, including (1) effectiveness, being able to accurately quantify the influence of the candidate nodes on the alignment results; (2) efficiency, scaling linearly with 15 \u2212 17 \u00d7 speed-up over the straight-forward implementation without any quality loss; (3) generality, consistently improving alignment performance of a variety of network alignment algorithms.",

            "title": "Towards Real Time Team Optimization",
            "abstract": "Teams can be often viewed as a dynamic system where the team configuration evolves over time (e.g., new members join the team; existing members leave the team; the skills of the members improve over time). Consequently, the performance of the team might be changing due to such team dynamics. A natural question is how to plan the (re-)staffing actions (e.g., recruiting a new team member) at each time step so as to maximize the expected cumulative performance of the team. In this paper, we address the problem of real-time team optimization by intelligently selecting the best candidates towards increasing the similarity between the current team and the high-performance teams according to the team configuration at each time-step. The key idea is to formulate it as a Markov Decision process (MDP) problem and leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning to optimize the team dynamically. The proposed method bears two main advantages, including (1) dynamics, being able to model the dynamics of the team to optimize the initial team towards the direction of a high-performance team via performance feedback; (2) efficacy, being able to handle the large state/action space via deep reinforcement learning based value estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive empirical evaluations.",
