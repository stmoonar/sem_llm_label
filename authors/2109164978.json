            "title": "Discrete Semantic Tokenization for Deep CTR Prediction",
            "abstract": "Incorporating item content information into click-through rate (CTR) prediction models remains a challenge, especially with the time and space constraints of industrial scenarios. The content-encoding paradigm, which integrates user and item encoders directly into CTR models, prioritizes space over time. In contrast, the embedding-based paradigm transforms item and user semantics into latent embeddings, subsequently caching them to optimize processing time at the expense of space. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic-token paradigm and propose a discrete semantic tokenization approach, namely UIST, for user and item representation. UIST facilitates swift training and inference while maintaining a conservative memory footprint. Specifically, UIST quantizes dense embedding vectors into discrete tokens with shorter lengths and employs a hierarchical mixture inference module to weigh the contribution of each user-item token pair. Our experimental results on news recommendation showcase the effectiveness and efficiency (about 200-fold space compression) of UIST for CTR prediction.",

            "title": "Backdoor Graph Condensation",
            "abstract": "Recently, graph condensation has emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on a large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), the security issues of graph condensation have not been studied. To bridge this research gap, we propose the task of backdoor graph condensation. While graph backdoor attacks have been extensively explored, applying existing graph backdoor methods for graph condensation is not practical since they can undermine the model utility and yield low attack success rate. To alleviate these issues, we introduce two primary objectives for backdoor attacks against graph condensation: 1) the injection of triggers cannot affect the quality of condensed graphs, maintaining the utility of GNNs trained on them; and 2) the effectiveness of triggers should be preserved throughout the condensation process, achieving high attack success rate. To pursue the objectives, we devise the first backdoor attack against graph condensation, denoted as BGC. Specifically, we inject triggers during condensation and iteratively update the triggers to ensure effective attacks. Further, we propose a poisoned node selection module to minimize the influence of triggers on condensed graphs' quality. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results demonstrate our method's resilience against multiple defense methods. Finally, we conduct comprehensive studies to analyze the factors that influence the attack performance.",

            "abstract": "Multi-domain learning (MDL) refers to simultaneously constructing a model or a set of models on datasets collected from different domains. Conventional approaches emphasize domain-shared information extraction and domain-private information preservation, following the shared-private framework (SP models), which offers significant advantages over single-domain learning. However, the limited availability of annotated data in each domain considerably hinders the effectiveness of conventional supervised MDL approaches in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called multi-domain contrastive learning (MDCL) to alleviate the impact of insufficient annotations by capturing both semantic and structural information from both labeled and unlabeled data.Specifically, MDCL comprises two modules: inter-domain semantic alignment and intra-domain contrast. The former aims to align annotated instances of the same semantic category from distinct domains within a shared hidden space, while the latter focuses on learning a cluster structure of unlabeled instances in a private hidden space for each domain. MDCL is readily compatible with many SP models, requiring no additional model parameters and allowing for end-to-end training. Experimental results across five textual and image multi-domain datasets demonstrate that MDCL brings noticeable improvement over various SP models.Furthermore, MDCL can further be employed in multi-domain active learning (MDAL) to achieve a superior initialization, eventually leading to better overall performance.",

            "title": "Dataset Condensation for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Training recommendation models on large datasets often requires significant time and computational resources. Consequently, an emergent imperative has arisen to construct informative, smaller-scale datasets for efficiently training. Dataset compression techniques explored in other domains show potential possibility to address this problem, via sampling a subset or synthesizing a small dataset. However, applying existing approaches to condense recommendation datasets is impractical due to following challenges: (i) sampling-based methods are inadequate in addressing the long-tailed distribution problem; (ii) synthesizing-based methods are not applicable due to discreteness of interactions and large size of recommendation datasets; (iii) neither of them fail to address the specific issue in recommendation of false negative items, where items with potential user interest are incorrectly sampled as negatives owing to insufficient exposure. To bridge this gap, we investigate dataset condensation for recommendation, where discrete interactions are continualized with probabilistic re-parameterization. To avoid catastrophically expensive computations, we adopt a one-step update strategy for inner model training and introducing policy gradient estimation for outer dataset synthesis. To mitigate amplification of long-tailed problem, we compensate long-tailed users in the condensed dataset. Furthermore, we propose to utilize a proxy model to identify false negative items. Theoretical analysis regarding the convergence property is provided. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In particular, we reduce the dataset size by 75% while approximating over 98% of the original performance on Dianping and over 90% on other datasets.",

            "abstract": "Modern techniques in Content-based Recommendation (CBR) leverage item content information to provide personalized services to users, but suffer from resource-intensive training on large datasets. To address this issue, we explore the dataset condensation for textual CBR in this paper. The goal of dataset condensation is to synthesize a small yet informative dataset, upon which models can achieve performance comparable to those trained on large datasets. While existing condensation approaches are tailored to classification tasks for continuous data like images or embeddings, direct application of them to CBR has limitations. To bridge this gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation for content-based recommendation. Inspired by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation, we leverage LLMs to empower the generation of textual content during condensation. To handle the interaction data involving both users and items, we devise a dual-level condensation method: content-level and user-level. At content-level, we utilize LLMs to condense all contents of an item into a new informative title. At user-level, we design a clustering-based synthesis module, where we first utilize LLMs to extract user interests. Then, the user interests and user embeddings are incorporated to condense users and generate interactions for condensed users. Notably, the condensation paradigm of this method is forward and free from iterative optimization on the synthesized dataset. Extensive empirical findings from our study, conducted on three authentic datasets, substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. Particularly, we are able to approximate up to 97% of the original performance while reducing the dataset size by 95% (i.e., on dataset MIND).",

            "abstract": "User-curated item lists, such as video-based playlists on Youtube and book-based lists on Goodreads, have become prevalent for content sharing on online platforms. Item list continuation is proposed to model the overall trend of a list and predict subsequent items. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown promise in comprehending contextual information and capturing item relationships in a list. However, deploying them in real-time industrial applications is challenging, mainly because the autoregressive generation mechanism used in them is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel fast non-autoregressive sequence generation model, namely FANS, to enhance inference efficiency and quality for item list continuation. First, we use a non-autoregressive generation mechanism to decode next K items simultaneously instead of one by one in existing models. Then, we design a two-stage classifier to replace the vanilla classifier used in current transformer-based models to further reduce the decoding time. Moreover, to improve the quality of non-autoregressive generation, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to optimize training. Experimental results on four real-world item list continuation datasets including Zhihu, Spotify, AotM, and Goodreads show that our FANS model can significantly improve inference efficiency (up to 8.7x) while achieving competitive or better generation quality for item list continuation compared with the state-of-the-art autoregressive models. We also validate the efficiency of FANS in an industrial setting. Our source code and data will be available at MindSpore/models1 and Github2.",

            "abstract": "Graph-based collaborative filtering has emerged as a powerful paradigm for delivering personalized recommendations. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, these methods often neglect the underlying intents of users, which constitute a pivotal facet of comprehensive user interests. Consequently, a series of approaches have arisen to tackle this limitation by introducing independent intent representations. However, these approaches fail to capture the intricate relationships between intents of different users and the compatibility between user intents and item properties. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel method, named uniformly co-clustered intent modeling. Specifically, we devise a uniformly contrastive intent modeling module to bring together the embeddings of users with similar intents and items with similar properties. This module aims to model the nuanced relations between intents of different users and properties of different items, especially those unreachable to each other on the user-item graph. To model the compatibility between user intents and item properties, we design the user-item co-clustering module, maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters of users and items. This approach is substantiated through theoretical validation, establishing its efficacy in modeling compatibility to enhance the mutual information between user and item representations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "Social recommendations utilize social relations to enhance the representation learning for recommendations. Most social recommendation models unify user representations for the user-item interactions (collaborative domain) and social relations (social domain). However, such an approach may fail to model the users' heterogeneous behavior patterns in two domains, impairing the expressiveness of user representations. In this work, to address such limitation, we propose a novel Disentangled contrastive learning framework for social Recommendations (DcRec). More specifically, we propose to learn disentangled users' representations from the item and social domains. Moreover, disentangled contrastive learning is designed to perform knowledge transfer between disentangled users' representations for social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.",
