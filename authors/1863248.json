            "abstract": "Assessing the healthiness of food items in images has gained attention in both the computer vision and the nutrition fields. However, such task is generally a difficult one as food images are captured in various settings and thus are usually non-homogeneous. Moreover, assessing how healthy a food item is requires nutritional expertise and knowledge of the constituents of the food item and how it is processed. In this manuscript, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach that can detect and localize various food items in a given food image using a customized object detection model. Our approach then assesses how healthy each detected food item is by classifying it into one or more of the four NOVA groups (Unprocessed Food, Processed Culinary Ingredients, Processed Food, and Ultra-processed Food). To train our food item detection model, we used two public datasets and a custom one we created ourselves and which contains images of food taken using wearable cameras. To train the NOVA food classifier, we use the custom dataset we created ourselves and that was manually labeled by expert nutritionists. Our food item detection model achieved a mAP of 0.90 and the NOVA food classifier achieved an average F1-score of 0.86 on test data.",

            "abstract": "In a world embroiled in armed conflicts, documenting conflict casualties is an important goal for many NGOs. Most of such documented records of casualties are however managed through internal databases, spreadsheets or Web forms. As such, exploring and querying such data becomes extremely chaotic. In this paper, we demonstrate CasualtIS, an RDF data management system for conflict casualties. Our system models conflict casualties data as RDF graphs and allows users to query such data using a SPARQL endpoint. Our system also includes a template-based natural-language querying interface to support non-expert users. Our system can be used for various purposes by end users, such as fact-checking certain claims about conflict casualties, aggregating casualties over time and location, and finding contextual information about casualties, such as the cause of death, actors involved, and other similar critical information. We demonstrate our system using two case studies, one related to casualties in the Iraqi war and the other related to casualties in the Syrian war.",

            "title": "Quantifying and Addressing Ranking Disparity in Human-Powered Data Acquisition",
            "abstract": "Algorithmic bias has been identified as a key challenge in many AI applications. One major source of bias is the data used to build these applications. For instance, many AI applications rely on human users to generate training data. The generated data might be biased if the data acquisition process is skewed towards certain groups of people based on say gender, ethnicity or location. This typically happens as a result of a hidden association between the people's qualifications for data acquisition and the people's protected attributes. In this paper, we study how to unveil and address disparity in data acquisition. We focus on the case where the data acquisition process involves ranking of people and we define disparity as the unbalanced targeting of people by the data acquisition process. To quantify disparity, we formulate an optimization problem that partitions people on their protected attributes, computes the qualifications of people in each partition, and finds the partitioning that exhibits the highest disparity in qualifications. Due to the combinatorial nature of our problem, we devise heuristics to navigate the space of partitions. We also discuss how to address disparity between partitions. We conduct a series of experiments on real and simulated datasets that demonstrate that our proposed approach is successful in quantifying and addressing ranking disparity in human-powered data acquisition.",

            "abstract": "Information and communication technologies have changed the way students learn, and higher education institutions in the Middle East region strive to attract professors who use technology in their daily teaching and learning practices. This study examines students\u2019 experiences of a Web-enhanced computer science course. In an online survey based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) model, 132 students\u2019 responses to 31 items were measured and analyzed. Factor analysis revealed three pre-dominated factors: technology, pedagogy-content and TPACK; of these, technology was found to exert the strongest influence on students\u2019 educational experiences. The findings are discussed in relation to the TPACK model, along with implications for theory and practice. This investigation provides insights into current initiatives in the Middle East region that encourage higher education institutions to implement technology in teaching and learning. It contributes to the literature by deepening understanding of how new approaches in education are diffused and adopted.",

            "title": "Fairness of Scoring in Online Job Marketplaces",
            "abstract": "We study fairness of scoring in online job marketplaces. We focus on group fairness and aim to algorithmically explore how a scoring function, through which individuals are ranked for jobs, treats different demographic groups. Previous work on group-level fairness has focused on the case where groups are pre-defined or where they are defined using a single protected attribute (e.g., whites vs. blacks or males vs. females). In this article, we argue for the need to examine fairness for groups of people defined with any combination of protected attributes (the-so called subgroup fairness). Existing work also assumes the availability of worker\u2019s data (i.e., data transparency) and the scoring function (i.e., process transparency). We relax that assumption in this work and run user studies to assess the effect of different data and process transparency settings on the ability to assess fairness. To quantify the fairness of a scoring of a group of individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to find a partitioning of those individuals on their protected attributes that exhibits the highest unfairness with respect to the scoring function. The scoring function yields one histogram of score distributions per partition and we rely on Earth Mover\u2019s Distance, a measure that is commonly used to compare histograms, to quantify unfairness. Since the number of ways to partition individuals is exponential in the number of their protected attributes, we propose a heuristic algorithm to navigate the space of all possible partitionings to identify the one with the highest unfairness. We evaluate our algorithm using a simulation of a crowdsourcing platform and show that it can effectively quantify unfairness of various scoring functions. We additionally run experiments to assess the applicability of our approach in other less-transparent data and process settings. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in assessing fairness of scoring in a real dataset crawled from the online job marketplace TaskRabbit.",

            "abstract": "Word embeddings have proven to be an effective method for capturing semantic relations among distinct terms within a large corpus. In this paper, we present a set of word embeddings learnt from three large Lebanese news archives, which collectively consist of 609,386 scanned newspaper images and spanning a total of 151 years, ranging from 1933 till 2011. The diversified ideological nature of the news archives alongside the temporal variability of the embeddings offer a rare glimpse onto the variation of word representation across the left-right political spectrum. To train the word embeddings, Google\u2019s Tesseract 4.0 OCR engine was employed to transcribe the scanned news archives, and various archive-level as well as decade-level word embeddings were learnt. To evaluate the accuracy of the learnt word embeddings, a benchmark of analogy tasks was used. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive system that allows the end user to visualize for a given word of interest, the variation of the top-k closest words in the embedding space as a function of time and across news archives using an animated scatter plot.",

Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Online job marketplaces are becoming very popular. Either jobs or people are ranked by algorithms. For example, Google and Facebook job search return a ranked list of jobs given a search query. TaskRabbit and Fiverr, on the other hand, produce rank-ings of workers for a given query. Qapa, an online marketplace, can be used to rank both workers and jobs. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for fairness to study ranking workers and jobs. We case study two particular sites: Google job search and TaskRabbit. Our framework addresses group fairness where groups are obtained with any combination of protected attributes. We define a measure for unfairness for a given group, query and location. We also define two generic fairness problems that we address in our framework: quantification, such as finding the k groups (resp., queries, locations) for which the site is most or least unfair, and comparison, such as finding the locations at which fairness between two groups differs from all locations, or finding the queries for which fairness at two locations differ from all queries. Since the number of groups, queries and locations can be arbitrarily large, we adapt Fagin top-k algorithms to address our fairness problems. To evaluate our framework, we run extensive experiments on two datasets crawled from TaskRabbit and Google job search.",

            "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) plays a significant role in many applications such as information extraction, information retrieval, question answering, and even machine translation. Most of the work on NER using deep learning was done for non-Arabic languages like English and French, and only few studies focused on Arabic. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach to train a BERT-based NER model using labeled and semi-labeled datasets. We compared our approach against various baselines, and state-of-the-art Arabic NER tools on three datasets: AQMAR, NEWS, and TWEETS. We report a significant improvement in F-measure for the AQMAR and the NEWS datasets, which are written in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and competitive results for the TWEETS dataset, which contains tweets that are mostly in the Egyptian dialect and contain many mistakes or misspellings.",

            "abstract": "Word embeddings are a core component of modern natural language processing systems, making the ability to thoroughly evaluate them a vital task. We describe DiaLex, a benchmark for intrinsic evaluation of dialectal Arabic word embeddings. DiaLex covers five important Arabic dialects: Algerian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Syrian, and Tunisian. Across these dialects, DiaLex provides a testbank for six syntactic and semantic relations, namely male to female, singular to dual, singular to plural, antonym, comparative, and genitive to past tense. DiaLex thus consists of a collection of word pairs representing each of the six relations in each of the five dialects. To demonstrate the utility of DiaLex, we use it to evaluate a set of existing and new Arabic word embeddings that we developed. Beyond evaluation of word embeddings, DiaLex supports efforts to integrate dialects into the Arabic language curriculum. It can be easily translated into Modern Standard Arabic and English, which can be useful for evaluating word translation. Our benchmark, evaluation code, and new word embedding models will be publicly available.",
