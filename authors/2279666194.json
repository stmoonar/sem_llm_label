            "title": "Authorship Obfuscation in Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection",
            "abstract": "High-quality text generation capability of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) causes concerns about their misuse (e.g., in massive generation/spread of disinformation). Machine-generated text (MGT) detection is important to cope with such threats. However, it is susceptible to authorship obfuscation (AO) methods, such as paraphrasing, which can cause MGTs to evade detection. So far, this was evaluated only in monolingual settings. Thus, the susceptibility of recently proposed multilingual detectors is still unknown. We fill this gap by comprehensively benchmarking the performance of 10 well-known AO methods, attacking 37 MGT detection methods against MGTs in 11 languages (i.e., 10 $\\times$ 37 $\\times$ 11 = 4,070 combinations). We also evaluate the effect of data augmentation on adversarial robustness using obfuscated texts. The results indicate that all tested AO methods can cause evasion of automated detection in all tested languages, where homoglyph attacks are especially successful. However, some of the AO methods severely damaged the text, making it no longer readable or easily recognizable by humans (e.g., changed language, weird characters).",

            "title": "Fake Resume Attacks: Data Poisoning on Online Job Platforms",
            "abstract": "While recent studies have exposed various vulnerabilities incurred from data poisoning attacks in many web services, little is known about the vulnerability on online professional job platforms (e.g., LinkedIn and Indeed). In this work, first time, we demonstrate the critical vulnerabilities found in the common Human Resources (HR) task of matching job seekers and companies on online job platforms. Capitalizing on the unrestricted format and contents of job seekers' resumes and easy creation of accounts on job platforms, we demonstrate three attack scenarios: (1) company promotion attack to increase the likelihood of target companies being recommended, (2) company demotion attack to decrease the likelihood of target companies being recommended, and (3) user promotion attack to increase the likelihood of certain users being matched to certain companies. To this end, we develop an end-to-end \"fake resume\" generation framework, titled FRANCIS, that induces systematic prediction errors via data poisoning. Our empirical evaluation on real-world datasets reveals that data poisoning attacks can markedly skew the results of matchmaking between job seekers and companies, regardless of underlying models, with vulnerability amplified in proportion to poisoning intensity. These findings suggest that the outputs of various services from job platforms can be potentially hacked by malicious users.",
