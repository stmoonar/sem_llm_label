            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel kind of trajectory analysis, so called context matching. It matches a given trajectory against a movement model, which is given as a Markov chain, capturing what we call the movement context. Particle filters are then used to match a given trajectory against its movement context with the ultimate goal of inferring semantic properties of the movement trajectory. Firstly, we introduce the method in its generality by illustrating multiple showcases. Secondly, we develop the formal model of context-matching. Finally, we illustrate an example use-case for annotating trajectories of fishing vessels into fishing and sailing segments. By doing so, we show the effectiveness of context matching and its use in enriching real-world trajectory datasets.",

            "abstract": "A moving body is a geometry that may translate and rotate over time. Computing the time-varying distance between moving bodies and surrounding static and moving objects is crucial to many application domains including safety at sea, logistics robots, and autonomous vehicles. Not only is it a relevant analytical operation in itself, but also it forms the basis of other operations, such as finding the nearest approach distance between two moving objects. Most moving objects databases represent moving objects using a point representation, and the computed temporal distance is thus inaccurate when working with large moving objects. This article presents an efficient algorithm to compute the temporal distance between a moving body and other static or moving geometries. We extend the idea of the V-Clip and Lin-Canney closest features algorithms of computational geometry to track the temporal evolution of the closest pair of features between two objects during their movement. We also present a working implementation of this algorithm in an open-source moving objects database and show, using a real-world example on AIS data, that this distance operator for moving bodies is only about 1.5 times as slow as the one for moving points while providing significant improvements in correctness and accuracy of the results.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of shipping CO2 emissions is important for developing regulations to combat the greenhouse effect. Many shipping CO2 emissions models have been proposed in the past decades. However, most of them are only validated for a few specific ships, and there is a lack of data-driven validation and comparison of these models on a large scale. To fill this gap, this study proposes a general evaluation framework to quantitatively validate and compare different emission models. This framework is based on data integration of three types of data sources: ship technical details, AIS trajectory, and weather. Along with emission models, these data are fed into three carefully-designed modules that perform analysis at both grid and trajectory level as well as use annually aggregated fuel consumption ground truth. Extensive experiments are conducted on one-month data from 1,571 ships passing Danish waters to demonstrate the utility of the framework and insights into the accuracy of five popular CO2 emission models are presented.",

            "abstract": "Selectivity estimation refers to the ability of the SQL query optimizer to estimate the size of the results of a predicate in the query. It is the main calculation based on which the optimizer can select the least expensive plan to execute. While the problem has been known since the mid-1970s, we were surprised that there are no solutions in the literature for the selectivity estimation of inequality joins. By testing four common database systems: Oracle, SQL-Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, we found that the open-source systems PostgreSQL and MySQL lack this estimation. Oracle and SQL-Server make fairly accurate estimations, yet their algorithms are secret. This paper, thus, proposes an algorithm for inequality join selectivity estimation. The proposed algorithm was implemented in PostgreSQL and sent as a patch to be included in the next releases. We compared this implementation with the above DBMS for three different data distributions (uniform, normal, and Zipfian) and showed that our algorithm provides extremely accurate estimations (below 0.1% average error), outperforming the other systems by an order of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Performance indicators of road networks are a long\u2010lasting topic of research. Existing schemes assess network properties such as the average speed on road segments and the queuing time at intersections. The increasing availability of user trajectories, collected mainly using mobile phones with a variety of applications, creates opportunities for developing user\u2010centered performance indicators. Performing such an analysis on big trajectory data sets remains a challenge for the existing data management systems, because they lack support for spatiotemporal trajectory data. This article presents an end\u2010to\u2010end solution, based on MobilityDB, a novel moving object database system that extends PostgreSQL with spatiotemporal data types and functions. A new class of indicators is proposed, focused on the users' experience. The indicators address the network design, the traffic flow, and the driving comfort of the motorists. Furthermore, these indicators are expressed as analytical MobilityDB queries over a big set of real vehicle trajectories.",

The main challenges are to provide rich transformations and visualizations through an interactive interface, to help users in exploring, understanding and presenting their moving object data. In this demo, we present MOVE (Moving Objects Visual Exploration), an open-source tool that integrates MobilityDB, a moving object database in PostgreSQL, and QGIS to visualize moving objects. MOVE is capable of querying and displaying moving object data through a simple interface and visualizing both static and animated spatial data in QGIS. We use Danish AIS data to demonstrate the capabilities of MOVE by presenting a set of example queries and visualizations.",

            "abstract": "Detection of fishing activities in trajectory data is important for authorities to develop fishery management policies and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing at sea. However, the complex movement patterns of fishing activities challenge existing trajectory segmentation approaches, which may not identify complete fishing activities. In light of this, we propose a window-based trajectory segmentation algorithm which aims to detect fishing activities as completely as possible. Firstly, we introduce a visualization-based technique TPoSTE to help design features characterizing different movement patterns. Secondly, a window-based segmentation algorithm WBS-RLE is proposed to split a trajectory into fishing and non-fishing segments. WBS-RLE first utilizes a pre-trained classifier to label windows in a trajectory as fishing or non-fishing, then it uses the run-length encoding technique to merge those labeled windows into complete fishing activities. The effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over existing approaches are evaluated on a real-world trajectory dataset.",

The transportation sector is responsible for about a quarter of all the CO2 in most developed countries. This study uses a large set of trajectory data (272.289 trajectories, built from 75.178.775 GPS points) to analyze and quantify, on a road segment level, the impacts of driving at a steady speed on the energy consumption of electrical vehicles. The results show that drivers should strive to maintain a steady speed for as much as possible as it can reduce the consumption by up to 42% while increasing the travel time by just 10%.",
