            "abstract": "We present a novel technique for modulating the appearance frequency of a few tokens within a dataset for encoding an invisible watermark that can be used to protect ownership rights upon data. We develop optimal as well as fast heuristic algorithms for creating and verifying such watermarks. We also demonstrate the robustness of our technique against various attacks and derive analytical bounds for the false positive probability of erroneously \u201cdetecting\u201d a watermark on a dataset that does not carry it. Our technique is applicable to both single dimensional and multidimensional datasets, is independent of token type, allows for a fine control of the introduced distortion, and can be used in a variety of use cases that involve buying and selling data in contemporary data marketplaces.",

To guard against this, we develop a robust aggregation scheme based on subjective logic and residual-based attack detection. Employing a combination of theoretical analysis, trace-driven simulation, as well as experimental validation with a prototype and real users, we show that our classifier can detect sensitive content with high accuracy, learn new labels fast, and remain robust in view of poisoning attacks from malicious users, as well as imperfect input from non-malicious ones.",

            "abstract": "Anonymous social networks present a number of new and challenging problems for existing Social Network Analysis techniques. Traditionally, existing methods for analysing graph structure, such as community detection, required global knowledge of the graph structure. That implies that a centralised entity must be given access to the edge list of each node in the graph. This is impossible for anonymous social networks and other settings where privacy is valued by its participants. In addition, using their graph structure inputs for learning tasks defeats the purpose of anonymity. In this work, we hypothesise that one can re-purpose the use of the HyperANF a.k.a HyperBall algorithm -- intended for approximate diameter estimation -- to the task of privacy-preserving community detection for friend recommending systems that learn from an anonymous representation of the social network graph structure with limited privacy impact. This is possible because the core data structure maintained by HyperBall is a HyperLogLog with a counter of the number of reachable neighbours from a given node. Exchanging this data structure in future decentralised learning deployments gives away no information about the neighbours of the node and therefore does preserve the privacy of the graph structure.",

            "abstract": "As of today abuse is a pressing issue to participants and administrators of Online Social Networks (OSN). Abuse in Twitter can spawn from arguments generated for influencing outcomes of a political election, the use of bots to automatically spread misinformation, and generally speaking, activities that deny, disrupt, degrade or deceive other participants and, or the network. Given the difficulty in finding and accessing a large enough sample of abuse ground truth from the Twitter platform, we built and deployed a custom crawler that we use to judiciously collect a new dataset from the Twitter platform with the aim of characterizing the nature of abusive users, a.k.a abusive \u201cbirds\u201d, in the wild. We provide a comprehensive set of features based on users' attributes, as well as social-graph metadata. The former includes metadata about the account itself, while the latter is computed from the social graph among the sender and the receiver of each message. Attribute-based features are useful to characterize user's accounts in OSN, while graph-based features can reveal the dynamics of information dissemination across the network. In particular, we derive the Jaccard index as a key feature to reveal the benign or malicious nature of directed messages in Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such a similarity metric to characterize abuse in Twitter.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Online video piracy (OVP) is a contentious topic, with strong proponents on both sides of the argument. Recently, a number of illegal websites, called streaming cyberlockers, have begun to dominate OVP. These websites specialise in distributing pirated content, underpinned by third party indexing services offering easy-to-access directories of content. This paper performs the first exploration of this new ecosystem. It characterises the content, as well the streaming cyberlockers' individual attributes. We find a remarkably centralised system with just a few networks, countries and cyberlockers underpinning most provisioning. We also investigate the actions of copyright enforcers. We find they tend to target small subsets of the ecosystem, although they appear quite successful. 84% of copyright notices see content removed.\n \n",

These systems have been traditionally designed as centralized silos, which unfortunately suffer from abusive behavior ranging from spam, cyberbullying to even censorship. This paper investigates the utility of supervised learning techniques for abuse detection in future decentralized settings, where less metadata remains available for use in learning algorithms. We present a method that uses a privacy-preserving protocol to exchange a fingerprint of the neighborhood of a pair of nodes, namely sender and receiver. Our method extracts social graph metadata to form a subset of key features, namely neighborhood knowledge, some of which we approximate to reduce communication and computational requirements of such a protocol. In our benchmarking we show that a data minimization approach can obtain features 13% faster while providing similar or, as with the SVM classifier, even better abuse detection rates with just approximated Private Set Intersection.",

            "abstract": "Today popular centralized Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook or Twitter process massive amounts of information associated with user content in their platforms. Their approach creates several threats for the privacy of users. Firstly, user data can leak to authorized (e.g., advertising) or unauthorized third parties (external entities). Secondly, centralized OSN are prone to censorship. On the other hand, future decentralized OSN (DOSN) remove the central authority for data management and so effectively such threats. However, they require careful routing to be resilient to failures, access control and data storage at the peer level. This thesis investigates privacy-preserving protocols that aid in detecting and discouraging abusive behavior in future DOSN. In such settings, less metadata is available to participants for analysis. However, to detect abuse we may need to make use of metadata that represents neighborhood knowledge, namely a social graph or network size/structure. Thus we need to provide privacy-preserving protocols that protect such metadata and are compatible with decentralized settings. We first analyze abusive behavior in Twitter, an existing centralized, subscription based OSN platform. The data model of Twitter is a publish-subscribe messaging infrastructure that allows participants publishing and subscribing to various types of notifications (e.g., news, sports). At the individual level, we conjecture that attackers may be more likely to abuse potential victims if they can address them via the OSN interface with tools as mentions (e.g., tagging) in Twitter. To verify abuse at the individual level, we start collecting messages directed to potential victims using a data mining framework we build and that programmatically crawls Twitter APIs. We managed to retrieve in the order or hundreds of thousands of tweets and metadata of millions of social relationships from Twitter. Then, we extract a number of features, namely individual measurable properties related to the dataset. To obtain abuse ground truth, we develop a light-weight web platform that provides effective and customizable crowdsourcing of label annotation for a sample of our dataset. The sample contains messages directed towards potential victims of abuse and we ask humans to label the nature of messages following a set of abuse guidelines that provide a non-binary classification choice (undecided, abusive, acceptable). Initially, we consider the problem of abuse classification in a centralized OSN (Twitter). Next, we abstract from the Twitter model and consider DOSN where locally, users only have access to a partial view of the metadata available in the network to perform abuse detection. In turn, we analyze the impact of enforcing privacy into features involving neighborhood knowledge, which requires collection and computation of social graph metadata that is not available to the user locally. In order to use these features in DOSN, we design a signed Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol that protects participant metadata collected and computed by the PSI. In addition, we analyze the resistance of our protocol against adversaries trying to tamper with the value of the PSI features. Finally, we perform data minimization by approximating PSI features and testing supervised learning algorithms for abuse detection. Our results show that approximation of the neighborhood fingerprint that PSI features use for abuse detection is still useful and compatible with DOSN.",

            "abstract": "The total estimated energy bill for data centers in 2010 was \\$11.5 billion, and experts estimate that the energy cost of a typical data center doubles every five years. On the other hand, computational developments have started to lag behind storage advancements, therein becoming a future bottleneck for the ongoing data growth which already approaches Exascale levels. We investigate the relationship among data throughput and energy footprint on a large storage cluster, with the goal of formalizing it as a metric that reflects the trading among consistency and energy. Employing a client-centric consistency approach, and while honouring ACID properties of the chosen columnar store for the case study (Apache HBase), we present the factors involved in the energy consumption of the system as well as lessons learned to underpin further design of energy-efficient cluster scale storage systems.",
