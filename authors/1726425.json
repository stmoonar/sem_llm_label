            "title": "Mitigating Representation Bias in Data Transformations: A Constraint-based Optimization Approach",
            "abstract": "The development of discrimination-aware solutions is one of the main current research directions in the design of automated decision systems that make deep use of people-related data. Two main groups of techniques have been designed so far: the first focuses on fair machine learning, i.e., the development of algorithms that can detect and correct the bias in the context of a learning process; the second targets approaches for detecting and mitigating bias due to the under-representation of specific groups of people in the used dataset (representation bias), independently from the further analytical tasks to be executed. In both cases, bias can originate from how and where the data was originally collected or it can be introduced, sometimes amplified, during the data preparation steps preceding any analytical task. In this paper, we focus on representation bias and we present an approach for mitigating representation bias in datasets generated through data transformation, a specific data preparation phase. Differently from similar proposals, the proposed technique can mitigate bias defined in terms of multiple types of constraints, including coverage and fairness. To show the applicability of the proposed approach, we consider dropout prediction in the educational context as a case study. The preliminary reported experimental results show that the proposed technique can mitigate representation bias in an effective and efficient way.",

            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "The development of technological solutions satisfying nondiscriminatory requirements is one of the main current challenges for data processing. Back-end operators for preparing, i.e., extracting and transforming, data play a relevant role w.r.t. nondiscrimination, since they can introduce bias with an impact on the entire data life-cycle. In this article, we focus on back-end transformations, defined in terms of Select-Project-Join queries, and on coverage. Coverage aims at guaranteeing that the input, or training, dataset includes enough examples for each (protected) category of interest, thus increasing diversity with the aim of limiting the introduction of bias during the next analytical steps. The article proposes an approach to automatically rewrite a transformation with a result that violates coverage constraints, into the \u201cclosest\u201d query satisfying the constraints. The approach is approximate and relies on a sample-based cardinality estimation, thus it introduces a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The efficiency and the effectiveness of the approach are experimentally validated on synthetic and real data.",

            "abstract": "The increasing impact of data-based decisions in education has risen concerns about the potential risk of an amplification of educational and societal inequities already implicit in existing data. Nondiscrimination can be characterized in terms of different properties (i.e., fairness, diversity, and coverage). Research mostly focused on fair machine learning, i.e., on the development of algorithms that can detect and, in some cases, correct bias. In this paper, we consider the case of dropout prediction and focus on coverage constraints. Specifically, with reference to this case study, we show why approaches are needed for guaranteeing nondiscrimination during all the steps of the data processing pipeline and discuss how a nondiscriminating pre-processing can be ensured by relying on coverage-based constraints on data transformations.",

Thus, the development of technological solutions satisfying nondiscrimination requirements, in terms of, e.g., fairness, diversity, and coverage, is currently one of the main challenges for the data management and data analytics communities. In particular, coverage constraints guarantee that a dataset includes enough items for each (protected) category of interest, thus increasing diversity with the aim of limiting the introduction of bias during the next analytical steps. While coverage constraints have been mainly used for designing data repair solutions, in our study we investigate their effects on data processing pipelines, with a special reference to data transformation. To this aim, we first introduce coverage-based queries as a means for ensuring coverage constraint satisfaction on a selection-based query result, through rewriting. We then present two approximate algorithms for coverage-based query processing: the first, covRew , initially introduced in [3], relies on data discretization and sampling; the second, covKnn is a novel contribution and relies on a nearest neighbour approach for coverage-based query processing. The algorithms are experimentally compared with respect to efficiency and effectiveness, on a real dataset.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many solutions for coarse geolocating of users at the time they post a message exist. However, for many important applications, like traffic monitoring and event detection, finer geolocation at the level of city neighborhoods, i.e., at a sub-city level, is needed. Data-driven approaches often do not guarantee good accuracy and efficiency due to the higher number of sub-city level positions to be estimated and the low availability of balanced and large training sets. We claim that external information sources overcome limitations of data-driven approaches in achieving good accuracy for sub-city level geolocation and we present a knowledge-driven approach achieving good results once the reference area of a message is known. Our algorithm, called Sherloc, exploits toponyms in the message, extracts their semantic from a geographic gazetteer, and embeds them into a metric space that captures the semantic distance among them. We identify the semantically closest toponyms to a message and then cluster them with respect to their spatial locations. Sherloc requires no prior training, it can infer the location at sub-city level with high accuracy, and it is not limited to geolocating on a fixed spatial grid.",

            "abstract": "Due to the impact of analytical processes on our life, an increasing effort is being devoted to the design of technological solutions that help humans in measuring the bias introduced by such processes and understanding its causes. Existing solutions can refer to either back-end or front-end stages of the data processing pipeline and usually represent bias in terms of some given diversity or fairness constraint. In our previous work [1], we proposed an approach for rewriting filtering and merge operations in pre-processing pipelines into the \u201cclosest\u201d operations so that protected groups are adequately represented (i.e., covered ) in the result. This is relevant because any under-represented category in an initial or intermediate dataset might lead to an under-representation of that category in any subsequent analytical process. Since many potential rewritings exist, the proposed approach is approximate and relies on a sample-based cardinality estimation, thus introducing a trade-off between the accuracy and the efficiency of the process. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off by first presenting various measures quantifying the error introduced by the rewriting, due to the applied approximation and the selected sample. Then, we (preliminarly) experimentally evaluate such measures on a real-world dataset.",
