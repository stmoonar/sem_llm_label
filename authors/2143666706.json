            "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have advanced rapidly in recent years, leading to significant progress in pre-trained and fine-tuned large-scale AI models. For example, in the natural language processing domain, the traditional \"pre-train, fine-tune\" paradigm is shifting towards the \"pre-train, prompt, and predict\" paradigm, which has achieved great success on many tasks across different application domains such as ChatGPT/BARD for Conversational AI and P5 for a unified recommendation system. Moreover, there has been a growing interest in models that combine vision and language modalities (vision-language models) which are applied to tasks like Visual Captioning/Generation. Considering the recent technological revolution, it is essential to emphasize these paradigm shifts and highlight the paradigms with the potential to solve different tasks. We thus provide a platform for academic and industrial researchers to showcase their latest work, share research ideas, discuss various challenges, and identify areas where further research is needed in pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompt-learning methods for large-scale AI models. We foster the development of a strong research community focused on solving challenges related to large-scale AI models, providing superior and impactful strategies that can change people's lives in the future.",

            "abstract": "In the current digital world, web search engines and recommendation systems are continuously evolving, opening up new potential challenges every day which require more sophisticated and efficient data mining and machine learning solutions to satisfy the needs of sellers and consumers as well as marketers. The quality of search and recommendation systems impacts customer retention, time on site, and sales volume. For instance, with often sparse conversion rates, highly personalized contents, heterogeneous digital sources, more rigorous and effective models are required to be developed by research engineers and data scientists. At the same time, deep learning has started to show great impact in many industrial applications which are capable of processing complicated, large-scale and real-time data. Deep learning not only provides more opportunities to increase conversion rates and improve revenue through a positive customer experience, but also provides customers with personalized contents along with their personal shopping journey. Due to this rapid growth of the digital world, there is a need to bring professionals together from both academic research and the industry to solve real-world problems. This workshop fosters the development of a strong research community focused on solving deep learning based large-scale web search, personalized search, recommendation and ranking relevance problems that provide superior digital experience to all users.",

            "abstract": "Building recommendation systems for enterprise software has many unique challenges that are different from consumer-facing systems. When applied to different organizations, the data used to power those recommendation systems vary substantially in both quality and quantity due to differences in their operational practices, marketing strategies, and targeted audiences. At Salesforce, as a cloud provider of such a system with data across many different organizations, naturally, it makes sense to pool data from different organizations to build a model that combines all values from different brands. However, multiple issues like how do we make sure a model trained with pooled data can still capture customer specific characteristics, how do we design the system to handle those data responsibly and ethically, i.e., respecting contractual agreements with our clients, legal and compliance requirements, and the privacy of all the consumers. In this proposal, We present a framework that not only utilizes enriched user-level data across organizations, but also boosts business-specific characteristics in generating personal recommendations. We will also walk through key privacy considerations when designing such a system.",

            "title": "Incorporating intent propensities in personalized next best action recommendation",
            "abstract": "Next best action (NBA) is a technique that is widely considered as the best practice in modern personalized marketing. It takes users' unique characteristics into consideration and recommends next actions that help users progress towards business goals as quickly and smoothly as possible. Many NBA engines are built with rules handcrafted by marketers based on experience or gut feelings. It is not effective. In this proposal, we show our machine learning based approach for such a real-time recommendation engine, detail our design choices, and discuss evaluation techniques. In practice, there are several key challenges to consider. (a) It needs to be able to deal with historical feedback that is typically incomplete and skewed towards a small set of actions; (b) Actions are typically dynamic. They can be added or removed anytime due to seasonal changes or shifts in business strategies; (c) The optimization objective is typically complex. It usually consists of reaching a set of target events or moving users to more preferred stages. The engine needs to account for all these aspects. Standard classification or regression models are not suitable to use, because only bandit feedback is available and sampling bias presented in historical data can not be handled properly. Conventional multi-armed bandit model can address some of the challenges. But it lacks the ability to model multiple objectives. We present a propensity variant hybrid contextual multi-armed bandit model (PV-MAB) that can address all three challenges. PV-MAB consists of two components: an intent propensity model (I-Prop) and a hybrid contextual MAB (H-Bandit). H-Bandit can be considered as a multi-policy contextual MAB, where we model different aspects of user engagement separately and cater the policies to each unique characteristic. I-Prop leverages user intent signals to target different users toward specific goals that are most relevant to them. It acts as a policy selector, to inform H-Bandit to choose the best strategy for different users at different points in the journey. I-Prop is trained separately with features extracted from user profile affinities and past behaviors. To illustrate this design, we will focus our discussion on how to incorporate two common distinct objectives in H-bandit. The first one is to target and drive users to reach a small set of high-value goals (e.g. purchase, become superfan), called goal-oriented policy. The second is to promote progression into more advanced stages in a consumer journey (e.g. from login to complete profile). We call it stage-advancement policy. In the goal-oriented policy, we reward reaching the goals accordingly, and use classification predictor as kernel function to predict the probabilities for achieving those goals. In the stage-advancement policy, we use the progression of stages as reward. Customers can move forward in their journey, skip a few stages or go back to previous stages doing more research or re-evaluation. The reward strategy is designed in the way that we reward higher for bigger positive stage progression and not reward zero or negative stage progression. Both policies incorporate Thompson Sampling with Gaussian kernel for better exploration. One big difference between our hybrid model and regular contextual bandit model, is that besides context information, we also mix user profile affinities in the model. It tells us the user intent and interest, and how their typical journey path looks like. With these special features, our model is able to recommend different actions for users that shows different interests (i.e. football ticket purchase v.s. jersey purchase). Similarly, for fast shoppers who usually skip a few stages, our model recommends actions that quickly triggers goal achievement; while for research type of users, the model offers actions that move them gradually towards next stages. This hybrid strategy provides us with better understanding of user intent and behaviors, so as to make more personalized recommendations. We designed a time-sensitive rolling evaluation mechanism for offline evaluation of the system with various hyperparameters that simulate behaviors in practice. Despite the lack of online evaluation, our strategy allows researchers and prospects to gain confidence through bounded expected performance. Evaluated on real-world data, we observed about 120% of reward gain, with an overall confidence of around 0.95. A big portion of the improvement is contributed by the goal-oriented policy. It well demonstrated the discovery functionality of the intent propensity model.",
