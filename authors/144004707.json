            "abstract": "We address multi-agent best arm identification with privacy guarantees. In this setting, agents collaborate by communicating to find the optimal arm. To avoid leaking sensitive data through messages, we consider two notions of privacy withholding different kinds of information: differential privacy and ( \u03f5, \u03b7 ) -privacy. For each privacy definition, we propose an algorithm based on a two-level successive elimination scheme. We provide theoretical guarantees for the privacy level, accuracy and sample complexity of our algorithms. Experiments on various settings support our theoretical findings.",

            "title": "Secure Protocols for Best Arm Identification in Federated Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits",
            "abstract": "The stochastic multi-armed bandit is a classical reinforcement learning model, where a learning agent sequentially chooses an action (pull a bandit arm) and the environment responds with a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown distribution associated with the chosen action. A popular objective for the agent is to identify the arm having the maximum expected reward, also known as the best arm identification problem. We address the security concerns that occur in a cross-silo federated learning setting, where multiple data owners collaborate under the orchestration of a server to execute a best arm identification algorithm. We propose three secure protocols, which guarantee desirable security properties for the: input data (i.e., reward values), intermediate data (i.e., sums of rewards), and output data (i.e., ranking of arms and in particular the identified best arm). More precisely: (1) no data owner can learn the identified best arm; moreover, no data owner can learn local data pertaining to another data owner; (2) the orchestration participants cannot learn the identified best arm, any reward value, or any sum of rewards; (3) by analyzing the messages exchanged over the network, an external observer cannot learn the identified best arm, or any reward value, or any sum of rewards. Each protocol has a different architecture, uses different techniques, and proposes a different trade-off with respect to several criteria that we thoroughly analyze: number of participants, generality of the supported reward functions, cryptographic overhead, and communication cost. To build our protocols, we rely on secure multi-party computation, AES-CBC, and the additive homomorphic property of Paillier.",

We show that LinUCB, a well-known cumulative reward maximization algorithm for linear bandits, can be implemented in off-the-shelf SQLite. Additionally, our empirical study shows that, when dealing with small bandit data, our SQLite implementation is faster than an implementation in off-the-shelf Python. We believe that our findings open the door for many promising research directions on the topic of in-DBMS federated learning because (i) in the federated learning paradigm, many data owners contribute to the same learning task while locally storing their small data, and (ii) SQLite is a DBMS embedded in billions of devices, hence being able to implement federated learning on top of SQLite is of great practical interest.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning enables clients to enrich their locally trained models via updates performed by a coordination server based on aggregates of local models. There are multiple advances in methods and applications of federated learning, in particular in cross-device federation, where clients having limited data and computational resources collaborate in a joint learning problem. Given the constraint of limited resources in cross-device federation, we study the potential benefits of embedded in-DBMS learning, illustrated in a federated reinforcement learning problem. We demonstrate FeReD, a system that contrasts the performance of cross-device federation using Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm. FeReD offers step-by-step guidance for in-DBMS SQLite implementation challenges for both horizontal and vertical data partitioning. FeReD also allows to contrast the Q-learning implementations in SQLite vs a standard Python implementation, by highlighting their learning performance, computational efficiency, succinctness and expressiveness. A video of FeReD is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kRIu_C5RZA and its open source code at https://github.com/sotostzam/FeReD.",

We demonstrate DashBot, a system that leverages Machine Learning to guide users in generating data-driven and customized dashboards. A dashboard contains a set of panels, each of which is a groupby query. DashBot iteratively recommends the most relevant panel while ensuring coverage. Relevance is computed based on intrinsic measures of the dataset and coverage aims to provide comprehensive summaries. DashBot relies on a Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) approach to balance exploitation of relevance and exploration of different regions of the data to achieve coverage. Users can provide feedback and explanations to customize recommended panels. We demonstrate the utility and features of DashBot on different datasets.",

            "abstract": "Motivation Precision medicine requires the ability to predict the efficacies of different treatments for a given individual using high\u2010dimensional genomic measurements. However, identifying predictive features remains a challenge when the sample size is small. Incorporating expert knowledge offers a promising approach to improve predictions, but collecting such knowledge is laborious if the number of candidate features is very large. Results We introduce a probabilistic framework to incorporate expert feedback about the impact of genomic measurements on the outcome of interest and present a novel approach to collect the feedback efficiently, based on Bayesian experimental design. The new approach outperformed other recent alternatives in two medical applications: prediction of metabolic traits and prediction of sensitivity of cancer cells to different drugs, both using genomic features as predictors. Furthermore, the intelligent approach to collect feedback reduced the workload of the expert to approximately 11%, compared to a baseline approach.

This setup occurs in personalized medicine, for instance, when predicting treatment outcomes for an individual patient based on noisy high-dimensional genomics data. A remaining source of information is expert knowledge, which has received relatively little attention in recent years. We formulate the inference problem of asking expert feedback on features on a budget, propose an elicitation strategy for a simple \"small n\" setting, and derive conditions under which the elicitation strategy is optimal. Experiments on simulated experts, both on synthetic and genomics data, demonstrate that the proposed strategy can drastically improve prediction accuracy.",

Prior knowledge can improve machine learning models by indicating relevant variables and parameter values. Yet, this prior knowledge is often tacit and only available from domain experts. We present a novel approach that uses interactive visualization to elicit the tacit prior knowledge and uses it to improve the accuracy of prediction models. The main component of our approach is a user model that models the domain expert's knowledge of the relevance of different features for a prediction task. In particular, based on the expert's earlier input, the user model guides the selection of the features on which to elicit user's knowledge next. The results of a controlled user study show that the user model significantly improves prior knowledge elicitation and prediction accuracy, when predicting the relative citation counts of scientific documents in a specific domain.",

            "abstract": "This thesis is dedicated to the study of resource allocation problems in uncertain environments, where an agent can sequentially select which action to take. After each step, the environment returns a noisy observation of the value of the selected action. These observations guide the agent in adapting his resource allocation strategy towards reaching a given objective. In the most typical setting of this kind, the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB), it is assumed that each observation is drawn from an unknown probability distribution associated with the selected action and gives no information on the expected value of the other actions. The MAB setting has been widely studied and optimal allocation strategies were proposed to solve various objectives under the MAB assumptions. Here, we consider a variant of the MAB setting where there exists a global linear structure in the environment and by selecting an action, the agent also gathers information on the value of the other actions. Therefore, the agent needs to adapt his resource allocation strategy to exploit the structure in the environment. In particular, we study the design of sequences of actions that the agent should take to reach objectives such as: (i) identifying the best value with a fixed confidence and using a minimum number of pulls, or (ii) minimizing the prediction error on the value of each action. In addition, we investigate how the knowledge gathered by a bandit algorithm in a given environment can be transferred to improve the performance in other similar environments.",
