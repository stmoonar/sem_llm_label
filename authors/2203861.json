            "abstract": "The AudioCHI 2022 workshop focusses on human engagement with spoken material in search settings, including live stream audio and collections. Spoken material comes in many forms, including for example: factual or entertaining (or both!), timely or of historical interest, local or global, single speaker or conversations. Users engage with spoken material for a variety of reasons, including entertainment, current affairs, education, and research. While there has been considerable previous work studying spoken document retrieval or more generally spoken content retrieval, AudioCHI 2022 is the first meeting to explore user engagement with audio content, including discussing: (i) how content analysis might establish verbal and non-verbal features for rich content representations, and (ii) and use cases and human factors in interaction with spoken audio content, and their interaction with more established topics relating to spoken content retrieval. The workshop brings together researchers in spoken content retrieval with expertise on human computer interaction in information access to examine opportunities and challenges for advancing technologies for search and interaction with spoken content.",

The workshop was organised to bring together researchers in spoken content retrieval with expertise on human computer interaction in information access to examine opportunities and challenges for advancing technologies for search and interaction with spoken content. The workshop was originally planned to be a full day event, but due to pandemic-imposed travelling constraints, it was instead held as a virtual half day event to accommodate time zone differences for participants.

            "abstract": "The Podcast Track is new at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) in 2020. The podcast track was designed to encourage research into podcasts in the information retrieval and NLP research communities. The track consisted of two shared tasks: segment retrieval and summarization, both based on a dataset of over 100,000 podcast episodes (metadata, audio, and automatic transcripts) which was released concurrently with the track. The track generated considerable interest, attracted hundreds of new registrations to TREC and fifteen teams, mostly disjoint between search and summarization, made final submissions for assessment. Deep learning was the dominant experimental approach for both search experiments and summarization. This paper gives an overview of the tasks and the results of the participants' experiments. The track will return to TREC 2021 with the same two tasks, incorporating slight modifications in response to participant feedback.",

            "abstract": "Rapidly growing online podcast archives contain diverse content on a wide range of topics. These archives form an important resource for entertainment and professional use, but their value can only be realized if users can rapidly and reliably locate content of interest. Search for relevant content can be based on metadata provided by content creators, but also on transcripts of the spoken content itself. Excavating relevant content from deep within these audio streams for diverse types of information needs requires varying the approach to systems prototyping. We describe a set of diverse podcast information needs and different approaches to assessing retrieved content for relevance. We use these information needs in an investigation of the utility and effectiveness of these information sources. Based on our analysis, we recommend approaches for indexing and retrieving podcast content for ad hoc search.",

            "abstract": "CLARIN is a European Research Infrastructure providing access to digital language resources and tools from across Europe and beyond to researchers in the humanities and social sciences. This paper focuses on CLARIN as a platform for the sharing of language resources. It zooms in on the service offer for the aggregation of language repositories and the value proposition for a number of communities that benefit from the enhanced visibility of their data and services as a result of integration in CLARIN. The enhanced findability of language resources is serving the social sciences and humanities (SSH) community at large and supports research communities that aim to collaborate based on virtual collections for a specific domain. The paper also addresses the wider landscape of service platforms based on language technologies which has the potential of becoming a powerful set of interoperable facilities to a variety of communities of use.",

We will highlight how the SSH Open Science infrastructures contribute to the goal of establishing the EOSC. First, through the example of OPERAS, the European Research Infrastructure for Open Scholarly Communication in the SSH, to see how its services are conceived to be part of the EOSC and to address the communities\u2019 needs. The next two sections highlight collaboration practices between partners in Europe to build the SSH component of the EOSC and a SSH discovery platform, as a service of OPERAS and the EOSC. The last two sections will focus on an implementation network dedicated to SSH data fairification.",
