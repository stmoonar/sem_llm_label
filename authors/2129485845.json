            "title": "Physics-guided Active Sample Reweighting for Urban Flow Prediction",
            "abstract": "Urban flow prediction is a spatio-temporal modeling task that estimates the throughput of transportation services like buses, taxis, and ride-sharing, where data-driven models have become the most popular solution in the past decade. Meanwhile, the implicitly learned mapping between historical observations to the prediction targets tend to over-simplify the dynamics of real-world urban flows, leading to suboptimal predictions. Some recent spatio-temporal prediction solutions bring remedies with the notion of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which describes spatio-temporal data with nuanced and principled physics laws, thus enhancing both the prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, these spatio-temporal PGML methods are built upon a strong assumption that the observed data fully conforms to the differential equations that define the physical system, which can quickly become ill-posed in urban flow prediction tasks. The observed urban flow data, especially when sliced into time-dependent snapshots to facilitate predictions, is typically incomplete and sparse, and prone to inherent noise incurred in the collection process. As a result, such physical inconsistency between the data and PGML model significantly limits the predictive power and robustness of the solution. Moreover, due to the interval-based predictions and intermittent nature of data filing in many transportation services, the instantaneous dynamics of urban flows can hardly be captured, rendering differential equation-based continuous modeling a loose fit for this setting. To overcome the challenges, we develop a discretized physics-guided network (PN), and propose a data-aware framework Physics-guided Active Sample Reweighting (P-GASR) to enhance PN. Experimental results in four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a demonstrable improvement in robustness.",

            "title": "A Thorough Performance Benchmarking on Lightweight Embedding-based Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Since the creation of the Web, recommender systems (RSs) have been an indispensable mechanism in information filtering. State-of-the-art RSs primarily depend on categorical features, which ecoded by embedding vectors, resulting in excessively large embedding tables. To prevent over-parameterized embedding tables from harming scalability, both academia and industry have seen increasing efforts in compressing RS embeddings. However, despite the prosperity of lightweight embedding-based RSs (LERSs), a wide diversity is seen in evaluation protocols, resulting in obstacles when relating LERS performance to real-world usability. Moreover, despite the common goal of lightweight embeddings, LERSs are evaluated with a single choice between the two main recommendation tasks -- collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This lack of discussions on cross-task transferability hinders the development of unified, more scalable solutions. Motivated by these issues, this study investigates various LERSs' performance, efficiency, and cross-task transferability via a thorough benchmarking process. Additionally, we propose an efficient embedding compression method using magnitude pruning, which is an easy-to-deploy yet highly competitive baseline that outperforms various complex LERSs. Our study reveals the distinct performance of LERSs across the two tasks, shedding light on their effectiveness and generalizability. To support edge-based recommendations, we tested all LERSs on a Raspberry Pi 4, where the efficiency bottleneck is exposed. Finally, we conclude this paper with critical summaries of LERS performance, model selection suggestions, and underexplored challenges around LERSs for future research.

            "title": "Explicit Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Conversational Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems estimate user preference on items purely based on historical interaction records, thus failing to capture fine-grained yet dynamic user interests and letting users receive recommendation only passively. Recent conversational recommender systems (CRSs) tackle those limitations by enabling recommender systems to interact with the user to obtain her/his current preference through a sequence of clarifying questions. Recently, there has been a rise of using knowledge graphs (KGs) for CRSs, where the core motivation is to incorporate the abundant side information carried by a KG into both the recommendation and conversation processes. However, existing KG-based CRSs are subject to two defects: (1) there is a semantic gap between the learned representations of utterances and KG entities, hindering the retrieval of relevant KG information; (2) the reasoning over KG is mostly performed with the implicitly learned user interests, overlooking the explicit signals from the entities actually mentioned in the conversation. To address these drawbacks, we propose a new CRS framework, namely the Knowledge Enhanced Conversational Reasoning (KECR) model. As a user can reflect her/his preferences via both attribute- and item-level expressions, KECR jointly embeds the structured knowledge from two levels in the KG. A mutual information maximization constraint is further proposed for semantic alignment between the embedding spaces of utterances and KG entities. Meanwhile, KECR utilizes the connectivity within the KG to conduct explicit reasoning of the user demand, making the model less dependent on the user\u2019s feedback to clarifying questions. As such, the semantic alignment and explicit KG reasoning can jointly facilitate accurate recommendation and quality dialogue generation. By comparing with strong baselines on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KECR obtains state-of-the-art recommendation effectiveness, as well as competitive dialogue generation performance.",

            "title": "Semi-decentralized Federated Ego Graph Learning for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems are typically trained based on personal interaction data (e.g., clicks and purchases) that could be naturally represented as ego graphs. However, most existing recommendation methods collect these ego graphs from all users to compose a global graph to obtain high-order collaborative information between users and items, and these centralized CF recommendation methods inevitably lead to a high risk of user privacy leakage. Although recently proposed federated recommendation systems can mitigate the privacy problem, they either restrict the on-device local training to an isolated ego graph or rely on an additional third-party server to access other ego graphs resulting in a cumbersome pipeline, which is hard to work in practice. In addition, existing federated recommendation systems require resource-limited devices to maintain the entire embedding tables resulting in high communication costs. In light of this, we propose a semi-decentralized federated ego graph learning framework for on-device recommendations, named SemiDFEGL, which introduces new device-to-device collaborations to improve scalability and reduce communication costs and innovatively utilizes predicted interacted item nodes to connect isolated ego graphs to augment local subgraphs such that the high-order user-item collaborative information could be used in a privacy-preserving manner. Furthermore, the proposed framework is model-agnostic, meaning that it could be seamlessly integrated with existing graph neural network-based recommendation methods and privacy protection techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed SemiDFEGL, extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemiDFEGL compared to other federated recommendation methods.",

            "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the performance of node representation learning on graphs. However, the majority class of early GNNs are only designed for homogeneous graphs, leading to inferior adaptivity to the more complex nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs. Also, few heterogeneous GNNs can bypass the transductive learning scheme where all nodes must be known during training, highlighting the need for inductiveness. Furthermore, the training efficiency of most heterogeneous GNNs has been hindered by their sophisticated designs for extracting the semantics associated with each meta path or relation type. In this paper, we propose wide and deep message passing network (WIDEN) to cope with the aforementioned problems about heterogeneity, inductiveness, and efficiency that are rarely investigated together in graph representation learning. We propose a novel inductive, meta path-free message passing scheme that packs up heterogeneous node features with their associated edges from both low- and high-order neighbor nodes. Meanwhile, we present an innovative downsampling strategy to facilitate faster information propagation. Experiments on real-world heterogeneous graphs have further validated the performance of WIDEN from both effectiveness and efficiency perspectives.",

Self-supervised learning (SSL), as an emerging technique for learning from unlabeled data, has attracted considerable attention as a potential solution to this issue. This survey paper presents a systematic and timely review of research efforts on self-supervised recommendation (SSR). Specifically, we propose an exclusive definition of SSR, on top of which we develop a comprehensive taxonomy to divide existing SSR methods into four categories: contrastive, generative, predictive, and hybrid. For each category, we elucidate its concept and formulation, the involved methods, as well as its pros and cons. Furthermore, to facilitate empirical comparison, we release an open-source library SELFRec (https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec), which incorporates a wide range of SSR models and benchmark datasets. Through rigorous experiments using this library, we derive and report some significant findings regarding the selection of self-supervised signals for enhancing recommendation. Finally, we shed light on the limitations in the current research and outline the future research directions.",

            "title": "Beyond Double Ascent via Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel in Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Overfitting has long been considered a common issue to large neural network models in sequential recommendation. In our study, an interesting phenomenon is observed that overfitting is temporary. When the model scale is increased, the trend of the performance firstly ascends, then descends (i.e., overfitting) and finally ascends again, which is named as double ascent in this paper. We therefore raise an assumption that a considerably larger model will generalise better with a higher performance. In an extreme case to infinite-width, performance is expected to reach the limit of this specific structure. Unfortunately, it is impractical to directly build a huge model due to the limit of resources. In this paper, we propose the Overparameterised Recommender (OverRec), which utilises a recurrent neural tangent kernel (RNTK) as a similarity measurement for user sequences to successfully bypass the restriction of hardware for huge models. We further prove that the RNTK for the tied input-output embeddings in recommendation is the same as the RNTK for general untied input-output embeddings, which makes RNTK theoretically suitable for recommendation. Since the RNTK is analytically derived, OverRec does not require any training, avoiding physically building the huge model. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets, which verifies the state-of-the-art performance of OverRec.1",

Recent POI recommenders mainly employ self-attention mechanism or graph neural networks to model complex high-order POI-wise interactions. However, most of them are merely trained on the historical check-in data in a standard supervised learning manner, which fail to fully explore each user's multi-faceted preferences, and suffer from data scarcity and long-tailed POI distribution, resulting in sub-optimal performance.

In particular, we devise a novel Graph-enhanced Self-attentive layer to incorporate the collaborative signals from both global transition graph and local trajectory graphs to uncover the transitional dependencies among POIs and capture a user's temporal interests. In order to counteract the scarcity and incompleteness of POI check-ins, we propose a novel self-supervised learning paradigm in \\ssgrec, where the trajectory representations are contrastively learned from two augmented views on geolocations and temporal transitions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world LBSN datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Deep cross-modal retrieval techniques have recently achieved remarkable performance, which also poses severe threats to data privacy potentially. Nowadays, enormous user-generated contents that convey personal information are released and shared on the Internet. One may abuse a retrieval system to pinpoint sensitive information of a particular Internet user, causing privacy leakage. In this article, we propose a data-centric Proactive Privacy-preserving Cross-modal Learning algorithm that fulfills the protection purpose by employing a generator to transform original data into adversarial data with quasi-imperceptible perturbations before releasing them. When the data source is infiltrated, the inside adversarial data can confuse retrieval models under the attacker\u2019s control to make erroneous predictions. We consider the protection under a realistic and challenging setting where the prior knowledge of malicious models is agnostic. To handle this, a surrogate retrieval model is instead introduced, acting as the target to fool. The whole network is trained under a game-theoretical framework, where the generator and the retrieval model persistently evolve to fight against each other. To facilitate the optimization, a Gradient Reversal Layer module is inserted between two models, enabling a one-step learning fashion. Extensive experiments on widely used realistic datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "title": "DeHIN: A Decentralized Framework for Embedding Large-Scale Heterogeneous Information Networks",
            "abstract": "Modeling heterogeneity by extraction and exploitation of high-order information from heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has been attracting immense research attention in recent times. Such heterogeneous network embedding (HNE) methods effectively harness the heterogeneity of small-scale HINs. However, in the real world, the size of HINs grow exponentially with the continuous introduction of new nodes and different types of links, making it a billion-scale network. Learning node embeddings on such HINs creates a performance bottleneck for existing HNE methods that are commonly centralized, i.e., complete data and the model are both on a single machine. To address large-scale HNE tasks with strong efficiency and effectiveness guarantee, we present Decentralized Embedding Framework for Heterogeneous Information Network (DeHIN) in this paper. In DeHIN, we generate a distributed parallel pipeline that utilizes hypergraphs in order to infuse parallelization into the HNE task. DeHIN presents a context preserving partition mechanism that innovatively formulates a large HIN as a hypergraph, whose hyperedges connect semantically similar nodes. Our framework then adopts a decentralized strategy to efficiently partition HINs by adopting a tree-like pipeline. Then, each resulting subnetwork is assigned to a distributed worker, which employs the deep information maximization theorem to locally learn node embeddings from the partition it receives. We further devise a novel embedding alignment scheme to precisely project independently learned node embeddings from all subnetworks onto a common vector space, thus allowing for downstream tasks like link prediction and node classification. As shown from our experimental results, DeHIN significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of existing HNE models as well as outperforms the large-scale graph embedding frameworks by efficiently scaling up to large-scale HINs.",
