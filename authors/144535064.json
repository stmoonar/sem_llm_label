            "title": "Flow Scheduling in Data Center Networks with Time and Energy Constraints: A Software-Defined Network Approach",
            "abstract": "Flow scheduling in Data Center Networks (DCN) is a hot topic as cloud computing and virtualization are becoming the dominant paradigm in the increasing demand of digital services. Within the cost of the DCN, the energy demands associated with the network infrastructure represent an important portion. When flows have temporal restrictions, the scheduling with path selection to reduce the number of active switching devices is a NP-hard problem as proven in the literature. In this paper, an heuristic approach to schedule real-time flows in data-centers is proposed, optimizing the temporal requirements while reducing the energy consumption in the network infrastructure via a proper selection of the paths. The experiments show good performance of the solutions found in relation to exact solution approximations based on an integer linear programming model. The possibility of programming the network switches allows the dynamic schedule of paths of flows under the software-defined network management.",

            "title": "A metaheuristic for crew scheduling in a pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows",
            "abstract": "A vehicle routing and crew scheduling problem (VRCSP) consists of simultaneously planning the routes of a fleet of vehicles and scheduling the crews, where the vehicle-crew correspondence is not fixed through time. This allows a greater planning flexibility and a more efficient use of the fleet, but in counterpart, a high synchronisation is demanded. In this work, we present a VRCSP where pickup-and-delivery requests with time windows have to be fulfilled over a given planning horizon by using trucks and drivers. Crews can be composed of 1 or 2 drivers and any of them can be relieved in a given set of locations. Moreover, they are allowed to travel among locations with non-company shuttles, at an additional cost that is minimised. As our problem considers distinct routes for trucks and drivers, we have an additional flexibility not contemplated in other previous VRCSP given in the literature where a crew is handled as an indivisible unit. We tackle this problem with a two-stage sequential approach: a set of truck routes is computed in the first stage and a set of driver routes consistent with the truck routes is obtained in the second one. We design and evaluate the performance of a metaheuristic based algorithm for the latter stage. Our algorithm is mainly a GRASP with a perturbation procedure that allows reusing solutions already found in case the search for new solutions becomes difficult. This procedure together with other to repair infeasible solutions allow us to find high-quality solutions on instances of 100 requests spread across 15 cities with a fleet of 12-32 trucks (depending on the planning horizon) in less than an hour. We also conclude that the possibility of carrying an additional driver leads to a decrease of the cost of external shuttles by about 60% on average with respect to individual crews and, in some cases, to remove this cost completely.",

            "abstract": "Internet users constantly make searches to find objects or results of their interest, generally through terms or phrases. Traditional search offers only solutions that take into account just the individual characteristics of the results, and not the relations they have with the rest of the universe. Typically, we are given an ordered list of the results related to the search criterion, which implies the need of changing several times the terms of the query to get to a solution that is more adequate to the intended search goal. As a solution to this problem, Composite Retrieval proposes that the results to a query may be grouped in sets of items (bundles), related through some similarity criterion, but at the same time are complementary. In this work we propose heuristic algorithms for Composite Retrieval which are evaluated experimentally, showing performance improvements over the previous results presented in the literature.",

            "abstract": "There has been a great effort to provide high quality at the conference: all papers were subjected to a rigorous review process, involving at least three independent reviews for each article, which allowed choosing a little over 100 articles to be presented at the conference, with an acceptance rate of around 30 percent. In addition, as it is the case in the recent editions of the conference, selected papers were selected to be published in different journal venues, such as the Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS) and the CLEI Electronic Journal. In particular, the best papers presented in CLEI 2014 were invited to submit an extended version for consideration in this special issue of CLEI Electronic Journal. These new, extended paper versions were subject to an additional refereeing process, and nine of them were selected, which are now published in this special issue. A short description of the selected articles is presented below. The first paper is \" Capataz: a framework for distributing algorithms via the World Wide Web \" , by Mart\u00ednez and Val. It studies the usability property in Capataz and proposes an improvement based on bundling jobs together if they are too simple. The second paper is titled \" Applying Information Retrieval Techniques to Detect Duplicates and to Rank References in the Preliminary Phase of Systematic Literature Reviews \" , It proposes strategies based on Information Retrieval techniques to detect non-papers and duplicated references in results exported by search engines, and to rank the references in decreasing order of importance according to the terms in the search string. The third paper is \" Towards an automatic model transformation mechanism from UML state machines to DEVS models \" , It presents a knowledge-based environment , called SPEAKER, which supports software organizations during the execution of process performance analysis, and presents an example to show how SPEAKER can guide the organization through a specific performance analysis activity. The fifth paper is titled \" Towards a Requirements Specification Multi-View Framework for Self-Adaptive Systems \" , by Mu\u00f1oz, Tamura, Mazo and Salinesi. It proposes the REFAS framework to model the requirements of self-adaptive software systems. REFAS reduces uncertainty and provides a language to specify the different aspects of self-adaptive systems for functional and non-functional requirements; it supports several viewpoints related to requirements modeling, and promotes in-depth analysis of all the aspects to be modeled concerns with aggregation and association \u2026",

            "abstract": "Users are often faced with the problem of finding complementary items that together achieve a single common goal (e.g., a starter kit for a novice astronomer, a collection of question/answers related to low-carb nutrition, a set of places to visit on holidays). In this paper, we argue that for some application scenarios returning item bundles is more appropriate than ranked lists. Thus we define composite retrieval as the problem of finding k bundles of complementary items. Beyond complementarity of items, the bundles must be valid w.r.t. a given budget, and the answer set of k bundles must exhibit diversity. We formally define the problem and show that in its general form is NP-hard and that also the special cases in which each bundle is formed by only one item, or only one bundle is sought, are hard. Our characterization however suggests how to adopt a two-phase approach (Produce-and-Choose, or PAC) in which we first produce many valid bundles, and then we choose k among them. For the first phase we devise two ad-hoc clustering algorithms, while for the second phase we adapt heuristics with approximation guarantees for a related problem. We also devise another approach which is based on first finding a k-clustering and then selecting a valid bundle from each of the produced clusters (Cluster-and-Pick, or CAP). We compare experimentally the proposed methods on two real-world data sets: the first data set is given by a sample of touristic attractions in 10 large European cities, while the second is a large database of user-generated restaurant reviews from Yahoo! Local. Our experiments show that when diversity is highly important, CAP is the best option, while when diversity is less important, a PAC approach constructing bundles around randomly chosen pivots, is better.",

            "abstract": "Online search has become a daily activity and a source of a variety of valuable information, from the finest granularity such as finding the address of a specific restaurant, to more complex tasks like looking for accessories compatible with an iPhone or planning a trip. The latter typically involves running multiple search queries to gather information about different places, reading online reviews to find out about hotels, and checking geographic proximity of places to visit. We refer to this information seeking activity as composite retrieval and propose to organize results into item bundles that together constitute an improved exploratory experience over ranked lists. As a first step towards composite retrieval definition, we need to formalize intuitive desirable properties of item bundles. We distinguish between properties of each bundle in the answer and properties of the answer as a whole. Consider the case of a user selecting the restaurants to try during a visit to a new city. The user has a limited budget which might be either financial, or simply the number of nights spent in the city. The user prefers suggested restaurants to serve different cuisines. The validity of a bundle of restaurants is given by the budget constraint and the complementarity of the restaurants in the bundle w.r.t. the cuisine they serve. Other restaurant attributes could be used for defining valid bundles. For example, instead of cuisines, different dress codes could be required to every restaurant in a single bundle. Moreover, in order to provide meaningful bundles, restaurants forming each bundle must be compatible, e.g., close geographically, or liked by similar reviewers. The degree of compatibility of the items forming a bundle defines the quality of the bundle. Intuitively, in the case geographic distance is used, the closer restaurants are from each other, the higher the quality of the bundle they belong to. Similarly, when common reviewers are used as the",
