            "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an Aerial Intelligent Reconfigurable Surface (AIRS) assisted wireless relay network, where IRS is implemented on the aerial platform, and the artificial noise is added to interrupt the eavesdropping. Based on the proposed system setup, it is formulated the secrecy rate maximization problem subject to the total transmit power and reflecting phase shift constraints. To solve this problem, we divide it into three sub-problems, i.e., transmit power allocation, AIRS trajectory optimization, and reflecting phase shift optimization. Alternately optimizing these three sub-problems, security aware joint optimal resource allocation schemes are proposed. Numerical simulations show that the joint optimal power allocation, AIRS trajectory, and reflecting phase shift schemes can effectively guarantee security performance for AIRS assisted wireless relay networks.",

            "abstract": "This work proposes a scalable access point (AP) selection framework based on a competitive mechanism that operates in two stages. Initially, the user equipment (UE) connects to an intermediate AP cluster, where a matched-decision among the APs and UEs establishes the best connection in terms of large-scale fading and prevents UEs from being dropped. Then, UEs can expand their AP clusters by connecting to more APs. We compare our method with baseline solutions considering different precoding techniques in centralized and distributed network implementations. We propose three strategies to fine-tune the AP clusters, reducing the number of UEs per AP without compromising the spectral efficiency (SE) or improving energy efficiency. The simulations comprise a range of UEs and APs, the number of antennas per AP varies, and each AP can serve a limited number of UEs. The results show that our solution improves up to 163% the SE of the 95% likely UEs compared with baseline solutions and that the number of UEs each AP serves is crucial for improving SE. Additional results indicate that our solution allows APs to save processing to enhance SE and evidence that the number of APs affects the SE differently in each network implementation.",

            "abstract": "Data collection and manipulation from real environments are two tasks that, in a well-organized way, can support the next generation of wireless networks (NGWNs) in resource allocation-related tasks such as spectrum frequency and transmission power. Due to the complexity of NGWNs, several metaheuristics have been proposed to help in these operations. However, a large number of these studies present solutions using only one algorithm or procedure, i.e., the research uses just one metaheuristic to resolve the radio resource allocation problem. This fact tends to lead to a loss of performance because, in this way, there is no considerable variability in the search strategies for better solutions. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework that maximizes the total throughput of an NGWN that implements the multi-carrier cell-less non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-CL-NOMA) architecture. The framework executes this activity using scenario information to feed an ensemble metaheuristic method. The empirical results show that the framework presents better performance than utilizing one metaheuristic individually. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms algorithms applicable in future 6G NOMA scenarios.",

Targeting at this problem, we propose an effective power-beamforming scheme by jointly allocating high power to CU and configuring a beamforming vector along with a maximum ratio transmission to CE's direction. The impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation on CE is thoughtfully taken into consideration. Approximate and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the block error rate and effective channel sum capacity are derived. Following that, we further quantify the diversity orders of users to reveal more useful insights into system designs. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power-beamforming scheme and to corroborate the accuracy of the derived theoretical analysis.",

            "abstract": "Average-consensus protocol is one of the ways to develop distributed time-synchronization algorithms in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the large number of iteration leads to a common time notion issue in nodes. This poses a critical challenge in the convergence of the time-synchronization algorithm and resulting asymptotic convergence in the average consensus protocol. In this article, a parameter-sharing-based average-consensus time-synchronization (PACTS) algorithm is proposed. For fast convergence, the proposed PACTS quickly forwards the time information to multihop nodes and employs multihop average-consensus instead of single-hop average consensus. Specifically, a node asynchronously and periodically broadcasts the relative clock offset estimation of neighbors with its local time information. Meanwhile, the relative clock offset estimation of the multihop node is calculated and used to estimate the average value. Consequently, an average consensus among local multihop nodes is obtained. As a result, the iteration number and convergence time are significantly reduced over the network. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed PACTS algorithm has low complexity, high accuracy, and quick convergence.",

We first exploit the sparsity of the NF channel in the polar domain and perform an off-grid sampling of angles and distances. Then, an effective SBL method is proposed for sparse channel recovery and off-grid refinement. The sampled grid points are set to adjustable parameters, which undergo iterative updates by resorting to an accurate block majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm and gradient calculation. The proposed method demonstrates efficient channel estimation capabilities even in the absence of prior knowledge of the noise variance, leveraging the sparse characteristics of the NF channel. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the sparsity and accuracy of the NF channel representation.

            "abstract": "Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is commonly deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) systems to achieve high data rates with reasonable complexity, where noncooperative protocols encode signals with different modulations for multiple users. However, conventional modulation recognition is limited to single-carrier communication systems, and there is an urgent need to design an effective method to blindly identify the unknown modulation format of received signals. In this article, we propose an automatic modulation classification method for the OFDM systems with the presence of channel deterioration. Our method first leverages a data reconstruction mechanism to arrange signals into high-dimensional data arrays and then exploits an efficient convolutional network, namely OFDMsym-Net, to learn underlying radio characteristics. OFDMsym-Net is designed by two kinds of processing modules, which manipulate one-dimensional asymmetric convolution filters to extract the intracorrelation within an OFDM symbol and the intercorrelation between different symbols. Moreover, a sophisticated structure with addition and concatenation layers is developed inside every module to improve learning efficiency. Based on simulation results achieved on a synthetic dataset of OFDM signals, our proposed method shows the classification robustness under various channel impairments. It reveals to have an overall accuracy of 95.41% at 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio, being superior to several state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we study short-packet communications in multi-hop networks with wireless energy transfer, where relay nodes harvest energy from power beacons to transmit short packets to multiple destinations. It is proposed a novel cooperative beamforming relay selection (CRS) scheme which incorporates partial relay selection and distributed multiuser beamforming to achieve a high-reliable transmission in two consecutive hops. A closed-form expression for the average block error rate (BLER) of the CRS scheme is derived, based on which an asymptotic analysis is also carried out. To achieve optimal channel uses allocation, we formulate a fairness end-to-end throughput maximization problem which is generally NP-hard due to the non-concavity of the objective function and mixed-integer constraints. To solve this challenging problem efficiently, we first relax channel uses to be continuous and transform the relaxed problem into an equivalent non-convex one, but with a more tractable form. We then develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm relying on inner approximation framework to convexify non-convex parts that converges to at least a locally optimal solution. Towards real-time settings, we design an efficient deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiscale-accumulation connections to achieve the sub-optimal solution of the relaxed problem via real-time inference processes. Numerical results are presented to verify the analytical derivations and to demonstrate performance improvements of the CRS scheme over the benchmark ones in terms of BLER, reliability, latency, and throughput in various settings. Moreover, the designed CNN provides the lowest root-mean-square error compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches while the CNN-aided optimization framework estimates accurately the optimal channel uses allocation with low execution time.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates short-packet communications (SPCs) of a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based cellular network where an IoT master node acts as: (1) a relay for the cellular system and (2) a source for the IoT system. Accurate and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the average block error rates (BLERs) of cellular user (CU) and IoT user (IU) are derived in the presence of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and channel state information (CSI). Notably, numerical results show that: (i) IUs' performance is significantly improved by exploitation of NOMA technique and is not dominated by decode-and-forward (DF) or amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocol; (ii) CUs' performance may not perform well compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based systems for both AF and DF protocols; (iii) higher antenna configuration at the cellular transmitter results in a rapid BLER convergence for CU.",
