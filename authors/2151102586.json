            "abstract": "Recommender systems have emerged as an indispensable mean to meet personalized interests of users and alleviate information overload. Despite the great success, accuracy-oriented recommendation models are creating information cocoons, i.e., it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to see other items they might be interested in. Although recent studies start paying attention to enhancing recommendation diversity, models based on point embedding fail to describe the range of user preferences and item features well, which is essential for diversified matching. To this end, we propose LCD-UC , a novel List-Check-Decide framework with UnCertainty masking based on box embedding to improve recommendation diversity with recommendation accuracy maintained. Specifically, LCD-UC creates hypercubes to represent users and items using box embedding for high model flexibility and expressiveness. Then, a hypercube similarity scoring function is designed to measure the similarity between hypercubes representing users and items. To make a balance between the accuracy and diversity of recommendations and achieve personalized diversity needs, we further develop a user-item pairwise attention mechanism as well as a user uncertainty masking mechanism in LCD-UC. Besides, we present two new metrics for better evaluation on recommendation diversity, which address the issue that existing metrics only consider the coverage of categories while ignore the frequency of categories. The extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that LCD-UC can improve both recommendation accuracy and diversity over three base models, and is superior to six state-of-the-art recommendation models. An online 10-day AB test also demonstrates that LCD-UC can improve the performance of a real-world advertising system.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic graph datasets are crucial for the assessment of network analysis algorithms, providing a measure of their effectiveness and efficiency. However, most existing generation techniques typically focus on community formation, neglecting the fact that real-world communities not only emerge but may also dissipate over time. This lifecycle occurs within a finite timeframe, adding complexity to the community dynamics. In this paper, firstly we introduce the concept of time-bound community to characterize communities that are destined to disintegrate. Secondly, we devise GTB, a temporal graph Generation method featuring Time-Bound communities, leveraging newly identified patterns within real datasets that we have collected. Additionally, we propose the advanced Temporal Edge Distribution (TED) model, a key component of G TB, designed for the swift generation of temporal edges within distribution limits and offering a constant time complexity to generate each edge. The TED model not only accommodates diverse distribution configurations but also facilitates its seamless transfer between time-bound communities to enhance time and space efficiency. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by delivering generated content of superior Quality with notably competitive time and space consumption.",

            "abstract": "Contrastive learning, a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm, has shown its efficacy in learning embed dings from independent and identically distributed (IID) as well as non-IID data without relying on label information. Since high-quality discriminative embeddings form a rich embedding space, which benefits model performance on downstream tasks, it is necessary to study how to improve the quality of contrastive node embeddings in graph contrastive learning. However, there has been limited research on this area. In this paper, we investigate how to generate high-quality contrastive node embeddings based on an in-depth analysis of graph contrastive losses. Firstly, we propose a novel and effective method, GLATE, for estimating the temperatures in three mainstream graph contrastive losses during the training phase. Secondly, we conduct the derivation of GLATE, and the derivation results reveal the specific relationship between the quality of contrastive node embeddings and tem-peratures. Finally, the extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that GLATE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning models in terms of both model performance and training efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Modern recommender systems often deal with a variety of user interactions, e.g., click, forward, purchase, etc., which requires the underlying recommender engines to fully understand and leverage multi-behavior data from users. Despite recent efforts towards making use of heterogeneous data, multi-behavior recommendation still faces great challenges. Firstly, sparse target signals and noisy auxiliary interactions remain an issue. Secondly, existing methods utilizing self-supervised learning (SSL) to tackle the data sparsity neglect the serious optimization imbalance between the SSL task and the target task. Hence, we propose a Multi-Behavior Self-Supervised Learning (MBSSL) framework together with an adaptive optimization method. Specifically, we devise a behavior-aware graph neural network incorporating the self-attention mechanism to capture behavior multiplicity and dependencies. To increase the robustness to data sparsity under the target behavior and noisy interactions from auxiliary behaviors, we propose a novel self-supervised learning paradigm to conduct node self-discrimination at both inter-behavior and intra-behavior levels. In addition, we develop a customized optimization strategy through hybrid manipulation on gradients to adaptively balance the self-supervised learning task and the main supervised recommendation task. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the consistent improvements obtained by MBSSL over ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. We release our model implementation at: https://github.com/Scofield666/MBSSL.git.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are able to learn user preferences based on user and item representations via their historical behaviors. To improve representation learning, recent recommendation models start leveraging information from various behavior types exhibited by users. In real-world scenarios, the user behavioral graph is not only multiplex but also dynamic, i.e., the graph evolves rapidly over time, with various types of nodes and edges added or deleted, which causes the Neighborhood Disturbance. Nevertheless, most existing methods neglect such streaming dynamics and thus need to be retrained once the graph has significantly evolved, making them unsuitable in the online learning environment. Furthermore, the Neighborhood Disturbance existing in dynamic graphs deteriorates the performance of neighbor-aggregation based graph models. To this end, we propose SUPA, a novel graph neural network for dynamic multiplex heterogeneous graphs. Compared to neighbor-aggregation architecture, SUPA develops a sample-update-propagate architecture to alleviate neighborhood disturbance. Specifically, for each new edge, SUPA samples an influenced subgraph, updates the representations of the two interactive nodes, and propagates the interaction information to the sampled subgraph. Furthermore, to train SUPA incrementally online, we propose InsLearn, an efficient workflow for single-pass training of large dynamic graphs. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that SUPA has a good generalization ability and is superior to sixteen state-of-the-art baseline methods.

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising results on exploiting node representations for many downstream tasks through supervised end-to-end training. To deal with the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world applications, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is leveraged to train GNNs with limited or even no labels by maximizing the mutual information between nodes in its augmented views generated from the original graph. However, the distribution of graphs remains unconsidered in view generation, resulting in the ignorance of unseen edges in most existing literature, which is empirically shown to be able to improve GCL's performance in our experiments. To this end, we propose to incorporate graph generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of views for GCL, in order to i) automatically capture the characteristic of graphs for augmentations, and ii) jointly train the graph GAN model and the GCL model. Specifically, we present GACN, a novel Generative Adversarial Contrastive learning Network for graph representation learning. GACN develops a view generator and a view discriminator to generate augmented views automatically in an adversarial style. Then, GACN leverages these views to train a GNN encoder with two carefully designed self-supervised learning losses, including the graph contrastive loss and the Bayesian personalized ranking Loss. Furthermore, we design an optimization framework to train all GACN modules jointly. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that GACN is able to generate high-quality augmented views for GCL and is superior to twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods. Noticeably, our proposed GACN surprisingly discovers that the generated views in data augmentation finally conform to the well-known preferential attachment rule in online networks.",

            "title": "PANE-GNN: Unifying Positive and Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems play a crucial role in addressing the issue of information overload by delivering personalized recommendations to users. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) for recommender systems, capitalizing on advancements in graph representation learning. These GNN-based models primarily focus on analyzing users' positive feedback while overlooking the valuable insights provided by their negative feedback. In this paper, we propose PANE-GNN, an innovative recommendation model that unifies Positive And Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks for recommendation. By incorporating user preferences and dispreferences, our approach enhances the capability of recommender systems to offer personalized suggestions. PANE-GNN first partitions the raw rating graph into two distinct bipartite graphs based on positive and negative feedback. Subsequently, we employ two separate embeddings, the interest embedding and the disinterest embedding, to capture users' likes and dislikes, respectively. To facilitate effective information propagation, we design distinct message-passing mechanisms for positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, we introduce a distortion to the negative graph, which exclusively consists of negative feedback edges, for contrastive training. This distortion plays a crucial role in effectively denoising the negative feedback. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that PANE-GNN surpasses the existing state-of-the-art benchmark methods across four real-world datasets. These datasets include three commonly used recommender system datasets and one open-source short video recommendation dataset.",

            "title": "HybridGNN: Learning Hybrid Representation for Recommendation in Multiplex Heterogeneous Networks",
            "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks have shown the superiority of modeling the complex topological structures in heterogeneous network-based recommender systems. Due to the diverse interactions among nodes and abundant semantics emerging from diverse types of nodes and edges, there is a bursting research interest in learning expressive node repre-sentations in multiplex heterogeneous networks. One of the most important tasks in recommender systems is to predict the potential connection between two nodes under a specific edge type (i.e., relationship). Although existing studies utilize explicit metapaths to aggregate neighbors, practically they only consider intra-relationship metapaths and thus fail to leverage the potential uplift by inter-relationship information. Moreover, it is not always straightforward to exploit inter-relationship metapaths comprehensively under diverse relationships, espe-cially with the increasing number of node and edge types. In addition, contributions of different relationships between two nodes are difficult to measure. To address the challenges, we propose HybridGNN, an end-to-end GNN model with hybrid aggregation flows and hierarchical attentions to fully utilize the heterogeneity in the multiplex scenarios. Specifically, HybridGNN applies a randomized inter-relationship exploration module to exploit the multiplexity property among different relationships. Then, our model leverages hybrid aggregation flows under intra-relationship metapaths and randomized exploration to learn the rich semantics. To explore the importance of different aggregation flow and take advantage of the multiplexity property, we bring forward a novel hierarchical attention module which leverages both metapath-Ievel attention and relationship-level attention. Extensive experimental results on five real-world datasets suggest that HybridGNN achieves the best performance compared to several state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.01, t-test) with statistical significance.",

Most of these applications are putting forward from desktop to mobile client side, since smart devices are growing by leaps and bounds, and they tend to take fully advantage of tunnels that telecom companies offer. Like any other industries, telecom operators also face tough competitions from \"over-the-top\"(OTT) service providers. Therefore, they are prone to bring in Big Data analytical techniques to take fully use of streaming data they possessed. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel query system specifically designed for telecom networks that integrates both online pre-processing and offline analytics for social streaming data. Furthermore, our framework is able to speedup the query processing by creating and parsing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
