            "abstract": "Satellite-high altitude platform (HAP)-terrestrial networks have been considered as an indispensable infrastructure of next-generation networks because they can offer massive access service with high throughput and broad coverage connections. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and two-way relaying techniques are considered as potential technologies to enhance the spectrum efficiency and connectivity. Thus, in this article, the performance of two-way satellite-HAP-terrestrial networks with NOMA, which are subject to imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation, is investigated. Closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the outage probability, and ergodic capacity are derived to verify the impact of the system and channel parameters on the considered network. Simulation results indicate that the optimization power allocation factor is independent of the channel fading.",

            "abstract": "Time-modulated arrays (TMAs) have been found useful to construct directional modulation (DM) transmitters, offering physical-layer security. Two issues, however, exist in conventional TMA DM, which are high power loss and generation of mirror harmonic frequency signals that may compromise wireless security. In this article, we propose to construct DM transmitters using a high efficiency TMA. By carefully designing the time sequences of the selected phase shifters, the DM symbols modulated upon multicarrier can be synthesized with suppressed mirror harmonic frequencies. It is shown that the proposed TMA DM transmitters here enjoy feeding network efficiency of 100%, and the transmit DM symbols can be synthesized at a pre-selected frequency only, significantly enhancing security performance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated via bit error rate (BER) simulations. Meanwhile, The TMA DM can also be used as a potential technique for the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).",

Analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate (ER) are calculated. For a deeper understanding, the asymptotic behavior of OP and ER at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes are carried out. Illustrative simulation results are presented and reveal that: i) The OP decreases and the ER gradually increases with the increase of SNR, and eventually approaching a constant; ii) ipSIC and CEEs have a negative impact on the considered system; iii) The outage and ER performance of RSMA-based CR network outperforms CR-NOMA network due to its flexible control of interference; iv) The OP first decreases and then increases with the power allocated to the common message, and there exists an optimal power allocation factor to ensure the reliable performance.",

            "abstract": "In frequency selective channel environment, channel estimation in hybrid precoding millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system is a challenge issue. To solve this problem, we propose an effective channel estimation scheme for frequency selective channel, which is based on the training channel model in urban traffic environment. Considering that the practical mmWave MIMO channel is sparsity and the subcarrier multi-channels have the same sparse structure, we regard the channel estimation problem as the sparse channel recovery, and propose a multipath simultaneous matching tracking estimation method. It is assumed that the noise between the practical channels has a certain correlation, and the noise correlation has an impact on the selection of the optimal atomic support set in the process of channel recovery. Therefore, noise weighting is introduced in our proposed method. The simulation results prove the validity of this proposed method in frequency selective mmWave MIMO channel. Without increasing the complexity of the algorithm, the proposed method can achieve better local performance than the traditional classical methods.",

            "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.",

We split the overall process into two phases: i) downlink wireless energy transmission (WET) in the first phase and ii) uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) in the second phase. Compared with the existing works, the double IRSs scheme is considered due to obstacles or deep shadowing between the transmitter and receiver. Specifically, we propose a scheme to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing the time allocation and phase shift matrices in these two phases. The optimization problem is non-trivial because of the coupling of multiple variables and the constraint of phase shift. An alternative optimization algorithm is adopted to surmount the objective step by step. The WET phase shift matrices are first obtained under given WIT phase shift matrices, and then vice versa. Numerical analysis proves the validity of the proposed scheme in increasing the sum rate and the effectiveness of double IRSs.",

In this article, we introduce a novel secure and privacy-preserving outsourcing computing scheme (hereafter referred to as SPOCS) to tackle this issue. In SPOCS, the effective use of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), one of the trusted execution environment (TEE), ensures the confidence and integrity of sensitive data in cloud computing and prevents data loss from causing privacy disclosure. In order to keep malicious cloud service providers (CSPs) from illegally tampering with the outsourcing results, blockchain is employed to ensure the data immutability. Significantly, our proposed scheme achieves anonymity and traceability. In the outsourcing process, smart contracts are applied to make the whole process fully automated without any human involvement. Finally, the security of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of its resistance to different attacks. The experiments indicate that our scheme is effective and efficient.",

            "title": "Dynamic Multi-Objective AWPSO in DT-Assisted UAV Cooperative Task Assignment",
            "abstract": "In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative task assignment. In order to complete the task with the lowest cost, some researchers use multi-objective optimization to solve the assignment problem. But few of them consider the complex dynamic scenarios. In this article, the time-varying resource supply and demands are provided by established digital twins (DTs) of UAVs and targets, thereby enabling accurate decision guidance for dynamic task assignment. It takes the scheduling cost, path cost, risk cost and total task time cost as the optimization objectives. To solve this model, an improved dynamic multi-objective adaptive weighted particle swarm Optimization algorithm (DMOAWPSO) is proposed. In the initialization stage, a heuristic method is used to increase the effectiveness of the solution. Besides, the adaptive mutation and subgroup methods are adopted to improve the diversity of the solution. Then, effective environment change detection and response strategies are designed to adapt to dynamic scenarios. Finally, the evaluation metrics are calculated in different instances. Compared with the popular and classic dynamic multi-objective algorithms, the simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm is effective and can cope with the environment changes better in solving the task assignment problem.",
