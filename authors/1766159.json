            "abstract": "We present 3MASSIV, a multilingual, multimodal and multi-aspect, expertly-annotated dataset of diverse short videos extracted from short-video social media platform - Moj. 3MASSIV comprises of 50k short videos (20 seconds average duration) and 100K unlabeled videos in 11 different languages and captures popular short video trends like pranks, fails, romance, comedy expressed via unique audio-visual formats like self-shot videos, reaction videos, lip-synching, self-sung songs, etc. 3MASSIV presents an opportunity for multimodal and multilingual semantic understanding on these unique videos by annotating them for concepts, affective states, media types, and audio language. We present a thorough analysis of 3MASSIV and highlight the variety and unique aspects of our dataset compared to other contemporary popular datasets with strong baselines. We also show how the social media content in 3MASSIV is dynamic and temporal in nature, which can be used for semantic understanding tasks and cross-lingual analysis.",

            "abstract": "Abusive content detection in spoken text can be addressed by performing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and leveraging advancements in natural language processing. However, ASR models introduce latency and often perform sub-optimally for abusive words as they are underrepresented in training corpora and not spoken clearly or completely. Exploration of this problem entirely in the audio domain has largely been limited by the lack of audio datasets. Building on these challenges, we propose ADIMA, a novel, linguistically diverse, ethically sourced, expert annotated and well- balanced multilingual abuse detection audio dataset comprising of 11,775 audio samples in 10 Indic languages spanning 65 hours and spoken by 6,446 unique users. Through quantitative experiments across monolingual and cross-lingual zeroshot settings, we take the first step in democratizing audio based content moderation in Indic languages and set forth our dataset to pave future work.

We propose a hybrid message prediction model, which can easily run on low-end phones. We discuss message cluster to sticker mapping, addressing the multilingual needs of our users, automated tuning of the system and also propose a novel application of community detection algorithm.

            "abstract": "The presence of abusive content on social media platforms is undesirable as it severely impedes healthy and safe social media interactions. While automatic abuse detection has been widely explored in textual domain, audio abuse detection still remains unexplored. In this paper, we attempt abuse detection in conversational audio from a multimodal perspective in a multilingual social media setting. Our key hypothesis is that along with the modelling of audio, incorporating discriminative information from other modalities can be highly beneficial for this task. Our proposed method, MADA, explicitly focuses on two modalities other than the audio itself, namely, the underlying emotions expressed in the abusive audio and the semantic information encapsulated in the corresponding textual form. Observations prove that MADA demonstrates gains over audio-only approaches on the ADIMA dataset. We test the proposed approach on 10 different languages and observe consistent gains in the range 0.6%-5.2% by leveraging multiple modalities. We also perform extensive ablation experiments for studying the contributions of every modality and observe the best results while leveraging all the modalities together. Additionally, we perform experiments to empirically confirm that there is a strong correlation between underlying emotions and abusive behaviour.",

            "abstract": "We present a computational approach for estimating emotion contagion on social media networks. Built on a foundation of psychology literature, our approach estimates the degree to which the perceivers' emotional states (positive or negative) start to match those of the expressors, based on the latter's content. We use a combination of deep learning and social network analysis to model emotion contagion as a diffusion process in dynamic social network graphs, taking into consideration key aspects like causality, homophily, and interference. We evaluate our approach on user behavior data obtained from a popular social media platform for sharing short videos. We analyze the behavior of 48 users over a span of 8 weeks (over 200k audio-visual short posts analyzed) and estimate how contagious the users with whom they engage with are on social media. As per the theory of diffusion, we account for the videos a user watches during this time (inflow) and the daily engagements; liking, sharing, downloading or creating new videos (outflow) to estimate contagion. To validate our approach and analysis, we obtain human feedback on these 48 social media platform users with an online study by collecting responses of about 150 participants. We report users who interact with more number of creators on the platform are 12% less prone to contagion, and those who consume more content of `negative' sentiment are 23% more prone to contagion. We will publicly release our code upon acceptance.",

            "title": "Heterogeneous Edge Embeddings for Friend Recommendation",
            "abstract": "We propose a friend recommendation system (an application of link prediction) using edge embeddings on social networks. Most real-world social networks are multi-graphs, where different kinds of relationships (e.g. chat, friendship) are possible between a pair of users. Existing network embedding techniques do not leverage signals from different edge types and thus perform inadequately on link prediction in such networks. We propose a method to mine network representation that effectively exploits heterogeneity in multi-graphs. We evaluate our model on a real-world, active social network where this system is deployed for friend recommendation for millions of users. Our method outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines on Hike's social network in terms of accuracy as well as user satisfaction.",
