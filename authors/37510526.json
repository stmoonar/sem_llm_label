            "title": "Enhanced Discrete Multi-Modal Hashing: More Constraints Yet Less Time to Learn",
            "abstract": "Due to the exponential growth of multimedia data, multi-modal hashing as a promising technique to make cross-view retrieval scalable is attracting more and more attention. However, most of the existing multi-modal hashing methods either divide the learning process unnaturally into two separate stages or treat the discrete optimization problem simplistically as a continuous one, which leads to suboptimal results. Recently, a few discrete multi-modal hashing methods that try to address such issues have emerged, but they still ignore several important discrete constraints (such as the balance and decorrelation of hash bits). In this paper, we overcome those limitations by proposing a novel method named \u201cEnhanced Discrete Multi-modal Hashing (EDMH)\u201d which learns binary codes and hashing functions simultaneously from the pairwise similarity matrix of data, under the aforementioned discrete constraints. Although the model of EDMH looks a lot more complex than the other models for multi-modal hashing, we are actually able to develop a fast iterative learning algorithm for it, since the subproblems of its optimization all have closed-form solutions after introducing a couple of auxiliary variables. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets have revealed the usefulness of those previously ignored discrete constraints and demonstrated that EDMH not only performs much better than state-of-the-art competitors according to several retrieval metrics but also runs much faster than most of them.",

            "abstract": "A core task in process mining is process discovery which aims to learn an accurate process model from event log data. In this paper, we propose to use (block-) structured programs directly as target process models so as to establish connections to the field of program synthesis and facilitate the translation from abstract process models to executable processes, e.g., for robotic process automation. Furthermore, we develop a novel bottom-up agglomerative approach to the discovery of such structured program process models. In comparison with the popular top-down recursive inductive miner, our proposed agglomerative miner enjoys the similar theoretical guarantee to produce sound process models (without deadlocks and other anomalies) while exhibiting some advantages like avoiding silent activities and accommodating duplicate activities. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively applying a few graph rewriting rules to the directly-follows-graph of activities. For real-world (sparse) directly-follows-graphs, the algorithm has quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of distinct activities. To our knowledge, this is the first process discovery algorithm that is made for the purpose of program synthesis. Experiments on the BPI-Challenge 2020 dataset and the Karel programming dataset have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm can outperform the inductive miner not only according to the traditional process discovery metrics but also in terms of the effectiveness in finding out the true underlying structured program from a small number of its execution traces.",

            "title": "Strongly Constrained Discrete Hashing",
            "abstract": "Learning to hash is a fundamental technique widely used in large-scale image retrieval. Most existing methods for learning to hash address the involved discrete optimization problem by the continuous relaxation of the binary constraint, which usually leads to large quantization errors and consequently suboptimal binary codes. A few discrete hashing methods have emerged recently. However, they either completely ignore some useful constraints (specifically the balance and decorrelation of hash bits) or just turn those constraints into regularizers that would make the optimization easier but less accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method named Strongly Constrained Discrete Hashing (SCDH) which overcomes such limitations. It can learn the binary codes for all examples in the training set, and meanwhile obtain a hash function for unseen samples with the above mentioned constraints preserved. Although the model of SCDH is fairly sophisticated, we are able to find closed-form solutions to all of its optimization subproblems and thus design an efficient algorithm that converges quickly. In addition, we extend SCDH to a kernelized version SCDH $_{K}$ . Our experiments on three large benchmark datasets have demonstrated that not only can SCDH and SCDH $_{K}$ achieve substantially higher MAP scores than state-of-the-art baselines, but they train much faster than those that are also supervised as well.",

This makes the approach applicable to digital archives recording historic texts, but also those composed of more recent news articles, for example.\n\n\nSocial implications\nThe analysis of \u201cparallel passages\u201d enables researchers to quantify the presence and extent of text-reuse in a collection of documents, which can provide useful data on author style, text genres and cultural contexts.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe approach is novel and addresses a need by humanities researchers for tools that can identify similar documents and local similarities represented by shared text sequences in a potentially vast large archive of documents. As far as the authors are aware, there are no tools currently exist that provide the same level of tolerance to the language of the documents.\n",

            "title": "SCRAM: Spatially Coherent Randomized Attention Maps",
            "abstract": "Attention mechanisms and non-local mean operations in general are key ingredients in many state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular, the Transformer model based on multi-head self-attention has recently achieved great success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, the vanilla algorithm computing the Transformer of an image with n pixels has O(n^2) complexity, which is often painfully slow and sometimes prohibitively expensive for large-scale image data. In this paper, we propose a fast randomized algorithm --- SCRAM --- that only requires O(n log(n)) time to produce an image attention map. Such a dramatic acceleration is attributed to our insight that attention maps on real-world images usually exhibit (1) spatial coherence and (2) sparse structure. The central idea of SCRAM is to employ PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence algorithm, to quickly pinpoint the most compatible key (argmax) for each query first, and then exploit that knowledge to design a sparse approximation to non-local mean operations. Using the argmax (mode) to dynamically construct the sparse approximation distinguishes our algorithm from all of the existing sparse approximate methods and makes it very efficient. Moreover, SCRAM is a broadly applicable approximation to any non-local mean layer in contrast to some other sparse approximations that can only approximate self-attention. Our preliminary experimental results suggest that SCRAM is indeed promising for speeding up or scaling up the computation of attention maps in the Transformer.",
