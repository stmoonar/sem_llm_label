            "title": "Be Aware of the Neighborhood Effect: Modeling Selection Bias under Interference",
            "abstract": "Selection bias in recommender system arises from the recommendation process of system filtering and the interactive process of user selection. Many previous studies have focused on addressing selection bias to achieve unbiased learning of the prediction model, but ignore the fact that potential outcomes for a given user-item pair may vary with the treatments assigned to other user-item pairs, named neighborhood effect. To fill the gap, this paper formally formulates the neighborhood effect as an interference problem from the perspective of causal inference and introduces a treatment representation to capture the neighborhood effect. On this basis, we propose a novel ideal loss that can be used to deal with selection bias in the presence of neighborhood effect. We further develop two new estimators for estimating the proposed ideal loss. We theoretically establish the connection between the proposed and previous debiasing methods ignoring the neighborhood effect, showing that the proposed methods can achieve unbiased learning when both selection bias and neighborhood effect are present, while the existing methods are biased. Extensive semi-synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced recommender systems. Both academia and industry have shown growing interest in developing LLMs for recommendation purposes, an approach commonly referred to as LLM4Rec. This involves efforts such as utilizing LLMs for generative item retrieval and ranking, along with the potential for creating universal LLMs for varied recommendation tasks, signaling a possible paradigm shift in recommender systems. This tutorial is designed to review the progression of LLM4Rec and provide an in-depth analysis of the prevailing studies. We will discuss how LLMs advance recommender systems in model architecture, learning paradigms, and capabilities like conversation, generalization, planning, and content generation. Additionally, the tutorial will highlight open problems and challenges in this nascent field, addressing concerns related to trustworthiness, efficiency, online training, and recommendation data modeling. Concluding with a summary of the takeaways from previous research, the tutorial will suggest avenues for future investigations. Our aim is to help the audience grasp the developments in LLM4Rec, as well as to spark inspiration for further research. By doing so, we expect to contribute to the growth and success of LLM4Rec, possibly leading to a fundamental change in recommender paradigms.",

            "title": "Proactive Recommendation with Iterative Preference Guidance",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems mainly tailor personalized recommendations according to user interests learned from user feedback. However, such recommender systems passively cater to user interests and even reinforce existing interests in the feedback loop, leading to problems like filter bubbles and opinion polarization. To counteract this, proactive recommendation actively steers users towards developing new interests in a target item or topic by strategically modulating recommendation sequences. Existing work for proactive recommendation faces significant hurdles: 1) overlooking the user feedback in the guidance process; 2) lacking explicit modeling of the guiding objective; and 3) insufficient flexibility for integration into existing industrial recommender systems. To address these issues, we introduce an Iterative Preference Guidance (IPG) framework. IPG performs proactive recommendation in a flexible post-processing manner by ranking items according to their IPG scores that consider both interaction probability and guiding value. These scores are explicitly estimated with iteratively updated user representation that considers the most recent user interactions. Extensive experiments validate that IPG can effectively guide user interests toward target interests with a reasonable trade-off in recommender accuracy.

            "abstract": "As recommender systems are indispensable in various domains such as job searching and e-commerce, providing equitable recommendations to users with different sensitive attributes becomes an imperative requirement. Prior approaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume the availability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. In practice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us to investigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attribute information. Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitive attributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to the complexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legal regulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust to reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust Fair Optimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over all potential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead of the reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limited sensitive attributes are accessible.",

            "abstract": "With the information explosion on the Web, search and recommendation are foundational infrastructures to satisfying users' information needs. As the two sides of the same coin, both revolve around the same core research problem, matching queries with documents or users with items. In the recent few decades, search and recommendation have experienced synchronous technological paradigm shifts, including machine learning-based and deep learning-based paradigms. Recently, the superintelligent generative large language models have sparked a new paradigm in search and recommendation, i.e., generative search (retrieval) and recommendation, which aims to address the matching problem in a generative manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging paradigm in information systems and summarize the developments in generative search and recommendation from a unified perspective. Rather than simply categorizing existing works, we abstract a unified framework for the generative paradigm and break down the existing works into different stages within this framework to highlight the strengths and weaknesses. And then, we distinguish generative search and recommendation with their unique challenges, identify open problems and future directions, and envision the next information-seeking paradigm.",

            "abstract": "Recommendation systems for Web content distribution intricately connect to the information access and exposure opportunities for vulnerable populations. The emergence of Large Language Models-based Recommendation System (LRS) may introduce additional societal challenges to recommendation systems due to the inherent biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). From the perspective of item-side fairness, there remains a lack of comprehensive investigation into the item-side fairness of LRS given the unique characteristics of LRS compared to conventional recommendation systems. To bridge this gap, this study examines the property of LRS with respect to item-side fairness and reveals the influencing factors of both historical users' interactions and inherent semantic biases of LLMs, shedding light on the need to extend conventional item-side fairness methods for LRS. Towards this goal, we develop a concise and effective framework called IFairLRS to enhance the item-side fairness of an LRS. IFairLRS covers the main stages of building an LRS with specifically adapted strategies to calibrate the recommendations of LRS. We utilize IFairLRS to fine-tune LLaMA, a representative LLM, on MovieLens and Steam datasets, and observe significant item-side fairness improvements.

Existing methods achieve this by learning collaborative embeddings in LLMs' latent space from scratch or by mapping from external models. However, they fail to represent the information in a text-like format, which may not align optimally with LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinLLM, a novel LLMRec method that seamlessly integrates collaborative information through text-like encoding. BinLLM converts collaborative embeddings from external models into binary sequences -- a specific text format that LLMs can understand and operate on directly, facilitating the direct usage of collaborative information in text-like format by LLMs. Additionally, BinLLM provides options to compress the binary sequence using dot-decimal notation to avoid excessively long lengths. Extensive experiments validate that BinLLM introduces collaborative information in a manner better aligned with LLMs, resulting in enhanced performance.

However, existing approaches often suffer from fairness issues, as recommendations tend to be more accurate for patients with common diseases compared to those with rare conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Robust and Accurate REcommendations for Medication (RAREMed), which leverages the pretrain-finetune learning paradigm to enhance accuracy for rare diseases. RAREMed employs a transformer encoder with a unified input sequence approach to capture complex relationships among disease and procedure codes. Additionally, it introduces two self-supervised pre-training tasks, namely Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) and Self Reconstruction (SR), to learn specialized medication needs and interrelations among clinical codes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that RAREMed provides accurate drug sets for both rare and common disease patients, thereby mitigating unfairness in medication recommendation systems.",

            "abstract": "The evolving paradigm of Large Language Model-based Recommendation (LLMRec) customizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using recommendation data. The inclusion of user data in LLMs raises privacy concerns. To protect users, the unlearning process in LLMRec, specifically removing unusable data (e.g., historical behaviors) from established LLMRec models, becomes crucial. However, existing unlearning methods are insufficient for the unique characteristics of LLM-Rec, mainly due to high computational costs or incomplete data erasure. In this study, we introduce the Adapter Partition and Aggregation (APA) framework for exact and efficient unlearning while maintaining recommendation performance. APA achieves this by establishing distinct adapters for partitioned training data shards and retraining only the adapters impacted by unusable data for unlearning. To preserve recommendation performance and mitigate considerable inference costs, APA employs parameter-level adapter aggregation with sample-adaptive attention for individual testing samples. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework",

            "abstract": "Optimization metrics are crucial for building recommendation systems at scale. However, an effective and efficient metric for practical use remains elusive. While Top-K ranking metrics are the gold standard for optimization, they suffer from significant computational overhead. Alternatively, the more efficient accuracy and AUC metrics often fall short of capturing the true targets of recommendation tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this dilemma, we propose a new optimization metric, Lower-Left Partial AUC (LLPAUC), which is computationally efficient like AUC but strongly correlates with Top-K ranking metrics. Compared to AUC, LLPAUC considers only the partial area under the ROC curve in the Lower-Left corner to push the optimization focus on Top-K. We provide theoretical validation of the correlation between LLPAUC and Top-K ranking metrics and demonstrate its robustness to noisy user feedback. We further design an efficient point-wise recommendation loss to maximize LLPAUC and evaluate it on three datasets, validating its effectiveness and robustness.",
