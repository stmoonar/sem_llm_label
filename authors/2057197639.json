            "abstract": "In real-world applications that involve complex data dependencies, it would be essential to proceed with machine learning tasks in an adaptable manner. This article presents a novel Mutually Adaptable Learning (MAL) approach that allows for, on the one hand, extracting the most crucial information from data, and on the other hand, maximally utilizing it through model learning, in a mutually adaptable manner. We elaborate our MAL approach by explaining how it determines the necessity for the adaptation of both features and the learning model, integratively adapts between feature selection and model learning, and optimally achieves the learning objective. To systematically validate the effectiveness of MAL, we conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging learning tasks from two representative domains: spatiotemporal prediction and chaotic behavioral prediction, where the complex data dependencies are general encountered. Results demonstrate that MAL outperforms existing learning methods. Moreover, we show that the formulated objective can be attained under an information-theoretic guarantee. With both empirical and theoretical supports, MAL offers an effective solution to the problem of feature and model adaptation to achieve desired learning objective for given complex tasks.",

            "abstract": "For better monitoring and controlling influenza, WHO has launched FluNet (recently integrated to FluMART) to provide a unified platform for participating countries to routinely collect influenza-related syndromic, epidemiological and virological data. However, the reported data were incomplete.We propose a novel surveillance system based on data from multiple sources to accurately assess the epidemic status of different countries, especially for those with missing surveillance data in some periods. The proposed method can automatically select a small set of reliable and informative indicators for assessing the underlying epidemic status and proper supporting data to train the predictive model. Our proactive selection method outperforms three other out-of-box methods (linear regression, multilayer perceptron, and long-short term memory) to make accurate predictions.",

            "title": "Demystifying Deep Learning in Predictive Spatiotemporal Analytics: An Information-Theoretic Framework",
            "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved incredible success over the past years, especially in various challenging predictive spatiotemporal analytics (PSTA) tasks, such as disease prediction, climate forecast, and traffic prediction, where intrinsic dependence relationships among data exist and generally manifest at multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, given a specific PSTA task and the corresponding data set, how to appropriately determine the desired configuration of a deep learning model, theoretically analyze the model\u2019s learning behavior, and quantitatively characterize the model\u2019s learning capacity remains a mystery. In order to demystify the power of deep learning for PSTA in a theoretically sound and explainable way, in this article, we provide a comprehensive framework for deep learning model design and information-theoretic analysis. First, we develop and demonstrate a novel interactively and integratively connected deep recurrent neural network (I2DRNN) model. I2DRNN consists of three modules: an input module that integrates data from heterogeneous sources; a hidden module that captures the information at different scales while allowing the information to flow interactively between layers; and an output module that models the integrative effects of information from various hidden layers to generate the output predictions. Second, to theoretically prove that our designed model can learn multiscale spatiotemporal dependence in PSTA tasks, we provide an information-theoretic analysis to examine the information-based learning capacity (i-CAP) of the proposed model. In so doing, we can tackle an important open question in deep learning, that is, how to determine the necessary and sufficient configurations of a designed deep learning model with respect to the given learning data sets. Third, to validate the I2DRNN model and confirm its i-CAP, we systematically conduct a series of experiments involving both synthetic data sets and real-world PSTA tasks. The experimental results show that the I2DRNN model outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art models on all data sets and PSTA tasks. More importantly, as readily validated, the proposed model captures the multiscale spatiotemporal dependence, which is meaningful in the real-world context. Furthermore, the model configuration that corresponds to the best performance on a given data set always falls into the range between the necessary and sufficient configurations, as derived from the information-theoretic analysis.",

            "abstract": "For thousands of years, infectious diseases have been a major threat to mankind. In order to detect and prevent the epidemics early and effectively, public health surveillance is very important in the disease control efforts. Planning of public health surveillance requires availability of public health data in a certain area, from which the spatial and temporal disease transmission patterns in the data can be discovered and used to set the surveillance sentinels. However, the data missing is often unavoidable in various kinds of epidemic scenarios. Moreover, different kinds of data missing, such as spatial missing, temporal missing, and random missing, make the modeling quite challenging. Existing methods for missing data completion modeled the spatio-temporal correlations only on the target variable but ignored the underlying risk factors, which have been shown playing an important role in making inferences on the target variable (i.e., the number of infected cases). Moreover, the strengths of spatio-temporal correlations, which have been assumed fixed in the existing methods, could dynamically change along with the changes in underlying risk factors. To take the underlying risk factors into consideration for inferring the disease dynamics with incomplete data, in this paper, we propose a novel method called spatio-temporal imputation via kernel-based learning (STI-KL). Specifically, we infer the missing data by determining the location-specific correlations of dynamically changing disease-related risk factors. The spatio-temporal correlations of the target variable are inferred from various disease-related risk factors and geographic distances. To integrate the spatio-temporal learning processes, we develop an alternating algorithm to update the model parameters. Extensive experiments in real-world malaria surveillance and on a systematically designed synthetic dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
