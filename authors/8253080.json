            "abstract": "Frequent meteorological disasters present new challenges for decision-making in disaster response. As a timely and effective source of intelligent information, social media plays a vital role in detecting and monitoring these situations. Meteorological social briefings summarize valuable information from numerous social media posts, providing essential decision-support services. This article proposes a multi-knowledge-enhanced summarization (MKES) model for automatically generating meteorological social briefing content from multiple Sina Weibo posts. The MKES model consists of a summary generation module and a knowledge enhancement module. The knowledge enhancement module guides and constrains the summary generation process using meteorological events and geographical location knowledge, resulting in summaries that focus on describing specific knowledge from the source text. The MKES model outperforms baseline models in content evaluation, as measured by <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {ROUGE-1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {ROUGE-2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {ROUGE-L}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> scores, and in sentiment evaluation, as measured by <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F_{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> scores. Based on the MKES model, a framework for generating meteorological social briefings is developed, providing decision support services for the China Meteorological Administration (CMA).",

            "abstract": "Tuples extraction is a fundamental task for information extraction and knowledge graph construction. The extracted tuples are usually represented as knowledge triples consisting of subject, relation, and object. In practice, however, the validity of knowledge triples is associated with and changes with the spatial, temporal, or other kinds of constraints. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a constrained tuple extraction (CTE) task to guarantee the validity of knowledge tuples. Formally, the CTE task is to extract constrained tuples from unstructured text, which adds constraints to conventional triples. To this end, we propose an interaction-aware network. Combinatorial interactions among context-specific external features and distinct-granularity internal features are exploited to effectively mine the potential constraints. Moreover, we have built a new dataset containing totally 1,748,826 constrained tuples for training and 3656 ones for evaluation. Experiments on our dataset and the public CaRB dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. The constructed dataset and the codes are publicly available.",

            "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD), including single-vehicle intelligent AD and vehicle\u2013infrastructure cooperative AD, has become a current research hot spot in academia and industry, and multi-sensor fusion is a fundamental task for AD system perception. However, the multi-sensor fusion process faces the problem of differences in the type and dimensionality of sensory data acquired using different sensors (cameras, lidar, millimeter-wave radar, and so on) as well as differences in the performance of environmental perception caused by using different fusion strategies. In this article, we study multiple papers on multi-sensor fusion in the field of AD and address the problem that the category division in current multi-sensor fusion perception is not detailed and clear enough and is more subjective, which makes the classification strategies differ significantly among similar algorithms. We innovatively propose a multi-sensor fusion taxonomy, which divides the fusion perception classification strategies into two categories\u2014symmetric fusion and asymmetric fusion\u2014and seven subcategories of strategy combinations, such as data, features, and results. In addition, the reliability of current AD perception is limited by its insufficient environment perception capability and the robustness of data-driven methods in dealing with extreme situations (e.g., blind areas). This article also summarizes the innovative applications of multi-sensor fusion classification strategies in AD cooperative perception.",

            "abstract": "Recently, frequency transformation (FT) has been increasingly incorporated into deep learning models to significantly enhance state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency in time series analysis. The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations in the field are. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.",

            "abstract": "Current evidence indicates that the semantic representation of question and answer sentences is better generated by deep neural network-based sentence models than traditional methods in community answer selection tasks. In particular, as a widely recognized language model, the self-attention model computes the similarity between the specific word and the whole sets of words in the same sentence and generates new semantic representation through the similarity-weighted summation of semantic representations of the whole words. However, the self-attention operation entirely considers all the signals with a weighted sum operation, which disperses the distribution of attention, which may result in overlooking the relation of neighboring signals. This issue becomes serious when applying the self-attention model to online community question answering platforms because of the varied length of the user-generated questions and answers. To address this problem, we introduce an attention mechanism enhanced local self-attention (LSA), which restricts the range of original self-attention by a local window mechanism, thereby scaling linearly when increasing the sequence length. Furthermore, we propose stacking multiple LSA layers to model the relationship of multiscale $n$ -gram features. It captures the word-to-word relationship in the first layer and then captures the chunk-to-chunk (such as lexical $n$ -gram phrases) relationship in its deeper layers. We also test the effectiveness of the proposed model by applying the learned representation through the LSA model to a Siamese and a classification network in community question answer selection tasks. Experiments on the public datasets show that the proposed LSA achieves a good performance.",

            "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have received unprecedented attention, in which learners can obtain a large number of learning objects anytime and anywhere. However, the increasing information overload on MOOCs inhibits the appropriate choice of learning objects by learners, leading to a low efficiency and high dropout rates in the learning process of this human-computer interaction scenario. E-learning recommendation systems have been studied to present learning objects directly to learners, thereby relieving such problem. However, in MOOC platforms, recommendation network structures which can selectively extract implicit feature such as heterogeneous learning preference and knowledge organization of learning objects are still not comprehensively studied. To this end, we propose a learning object recommendation model based on heterogeneous learning behavior and knowledge graph. To generate a unified representation of each entity and relation, we first propose an Attentive Composition based Graph Convolutional Network (ACGCN). By introducing an attention mechanism, information is amplified when updating the representation of the heterogeneous graph, which eliminates the impact of noise and improves the robustness of the model. Then, a Dense Feature based Operation-Aware Network (DFOAN) is utilized to capture implicit and complex learners\u2019 interactive behaviors, and to further provide a recommendation. Experimental results using two real-world datasets revealed that our proposed model has the best precision, recall, F1, and accuracy scores compared to those of several existing models.",

However, previous works directly utilized the features extracted from multimodal data, in which the noise reduction within and among multiple modalities has been largely ignored before multimodal fusion. This paper proposes a multi-level attention map network (MAMN) to filter noise before multimodal fusion and capture the consistent and heterogeneous correlations among multi-granularity features for multimodal sentiment analysis. Architecturally, MAMN is comprised of three modules: multi-granularity feature extraction module, multi-level attention map generation module, and attention map fusion module. The first module is designed to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features from multimodal data. The second module is constructed to filter noise and enhance the representation ability for multi-granularity features before multimodal fusion. And the third module is built to extensibly mine the interactions among multi-level attention maps by the proposed extensible co-attention fusion method. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets show the proposed model is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two tasks of document-based and aspect-based MSA tasks.",

            "title": "Application of Social Sensors in Natural Disasters Emergency Management: A Review",
            "abstract": "Natural disasters are public emergencies characterized by suddenness, universality, and nonconventionality. Realizing the early warning, monitoring, and intervention of natural disasters and their derivative social impacts is significant for reducing the disasters\u2019 damage and benefits the maintenance of social stability. Social sensors are ubiquitous sensors based on social network platforms. It uses the concepts and methods of physical space to mine social signals that integrate human perception and intelligence in cyberspace. Compared with traditional physical sensors, social sensors represent a crucial data acquisition channel in the emergency management of natural disasters and have the advantages of real time, comprehensive coverage, low cost, and flexible deployment. This article reviews the application of social sensors in natural disasters emergency management. We summarize the application functions of social sensors into three categories: natural disaster situation awareness and event detection, disaster information dissemination and communication, and disaster sentiment analysis and public opinion mining. Based on the above functions, this article analyzes the research status, data, technical methods, and application systems. Finally, this article proposes a research trend of applying social sensors in natural disaster emergency management according to the requirements of real scenarios.",

            "title": "University Academic Performance Development Prediction Based on TDA",
            "abstract": "With the rapid development of higher education, the evaluation of the academic growth potential of universities has received extensive attention from scholars and educational administrators. Although the number of papers on university academic evaluation is increasing, few scholars have conducted research on the changing trend of university academic performance. Because traditional statistical methods and deep learning techniques have proven to be incapable of handling short time series data well, this paper proposes to adopt topological data analysis (TDA) to extract specified features from short time series data and then construct the model for the prediction of trend of university academic performance. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments on a real-world university academic performance dataset. By comparing the prediction results given by the Markov chain as well as SVM on the original data and TDA statistics, respectively, we demonstrate that the data generated by TDA methods can help construct very discriminative models and have a great advantage over the traditional models. In addition, this paper gives the prediction results as a reference, which provides a new perspective for the development evaluation of the academic performance of colleges and universities.",
