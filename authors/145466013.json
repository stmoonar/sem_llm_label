            "abstract": "Advanced manufacturing creates increasingly complex objects with material compositions that are often difficult to characterize by a single modality. Our collaborating domain scientists are going beyond traditional methods by employing both X-ray and neutron computed tomography to obtain complementary representations expected to better resolve material boundaries. However, the use of two modalities creates its own challenges for visualization, requiring either complex adjustments of bimodal transfer functions or the need for multiple views. Together with experts in nondestructive evaluation, we designed a novel interactive bimodal visualization approach to create a combined view of the co-registered X-ray and neutron acquisitions of industrial objects. Using an automatic topological segmentation of the bivariate histogram of X-ray and neutron values as a starting point, the system provides a simple yet effective interface to easily create, explore, and adjust a bimodal visualization. We propose a widget with simple brushing interactions that enables the user to quickly correct the segmented histogram results. Our semiautomated system enables domain experts to intuitively explore large bimodal datasets without the need for either advanced segmentation algorithms or knowledge of visualization techniques. We demonstrate our approach using synthetic examples, industrial phantom objects created to stress bimodal scanning techniques, and real-world objects, and we discuss expert feedback.",

            "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) are an emerging capability in additive manufacturing (AM), set to revolutionize design optimization, inspection, in situ monitoring, and root cause analysis. AM DTs typically incorporate multimodal data streams, ranging from machine toolpaths and in-process imaging to X-ray CT scans and performance metrics. Despite the evolution of DT platforms, challenges remain in effectively inspecting them for actionable insights, either individually or in a multidisciplinary team setting. Quality assurance, manufacturing departments, pilot labs, and plant operations must collaborate closely to reliably produce parts at scale. This is particularly crucial in AM where complex structures require a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach. Additionally, the large-scale data originating from different modalities and their inherent 3D nature pose significant hurdles for traditional 2D desktop-based inspection methods. To address these challenges and increase the value proposition of DTs, we introduce a novel virtual reality (VR) framework to facilitate collaborative and real-time inspection of DTs in AM. This framework includes advanced features for intuitive alignment and visualization of multimodal data, visual occlusion management, streaming large-scale volumetric data, and collaborative tools, substantially improving the inspection of AM components and processes to fully exploit the potential of DTs in AM.",

            "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have been used to enhance the design and fabrication of complex components for various applications in the medical, aerospace, energy, and consumer products industries. A defining feature for many AM parts is the complex internal geometry enabled by the printing process. However, inspecting these internal structures requires volumetric imaging, i.e., X-ray CT, leading to the well-known challenge of visualizing complex 3D geometries using 2D desktop interfaces. Furthermore, existing tools are limited to single-user systems making it difficult to jointly discuss or share findings with a larger team, i.e., the designers, manufacturing experts, and evaluation team. In this work, we present a collaborative virtual reality (VR) for the exploration and inspection of AM parts. Geographically separated experts can virtually inspect and jointly discuss data. It also supports VR and non-VR users, who can be spectators in the VR environment. Various features for data exploration and inspection are developed and enhanced via real-time synchronization. We followed usability and interface verification guidelines using Nielsen\u2019s heuristics approach. Furthermore, we conducted exploratory and semi-structured interviews with domain experts to collect qualitative feedback. Results reveal potential benefits, applicability, and current limitations. The proposed collaborative VR environment provides a new basis and opens new research directions for virtual inspection and team collaboration in AM settings.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have substantially improved its predictive and computational abilities, offering promising opportunities for surrogate modeling in scientific applications. By accurately approximating complex functions with low computational cost, ML-based surrogates can accelerate scientific applications by replacing computationally intensive components with faster model inference. However, integrating ML models into these applications remains a significant challenge, hindering the widespread adoption of ML surrogates as an approximation technique in modern scientific computing. We propose an easy-to-use directive-based programming model that enables developers to seamlessly describe the use of ML models in scientific applications. The runtime support, as instructed by the programming model, performs data assimilation using the original algorithm and can replace the algorithm with model inference. Our evaluation across five benchmarks, testing over 5000 ML models, shows up to 83.6x speed improvements with minimal accuracy loss (as low as 0.01 RMSE).",

Compared to existing work on LLM\u2010based visualization works that generate and control visualization with textual input and output only, the proposed approach explores the utilization of the visual processing ability of multi\u2010modal LLMs to develop Autonomous Visualization Agents (AVAs) that can evaluate the generated visualization and iterate on the result to accomplish user\u2010defined objectives defined through natural language. We propose the first framework for the design of AVAs and present several usage scenarios intended to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed paradigm. Our preliminary exploration and proof\u2010of\u2010concept agents suggest that this approach can be widely applicable whenever the choices of appropriate visualization parameters require the interpretation of previous visual output. Our study indicates that AVAs represent a general paradigm for designing intelligent visualization systems that can achieve high\u2010level visualization goals, which pave the way for developing expert\u2010level visualization agents in the future.",

This has driven the need for tools to audit trained networks in human intelligible format, for example, to identify biases or ensure fairness. Existing GAN audit tools are restricted to coarse-grained, modeldata comparisons based on summary statistics such as FID or recall. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that compares a newly developed GAN against a prior baseline. To this end, we introduce Cross-GAN Auditing (xGA) that, given an established \u201creference\u201d GAN and a newly proposed \u201cclient\u201d GAN, jointly identifies intelligible attributes that are either common across both GANs, novel to the client GAN, or missing from the client GAN. This provides both users and model developers an intuitive assessment of similarity and differences between GANs. We introduce novel metrics to evaluate attribute-based GAN auditing approaches and use these metrics to demonstrate quantitatively that xGA outperforms baseline approaches. We also include qualitative results that illustrate the common, novel and missing attributes identified by xGA from GANs trained on a variety of image datasets 1",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "We develop an on-the-fly reduced-order model (ROM) integrated with a flow simulation, gradually replacing a corresponding full-order model (FOM) of a physics solver. Unlike offline methods requiring a separate FOM-only simulation prior to model reduction, our approach constructs a ROM dynamically during the simulation, replacing the FOM when deemed credible. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is employed for online ROM construction, with a single snapshot vector used for rank-1 updates in each iteration. Demonstrated on a flow over a cylinder with Re = 100, our hybrid FOM/ROM simulation is verified in terms of the Strouhal number, resulting in a 4.4 times speedup compared to the FOM solver.",
