            "title": "Causal Distillation for Alleviating Performance Heterogeneity in Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Recommendation performance usually exhibits a long-tail distribution over users \u2014 a small portion of head users enjoy much more accurate recommendation services than the others. We reveal two sources of this performance heterogeneity problem: the uneven distribution of historical interactions (a natural source); and the biased training of recommender models (a model source). As addressing this problem cannot sacrifice the overall performance, a wise choice is to eliminate the model bias while maintaining the natural heterogeneity. The key to debiased training lies in eliminating the effect of confounders that influence both the user's historical behaviors and the next behavior. The emerging causal recommendation methods achieve this by modeling the causal effect between user behaviors, however potentially neglect unobserved confounders (e.g., friend suggestions) that are hard to measure in practice. To address unobserved confounders, we resort to the front-door adjustment (FDA) in causal theory and propose a causal multi-teacher distillation framework (CausalD). FDA requires proper mediators in order to estimate the causal effects of historical behaviors on the next behavior. To achieve this, we equip CausalD with multiple heterogeneous recommendation models to model the mediator distribution. Then, the causal effect estimated by FDA is the expectation of recommendation prediction over the mediator distribution and the prior distribution of historical behaviors, which is technically achieved by multi-teacher ensemble. To pursue efficient inference, CausalD further distills multiple teachers into one student model to directly infer the causal effect for making recommendations. We instantiate CausalD on two representative models, DeepFM and DIN, and conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which validate the superiority of CausalD over state-of-the-art methods. Through in-depth analysis, we find that CausalD largely improves the performance of tail users, reduces the performance heterogeneity, and enhances the overall performance.",

            "title": "Personalized Latent Structure Learning for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In recommender systems, users\u2019 behavior data are driven by the interactions of user-item latent factors. To improve recommendation effectiveness and robustness, recent advances focus on latent factor disentanglement via variational inference. Despite significant progress, uncovering the underlying interactions, i.e., dependencies of latent factors, remains largely neglected by the literature. To bridge the gap, we investigate the joint disentanglement of user-item latent factors and the dependencies between them, namely latent structure learning. We propose to analyze the problem from the causal perspective, where a latent structure should ideally reproduce observational interaction data, and satisfy the structure acyclicity and dependency constraints, i.e., causal prerequisites. We further identify the recommendation-specific challenges for latent structure learning, i.e., the subjective nature of users\u2019 minds and the inaccessibility of private/sensitive user factors causing universally learned latent structure to be suboptimal for individuals. To address these challenges, we propose the personalized latent structure learning framework for recommendation, namely PlanRec, which incorporates 1) differentiable Reconstruction, Dependency, and Acyclicity regularizations to satisfy the causal prerequisites; 2) Personalized Structure Learning (PSL) which personalizes the universally learned dependencies through probabilistic modeling; and 3) uncertainty estimation which explicitly measures the uncertainty of structure personalization, and adaptively balances personalization and shared knowledge for different users. We conduct extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets from MovieLens and Amazon, and a large-scale industrial dataset from Alipay. Empirical studies validate that PlanRec discovers effective shared/personalized structures, and successfully balances shared knowledge and personalization via rational uncertainty estimation.",

            "abstract": "Feed recommendation allows users to constantly browse items until feel uninterested and leave the session, which differs from traditional recommendation scenarios. Within a session, user's decision to continue browsing or not substantially affects occurrences of later clicks. However, such type of exposure bias is generally ignored or not explicitly modeled in most feed recommendation studies. In this paper, we model this effect as part of intra-session context, and propose a novel intra-session Context-aware Feed Recommendation (INSCAFER) framework to maximize the total views and total clicks simultaneously. User click and browsing decisions are jointly learned by a multi-task setting, and the intra-session context is encoded by the session-wise exposed item sequence. We deploy our model on Alipay with all key business benchmarks improved. Our method sheds some lights on feed recommendation studies which aim to optimize session-level click and view metrics.",
