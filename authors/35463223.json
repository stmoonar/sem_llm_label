            "abstract": "This paper describes our broad goal of linking tabular data to semantic knowledge graphs, as well as our specific attempts at solving the Semantic Web Challenge on Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching. Our efforts were split into a Candidate Generation and a Candidate Selection phase. The former involves searching for relevant entities in knowledge bases, while the latter involves picking the top candidate using various techniques such as heuristics (the \u2018TF-IDF\u2019 approach) and machine learning (the Neural Network Ranking model). We achieve an F1 score of 0.826 without any training data on the 400000+ cells to be annotated in Round 2 CEA challenge. On CTA and CPA variants, we score 1.099 and 0.790 respectively.",

            "abstract": "The OpenAirInterface(OAI) is an open-source software implementation of 4th generation mobile cellular system. It emulates the core network of telecommunication, access network and user equipment of 3GPP cellular networks. Installation of OpenAirInterface is a tedious task as a number of steps need to be manually done for the configuration process. This makes it very difficult to use the software. With this project, we aim to make it easier to install the OAI for users on different Linux distros. We have implemented the entire OAI stack using Linux network namespaces. Thus, each OAI component runs in a separate, isolated network namespace, on a single physical machine, as against two machines required earlier. Network namespaces are a cheap and efficient way of virtualizing the network as against using Virtual Machines. In this way, time and efforts of the first time users/contributors of OAI in setting it up on their own machine is reduced, enhancing their research capability.",

            "abstract": "Songs, as a medium of expression, have always been a popular choice to depict and understand human emotions. Reliable emotion based classification systems can go a long way in helping us parse their meaning. However, research in the field of emotion-based music classification has not yielded optimal results. In this paper, we present an affective cross-platform music player, EMP, which recommends music based on the real-time mood of the user. EMP provides smart mood based music recommendation by incorporating the capabilities of emotion context reasoning within our adaptive music recommendation system. Our music player contains three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use of deep learning algorithms to identify their mood with an accuracy of 90.23%. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to achieve a remarkable result of 97.69% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes. The Recommendation Module suggests songs to the user by mapping their emotions to the mood type of the song, taking into consideration the preferences of the user.",
