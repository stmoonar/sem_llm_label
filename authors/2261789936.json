            "abstract": "Recommender systems rely on user-item interactions to learn Collaborative Filtering (CF) signals and easily under-recommend the cold-start items without historical interactions. To boost cold-start item recommendation, previous studies usually incorporate item features (e.g., micro-video content features) into CF models. They essentially align the feature representations of warm-start items with CF representations during training, and then adopt the feature representations of cold-start items to make recommendations. However, cold-start items might have feature distribution shifts from warm-start ones due to different upload times. As such, these cold-start item features fall into the underrepresented feature space, where their feature representations cannot align well with CF signals, causing poor cold-start recommendation. To combat item feature shifts, the key lies in pushing feature representation learning to well represent the shifted item features and align with the CF representations in the underrepresented feature space. To this end, we propose an equivariant learning framework, which aims to achieve equivariant alignment between item features, feature representations, and CF representations in the underrepresented feature space. Specifically, since cold-start items are unavailable for training, we interpolate the features and CF representations of two underrepresented warm items to simulate the feature shifts. The interpolated feature representations are then regulated to achieve equivariant alignment with the interpolated features and CF representations via three alignment losses. We instantiate the proposed framework on two competitive cold-start models, and empirical results on three datasets validate that the framework significantly improves cold-start recommendation.",
