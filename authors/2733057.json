            "abstract": "Deep recommender systems (DRS) are critical for current commercial online service providers, which address the issue of information overload by recommending items that are tailored to the user\u2019s interests and preferences. They have unprecedented feature representations effectiveness and the capacity of modeling the non-linear relationships be-tween users and items. Despite their advancements, DRS models, like other deep learning models, employ sophisticated neural network architectures and other vital components that are typically designed and tuned by human experts. This article will give a comprehensive summary of automated machine learning (AutoML) for developing DRS models. We \ufb01rst provide an overview of AutoML for DRS models and the related techniques. Then we discuss the state-of-the-art AutoML approaches that automate the feature selection, feature embeddings, feature interactions, and system design in DRS. Finally, we discuss appealing research directions and summarize the survey.",

            "title": "DRL4IR: 2nd Workshop on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Modern information retrieval (IR) consists of a series of processes, including query expansion, candidate item recall, item ranking, item re-ranking, etc. The final ranked item list will be exposed to the user, which will accordingly provide feedback through some expected actions such as browsing and click. Such a whole process can be formulated as a decision-making process where the agent is the IR system while the environment is the specific user. This decision-making process can be one-step or sequential, depending on the scenarios or the ways of problem formulation. Since 2013, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been a fast-developing technique for decision-making tasks. The high capacity of deep learning models is incorporated in the reinforcement learning framework so that the agent may successfully handle complex decision-making. In recent years, there have been a bunch of publications attempting to leverage DRL techniques for different IR tasks such as ad hoc retrieval, learning to rank and interactive recommendation. Nonetheless, the fundamental theory, the principle of RL methods or the recognized experimental protocols of decision-making in IR, has not been well developed, making it challenging to evaluate the correctness of a proposed method or judge whether the reported experimental performance is valid. We propose the second DRL4IR workshop at SIGIR 2021, which provides a venue to gather the academia researchers and industry practitioners to present the recent progress of DRL techniques for IR. More importantly, people in this workshop are expected to discuss more about the fundamental principles of formulating a decision-making IR task, the underlying theory as well as the practical effectiveness of the experiment protocol design, which would foster further research on novel methodologies, innovative experimental findings and new applications of DRL for information retrieval. DRL4IR organized at SIGIR'20 was one of the most popular workshops and attracted over 200 conference attendees. In this year, we will pay more attention to fundamental research topics and recent applications, and expect about 300 participants.",

            "abstract": "Practical large-scale recommender systems usually contain thousands of feature fields from users, items, contextual information, and their interactions. Most of them empirically allocate a unified dimension to all feature fields, which is memory inefficient. Thus it is highly desired to assign various embedding dimensions to different feature fields according to their importance and predictability. Due to the large amounts of feature fields and the nuanced relationship between embedding dimensions with feature distributions and neural network architectures, manually allocating embedding dimensions in practical recommender systems can be challenging. To this end, we propose an AutoML-based framework (AutoDim) in this paper, which can automatically select dimensions for different feature fields in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we first proposed an end-to-end differentiable framework that can calculate the weights over various dimensions in a soft and continuous manner for feature fields, and an AutoML-based optimization algorithm; then, we derive a hard and discrete embedding component architecture according to the maximal weights and retrain the whole recommender framework. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of AutoDim.",

            "abstract": "\u2014Recommender systems aim to provide personalized services to users and are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The key of recommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items based on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart, purchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite graph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning, these GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the recommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based recommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable behaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions, which can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we investigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness) of existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we propose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled designs that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and understand the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our implementation and datasets can be released after publication.",

            "abstract": "Graph self-supervised learning has gained increasing attention due to its capacity to learn expressive node representations. Many pretext tasks, or loss functions have been designed from distinct perspectives. However, we observe that different pretext tasks affect downstream tasks differently cross datasets, which suggests that searching pretext tasks is crucial for graph self-supervised learning. Different from existing works focusing on designing single pretext tasks, this work aims to investigate how to automatically leverage multiple pretext tasks effectively. Nevertheless, evaluating representations derived from multiple pretext tasks without direct access to ground truth labels makes this problem challenging. To address this obstacle, we make use of a key principle of many real-world graphs, i.e., homophily, or the principle that\"like attracts like,\"as the guidance to effectively search various self-supervised pretext tasks. We provide theoretical understanding and empirical evidence to justify the flexibility of homophily in this search task. Then we propose the AutoSSL framework which can automatically search over combinations of various self-supervised tasks. By evaluating the framework on 7 real-world datasets, our experimental results show that AutoSSL can significantly boost the performance on downstream tasks including node clustering and node classification compared with training under individual tasks.

            "abstract": "Sequential decision-making under cost-sensitive tasks is prohibitively daunting, especially for the problem that has a significant impact on people's daily lives, such as malaria control, treatment recommendation. The main challenge faced by policymakers is to learn a policy from scratch by interacting with a complex environment in a few trials. This work introduces a practical, data-efficient policy learning method, named Variance-Bonus Monte Carlo Tree Search~(VB-MCTS), which can copy with very little data and facilitate learning from scratch in only a few trials. Specifically, the solution is a model-based reinforcement learning method. To avoid model bias, we apply Gaussian Process~(GP) regression to estimate the transitions explicitly. With the GP world model, we propose a variance-bonus reward to measure the uncertainty about the world. Adding the reward to the planning with MCTS can result in more efficient and effective exploration. Furthermore, the derived polynomial sample complexity indicates that VB-MCTS is sample efficient. Finally, outstanding performance on a competitive world-level RL competition and extensive experimental results verify its advantage over the state-of-the-art on the challenging malaria control task.",

            "abstract": "Designing an effective loss function plays a crucial role in training deep recommender systems. Most existing works often leverage a predefined and fixed loss function that could lead to suboptimal recommendation quality and training efficiency. Some recent efforts rely on exhaustively or manually searched weights to fuse a group of candidate loss functions, which is exceptionally costly in computation and time. They also neglect the various convergence behaviors of different data examples. In this work, we propose an AutoLoss framework that can automatically and adaptively search for the appropriate loss function from a set of candidates. To be specific, we develop a novel controller network, which can dynamically adjust the loss probabilities in a differentiable manner. Unlike existing algorithms, the proposed controller can adaptively generate the loss probabilities for different data examples according to their varied convergence behaviors. Such design improves the model's generalizability and transferability between deep recommender systems and datasets. We evaluate the proposed framework on two benchmark datasets. The results show that AutoLoss outperforms representative baselines. Further experiments have been conducted to deepen our understandings of AutoLoss, including its transferability, components and training efficiency.",

            "abstract": "With the recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL), there have been tremendous interests in employing RL for recommender systems. However, directly training and evaluating a new RL-based recommendation algorithm needs to collect users\u2019 real-time feedback in the real system, which is time/effort consuming and could negatively impact users\u2019 experiences. Thus, it calls for a user simulator that can mimic real users\u2019 behaviors to pre-train and evaluate new recommendation algorithms. Simulating users\u2019 behaviors in a dynamic system faces immense challenges \u2013 (i) the underlying item distribution is complex, and (ii) historical logs for each user are limited. In this paper, we develop a user simulator based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To be specific, the generator captures the underlying distribution of users\u2019 historical logs and generates realistic logs that can be considered as augmentations of real logs; while the discriminator not only distinguishes real and fake logs but also predicts users\u2019 behaviors. The experimental results based on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed simulator.",

            "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great casualties and becomes almost the most urgent public health events worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) is a significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automated segmentation of lung infection in COVID-19 CT images will greatly assist diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections remains to be challenging. In this paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual attention mechanism to address the issues above. We introduce a dilated convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive field, which refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we present a dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are inserted to skip connection and model decoder respectively. The dual attention mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce semantic gap between different levels of the model. The proposed method has been evaluated on open-source dataset and outperforms cutting edges methods in semantic segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves a Dice score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified D2A U-Net without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other models trained from scratch, which still outperforms popular U-Net family models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626. Our experiment results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual attention mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which improves sensitivity to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant increase to Dice score.",
