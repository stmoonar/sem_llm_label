            "title": "Graph Neural Network for Higher-Order Dependency Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) has become a popular tool to analyze the graph data. Existing GNNs only focus on networks with first-order dependency, that is, conventional networks following the Markov property. However, many networks in real life own the higher-order dependency, such as click-stream data where the choice of the next page depends not only on the current page but also on previous pages. This kind of sequential data from complex systems (including natural dependencies) are often ignored by existing GNNs which makes them ineffective. To address this problem, we propose for the first time new GNN approaches for higher-order networks in this paper. First, we form sequence fragments by the current node and its predecessor nodes of different orders as candidate higher-order dependencies. When the fragment significantly affects the probability distribution of different successor nodes of the current node, we include it in the higher-order dependency set. We formulize the network with higher-order dependency as an augmented conventional first-order network, and then feed it into GNNs to derive network embeddings. Moreover, we further propose a new end-to-end GNN framework for dealing with higher-order networks directly in the model. Specifically, the higher-order dependency is used as the neighbor aggregation controller when the node is embedded and updated. In the graph convolutional layer, in addition to the first-order neighbor information, we also aggregate the middle node information from the higher-order dependency segment. We finally test the new approaches on three real networks with higher-order dependency, and compare with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show significant improvements of the new approaches which consider higher-order dependency.",

TM-ZC used the one-hot code and the PSSM as input features for a convolutional neural network (CNN) regression model. The experimental results demonstrated that TM-ZC was a powerful predictor, which is simple and fast, and achieved a considerable performance: the average error was 1.958, the percent of prediction error within 3\u00c5 was 77.461%, and the correlation coefficient (CC) was 0.922. We further discussed the usefulness of TM-ZC predicted z-coordinate and found its high consistency with topology structure and the enhancement of the surface accessibility prediction.",

            "abstract": "Transmembrane proteins (TMPs) play vital and diverse roles in many biological processes, such as molecular transportation and immune response. Like other proteins, many major interactions with other molecules happen in TMPs\u2019 surface area, which is important for function annotation and drug discovery. Under the condition that the structure of TMP is hard to derive from experiment and prediction, it is a practical way to predict the TMP residues\u2019 surface area, measured by the relative accessible surface area (rASA), based on computational methods. In this study, we presented a novel deep learning-based predictor TMP-SSurface for both alpha-helical and beta-barrel transmembrane proteins (\u03b1-TMP and \u03b2-TMP), where convolutional neural network (CNN), inception blocks, and CapsuleNet were combined to construct a network framework, simply accepting one-hot code and position-specific score matrix (PSSM) of protein fragment as inputs. TMP-SSurface was tested against an independent dataset achieving appreciable performance with 0.584 Pearson correlation coefficients (CC) value. As the first TMP\u2019s rASA predictor utilizing the deep neural network, our method provided a referenceable sample for the community, as well as a practical step to discover the interaction sites of TMPs based on their sequence.",
