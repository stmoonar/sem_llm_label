            "abstract": "Estimating all pairs of distances among a set of objects has wide applicability in various computational problems in databases, machine learning, and statistics. This work presents a probabilistic framework for estimating all pair distances through crowdsourcing, where the human workers are involved to provide distance between some object pairs. Since the workers are subject to error, their responses are considered with a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, the framework comprises of three problems : (1) Given multiple feedback on an object pair, how do we combine and aggregate those feedback and create a probability distribution of the distance? (2) Since the number of possible pairs is quadratic in the number of objects, how do we estimate, from the known feedback for a small numbers of object pairs, the unknown distances among all other object pairs? For this problem, we leverage the metric property of distance, in particular, the triangle inequality property in a probabilistic settings. (3) Finally, how do we improve our estimate by soliciting additional feedback from the crowd? For all three problems, we present principled modeling and solutions. We experimentally evaluate our proposed framework by involving multiple real-world and large scale synthetic data, by enlisting workers from a crowdsourcing platform.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative crowdsourcing is an emerging paradigm where a set of workers, often with diverse and complementary skills, form groups and work together to complete complex tasks. While crowdsourcing has been used successfully in many applications, collaboration is essential for achieving a high quality outcome for a number of emerging applications such as text translation, citizen journalism and surveillance tasks. However, no crowdsourcing platform today enables the end-to-end deployment of collaborative tasks. We demonstrate Crowd4U, a volunteer-based system that enables the deployment of diverse crowdsourcing tasks with complex data-flows, in a declarative manner. In addition to treating workers and tasks as rich entities, Crowd4U also provides an easy-to-use form-based task UI. Crowd4U implements worker-to-task assignment algorithms that are appropriate for each kind of task. Once workers are assigned to tasks, appropriate worker collaboration schemes are enforced in order to enable effective result coordination.",

We intend to recommend tasks to the workers by exploiting the implicit interactions, and the presence or absence of explicit features in the tasks. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem, propose two alternative problem formulations and respective solutions that exploit implicit feedback, explicit features, as well as similarity between the tasks.

Central to any collaborative crowdsourcing process is the aspect of successful collaboration among the workers, which, for the first time, is formalized and then optimized in this work. Our formalism considers two main collaboration-related human factors, affinity and upper critical mass, appropriately adapted from organizational science and social theories. Our contributions are (a) proposing a comprehensive model for collaborative crowdsourcing optimization, (b) rigorous theoretical analyses to understand the hardness of the proposed problems, (c) an array of efficient exact and approximation algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees.

In this work, we investigate how to estimate individual worker's skill based on the outcome of the team-based tasks they have undertaken. We consider two popular skill aggregation functions and estimate the skill of the workers, where skill is either a deterministic value or a probability distribution.

We refer to each of the distinct attribute values as a feature. We also assume that we have information about the interactions (such as visits or likes) between a set of users and those items. In our paper, we would like to rank the features of an item using user-item interactions. For instance, if the items are movies, features could be actors, directors or genres, and user-item interaction could be user liking the movie. These information could be used to identify the most important actors for each movie. While users are drawn to an item due to a subset of its features, a user-item interaction only provides an expression of user preference over the entire item, and not its component features. We design algorithms to rank the features of an item depending on whether interaction information is available at aggregated or individual level granularity and extend them to rank composite features (set of features). Our algorithms are based on constrained least squares, network flow and non-trivial adaptations to non-negative matrix factorization. We evaluate our algorithms using both real-world and synthetic datasets.",

            "abstract": "We assume a dataset of transactions generated by a set of users over structured items where each item could be described through a set of features. In this paper, we are interested in identifying the frequent featuresets (set of features) by mining item transactions. For example, in a news website, items correspond to news articles, the features are the named-entities/topics in the articles and an item transaction would be the set of news articles read by a user within the same session. We show that mining frequent featuresets over structured item transactions is a novel problem and show that straightforward extensions of existing frequent itemset mining techniques provide unsatisfactory results. This is due to the fact that while users are drawn to each item in the transaction due to a subset of its features, the transaction by itself does not provide any information about such underlying preferred features of users. In order to overcome this hurdle, we propose a featureset uncertainty model where each item transaction could have been generated by various featuresets with different probabilities. We describe a novel approach to transform item transactions into uncertain transaction over featuresets and estimate their probabilities using constrained least squares based approach. We propose diverse algorithms to mine frequent featuresets. Our experimental evaluation provides a comparative analysis of the different approaches proposed.",

This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.",

            "abstract": "Given the sheer amount of work and expertise required in authoring Wikipedia articles, automatic tools that help Wikipedia contributors in generating and improving content are valuable. This paper presents our initial step towards building a full-fledged author assistant, particularly for suggesting infobox templates for articles. We build SVM classifiers to suggest infobox template types, among a large number of possible types, to Wikipedia articles without infoboxes. Different from prior works on Wikipedia article classification which deal with only a few label classes for named entity recognition, the much larger 337-class setup in our study is geared towards realistic deployment of infobox suggestion tool. We also emphasize testing on articles without infoboxes, due to that labeled and unlabeled data exhibit different distributions of features, which departs from the typical assumption that they are drawn from the same underlying population.",
