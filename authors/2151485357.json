            "title": "Seed-Guided Topic Discovery with Out-of-Vocabulary Seeds",
            "abstract": "Discovering latent topics from text corpora has been studied for decades. Many existing topic models adopt a fully unsupervised setting, and their discovered topics may not cater to users\u2019 particular interests due to their inability of leveraging user guidance. Although there exist seed-guided topic discovery approaches that leverage user-provided seeds to discover topic-representative terms, they are less concerned with two factors: (1) the existence of out-of-vocabulary seeds and (2) the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs). In this paper, we generalize the task of seed-guided topic discovery to allow out-of-vocabulary seeds. We propose a novel framework, named SeeTopic, wherein the general knowledge of PLMs and the local semantics learned from the input corpus can mutually benefit each other. Experiments on three real datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of SeeTopic in terms of topic coherence, accuracy, and diversity.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes our participation in the faceted blog distillation task at Blog Track 2010. In our approach, indri toolkit is applied for basic topic relevance retrieval. Then the Maximum Entropy (ME) model is adopted to judge the relevance of each blog to specified facet. Feed faceted relevance is calculated by integrating the average relevance of all blogs within a feed and the average relevance of the most relevant N blogs. Two implementations are applied to calculate feed faceted relevance. Experimental results on Blogs08 dataset show the effectiveness of our approach.",
