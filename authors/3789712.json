            "abstract": "With the increase in the business scale and number of domains in online advertising, multi-domain ad recommendation has become a mainstream solution in the industry. The core of multi-domain recommendation is effectively modeling the commonalities and distinctions among domains. Existing works are dedicated to designing model architectures for implicit multi-domain modeling while overlooking an in-depth investigation from a more fundamental perspective of feature distributions. This paper focuses on features with significant differences across various domains in both distributions and effects on model predictions. We refer to these features as domain-sensitive features, which serve as carriers of domain distinctions and are crucial for multi-domain modeling. Experiments demonstrate that existing multi-domain modeling methods may neglect domain-sensitive features, indicating insufficient learning of domain distinctions. To avoid this neglect, we propose a domain-sensitive feature attribution method to identify features that best reflect domain distinctions from the feature set. Further, we design a memory architecture that extracts domain-specific information from domain-sensitive features for the model to retrieve and integrate, thereby enhancing the awareness of domain distinctions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in capturing domain distinctions and improving multi-domain recommendation performance.",

            "abstract": "Feature crosses, which represent joint features synthesized by two single features, are critical for deep recommender systems to model sophisticated feature relations. In practice, only a tiny fraction of feature crosses among massive possible ones are informative, while introducing irrelevant or noisy ones may increase online service latency and boost the risk of overfitting. Therefore, picking high-quality feature crosses is essential in practical recommender systems. However, even for selecting quadratic feature crosses, existing algorithms still incur either o(n2) time complexity or o(n2) space complexity, which is inefficient and unscalable in industrial scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient and accurate quadratic feature cross selection method with both linear time and space complexity. Motivated by the idea of Quasi-Newton methods, we propose to use 2nd-order derivative matrix to evaluate all theoretically possible feature crosses concurrently without the need of constructing them explicitly, where an approximation of 2nd-order gradient is applied to guarantee both low time and space complexity. Furthermore, we decouple the feature crosses' novelty from single features' joint importance. Experiments on two public recommendation datasets and a private dataset validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, and it has also become a fundamental feature cross selection tool used by Huawei Ads Platform.",

            "abstract": "Accurately predicting the probabilities of user feedback, such as clicks and conversions, is critical for advertisement ranking and bidding. However, there often exist unwanted mismatches between predicted probabilities and true likelihoods due to the rapid shift of data distributions and intrinsic model biases. Calibration aims to address this issue by post-processing model predictions, and field-aware calibration can adjust model output on different feature field values to satisfy fine-grained advertising demands. Unfortunately, the observed samples corresponding to certain field values can be seriously limited to make confident calibrations, which may yield bias amplification and online disturbance. In this paper, we propose a confidence-aware multi-field calibration method, which adaptively adjusts the calibration intensity based on confidence levels derived from sample statistics. It also utilizes multiple fields for joint model calibration according to their importance to mitigate the impact of data sparsity on a single field. Extensive offline and online experiments show the superiority of our method in boosting advertising performance and reducing prediction deviations.",

            "abstract": "Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, vanilla MLP networks are inefficient in learning multiplicative feature interactions, making feature interaction learning an essential topic for CTR prediction. Existing feature interaction networks are effective in complementing the learning of MLPs, but they often fall short of the performance of MLPs when applied alone. Thus, their integration with MLP networks is necessary to achieve improved performance. This situation motivates us to explore a better alternative to the MLP backbone that could potentially replace MLPs. Inspired by factorization machines, in this paper, we propose FINAL, a factorized interaction layer that extends the widely-used linear layer and is capable of learning 2nd-order feature interactions. Similar to MLPs, multiple FINAL layers can be stacked into a FINAL block, yielding feature interactions with an exponential degree growth. We unify feature interactions and MLPs into a single FINAL block and empirically show its effectiveness as a replacement for the MLP block. Furthermore, we explore the ensemble of two FINAL blocks as an enhanced two-stream CTR model, setting a new state-of-the-art on open benchmark datasets. FINAL can be easily adopted as a building block and has achieved business metric gains in multiple applications at Huawei.

            "abstract": "CTR and CVR are critical factors in personalized applications, and many methods jointly estimate them via multi-task learning to alleviate the ultra-sparsity of conversion behaviors. However, it is still difficult to predict CVR accurately and robustly due to the limited and even biased knowledge extracted by the single model tower optimized on insufficient conversion samples. In this paper, we propose a task adaptive multi-learner (TAML) framework for joint CTR and CVR prediction. We design a hierarchical task adaptive knowledge representation module with different experts to capture knowledge in different granularities, which can effectively exploit the commonalities between CTR and CVR estimation tasks meanwhile keeping their unique characteristics. We apply multiple learners to extract data knowledge from various views and fuse their predictions to obtain accurate and robust scores. To facilitate knowledge sharing across learners, we further perform self-distillation that uses the fused scores to teach different learners. Thorough offline and online experiments show the superiority of TAML in different Ad ranking tasks, and we have deployed it in Huawei\u2019s online advertising platform to serve the main traffic.",

            "abstract": "Conversion rate prediction is critical to many online applications such as digital display advertising. To capture dynamic data distribution, industrial systems often require retraining models on recent data daily or weekly. However, the delay of conversion behavior usually leads to incorrect labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. Existing work may fail to introduce the correct information about false negative samples due to data sparsity and dynamic data distribution. To directly introduce the correct feedback label information, we propose an Unbiased delayed feedback Label Correction framework (ULC), which uses an auxiliary model to correct labels for observed negative feedback samples. Firstly, we theoretically prove that the label-corrected loss is an unbiased estimate of the oracle loss using true labels. Then, as there are no ready training data for label correction, counterfactual labeling is used to construct artificial training data. Furthermore, since counterfactual labeling utilizes only partial training data, we design an embedding-based alternative training method to enhance performance. Comparative experiments on both public and private datasets and detailed analyses show that our proposed approach effectively alleviates the delayed feedback problem and consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Accurate customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction can help service providers optimize their marketing policies in customer-centric applications. However, the heavy sparsity of consumption events and the interference of data variance and noise obstruct LTV estimation. Many existing LTV prediction methods directly train a single-view LTV predictor on consumption samples, which may yield inaccurate and even biased knowledge extraction. In this paper, we propose a contrastive multi-view framework for LTV prediction, which is a plug-and-play solution compatible with various backbone models. It synthesizes multiple heterogeneous LTV regressors with complementary knowledge to improve model robustness and captures sample relatedness via contrastive learning to mitigate the dependency on data abundance. Concretely, we use a decomposed scheme that converts the LTV prediction problem into a combination of estimating consumption probability and payment amount. To alleviate the impact of noisy data on model learning, we propose a multi-view framework that jointly optimizes multiple types of regressors with diverse characteristics and advantages to encode and fuse comprehensive knowledge. To fully exploit the potential of limited training samples, we propose a hybrid contrastive learning method to help capture the relatedness between samples in both classification and regression tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world game LTV prediction dataset and the results validate the effectiveness of our method. We have deployed our solution online in Huawei's mobile game center and achieved 32.26% of total payment amount gains.",

            "abstract": "The ultimate goal of recommender systems is satisfying users\u2019 information needs in the long term. Despite the success of current recommendation techniques in targeting user interest, optimizing long-term user engagement and platform revenue is still challenging due to the restriction of optimization objectives such as clicks, ratings, and dwell time. Customer lifetime value (LTV) reflects the total monetary value of a customer to a business over the course of their relationship. Accurate LTV prediction can guide personalized service providers to optimize their marketing, sales, and service strategies to maximize customer retention, satisfaction, and profitability. However, the extreme sparsity, volatility, and randomness of consumption behaviors make LTV prediction rather intricate and challenging. In this tutorial, we give a detailed introduction to the key technologies and problems in LTV prediction. We present a systematic technique chronicle of LTV prediction over decades, including probabilistic models, traditional machine learning methods, and deep learning techniques. Based on this overview, we introduce several critical challenges in algorithm design, performance evaluation and system deployment from an industrial perspective, from which we derive potential directions for future exploration. From this tutorial, the RecSys community can gain a better understanding of the unique characteristics and challenges of LTV prediction, and it may serve as a catalyst to shift the focus of recommender systems from short-term targets to long-term ones.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we present the optimal design method of multimodal traffic strategies in emergency evacuations by considering the background traffic. First, the lane use configuration of public-oriented transport in multimodal evacuation that considers the background traffic is presented. Then, the feasible strategies are proposed based on the application conditions of five evacuation traffic strategies in feasible strategy proposal. Furthermore, the feasible strategies are transformed into optimal strategies by using the optimal strategy design model to minimize the weighted sum of public transport, private cars, and background traffic target values. Finally, the previous case study of Wenling is used to discuss the strategy evolution process, compare other strategies, and analyze the sensitivity of weights. The results presented in this work provide a reference for other researchers on the design and formulation of multimodal evacuation traffic strategies.",

            "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to help users find interested news, and how to precisely match users' interests and candidate news lies in the core of news recommendation. Existing studies generally learn user's interest vector by aggregating his/her browsed news and then match it with the candidate news vector, which may lose the textual semantic matching signals for recommendation. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Multi-field Matching (AMM) framework for news recommendation which captures the semantic matching representations between each browsed news and candidate news, and then aggregates them as final user-news matching signal. In addition, our method incorporates multi-field information and designs a within-field and cross-field matching mechanism, which leverages complementary information from different fields (e.g., titles, abstracts and bodies) and obtain the multi-field matching representations. To achieve a comprehensive semantic understanding, we employ the most popular language model BERT to learn the matching representation of each browsed-candidate news pair, and incorporate the attention mechanism in aggregating procedure to characterize the importance of each matching representation for the final user-news matching signal. Experiments on the real world datasets validate the effectiveness of AMM.",
