            "title": "Building Conversational Artifacts to Enable Digital Assistant for APIs and RPAs",
            "abstract": "In the realm of business automation, digital assistants/chatbots are emerging as the primary method for making automation software accessible to users in various business sectors. Access to automation primarily occurs through APIs and RPAs. To effectively convert APIs and RPAs into chatbots on a larger scale, it is crucial to establish an automated process for generating data and training models that can recognize user intentions, identify questions for conversational slot filling, and provide recommendations for subsequent actions. In this paper, we present a technique for enhancing and generating natural language conversational artifacts from API specifications using large language models (LLMs). The goal is to utilize LLMs in the \"build\" phase to assist humans in creating skills for digital assistants. As a result, the system doesn't need to rely on LLMs during conversations with business users, leading to efficient deployment. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our system is deployed in the IBM Watson Orchestrate product for general availability.",

            "abstract": "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential step for analyzing a dataset to derive insights. Several EDA techniques have been explored in the literature. Many of them leverage visualizations through various plots. But it is not easy to interpret them for a non-technical user, and producing appropriate visualizations is also tough when there are a large number of columns. Few other works provide a view of some interesting slices of data but it is still difficult for the user to draw relevant insights from them. Of late, conversational data exploration is gaining a lot of traction among non-technical users. It helps the user to explore the dataset without having deep technical knowledge about the data. Towards this, we propose a system that recommends interesting questions in natural language based on relevant slices of a dataset in a conversational setting. Specifically, given a dataset, we pick a select set of interesting columns and identify interesting slices of such columns and column combinations based on few interestingness measures. We use our own fine-tuned variation of a pre-trained language model(T5) to generate natural language questions in a specific manner. We then slot-fill values in the generated questions and rank them for recommendations. We show the utility of our proposed system in a coversational setting with a collection of real datasets.",

            "title": "An Empirical Study of Starting Salaries and Employment Trends of Engineering Students in India",
            "abstract": ": This paper presents an empirical study of a recently compiled workforce analytics data-set modeling employment outcomes of Engineering students. The contributions reported in this paper won the data challenge of the ACM IKDD 2016 Conference on Data Science. Two problems are addressed - regression using heterogeneous information types and the extraction of insights/trends from data to make recommendations; these goals are supported by a range of visualizations. Whereas the data-set is specific to a nation, the underlying techniques and visualization methods are generally applicable. Gaussian processes are proposed to model and predict salary as a function of heterogeneous independent attributes. Key novelties the GP approach brings to the domain of understanding workforce analytics are (a) statistically sound notion of uncertainty of prediction that is data dependent, (b) automatic relevance determination of various independent attributes to the dependent variable (salary),(c) seamless incorporation of both numeric and string attributes within the same regression frame- work without dichotomization; specifically, string attributes include single-word or categorical (e.g. gender) or nominal attributes (e.g. college tier) or multi-word attributes (e.g. specialization) and (d) treatment of all data as being correlated towards making predictions. Insights from both predictive modeling approaches and data analysis were used to suggest factors, that if improved, might lead to better starting salaries for Engineering students. A range of visualization techniques were used to extract key employment patterns from the data. dataset Aspiring Minds (2015) contains background information about engineering candidates and their employment outcomes. A number of parametric, non-parametric and machine learning methods were attempted towards predicting salary for job-candidates, given their background information. This paper reports the use of Gaussian processes to model salaries; it demonstrates the use of kernels as a means of integrating heterogeneous background information types. The technique is new to the domain of workforce analytics. The paper also presents several insightful trends observed from the data and makes recommendations for candidates seeking higher starting salaries. This paper thus views the workforce- analytics / labour market / student salary expectation problem from a data science perspective; it reports on the application of a state-of-the-art probabilistic modeling approach to the problem and trends that are intended to enable the Engineering student population of India.",

            "abstract": "Learning the emergence of cooperation in conflicting scenarios such as social dilemmas is a centerpiece of research. Many reinforcement learning based theories exist in the literature to address this problem. The well-known fact about RL based model's very slow learning capabilities coupled with large state space exhibit significant negative effects especially in repeated version of social dilemma settings such as repeated Public Goods Game (PGG) and thereby making them ineffective to model sustainability of cooperation. In this paper, we address this research challenge by augmenting the reinforcement learning based models with a notion of collaboration among the agents, motivated by the fact that humans learn not only through their own actions but also by following the actions of other agents who also continuously learn about the environment. In particular, we propose a novel model, which we refer to as Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL), wherein we define collaboration among the agents as the ability of agents to fully follow other agent's actions/decisions. This is also termed as social learning. The proposed CRL model significantly influences the speed of individual learning, which eventually has a large effect on the collective behavior as compared to that of RL only models and thereby effectively explaining the sustainability of cooperation in repeated PGG settings. We also extend the CRL model for PGGs over different generations where agents die out and new agents are born following a birth-death process.",

            "title": "Dynamic Particle Allocation to Solve Interactive POMDP Models for Social Decision Making",
            "abstract": "In social dilemma settings, such as repeated Public Goods Games (PGGs), humans often come across a dilemma whether to contribute or not based on past contributions from others. In such settings, the decision taken by an agent/human actually depends not only on the belief the agent has about other agents and the environment, but also on their beliefs about others' beliefs. To factor in these aspects, we propose a novel formulation of computational theory of mind (ToM) to model human behavior in a repeated PGG using interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs). Interactive particle filter (IPF) is a well-known algorithm used to approximately solve I-POMDP models for the agents to find their optimal contributions. Number of particles assigned to an agent in IPF can be translated into time and computational resources. Solving I-POMDPs in a time-memory efficient manner even in the case of small state spaces is a largely intractable problem. Also, maintaining a fixed number of particles assigned to each agent, over time, will be highly inefficient in terms of resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic particle allocation algorithm for different agents based on how well they could predict. We validate our proposed algorithm through real experiments involving human agents. Our results suggest that dynamic particle allocation based IPF for I-POMDPs is effective in modelling human behaviours in repeated social dilemma setting while utilizing computational resources in an effective manner.",

We highlight several research challenges and technology barriers in achieving this goal. We propose a governance mechanism around this ecosystem to ensure ethical behaviors of all cognitive agents. Along with a novel set of use-cases of Cogniculture, we discuss the road map ahead for this journey.",

            "abstract": "In today's rapidly changing technological scenario, tech giants revise their strategic alignment every couple of years. As a result, their workforce has to be adapted to the organization's strategy. Members of the workforce who are neither relevant to the strategic alignment, nor can be made relevant by reskilling, have to be either outplaced (i.e. placed in an another job within organization) or separated from the organization. In geographies like Europe, where the cost of separation is very high, it becomes very important to make the right decision for each employee. In this paper, we describe a simulation based methodology to find the probability and time of outplacement of an employee. These numbers are inputs to a global problem of making the optimal decision for the entire workforce.",
