            "abstract": "Most of the widely used quantum programming languages and libraries are not designed for the tightly coupled nature of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which run on quantum resources that are integrated on-premise with classical HPC infrastructure. We propose a programming model using the API provided by OpenMP to target quantum devices, which provides an easy-to-use and efficient interface for HPC applications to utilize quantum compute resources. We have implemented a variational quantum eigensolver using the programming model, which has been tested using a classical simulator. We are in the process of testing on the quantum resources hosted at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ).",

            "abstract": "The computational requirements of applications running in supercomputing centres are growing rapidly and diversifying over time. To meet these needs, developers are constantly developing new processors, domain-specific accelerators, and technologies. Quantum computing is one notable technology that has the potential to speed up certain computations and could be used to enhance High Performance Computing (HPC). However, integrating a quantum computer (QC) into HPC systems is a complex and challenging task, both at the physical and software level. Although various types of accelerators have been integrated into HPC in the past, the integration of QC into HPC presents a unique challenge as it operates on a new computing paradigm and is a scarce resource that needs to be shared among multiple jobs. Furthermore, HPCQC integration is a multidisciplinary field and integration can mean different things to different stakeholders. Our approach to HPCQC integration is from the perspective of an HPC centre where QC is integrated into the HPC environment as an accelerator. We identify parameters that are important for the integration, including network latency, HPCQC hybrid application characteristics and fine-grained scheduling. In addition, we develop a custom simulation model that can comprehensively simulate a hybrid classical-quantum compute system at selected level of detail. This simulation model is utilised to simulate the performance of a hybrid application by adjusting its features on a hybrid system with varying parameters. We discover that fine-grained scheduling is critical to performance, and network latency between QC and HPC has a significant impact on hybrid system performance.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "As quantum computing systems mature and move from laboratories to production computing environments, corresponding software stacks are becoming key for their successful utilization. In particular, the expected use of quantum systems as HPC accelerators requires a deep integration with the existing and widely deployed HPC software stacks. Additionally, new requirements such as dynamic compilation and new challenges for tools and programming models must be considered. We tackle these challenges by developing the Munich Quantum Software Stack\u2014a comprehensive initiative by the Munich Quantum Valley to offer a flexible, efficient, and user-oriented software environment. In this poster, we describe the core components and workflows, and how they will enable this transformation from quantum experiments to quantum accelerators.",

            "title": "MPIs Language Bindings are Holding MPI Back",
            "abstract": "Over the past two decades, C++ has been adopted as a major HPC language (displacing C to a large extent, andFortran to some degree as well). Idiomatic C++ is clearly how C++ is being used nowadays. But, MPIs syntax and semantics defined and extended with C and Fortran interfaces that align with the capabilities and limitations of C89 and Fortran-77.Unfortunately, the language-independent specification also clearly reflects the intersection of what these languages could syntactically and semantically manage at the outset in 1993, rather than being truly language neutral.In this paper, we propose a modern C++ language interface to replace the C language binding for C++ programmers with an upward-compatible architecture that leverages all the benefits of C++11-20 for performance, productivity, and interoperability with other popular C++ libraries and interfaces for HPC. Demand is demonstrably strong for this second attempt at language support for C++ in MPI after the original interface, which was added in MPI-2, then was found to lack specific benefits over theC binding, and so was subsequently removed in MPI-3. Since C++ and its idiomatic usage have evolved since the original C++ language binding was removed from the standard, this new effort is both timely and important for MPI applications. Also, many C++ application programmers create their own, ad hoc shim libraries over MPI to provide some degree of abstraction unique to their particular project, which means many such abstraction libraries are being devised without any specific commonality other than the demand for such.",

            "abstract": "Many scientific and medical researchers are working towards the creation of a virtual human\u2014a personalized digital copy of an individual\u2014that will assist in a patient\u2019s diagnosis, treatment and recovery. The complex nature of living systems means that the development of this remains a major challenge. We describe progress in enabling the HemeLB lattice Boltzmann code to simulate 3D macroscopic blood flow on a full human scale. Significant developments in memory management and load balancing allow near linear scaling performance of the code on hundreds of thousands of computer cores. Integral to the construction of a virtual human, we also outline the implementation of a self-coupling strategy for HemeLB. This allows simultaneous simulation of arterial and venous vascular trees based on human-specific geometries.",

Unfortunately, no previous study has characterized the use of MPI on applications at a significant scale; previous surveys focus either on small data samples or on MPI jobs of specific HPC centers. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of MPI usage in applications. We survey more than one hundred distinct MPI programs covering a significantly large space of the population of MPI applications. We focus on understanding the characteristics of MPI usage with respect to the most used features, code complexity, and programming models and languages. Our study corroborates certain findings previously reported on smaller data samples and presents a number of interesting, previously un-reported insights.",
