            "title": "Incremental Density-Based Clustering on Multicore Processors",
            "abstract": "The density-based clustering algorithm is a fundamental data clustering technique with many real-world applications. However, when the database is frequently changed, how to effectively update clustering results rather than reclustering from scratch remains a challenging task. In this work, we introduce IncAnyDBC, a unique parallel incremental data clustering approach to deal with this problem. First, IncAnyDBC can process changes in bulks rather than batches like state-of-the-art methods for reducing update overheads. Second, it keeps an underlying cluster structure called the object node graph during the clustering process and uses it as a basis for incrementally updating clusters wrt. inserted or deleted objects in the database by propagating changes around affected nodes only. In additional, IncAnyDBC actively and iteratively examines the graph and chooses only a small set of most meaningful objects to produce exact clustering results of DBSCAN or to approximate results under arbitrary time constraints. This makes it more efficient than other existing methods. Third, by processing objects in blocks, IncAnyDBC can be efficiently parallelized on multicore CPUs, thus creating a work-efficient method. It runs much faster than existing techniques using one thread while still scaling well with multiple threads. Experiments are conducted on various large real datasets for demonstrating the performance of IncAnyDBC.",

            "abstract": "Clustering trajectories from GPS data is a crucial task for developing applications in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing approaches perform clustering on raw data consisting of series of GPS positions of moving objects over time. Such approaches are not suitable for classifying moving behaviours of vehicles, e.g., how to distinguish between a trajectory of a taxi and a trajectory of a private car. In this paper, we focus on the problem of clustering trajectories of vehicles having the same moving behaviours. Our approach is based on histogram-based feature extraction to model moving behaviours of objects and utilizes traditional clustering algorithms to group trajectories. We perform experiments on real datasets and obtain better results than existing approaches.",
