            "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Deep Learning in Peak-Hour Series Forecasting",
            "abstract": "Unlocking the potential of deep learning in Peak-Hour Series Forecasting (PHSF) remains a critical yet underexplored task in various domains. While state-of-the-art deep learning models excel in regular Time Series Forecasting (TSF), they struggle to achieve comparable results in PHSF. This can be attributed to the challenges posed by the high degree of non-stationarity in peak-hour series, which makes direct forecasting more difficult than standard TSF. Additionally, manually extracting the maximum value from regular forecasting results leads to suboptimal performance due to models minimizing the mean deficit. To address these issues, this paper presents Seq2Peak, a novel framework designed specifically for PHSF tasks, bridging the performance gap observed in TSF models. Seq2Peak offers two key components: the CyclicNorm pipeline to mitigate the non-stationarity issue and a simple yet effective trainable-parameter-free peak-hour decoder with a hybrid loss function that utilizes both the original series and peak-hour series as supervised signals. Extensive experimentation on publicly available time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, yielding a remarkable average relative improvement of 37.7% across four real-world datasets for both transformer- and non-transformer-based TSF models.",

            "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), aiming to obtain node embeddings by integrating high-order neighborhood information through stacked graph convolution layers, have demonstrated great power in many network analysis tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, a fundamental weakness of GCNs, that is, topological limitations, including over-smoothing and local homophily of topology, limits their ability to represent networks. Existing studies for solving these topological limitations typically focus only on the convolution of features on network topology, which inevitably relies heavily on network structure. Moreover, most networks are text-rich, so it is important to integrate not only document-level information, but also the local text information which is particularly significant while often ignored by the existing methods. To solve these limitations, we propose BiTe-GCN, a novel GCN architecture modeling via bidirectional convolution of topology and features on text-rich networks. Specifically, we first transform the original text-rich network into an augmented bi-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the global document-level information and the local text-sequence information from texts. We then introduce discriminative convolution mechanisms, which performs convolution on this augmented bi-typed network, realizing the convolutions of topology and features altogether in the same system, and learning different contributions of these two parts (i.e., network part and text part), automatically for the given learning objectives. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks demonstrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a breakout improvement. Moreover, this architecture can also be applied to several e-commerce search scenes such as JD searching, and experiments on JD dataset show the superiority of the proposed architecture over the related methods.",

            "abstract": "We present a machine learning framework for multi-agent systems to learn both the optimal policy for maximizing the rewards and the encoding of the high dimensional visual observation. The encoding is useful for sharing local visual observations with other agents under communication resource constraints. The actor-encoder encodes the raw images and chooses an action based on local observations and messages sent by the other agents. The machine learning agent generates not only an actuator command to the physical device, but also a communication message to the other agents. We formulate a reinforcement learning problem, which extends the action space to consider the communication action as well. The feasibility of the reinforcement learning framework is demonstrated using a 3D simulation environment with two collaborating agents. The environment provides realistic visual observations to be used and shared between the two agents.",
