            "title": "OpenSiteRec: An Open Dataset for Site Recommendation",
            "abstract": "As a representative information retrieval task, site recommendation, which aims at predicting the optimal sites for a brand or an institution to open new branches in an automatic data-driven way, is beneficial and crucial for brand development in modern business. However, there is no publicly available dataset so far and most existing approaches are limited to an extremely small scope of brands, which seriously hinders the research on site recommendation. Therefore, we collect, construct and release an open comprehensive dataset, namely OpenSiteRec, to facilitate and promote the research on site recommendation. Specifically, OpenSiteRec leverages a heterogeneous graph schema to represent various types of real-world entities and relations in four international metropolises. To evaluate the performance of the existing general methods on the site recommendation task, we conduct benchmarking experiments of several representative recommendation models on OpenSiteRec. Furthermore, we also highlight the potential application directions to demonstrate the wide applicability of OpenSiteRec. We believe that our OpenSiteRec dataset is significant and anticipated to encourage the development of advanced methods for site recommendation. OpenSiteRec is available online at https://OpenSiteRec.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "Every day, our living city produces a tremendous amount of spatial-temporal data, involved with multiple sources from the individual scale to the city scale. Undoubtedly, such massive urban data can be explored for a better city and better life, as what the urban computing community has been dedicating in recent years. Nevertheless, existing studies are still facing the challenges of data fusion for the urban data as well as the knowledge distillation for specific applications. Moreover, there is a lack of full-featured and user-friendly platforms for both researchers and developers in the urban computing scenario. Therefore, in this article, we present UrbanKG, an urban knowledge graph system to incorporate a knowledge graph with urban computing. Specifically, the system introduces a complete scheme to construct a knowledge graph for urban data fusion. Built upon the data layer, the system further develops the multiple layers of construction, storage, algorithm, operation, and applications, which achieve knowledge distillation and support various functions to the users. We perform representative use cases and demonstrate the system capability of boosting performance in various downstream applications, indicating a promising research direction for knowledge-driven urban computing.",

            "abstract": "Socioeconomic indicators reflect location status from various aspects such as demographics, economy, crime and land usage, which play an important role in the understanding of location-based social networks (LBSNs). Especially, several existing works leverage multi-source data for socioeconomic indicator prediction in LBSNs, which however fail to capture semantic information as well as distil comprehensive knowledge therein. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG), which distils semantic knowledge from multi-source data, has been popular in recent LBSN research, which inspires us to introduce KG for socioeconomic indicator prediction in LBSNs. Specifically, we first construct a location-based KG (LBKG) to integrate various kinds of knowledge from heterogeneous LBSN data, including locations and other related elements like point of interests (POIs), business areas as well as various relationships between them, such as spatial proximity and functional similarity. Then we propose a hierarchical KG learning model to capture both global knowledge from LBKG and domain knowledge from several sub-KGs.

Particularly, existing studies mainly follow the data-driven paradigm to develop feature engineering and representation learning on such data, which however suffer from the robustness issue, i.e., generalizing poorly across datasets and profiles without considering semantic knowledge therein. In comparison, the rising knowledge-driven paradigm built upon the knowledge graph (KG) offers a potential solution to mitigate such weakness. Therefore, in this article, we propose a Knowledge Graph aided framework for Mobile User Profiling (KG-MUP). Specifically, to distil semantic knowledge among data, we firstly construct an urban knowledge graph (UrbanKG) with domain entities like users, regions, point of interests (POIs), and so on. identified, as well as semantic relations for home, workplace, spatiality, and so on. extracted. Moreover, we leverage tensor decomposition and graph neural network to obtain knowledgeable user representations from UrbanKG. In addition, we introduce several customized features to quantify individual mobility characteristics for mobile user profiling. Extensive experiments on three real-world mobility datasets demonstrate that KG-MUP achieves state-of-the-art performance on user profile inference tasks. Moreover, further results also reveal the importance of various semantic knowledge to user profile inference, which provides meaningful insights on user modeling with mobile behavioral data.",

Especially, the wide application of artificial intelligence with multi-source urban data makes intelligent site selection promising. However, existing data-driven methods heavily rely on feature engineering, facing the issues of business generalization and complex relationship modeling. To get rid of the dilemma, in this work, we borrow ideas from knowledge graph (KG), and propose a knowledge-driven model for site selection, short for KnowSite. Specifically, motivated by distilled knowledge and rich semantics in KG, we firstly construct an urban KG (UrbanKG) with cities' key elements and semantic relationships captured. Based on UrbanKG, we employ pre-training techniques for semantic representations, which are fed into an encoder-decoder structure for site decisions. With multi-relational message passing and relation path-based attention mechanism developed, KnowSite successfully reveals the relationship between various businesses and site selection criteria. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that KnowSite outperforms representative baselines with both effectiveness and explainability achieved.",

Accordingly, in such large-scale and complicated wireless networks, optimal controlling is reaching unprecedented levels of complexity while its traditional solutions of handcrafted offline algorithms become inefficient due to high complexity, low robustness, and high overhead. Therefore, reinforcement learning (RL), which enables network entities to learn from their actions and consequences in the interactive network environment, attracts significant attention. In this article, we comprehensively review the applications of RL in wireless networks from a layering perspective. First, we present an overview of the principle, fundamentals, and several advanced models of RL.

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of the mobile communication technology, mobile trajectories of humans are massively collected by Internet service providers (ISPs) and application service providers (ASPs). On the other hand, the rising paradigm of knowledge graph (KG) provides us a promising solution to extract structured \"knowledge\" from massive trajectory data. In this paper, we focus on modeling users' spatio-temporal mobility patterns based on knowledge graph techniques, and predicting users' future movement based on the \"knowledge\" extracted from multiple sources in a cohesive manner. Specifically, we propose a new type of knowledge graph, i.e., spatio-temporal urban knowledge graph (STKG), where mobility trajectories, category information of venues, and temporal information are jointly modeled by the facts with different relation types in STKG. The mobility prediction problem is converted to the knowledge graph completion problem in STKG. Further, a complex embedding model with elaborately designed scoring functions is proposed to measure the plausibility of facts in STKG to solve the knowledge graph completion problem, which considers temporal dynamics of the mobility patterns and utilizes PoI categories as the auxiliary information and background knowledge. Extensive evaluations confirm the high accuracy of our model in predicting users' mobility, i.e., improving the accuracy by 5.04% compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, PoI categories as the background knowledge and auxiliary information are confirmed to be helpful by improving the performance by 3.85% in terms of accuracy. Additionally, experiments show that our proposed method is time-efficient by reducing the computational time by over 43.12% compared with existing methods.",

Nevertheless, human mobility can significantly impact the offloading decision and performance in MEC networks. In this context, we propose device-to-device (D2D) cooperation based MEC to expedite the task execution of mobile user by leveraging proximity-aware task offloading. However, user mobility in such distributed architecture results in dynamic offloading decision that instigates mobility-aware task scheduling in our proposed framework. We jointly formulate task assignment and power allocation to minimize the total task execution latency by taking account of user mobility, distributed resources, tasks properties, and energy constraint of the user device. We first propose Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based evolutionary scheme to solve our formulated mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Then we propose a heuristic named mobility-aware task scheduling (MATS) to obtain effective task assignment with low complexity. The extensive evaluation under realistic human mobility trajectories provides useful insights into the performance of our schemes and demonstrates that, both GA and MATS achieve better latency than other baseline schemes while satisfying the energy constraint of mobile device.",

            "abstract": "N-ary relational knowledge bases (KBs) represent knowledge with binary and beyond-binary relational facts. Especially, in an n-ary relational fact, the involved entities play different roles, e.g., the ternary relation PlayCharacterIn consists of three roles, Actor, Character and Movie. However, existing approaches are often directly extended from binary relational KBs, i.e., knowledge graphs, while missing the important semantic property of role. Therefore, we start from the role level, and propose a Role-Aware Modeling, RAM for short, for facts in n-ary relational KBs. RAM explores a latent space that contains basis vectors, and represents roles by linear combinations of these vectors. This way encourages semantically related roles to have close representations. RAM further introduces a pattern matrix that captures the compatibility between the role and all involved entities. To this end, it presents a multilinear scoring function to measure the plausibility of a fact composed by certain roles and entities. We show that RAM achieves both theoretical full expressiveness and computation efficiency, which also provides an elegant generalization for approaches in binary relational KBs. Experiments demonstrate that RAM outperforms representative baselines on both n-ary and binary relational datasets.",

            "title": "Latency Minimization for D2D-Enabled Partial Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing",
            "abstract": "We consider Device-to-Device (D2D)-enabled mobile edge computing offloading scenario, where a device can partially offload its computation task to the edge server or exploit the computation resources of proximal devices. Keeping in view the millisecond-scale latency requirement in 5G service scenarios and the spectrum scarcity, we focus on minimizing the sum of task execution latency of all the devices in a shared spectrum with interference. In particular, we provide an integrated framework for partial offloading and interference management using orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme. Accordingly, we formulate total latency minimization as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem by considering desired energy consumption, partial offloading, and resource allocation constraints. We use decomposition approach to solve our problem and propose a novel scheme named Joint Partial Offloading and Resource Allocation (JPORA). With aim to reduce the task execution latency, JPORA iteratively adjusts data segmentation and solves the underlying problem of quality of service (QoS)-aware communication resource allocation to the cellular links, and interference-aware communication resource allocation to D2D links. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that JPORA achieves the lowest latency as compared to the other baseline schemes, meanwhile limiting the local energy consumption of user devices.",
