            "title": "Large Language Models are In-Context Molecule Learners",
            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve informative context examples. Additionally, we also propose Post-retrieval Re-ranking with Sequence Reversal and Random Walk to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context molecule learning capability of LLMs with retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for the molecule-caption translation task. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMT can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.",

            "title": "Effective Illicit Account Detection on Large Cryptocurrency MultiGraphs",
            "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are rapidly expanding and becoming vital in digital financial markets. However, the rise in cryptocurrency-related illicit activities has led to significant losses for users. To protect the security of these platforms, it is critical to identify illicit accounts effectively. Current detection methods mainly depend on feature engineering or are inadequate to leverage the complex information within cryptocurrency transaction networks, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present DIAM, an effective method for detecting illicit accounts in cryptocurrency transaction networks modeled by directed multi-graphs with attributed edges. DIAM first features an Edge2Seq module that captures intrinsic transaction patterns from parallel edges by considering edge attributes and their directed sequences, to generate effective node representations. Then in DIAM, we design a multigraph Discrepancy (MGD) module with a tailored message passing mechanism to capture the discrepant features between normal and illicit nodes over the multigraph topology, assisted by an attention mechanism. DIAM integrates these techniques for end-to-end training to detect illicit accounts from legitimate ones. Extensive experiments, comparing against 15 existing solutions on 4 large cryptocurrency datasets of Bitcoin and Ethereum, demonstrate that DIAM consistently outperforms others in accurately identifying illicit accounts. For example, on a Bitcoin dataset with 20 million nodes and 203 million edges, DIAM attains an F1 score of 96.55%, markedly surpassing the runner-up's score of 83.92%.
