            "title": "Pretrained Embeddings for E-commerce Machine Learning: When it Fails and Why?",
            "abstract": "The use of pretrained embeddings has become widespread in modern e-commerce machine learning (ML) systems. In practice, however, we have encountered several key issues when using pretrained embedding in a real-world production system, many of which cannot be fully explained by current knowledge. Unfortunately, we find that there is a lack of a thorough understanding of how pre-trained embeddings work, especially their intrinsic properties and interactions with downstream tasks. Consequently, it becomes challenging to make interactive and scalable decisions regarding the use of pre-trained embeddings in practice. Our investigation leads to two significant discoveries about using pretrained embeddings in e-commerce applications. Firstly, we find that the design of the pretraining and downstream models, particularly how they encode and decode information via embedding vectors, can have a profound impact. Secondly, we establish a principled perspective of pre-trained embeddings via the lens of kernel analysis, which can be used to evaluate their predictability, interactively and scalably. These findings help to address the practical challenges we faced and offer valuable guidance for successful adoption of pretrained embeddings in real-world production. Our conclusions are backed by solid theoretical reasoning, benchmark experiments, as well as online testings.",

            "abstract": "1 FOREWORD Most of the recent progress in information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems has been fueled by deep learning: the success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns for prediction. However, algorithmic advances on accurate predictions and improved user modeling are just a small part of designing considerations of a much larger system. IR and recommender systems difer from other machine learning domains because they are inherently part of an ecosystem \u2013 in the simplest case, a world of items and users. In these ecosystems, system designers face a broad range of decisions \u2013 e.g., how to balance popularity, which incentives should be given to which users, or what safeguards to put in place to ensure the platform thrives in the long-run. Some of the decision making problems are statistical and algorithmic in nature, such as coping with the uncertainty of data and models, while others can involve building systems for the satisfactory of multiple parties. In general, there are many complex decision-making challenges faced by real-world IR and recommender systems, but existing approaches often make oversimplifed assumptions about the environment, data, and human behavior. Ignoring those challenges or treating them simply as pattern recognition problems can cost the engagement, accessibility, fairness, inclusiveness, and ultimately the vitality of IR and recommendation systems.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental challenge of recommendation systems (RS) is understanding the causal dynamics underlying users' decision making. Most existing literature addresses this problem by using causal structures inferred from domain knowledge. However, there are numerous phenomenons where domain knowledge is insufficient, and the causal mechanisms must be learnt from the feedback data. Discovering the causal mechanism from RS feedback data is both novel and challenging, since RS itself is a source of intervention that can influence both the users' exposure and their willingness to interact. Also for this reason, most existing solutions become inappropriate since they require data collected free from any RS. In this paper, we first formulate the underlying causal mechanism as a causal structural model and describe a general causal structure learning framework grounded in the real-world working mechanism of RS. The essence of our approach is to acknowledge the unknown nature of RS intervention. We then derive the learning objective from our framework and propose an augmented Lagrangian solver for efficient optimization. We conduct both simulation and real-world experiments to demonstrate how our approach compares favorably to existing solutions, together with the empirical analysis from sensitivity and ablation studies.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, deep learning has significantly reshaped the landscape of information retrieval (IR). The community has recently begun to notice the potential dangers of overusing less-understood mechanisms and over-simplified assumptions to learn patterns and make decisions. In particular, there is growing concerns on the interpretation, reliability, social impact, and long-term utility of real-world IR systems. Therefore, it has become a pressing issue to bring the IR community comprehensive and systematic tools to understand empirical domain solutions and motivate principled design ideas. We focus on the three pillar stones of modern IR systems: pattern recognition with deep learning, causal inference analysis, and online decision making (with bandits and reinforcement learning). Our objectives are as follows. For pattern recognition, we introduce theoretical tools that address the expressivity, optimization, generalization, and model diagnostic for widespread domain practices, including models from unsupervised, (semi-)supervised, meta-learning, and online learning. For causal inference analysis, we emphasize both learning from observational studies and optimizing online experiment design, leveraging the recent theoretical advancements from various domains. Finally, for online decision making (with bandits and reinforcement learning), we aim to resolve both the conceptual and practical learning, evaluation and deployment challenges by introducing powerful tools from robust optimization and optimal control. Our tutorial is inclusive: we not only cover a broad range of heating topics, more importantly, we substantiate our discussion with the production examples at Walmart and Instacart such that audiences with different backgrounds can learn to leverage the tools as instructed. Our tutorial can serve as a guideline for practitioners seeking justifications and principled design ideas, a playbook for researchers landing their innovations on IR productions, and an introductory course for those interested in learning the advanced topics and tools of IR.",

            "abstract": "The interventional nature of recommendation has attracted increasing attention in recent years. It particularly motivates researchers to formulate learning and evaluating recommendation as causal inference and data missing-not-at-random problems. However, few take seriously the consequence of violating the critical assumption of overlapping, which we prove can significantly threaten the validity and interpretation of the outcome. We find a critical piece missing in the current understanding of information retrieval (IR) systems: as interventions, recommendation not only affects the already observed data, but it also interferes with the target domain (distribution) of interest. We then rephrase optimizing recommendation as finding an intervention that best transports the patterns it learns from the observed domain to its intervention domain. Towards this end, we use domain transportation to characterize the learning-intervention mechanism of recommendation. We design a principled transportation-constraint risk minimization objective and convert it to a two-player minimax game. We prove the consistency, generalization, and excessive risk bounds for the proposed objective, and elaborate how they compare to the current results. Finally, we carry out extensive real-data and semi-synthetic experiments to demonstrate the advantage of our approach, and launch online testing with a real-world IR system.",

            "abstract": "In the relatively short history of machine learning, the subtle balance between engineering and theoretical progress has been proved critical at various stages. The most recent wave of AI has brought to the IR community powerful techniques, particularly for pattern recognition. While many benefits from the burst of ideas as numerous tasks become algorithmically feasible, the balance is tilting toward the application side. The existing theoretical tools in IR can no longer explain, guide, and justify the newly-established methodologies. With no choices, we have to bet our design on black-box mechanisms that we only empirically understand. The consequences can be suffering: in stark contrast to how the IR industry has envisioned modern AI making life easier, many are experiencing increased confusion and costs in data manipulation, model selection, monitoring, censoring, and decision making. This reality is not surprising: without handy theoretical tools, we often lack principled knowledge of the pattern recognition model's expressivity, optimization property, generalization guarantee, and our decision-making process has to rely on over-simplified assumptions and human judgments from time to time. Facing all the challenges, we started researching advanced theoretical tools emerging from various domains that can potentially resolve modern IR problems. We encountered many impactful ideas and made several independent publications emphasizing different pieces. Time is now to bring the community a systematic tutorial on how we successfully adapt those tools and make significant progress in understanding, designing, and eventually productionize impactful IR systems. We emphasize systematicity because IR is a comprehensive discipline that touches upon particular aspects of learning, causal inference analysis, interactive (online) decision-making, etc. It thus requires systematic calibrations to render the actual usefulness of the imported theoretical tools to serve IR problems, as they usually exhibit unique structures and definitions. Therefore, we plan this tutorial to systematically demonstrate our learning and successful experience of using advanced theoretical tools for understanding and designing IR systems.",

However, during the real-time serving, we observe varieties of interventions and constraints that cause inconsistency between the online and offline setting, which we summarize and term as runtime uncertainty. Such uncertainty cannot be learned from the logged data due to its abnormality and rareness nature. To assert a certain level of robustness, we perturb the off-policy estimators along an adversarial direction in view of the runtime uncertainty. It allows the resulting estimators to be robust not only to observed but also unexpected runtime uncertainties. Leveraging this idea, we bring runtime-uncertainty robustness to three major off-policy learning methods: the inverse propensity score method, reward-model method, and doubly robust method. We theoretically justify the robustness of our methods to runtime uncertainty, and demonstrate their effectiveness using both the simulation and the real-world online experiments.",

(2020), based on empirical observations, argues that matrix-factorization collaborative filtering (MCF) compares favorably to neural collaborative filtering (NCF), and conjectures the dot product's superiority over the feed-forward neural network as similarity function. In this paper, we address the comparison rigorously by answering the following questions: 1. what is the limiting expressivity of each model; 2. under the practical gradient descent, to which solution does each optimization path converge; 3. how would the models generalize under the inductive and transductive learning setting. Our results highlight the similar expressivity for the overparameterized NCF and MCF as kernelized predictors, and reveal the relation between their optimization paths. We further show their different generalization behaviors, where MCF and NCF experience specific tradeoff and comparison in the transductive and inductive collaborative filtering setting. Lastly, by showing a novel generalization result, we reveal the critical role of correcting exposure bias for model evaluation in the inductive setting. Our results explain some of the previously observed conflicts, and we provide synthetic and real-data experiments to shed further insights to this topic.",
