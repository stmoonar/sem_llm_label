            "title": "The Impact of Differential Privacy on Recommendation Accuracy and Popularity Bias",
            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems leverage vast amounts of behavioral user data, which poses severe privacy risks. Thus, often, random noise is added to the data to ensure Differential Privacy (DP). However, to date, it is not well understood, in which ways this impacts personalized recommendations. In this work, we study how DP impacts recommendation accuracy and popularity bias, when applied to the training data of state-of-the-art recommendation models. Our findings are three-fold: First, we find that nearly all users' recommendations change when DP is applied. Second, recommendation accuracy drops substantially while recommended item popularity experiences a sharp increase, suggesting that popularity bias worsens. Third, we find that DP exacerbates popularity bias more severely for users who prefer unpopular items than for users that prefer popular items.",

            "abstract": "User-based KNN recommender systems ( UserKNN ) utilize the rating data of a target user\u2019s \ud835\udc58 nearest neighbors in the recommendation process. This, however, increases the privacy risk of the neighbors since their rating data might be exposed to other users or malicious parties. To reduce this risk, existing work applies differential privacy by adding randomness to the neighbors\u2019 ratings, which reduces the accuracy of UserKNN . In this work, we introduce ReuseKNN , a novel privacy-aware recommender system. The main idea is to identify small but highly reusable neighborhoods so that (i) only a minimal set of users requires protection with differential privacy, and (ii) most users do not need to be protected with differential privacy, since they are only rarely exploited as neighbors. In our experiments on five diverse datasets, we make two key observations: Firstly, ReuseKNN requires significantly smaller neighborhoods, and thus, fewer neighbors need to be protected with differential privacy compared to traditional UserKNN . Secondly, despite the small neighborhoods, ReuseKNN outperforms UserKNN and a fully differentially private approach in terms of accuracy. Overall, ReuseKNN \u2019s recommendation process leads to significantly less privacy risk for users than in the case of UserKNN .",
