            "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has been widely used to improve recommendation performance, since its self-supervised signals can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems. Nevertheless, most existing CL-based recommendation models construct negative sample pairs following the common practice, which may include many false negatives (i.e., highly similar nodes). Some studies detect potential false negatives through specific rules and either remove these samples from the negative samples or treat them all as positive samples. However, they lack a finer-grained consideration of the samples. To address this limitation, we propose a Ranking Enhanced Fine-grained Contrastive Learning method (REFCL). Specifically, we devise two sampling strategies to generate two sets of positive samples with different confidence levels. These well-ordered positive sample sets are then integrated into our novel contrastive loss, which allows for a more nuanced consideration of distinctions between samples and thereby enhancing the discriminative qualities of the learned user/item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of REFCL.",

These attacks, aimed at manipulating recommendation outputs for unethical gains, exploit vulnerabilities in RS through injecting malicious data or intervening model training. This survey presents a unique perspective by examining these threats through the lens of an attacker, offering fresh insights into their mechanics and impacts. Concretely, we detail a systematic pipeline that encompasses four stages of a poisoning attack: setting attack goals, assessing attacker capabilities, analyzing victim architecture, and implementing poisoning strategies. The pipeline not only aligns with various attack tactics but also serves as a comprehensive taxonomy to pinpoint focuses of distinct poisoning attacks. Correspondingly, we further classify defensive strategies into two main categories: poisoning data filtering and robust training from the defender's perspective. Finally, we highlight existing limitations and suggest innovative directions for further exploration in this field.",

For each category, we discuss its mechanism in detail, along with associated methods. Furthermore, this paper highlights potential future research avenues in this domain. Additionally, to facilitate and benchmark the empirical comparison of PAR, we introduce an open-source library, ARLib, which encompasses a comprehensive collection of PAR models and common datasets.

            "abstract": "The ID-free recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitation that traditional recommender systems struggle to model cold-start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that ID-free recommender systems are vulnerable to the proposed Text Simulation attack (TextSimu) which aims to promote specific target items. As a novel type of text poisoning attack, TextSimu exploits large language models (LLM) to alter the textual information of target items by simulating the characteristics of popular items. It operates effectively in both black-box and white-box settings, utilizing two key components: a unified popularity extraction module, which captures the essential characteristics of popular items, and an N-persona consistency simulation strategy, which creates multiple personas to collaboratively synthesize refined promotional textual descriptions for target items by simulating the popular items. To withstand TextSimu-like attacks, we further explore the detection approach for identifying LLM-generated promotional text. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that TextSimu poses a more significant threat than existing poisoning attacks, while our defense method can detect malicious text of target items generated by TextSimu. By identifying the vulnerability, we aim to advance the development of more robust ID-free recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has become increasingly popular in recommendation due to its remarkable ability to reduce reliance on labels. Typically, GCL employs data augmentation methods, e.g., structure perturbation and representation perturbation, and CL loss to enhance performance. Recent studies have shown that structural perturbation plays a minor role in GCL, but there is still a lack of exploration on the representation perturbation. Therefore, we compare the two data perturbations in detail and reveal that both of them have a limited impact on performance. Simply combining recommendation loss and CL loss can produce comparable improvements. Besides, we identify a shared principle between the designs of recommendation loss and CL loss: both aim to optimize representation by increasing similarity between a target node and its positive samples while decreasing similarity with negative samples. Based on these findings, we propose Compact Graph Contrastive Learning (CGCL), a streamlined strategy that eliminates the data augmentation and deeply unifies recommendation loss and CL loss by elegantly incorporating their respective contributions. Leveraging the benefits of the unified strategy, we discover that our model can learn a concentrated mode length distribution of representation, which can enhance the ability to debias and thus improve the performance of the recommendation. This is a novel perspective on representation learning, and we also validate its rationality through rigorous experiments. Our comprehensive study on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that CGCL outperforms existing GCL methods.",

            "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has recently gained prominence in the domain of recommender systems due to its great ability to enhance recommendation accuracy and improve model robustness. Despite its advantages, this paper identifies a vulnerability of CL-based recommender systems that they are more susceptible to poisoning attacks aiming to promote individual items. Our analysis indicates that this vulnerability is attributed to the uniform spread of representations caused by the InfoNCE loss. Furthermore, theoretical and empirical evidence shows that optimizing this loss favors smooth spectral values of representations. This finding suggests that attackers could facilitate this optimization process of CL by encouraging a more uniform distribution of spectral values, thereby enhancing the degree of representation dispersion. With these insights, we attempt to reveal a potential poisoning attack against CL-based recommender systems, which encompasses a dual-objective framework: one that induces a smoother spectral value distribution to amplify the InfoNCE loss's inherent dispersion effect, named dispersion promotion; and the other that directly elevates the visibility of target items, named rank promotion. We validate the threats of our attack model through extensive experimentation on four datasets. By shedding light on these vulnerabilities, our goal is to advance the development of more robust CL-based recommender systems. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/CoderWZW/ARLib}.",

            "abstract": "Urban flow prediction plays a crucial role in public transportation management and smart city construction. Although previous studies have achieved success in integrating spatial-temporal information to some extents, those models lack thoughtful consideration on global information and positional information in the temporal dimension, which can be summarized by three aspects: a) The models do not consider the relative position information of time axis, resulting in that the position features of flow maps are not effectively learned. b) They overlook the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales, which lead to inaccurate global information representation. c) Those models only predict the flow map at the end of time sequence other than more flow maps before that, which results in neglecting parts of temporal features in the learning process. To solve the problems, we propose a novel model, Spatial-Temporal Global Semantic representation learning for urban flow Prediction (ST-GSP) in this paper. Specifically, for a), we design a semantic flow encoder that extracts relative positional information of time. Besides, the encoder captures the spatial dependencies and external factors of urban flow at each time interval. For b), we model the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales simultaneously by using the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which can learn the global temporal dependencies. For c), inspired by the idea of self-supervised learning, we mask an urban flow map on the time sequence and predict it to pre-train a deep bidirectional learning model to catch the representation from its context. We conduct extensive experiments on two types of urban flows in Beijing and New York City to show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Quick Graph Conversion for Robust Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Implicit feedback plays a huge role in recommender systems, but its high noise characteristic seriously reduces its effect. To denoise implicit feedback, some efforts have been devoted to graph data augmentation (GDA) methods. Although the bi-level optimization thought of GDA guarantees better recommendation performance theoretically, it also leads to expensive time costs and severe space explosion problems. Specifically, bi-level optimization involves repeated traversal of all positive and negative instances after each optimization of the recommendation model. In this paper, we propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Quick Graph Conversion (QGrace) , to effectively transform the original interaction graph into a purified (for positive instances) and densified (for negative instances) interest graph during the recommendation model training process. In QGrace, we leverage the gradient matching scheme based on elaborated generative models to fulfill the conversion and generation of an interest graph, elegantly overcoming the high time and space cost problems. To enable recommendation models to run on interest graphs that lack implicit feed-back data, we provide a fine-grained objective function from the perspective of alignment and uniformity. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the QGrace outperforms the state-of-the-art GDA methods and recommendation models in effectiveness and robustness.",

            "title": "Predictive and Contrastive: Dual-Auxiliary Learning for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) recently has achieved outstanding success on recommendation. By setting up an auxiliary task (either predictive or contrastive), SSL can discover supervisory signals from the raw data without human annotation, which greatly mitigates the problem of sparse user\u2013item interactions. However, most SSL-based recommendation models rely on general-purpose auxiliary tasks, e.g., maximizing correspondence between node representations learned from the original and perturbed interaction graphs, which are explicitly irrelevant to the recommendation task. Accordingly, the rich semantics reflected by social relationships and item categories, which lie in the recommendation data-based heterogeneous graphs, are not fully exploited. To explore recommendation-specific auxiliary tasks, we first quantitatively analyze the heterogeneous interaction data and find a strong positive correlation between the interactions and the number of user\u2013item paths induced by meta-paths. Based on the finding, we design two auxiliary tasks that are tightly coupled with the target task (one is predictive and the other one is contrastive) toward connecting recommendation with the self-supervision signals hiding in the positive correlation. Finally, a model-agnostic dual-auxiliary learning (DUAL) framework, which unifies the SSL and recommendation tasks, is developed. The extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DUAL can significantly improve recommendation, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.",
