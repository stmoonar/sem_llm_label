            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

Whereas it has been traditionally tackled with genetic programming, it has recently gained a growing interest in deep learning as a data-driven model discovery tool, achieving significant advances in various application domains ranging from fundamental to applied sciences. In this survey, we present a structured and comprehensive overview of symbolic regression methods, review the adoption of these methods for model discovery in various areas, and assess their effectiveness. We have also grouped state-of-the-art symbolic regression applications in a categorized manner in a living review.",

While there is a growing interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for traffic control, the work so far has focussed on learning through interactions which, in practice, is costly. Instead, real experience data on traffic is available and could be exploited at minimal costs. Recent progress in offline or batch RL has enabled just that. Model-based offline RL methods, in particular, have been shown to generalize to the experience data much better than others. We build a model-based learning framework, A-DAC, which infers a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from dataset with pes-simistic costs built in to deal with data uncertainties. The costs are modeled through an adaptive shaping of rewards in the MDP which provides better regularization of data compared to the prior related work. A-DAC is evaluated on a complex signalized roundabout us-ing multiple datasets varying in size and in batch collection policy. The evaluation results show that it is possible to build high performance control policies in a data efficient manner using simplistic batch collection policies.",

            "abstract": "It is ten years since neural networks made their spectacular comeback. Prompted by this anniversary, we take a holistic perspective on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Supervised Learning for cognitive tasks is effectively solved - provided we have enough high-quality labeled data. However, deep neural network models are not easily interpretable, and thus the debate between blackbox and whitebox modeling has come to the fore. The rise of attention networks, self-supervised learning, generative modeling, and graph neural networks has widened the application space of AI. Deep Learning has also propelled the return of reinforcement learning as a core building block of autonomous decision making systems. The possible harms made possible by new AI technologies have raised socio-technical issues such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. The dominance of AI by Big-Tech who control talent, computing resources, and most importantly, data may lead to an extreme AI divide. Failure to meet high expectations in high profile, and much heralded flagship projects like self-driving vehicles could trigger another AI winter.",

In October 2019, and in the strategy makes Qatarspecific recommendations in order for the country to realize its national vision to transition into a knowledgebased economy by 2030. Here, we briefly outline and contextualize the pillars and report on progress since the strategy was announced. Race for talent. Some 95% of the workforce in Qatar consists of non-Qatari expatriates. A large bulk of the workforce consists of blue-collar workers employed in the construction and service sector. As the infrastructure work related to the FIFA 2022 World Cup comes to an end, Qatar must create pathways to attract talent that has experience working in AI and digital ecosystems. For example, fast-track visas for AI engineers can help build a critical mass of AI collaboration with Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), the government of Qatar released a National Strategy for AI. The aim of the strategy is to provide decision-makers and the wider public in Qatar with a nuanced and realistic view of AI technology and at the same time serve as a \u201ccall for action\u201d toward a future where AI will become the defining technology of the 21 century and beyond.",

            "abstract": "We introduce Permutation and Structured Perturbation Inference (PSPI), a new problem formulation that abstracts many graph matching tasks that arise in systems biology. PSPI can be viewed as a robust formulation of the permutation inference or graph matching, where the objective is to find a permutation between two graphs under the assumption that a set of edges may have undergone a perturbation due to an underlying cause. For example, suppose there are two gene regulatory networks X and Y from a diseased and normal tissue respectively. Then, the PSPI problem can be used to detect if there has been a structural change between the two networks which can serve as a signature of the disease. Besides the new problem formulation, we propose an ADMM algorithm (STEPD) to solve a relaxed version of the PSPI problem. An extensive case study on comparative gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is used to demonstrate that STEPD is able to accurately infer structured perturbations and thus provides a tool for computational biologists to identify novel prognostic signatures. A spectral analysis confirms that STEPD can recover small clique-like perturbations making it a useful tool for detecting permutation-invariant changes in graphs.",

            "abstract": "The data and Artificial Intelligence revolution has had a massive impact on enterprises, governments, and society alike. It is fueled by two key factors. First, data have become increasingly abundant and are often available openly. Enterprises have more data than they can process. Governments are spearheading open data initiatives by setting up data portals such as data.gov and releasing large amounts of data to the public. Second, AI engineering development is becoming increasingly democratized. Open source frameworks have enabled even an individual developer to engineer sophisticated AI systems. But with such ease of use comes the potential for irresponsible use of data. Ensuring that AI systems adhere to a set of ethical principles is one of the major problems of our age. We believe that data and model transparency has a key role to play in mitigating the deleterious effects of AI systems. In this article, we describe a framework to synthesize ideas from various domains such as data transparency, data quality, data governance among others to tackle this problem. Specifically, we advocate an approach based on automated annotations (of both data and the AI model), which has a number of appealing properties. The annotations could be used by enterprises to get visibility of potential issues, prepare data transparency reports, create and ensure policy compliance, and evaluate the readiness of data for diverse downstream AI applications. We propose a model architecture and enumerate its key components that could achieve these requirements. Finally, we describe a number of interesting challenges and opportunities.",

            "abstract": "Accurately maintaining digital street maps is labor-intensive. To address this challenge, much work has studied automatically processing geospatial data sources such as GPS trajectories and satellite images to reduce the cost of maintaining digital maps. An end-to-end map update system would first process geospatial data sources to extract insights, and second leverage those insights to update and improve the map. However, prior work largely focuses on the first step of this pipeline: these map extraction methods infer road networks from scratch given geospatial data sources (in effect creating entirely new maps), but do not address the second step of leveraging this extracted information to update the existing map data. In this paper, we first explain why current map extraction techniques yield low accuracy when extended to update existing maps. We then propose a novel method that leverages the progression of satellite imagery over time to substantially improve accuracy. Our approach first compares satellite images captured at different times to identify portions of the physical road network that have visibly changed, and then updates the existing map accordingly. We show that our change-based approach reduces error rates four-fold.",
