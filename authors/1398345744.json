            "title": "Calibrating Nighttime Satellite Imagery with Red Photometer Networks",
            "abstract": "The data retrieved from satellite imagery and ground-based photometers are the two main sources of information on light pollution and are thus the two main tools for tackling the problem of artificial light pollution at night (ALAN). While satellite data offer high spatial coverage, on the other hand, photometric data provide information with a higher degree of temporal resolution. Thus, studying the proper correlation between both sources will allow us to calibrate and integrate them to obtain data with both high temporal resolution and spatial coverage. For this purpose, more than 15,000 satellite measurements and 400,000 measurements from 72 photometers for the year 2022 were used. The photometers used were the Sky-Glow Wireless Autonomous Sensor (SG-WAS) and Telescope Encoder and Sky Sensor WIFI (TESS-W) types, located at different ground-based locations, mainly in Spain. These photometers have a spectral sensitivity closer to that of VIIRS than to the Sky Quality Meter (SQM). In this study, a good correlation of data from the Day\u2013Night Band (DNB) from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with a red photometric network between 19.41 mag/arcsec2 and 21.12 mag/arcsec2 was obtained.",

            "title": "Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Image Classification Over Small Datasets: Diabetic Foot Case Study",
            "abstract": "Data scarcity is a common and challenging issue when working with Artificial Intelligence solutions, especially those including Deep Learning (DL) models for tasks such as image classification. This is particularly relevant in healthcare scenarios, in which data collection requires a long-lasting process, involving specific control protocols. The performance of DL models is usually quantified by different classification metrics, which may provide biased results, due to the lack of sufficient data. In this paper, an innovative approach is proposed to evaluate the performance of DL models when labeled data is scarce. This approach, which aims to detect the poor performance provided by DL models, in spite of traditional assessing metrics indicating otherwise, is based on information theoretic concepts and motivated by the Information Bottleneck framework. This methodology has been evaluated by implementing several experimental configurations to classify samples from a plantar thermogram dataset, focused on early stage detection of diabetic foot ulcers, as a case study. The proposed network architectures exhibited high results in terms of classification metrics. However, as our approach shows, only two of those models are indeed consistent to generalize the data properly. In conclusion, a new methodology was introduced and tested to identify promising DL models for image classification over small datasets without relying exclusively on the widely employed classification metrics. Example code and supplementary material using a state-of-the-art DL model are available at https://github.com/mt4sd/PerformanceEvaluationScarceDataset.",

            "abstract": "An increasing amount of researchers use software images to capture the requirements and code dependencies needed to carry out computational experiments. Software images preserve the computational environment required to execute a scientific experiment and have become a crucial asset for reproducibility. However, software images are usually not properly documented and described, making it challenging for scientists to find, reuse and understand them. In this paper, we propose a framework for automatically describing software images in a machine-readable manner by (i) creating a vocabulary to describe software images; (ii) developing an annotation framework designed to automatically document the underlying environment of software images and (iii) creating DockerPedia, a Knowledge Graph with over 150,000 annotated software images, automatically described using our framework. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach in finding images with specific software dependencies, comparing similar software images, addressing versioning problems when running computational experiments; and flagging problems with vulnerable software dependencies.",

BiDO Standard Bibliometric Measures is part of its set of ontologies. It allows describing of numerical and categorical bibliometric data such as h-index, author citation count, journal impact factor. These measures may be used to evaluate scientific production of researchers. However, they are not enough. In a previous study, we determined the lack of some terms to provide a more complete representation of scientific production. Hence, we have built an extension using the NeOn Methodology to restructure the BiDO ontology. With this extension, it is possible to represent and measure the number of documents from research, the number of citations from a paper and the number of publications in high impact journals according to its area and discipline.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KG) are becoming core components of most artificial intelligence applications. Linked Data, as a method of publishing KGs, allows applications to traverse within, and even out of, the graph thanks to global dereferenceable identifiers denoting entities, in the form of IRIs. However, as we show in this work, after analyzing several popular datasets (namely DBpedia, LOD Cache, and Web Data Commons JSON-LD data) many entities are being represented using literal strings where IRIs should be used, diminishing the advantages of using Linked Data. To remedy this, we propose an approach for identifying such strings and replacing them with their corresponding entity IRIs. The proposed approach is based on identifying relations between entities based on both ontological axioms as well as data profiling information and converting strings to entity IRIs based on the types of entities linked by each relation. Our approach showed 98% recall and 76% precision in identifying such strings and 97% precision in converting them to their corresponding IRI in the considered KG. Further, we analyzed how the connectivity of the KG is increased when new relevant links are added to the entities as a result of our method. Our experiments on a subset of the Spanish DBpedia data show that it could add 25% more links to the KG and improve the overall connectivity by 17%.",
