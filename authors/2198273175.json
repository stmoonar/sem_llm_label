            "abstract": "Heterogeneous data is endemic due to the use of diverse models and settings of devices by hospitals in the field of medical imaging. However, there are few open-source frameworks for federated heterogeneous medical image analysis with personalization and privacy protection without the demand to modify the existing model structures or to share any private data. In this paper, we proposed PPPML-HMI, a novel open-source learning paradigm for personalized and privacy-preserving federated heterogeneous medical image analysis. To our best knowledge, personalization and privacy protection were achieved simultaneously for the first time under the federated scenario by integrating the PerFedAvg algorithm and designing the novel cyclic secure aggregation with the homomorphic encryption algorithm. To show the utility of PPPML-HMI, we applied it to a simulated classification task namely the classification of healthy people and patients from the RAD-ChestCT Dataset, and one real-world segmentation task namely the segmentation of lung infections from COVID-19 CT scans. For the real-world task, PPPML-HMI achieved $sim$5% higher Dice score on average compared to conventional FL under the heterogeneous scenario. Meanwhile, we applied the improved deep leakage from gradients to simulate adversarial attacks and showed the strong privacy-preserving capability of PPPML-HMI. By applying PPPML-HMI to both tasks with different neural networks, a varied number of users, and sample sizes, we further demonstrated the strong generalizability of PPPML-HMI.",

            "abstract": "Skin and subcutaneous diseases rank high among the leading contributors to the global burden of nonfatal diseases, impacting a considerable portion of the population. Nonetheless, the field of dermatology diagnosis faces three significant hurdles. Firstly, there is a shortage of dermatologists accessible to diagnose patients, particularly in rural regions. Secondly, accurately interpreting skin disease images poses a considerable challenge. Lastly, generating patient-friendly diagnostic reports is usually a time-consuming and labor-intensive task for dermatologists. To tackle these challenges, we present SkinGPT-4, which is the world's first interactive dermatology diagnostic system powered by an advanced visual large language model. SkinGPT-4 leverages a fine-tuned version of MiniGPT-4, trained on an extensive collection of skin disease images (comprising 52,929 publicly available and proprietary images) along with clinical concepts and doctors' notes. We designed a two-step training process to allow SkinGPT to express medical features in skin disease images with natural language and make accurate diagnoses of the types of skin diseases. With SkinGPT-4, users could upload their own skin photos for diagnosis, and the system could autonomously evaluate the images, identifies the characteristics and categories of the skin conditions, performs in-depth analysis, and provides interactive treatment recommendations. Meanwhile, SkinGPT-4's local deployment capability and commitment to user privacy also render it an appealing choice for patients in search of a dependable and precise diagnosis of their skin ailments. To demonstrate the robustness of SkinGPT-4, we conducted quantitative evaluations on 150 real-life cases, which were independently reviewed by certified dermatologists, and showed that SkinGPT-4 could provide accurate diagnoses of skin diseases. Though SkinGPT-4 is not a substitute for doctors, it could enhance users' comprehension of their medical conditions, facilitate improve communication between patients and doctors, expedite the diagnostic process for dermatologists, and potentially promote human-centred care and healthcare equity in underdeveloped areas.",

            "title": "Path to Medical AGI: Unify Domain-specific Medical LLMs with the Lowest Cost",
            "abstract": "Medical artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an emerging field that aims to develop systems specifically designed for medical applications that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks and domains. Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant step towards AGI. However, training cross-domain LLMs in the medical field poses significant challenges primarily attributed to the requirement of collecting data from diverse domains. This task becomes particularly difficult due to privacy restrictions and the scarcity of publicly available medical datasets. Here, we propose Medical AGI (MedAGI), a paradigm to unify domain-specific medical LLMs with the lowest cost, and suggest a possible path to achieve medical AGI. With an increasing number of domain-specific professional multimodal LLMs in the medical field being developed, MedAGI is designed to automatically select appropriate medical models by analyzing users' questions with our novel adaptive expert selection algorithm. It offers a unified approach to existing LLMs in the medical field, eliminating the need for retraining regardless of the introduction of new models. This characteristic renders it a future-proof solution in the dynamically advancing medical domain. To showcase the resilience of MedAGI, we conducted an evaluation across three distinct medical domains: dermatology diagnosis, X-ray diagnosis, and analysis of pathology pictures. The results demonstrated that MedAGI exhibited remarkable versatility and scalability, delivering exceptional performance across diverse domains. Our code is publicly available to facilitate further research at https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/MedAGI.",

            "abstract": "Revoking personal private data is one of the basic human rights, which has already been sheltered by several privacy-preserving laws in many countries. However, with the development of data science, machine learning and deep learning techniques, this right is usually neglected or violated as more and more patients\u2019 data are being collected and used for model training, especially in intelligent healthcare, thus making intelligent healthcare a sector where technology must meet the law, regulations, and privacy principles to ensure that the innovation is for the common good. In order to secure patients\u2019 right to be forgotten, we proposed a novel solution by using auditing to guide the forgetting process, where auditing means determining whether a dataset has been used to train the model and forgetting requires the information of a query dataset to be forgotten from the target model. We unified these two tasks by introducing a new approach called knowledge purification. To implement our solution, we developed AFS, a unified open-source software, which is able to evaluate and revoke patients\u2019 private data from pre-trained deep learning models. We demonstrated the generality of AFS by applying it to four tasks on different datasets with various data sizes and architectures of deep learning networks. The software is publicly available at https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/AFS.",
