This automation will allow us to develop intelligent systems to assist non-experts in getting useful information out of their own data. Our framework takes high-level questions, automatically elaborates them, and run the necessary analyses on the data. Our TGN10+ system implements that framework and was used to reproduce an analysis of behavioral, psychological, and physiological data of healthcare workers to uncover differences in subjects that can help improve their work conditions. TGN10+ can also be used to update the results when new data becomes available, and could be used to analyze new data using the same method. Our ultimate goal is to develop intelligent systems that will empower healthcare workers to analyze their own data, and ultimately anyone who wants to understand their own health and wellbeing.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background and Context Differences in children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 initial attitudes about computing and other STEM fields may form during middle school and shape decisions leading to career entry. Early emerging differences in career interest may propagate a lack of diversity in computer science and programming fields. Objective Though middle school is recognized as a formative period in the development of career interest, there appears to be a gap in research considering growth disparities in students\u2019 attitudes towards computer programming. We examine outcomes related to students\u2019 use of an e-learning platform designed to promote exposure to computer science content. We consider growth in middle school students\u2019 attitudes towards computer programming during an academic year while controlling for variation in key baseline factors. Method We tracked growth in attitudes towards computer programming among middle school students (N = 610; Mage = 12.07) in schools serving underrepresented minority (URM) students (74.7% URM) during an academic year in which they used an online platform curating computer programming educational content. Findings We found baseline differences in students\u2019 interest and aspirations toward computer programming on the basis of gender and underrepresented status, after controlling for math attitudes. There was evidence of initial growth in all four domains of computer programming attitudes, irrespective of gender or underrepresented status. Implications These findings provide a framework for studying changes in students\u2019 computer programming attitudes, which may help in addressing workforce participation disparities. Future work is needed to promote early computer programming attitudes among all students.",

            "abstract": "Women earn less than men in technical fields. Competing theories have been offered to explain this disparity. Some argue that women underperform in negotiating their salary, in-part due to language in job descriptions, called gender triggers, which leave women feeling disadvantaged in salary negotiations. Others point to structural and institutional bias: i.e., recruiters make better offers to men even when women exhibit equal negotiation skills. As a final salary is co-constructed though an interaction between employees and recruiters, it is difficult to disentangle these views. Here, we discuss how intelligent virtual agents serve as powerful methodological tools that lend new insight into this psychological debate. We use virtual negotiators to examine the impact of gender triggers on computer science (CS) undergraduates that engaged in a simulated salary negotiation with an automated recruiter. We find that, regardless of gender, CS students are reluctant to negotiate, and this hesitancy likely lowers their starting salary. Even when they negotiate, students show little skill in discovering tradeoffs that could enhance their salary, highlighting the need for negotiation training in technical fields. Most importantly, we find little evidence that gender triggers impact women's negotiated outcomes, at least within the field of CS. We argue that findings that emphasize women's individual deficits may reflect a lack of experimental control, which intelligent agents can help correct, and that structural and institutional explanations of inequity deserve greater attention.",

            "abstract": "Understanding an opponent's wants is crucial for maximizing the outcomes of a multi-issue negotiation. To do this, automated systems must build an \"opponent model\" from information conveyed during a negotiation. Bayesian and frequentist models are the most commonly used. Bayesian models have a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge about an opponent's preferences. However, frequentist models have outperformed Bayesian approaches in practice, dominating the yearly agent-verses-agent negotiation competitions. With growing interest in agents that negotiate with people, this presumed dominance needs to be revisited. Human opponents convey far less information than automated agents, and people often share similar preferences (e.g., in a salary negotiation, most people care the most about salary). Thus, the theoretical advantage of Bayesian approaches may translate into practice for agent-versus-human negotiation. In this work, we compare the performance of Bayesian models against a leading frequentist approach in an agent-versus-human multi-issue salary negotiation. Although we show that frequentist opponent models outperform Bayesian models when using a uniform prior, Bayesian approaches excel when using two common priors. The best performance is achieved with an empirically-derived prior (i.e., biasing the model space using the distribution of preferences found in past human negotiators). Yet, strong performance is also observed when using a \"fixed-pie bias\", the prior used by most human negotiators. We discuss the implication of these findings for research on human-agent negotiation.",

            "abstract": "Intelligent virtual agents have been developed to study, assess and teach a variety of human interpersonal skills. Here we examine the impact of an agent's perspective-taking sophistication on human negotiators. Good perspective-takers can discover creative solutions that benefit both parties, but many have difficulty with this skill. In particular, novices focus on explicit goal-statements (e.g., \"I want apples more than bananas\") but discount goal-relevant information implicit in the opponent's offers. Many human-agent negotiation agents similarly ignore implicit information. We examined the influence of implicit information on human negotiators by independently enhancing agents in two ways: do agents communicate implicit information and do they attend to implicit information communicated by users. We find that communicating implicit information seems to confuse user's perspective-taking ability, yet paradoxically, helps lead them to better outcomes. In contrast, an agent that attends to user's implicit communications shows better perspective-taking but fails to translate this into better outcomes. These results emphasize the challenges associated with implicit information. We discuss how these results impact the design of negotiation agents for applications, analysis and pedagogy.",

            "abstract": "Recent research shows that how we respond to other social actors depends on what sort of mind we ascribe to them. In this article we examine how perceptions of a virtual agent's mind shape behavior in human-agent negotiations. We varied descriptions and communicative behavior of virtual agents on two dimensions according to the mind perception theory:agency (cognitive aptitude) andpatiency (affective aptitude). Participants then engaged in negotiations with the different agents. People scored more points and engaged in shorter negotiations with agents described to be cognitively intelligent, and got lower points and had longer negotiations with agents that were described to be cognitively unintelligent. Accordingly, agents described as having low agency ended up earning more points than those with high agency. Within the negotiations themselves, participants sent more happy and surprise emojis and emotionally valenced messages to agents described to be emotional. This high degree of described patiency also affected perceptions of the agent's moral standing and relatability. In short, manipulating the perceived mind of agents affects how people negotiate with them. We discuss these results, which show that agents are perceived not only as social actors, but as intentional actors through negotiations.",

Virtual agents provide an opportuni-ty for students to practice their negotiation skills which leads to better outcomes. However, these negotiation training agents often lack the ability to understand the errors students make when negotiating, thus limiting their effectiveness as training tools. In this article, we argue that automated opponent-modeling techniques serve as effective methods for diagnos-ing important negotiation mistakes. To demonstrate this, we analyze a large number of participant traces generated while negotiating with a set of automated opponents. We show that negotiators' performance is closely tied to their understanding of an opponent's preferences. We further show that opponent modeling techniques can diagnose specific errors includ-ing: failure to elicit diagnostic information from an opponent, failure to utilize the information that was elicited, and failure to understand the transparency of an opponent. These results show that opponent modeling techniques can be effective methods for diagnosing and potentially correcting crucial ne-gotiation errors.",

            "abstract": "This work explores whether culture impacts the extent to which social dialogue can mitigate (or exacerbate) the loss of trust caused when agents make conversational errors. Our study uses an agent designed to persuade users to agree with its rankings on two tasks. Participants from the U.S. and Japan completed our study. We perform two manipulations: (1) The presence of conversational errors -- the agent exhibited errors in the second task or not; (2) The presence of social dialogue -- between the two tasks, users either engaged in a social dialogue with the agent or completed a control task. Replicating previous research, conversational errors reduce the agent's influence. However, we found that culture matters: there was a marginally significant three-way interaction with culture, presence of social dialogue, and presence of errors. The pattern of results suggests that, for American participants, social dialogue backfired if it is followed by errors, presumably because it extends the period of good performance, creating a stronger contrast effect with the subsequent errors. However, for Japanese participants, social dialogue if anything mitigates the detrimental effect of errors; the negative effect of errors is only seen in the absence of a social dialogue. Agent design should therefore take the culture of the intended users into consideration when considering use of social dialogue to bolster agents against conversational errors.",
