            "abstract": "Given a million-scale dataset of who-calls-whom data containing imperfect labels, how can we detect existing and new fraud patterns? We propose TgrApp, which extracts carefully designed features and provides visualizations to assist analysts in spotting fraudsters and suspicious behavior. Our TgrApp method has the following properties: (a) Scalable, as it is linear on the input size; and (b) Effective, as it allows natural interaction with human analysts, and is applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings.",

            "abstract": "Given a large, time-evolving graph of who-calls-whom-when, how can we help analysts find anomalies and fraudsters? How can we explain our decisions? We provide TgraphSpot, which carefully extracts features that are often related to fraud; and which provides informative, interactive plots that help analysts zoom down to the few strange nodes. We present the architecture and design decisions of TgraphSpot. Thanks to our careful feature-extraction algorithms, it scales linearly, taking 2.5 hours on a stock laptop, to process 29 million phone calls. More importantly, when applied on a real dataset of millions of phone calls, it discovered suspicious nodes; experts confirmed that those nodes are fraudsters that had been undetected so far.",
