            "title": "PERSONA: A Reproducible Testbed for Pluralistic Alignment",
            "abstract": "The rapid advancement of language models (LMs) necessitates robust alignment with diverse user values. However, current preference optimization approaches often fail to capture the plurality of user opinions, instead reinforcing majority viewpoints and marginalizing minority perspectives. We introduce PERSONA, a reproducible test bed designed to evaluate and improve pluralistic alignment of LMs. We procedurally generate diverse user profiles from US census data, resulting in 1,586 synthetic personas with varied demographic and idiosyncratic attributes. We then generate a large-scale evaluation dataset containing 3,868 prompts and 317,200 feedback pairs obtained from our synthetic personas. Leveraging this dataset, we systematically evaluate LM capabilities in role-playing diverse users, verified through human judges, and the establishment of both a benchmark, PERSONA Bench, for pluralistic alignment approaches as well as an extensive dataset to create new and future benchmarks. The full dataset and benchmarks are available here: https://www.synthlabs.ai/research/persona.",

            "abstract": "The increasing demand for personalized interactions with large language models (LLMs) calls for methodologies capable of accurately and efficiently identifying user opinions and preferences. Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.",

            "abstract": "Automatic response forecasting for news media plays a crucial role in enabling content producers to efficiently predict the impact of news releases and prevent unexpected negative outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. To effectively forecast responses, it is essential to develop measures that leverage the social dynamics and contextual information surrounding individuals, especially in cases where explicit profiles or historical actions of the users are limited (referred to as lurkers). As shown in a previous study, 97% of all tweets are produced by only the most active 25% of users. However, existing approaches have limited exploration of how to best process and utilize these important features. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, named SocialSense, that leverages a large language model to induce a belief-centered graph on top of an existent social network, along with graph-based propagation to capture social dynamics. We hypothesize that the induced graph that bridges the gap between distant users who share similar beliefs allows the model to effectively capture the response patterns. Our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art in experimental evaluations for both zero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in response forecasting. Moreover, the analysis reveals the framework's capability to effectively handle unseen user and lurker scenarios, further highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.",

            "abstract": "Predicting how a user responds to news events enables important applications such as allowing intelligent agents or content producers to estimate the effect on different communities and revise unreleased messages to prevent unexpected bad outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. We present a new task, Response Forecasting on Personas for News Media, to estimate the response a persona (characterizing an individual or a group) might have upon seeing a news message. Compared to the previous efforts which only predict generic comments to news, the proposed task not only introduces personalization in the modeling but also predicts the sentiment polarity and intensity of each response. This enables more accurate and comprehensive inference on the mental state of the persona. Meanwhile, the generated sentiment dimensions make the evaluation and application more reliable. We create the first benchmark dataset, which consists of 13,357 responses to 3,847 news headlines from Twitter. We further evaluate the SOTA neural language models with our dataset. The empirical results suggest that the included persona attributes are helpful for the performance of all response dimensions. Our analysis shows that the best-performing models are capable of predicting responses that are consistent with the personas, and as a byproduct, the task formulation also enables many interesting applications in the analysis of social network groups and their opinions, such as the discovery of extreme opinion groups.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present Tetris, a new task of Goal-Oriented Script Completion. Unlike previous work, it considers a more realistic and general setting, where the input includes not only the goal but also additional user context, including preferences and history. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, which uses two techniques to improve performance: (1) concept prompting, and (2) script-oriented contrastive learning that addresses step repetition and hallucination problems. On our WikiHow-based dataset, we find that both methods improve performance.",

            "abstract": "In view of the problem that the rapid growth of data makes it difficult for users to obtain information and the recommendation system lacks a perfect evaluation system, this paper puts forward an evaluation system of the recommendation system, through which the recommendation algorithm which is used more and more frequently is evaluated.Firstly, the evaluation index is set from online evaluation and offline evaluation separately; Secondly, the calculation method of each index is analyzed and designed; Finally, the two evaluation ideas are combined to form a complete recommendation system evaluation system. The establishment of recommendation system evaluation system is conducive to the comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation system and the improvement of the shortcomings, so as to enhance the user experience. Experimental results show that the proposed evaluation system can measure the advantages and disadvantages of each recommendation algorithm well.",

How to extract detailed knowledge about chemical reactions from the core chemistry literature is a new emerging challenge that has not been well studied. In this paper, we study the new problem of fine-grained chemical entity typing, which poses interesting new challenges especially because of the complex name mentions frequently occurring in chemistry literature and graphic representation of entities. We introduce a new benchmark data set (CHEMET) to facilitate the study of the new task and propose a novel multi-modal representation learning framework to solve the problem of fine-grained chemical entity typing by leveraging external resources with chemical structures and using cross-modal attention to learn effective representation of text in the chemistry domain. Experiment results show that the proposed framework outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods. 1",
