            "abstract": "We present ongoing work dealing with a Linked Data compliant representation of infrastructures using wordnets for connecting multilingual Sign Language data sets. We build for this on already existing RDF and OntoLex representations of Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) data sets and work done by the European EASIER research project on the use of the CSV files of OMW for linking glosses and basic semantic information associated with Sign Language data sets in two languages: German and Greek. In this context, we started the transformation into RDF of a Danish data set, which links Danish Sign Language data and the wordnet for Danish, DanNet. The final objective of our work is to include Sign Language data sets (and their conceptual cross-linking via wordnets) in the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.",

This development emerged from investigations on how to represent multimodal lexical data in the OntoLex-Lemon framework, with the goal to publish such data in the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud. While studying the literature and various sites dealing with sign languages, we saw the need to harmonise all the data categories (or features) defined and used in those sources, and to organise them in an ontology to which lexical descriptions in OntoLex-Lemon could be linked. We make the code of the first version of this ontology available, so that it can be further developed collaboratively by both the Linked Data and the SL communities",

In order to help improve the quality, coverage and performance of automated translation solutions for current and future Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) digital services, the European Language Resource Coordination (ELRC) was set up in 2015 through a service contract operating under the European Commission\u2019s CEF SMART 2014/1074 programme . Since then, ELRC initiated a number of actions to support the collection of Language Resources (LRs) within the public sector in EU member and CEF-affiliated countries. All resources shared by the contributors were gathered and curated in the ELRC-SHARE Re-pository, after having passed the validation process developed by ELRC. This paper provides insights into the overall data collection and curation process (including both technical and legal validation of resources) employed within ELRC. The ELRC Helpdesk provides both technical and legal guidance (e.g. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) clearance support) to potential data contributors, thus enabling the sustainable sharing of language data.",
