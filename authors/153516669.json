The goals of this paper are twofold: First, we build Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English-to-Greek and Greek-to-English based on the Transformer architecture. Second, we leverage these NMT models to produce English translations of Greek text as input for our NLP pipeline, to which we apply a series of pre-processing and triple extraction tasks. Finally, we back-translate the extracted triples to Greek. We conduct an evaluation of both our NMT and OIE methods on benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art for the Greek natural language.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things and the proliferation of easily compromisable IoT devices has led to a drastic increase in the occurrence of IoT-based botnet attacks. Hackers are keen on exploiting the vulnerabilities of smart devices, which are seen as easy targets often lacking robust security mechanisms. Identifying botnet activity is an active research topic and remains a challenging task due to the continuous evolution of botnet families that employ a large number of attack vectors. Traditional rule-based approaches which rely on signature matching, heuristics and behavioral profiling are always lagging one step behind the attacker, leading researchers to the development of machine and deep learning methods for the detection of compromised IoT device behaviour. In this paper, we model botnet traffic identification as an anomaly detection task, aiming at establishing a baseline of benign traffic, in order to detect unusual behavior using Netflow data. We propose a feature engineering and deep learning-based detection framework based on two Autoencoder architectures: (i) a vanilla implementation of a deep Autoencoder and (ii) GANomaly which has never been used in the context of network traffic analysis before. We validate the performance of the proposed methodology on the CICIDS2017 dataset which has been widely used for cybersecurity benchmarks and show that it is possible to induce highly accurate unsupervised learning models to detect previously unseen botnet behaviour.",

            "abstract": "Novel cybersecurity solutions tend to adopt new mechanisms from emerging fields in order to confront zero-day attacks and unknown signature threats. Deep learning techniques have attracted the interest of the cybersecurity domain, as they offer the flexibility to be trained for various objects and targets, amongst them network anomaly detection. Traditional network anomaly detection methods rely on predefined threats signature pattern, whereas deep learning ones can combine different attributes of network flows and packet payloads. In this paper a deep learning-based method for network anomaly detection is presented in the frame of the PALANTIR project. PALANTIR aims to develop an end-to-end cybersecurity solution for SMEs, providing virtualized security services for various attack threats. Regarding the current study, the proposed deep learning method was evaluated for its accuracy on two widely used security databases, performing anomaly detection, while performing flow monitoring. The developed framework shows promising results in terms of accuracy and sets the steppingstone for further adoption of deep learning mechanisms in the cybersecurity field.",

We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "Introduction This was a feasibility pilot study aiming to develop and validate an activity recognition system based on a custom-made body-fixed sensor and driven by an algorithm for recognising basic kinetic movements in military personnel. The findings of this study are deemed essential in informing our development process and contributing to our ultimate aim which is to develop a low-cost and easy-to-use body-fixed sensor for military applications. Methods Fifty military participants performed a series of trials involving walking, running and jumping under laboratory conditions in order to determine the optimal, among five machine learning (ML), classifiers. Thereafter, the accuracy of the classifier was tested towards the prediction of these movements (15\u2009183 measurements) and in relation to participants\u2019 gender and fitness level. Results Random forest classifier showed the highest training and validation accuracy (98.5% and 92.9%, respectively) and classified participants with differences in type of activity, gender and fitness level with an accuracy level of 83.6%, 70.0% and 62.2%, respectively. Conclusions The study showed that accurate prediction of various dynamic activities can be achieved with high sensitivity using a low-cost easy-to-use sensor and a specific ML model. While this technique is in a development stage, our findings demonstrate that our body-fixed sensor prototype alongside a fully trained validated algorithm can strategically support military operations and offer valuable information to commanders controlling operations remotely. Further stages of our developments include the validation of our refined technique on a larger range of military activities and groups by combining activity data with physiological variables to predict phenomena relating to the onset of fatigue and performance decline.",

            "abstract": "The usefulness of automated information extraction tools in generating structured knowledge from unstructured and semi-structured machine-readable documents is limited by challenges related to the variety and intricacy of the targeted entities, the complex linguistic features of heterogeneous corpora, and the computational availability for readily scaling to large amounts of text. In this paper, we argue that the redundancy and ambiguity of subject\u2013predicate\u2013object (SPO) triples in open information extraction systems has to be treated as an equally important step in order to ensure the quality and preciseness of generated triples. To this end, we propose a pipeline approach for information extraction from large corpora, encompassing a series of natural language processing tasks. Our methodology consists of four steps: i. in-place coreference resolution, ii. extractive text summarization, iii. parallel triple extraction, and iv. entity enrichment and graph representation. We manifest our methodology on a large medical dataset (CORD-19), relying on state-of-the-art tools to fulfil the aforementioned steps and extract triples that are subsequently mapped to a comprehensive ontology of biomedical concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our information extraction method by comparing it in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score with state-of-the-art OIE engines and demonstrate its capabilities on a set of data exploration tasks.",

            "abstract": "End-to-end machine learning pipelines that run in shared environments are challenging to implement. Production pipelines typically consist of multiple interdependent processing stages. Between stages, the intermediate results are persisted to reduce redundant computation and to improve robustness. Those results might come in the form of datasets for data processing pipelines or in the form of model coefficients in case of model training pipelines. Reusing persisted results improves efficiency but at the same time creates complicated dependencies. Every time one of the processing stages is changed, either due to code change or due to parameters change, it becomes difficult to find which datasets can be reused and which should be recomputed. In this paper we build upon previous work to produce derivations of datasets to ensure that multiple versions of a pipeline can run in parallel while minimizing the amount of redundant computations. Our extensions include partial derivations to simplify navigation and reuse, explicit support for schema changes of pipelines, and a central registry of running pipelines to coordinate upgrading pipelines between teams.",
