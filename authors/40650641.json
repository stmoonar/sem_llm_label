            "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognitive abilities and memory, especially in older adults. One of the challenges of AD is that it can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages. However, recent research has shown that changes in language, including speech decline and difficulty in processing information, can be important indicators of AD and may help with early detection. Hence, the speech narratives of the patients can be useful in diagnosing the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While the previous works have presented the potential of using speech narratives to diagnose AD in high-resource languages, this work explores the possibility of using a low-resourced language, i.e., Hindi language, to diagnose AD. In this paper, we present a dataset specifically for analyzing AD in the Hindi language, along with experimental results using various state-of-the-art algorithms to assess the diagnostic potential of speech narratives in Hindi. Our analysis suggests that speech narratives in the Hindi language have the potential to aid in the diagnosis of AD. Our dataset and code are made publicly available at https://github.com/rkritesh210/DementiaBankHindi.",

            "abstract": "Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have shown promising abilities to diagnose through a conversation with a patient like a human doctor would. However, current systems are mostly based on sequence modeling, which does not account for medical knowledge. This makes the systems more prone to misdiagnosis in case of diseases with limited information. To overcome this issue, we present MDKG, an end-to-end dialogue system for medical dialogue generation (MDG) specifically designed to adapt to new diseases by quickly learning and evolving a meta-knowledge graph that allows it to reason about disease-symptom correlations. Our approach relies on a medical knowledge graph to extract disease-symptom relationships and uses a dynamic graph-based meta-learning framework to learn how to evolve the given knowledge graph to reason about disease-symptom correlations. Our approach incorporates medical knowledge and hence reduces the need for a large number of dialogues. Evaluations show that our system outperforms existing approaches when tested on benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Graph-based techniques have gained traction for representing and analyzing data in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Knowledge graph-based language representation models have shown promising results in leveraging domain-specific knowledge for NLP tasks, particularly in the biomedical NLP field. However, such models have limitations, including knowledge noise and neglect of contextual relationships, leading to potential semantic errors and reduced accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes two novel methods. The first method combines knowledge graph-based language model with nearest-neighbor models to incorporate semantic and category information from neighboring instances. The second method involves integrating knowledge graph-based language model with graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage feature information from neighboring nodes in the graph. Experiments on relation extraction (RE) and classification tasks in English and Chinese language datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements with both methods, highlighting their potential for enhancing the performance of language models and improving NLP applications in the biomedical domain.",

            "abstract": "Text-embedded images are frequently used on social media to convey opinions and emotions, but they can also be a medium for disseminating hate speech, propaganda, and extremist ideologies. During the Russia-Ukraine war, both sides used text-embedded images extensively to spread propaganda and hate speech. To aid in moderating such content, this paper introduces CrisisHateMM, a novel multimodal dataset of over 4,700 text-embedded images from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, annotated for hate and non-hate speech. The hate speech is annotated for directed and undirected hate speech, with directed hate speech further annotated for individual, community, and organizational targets. We benchmark the dataset using unimodal and multimodal algorithms, providing insights into the effectiveness of different approaches for detecting hate speech in text-embedded images. Our results show that multimodal approaches outperform unimodal approaches in detecting hate speech, highlighting the importance of combining visual and textual features. This work provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in automated content moderation and social media analysis.

            "abstract": "Contrary to expectations that the increased connectivity offered by the internet and particularly Online Social Networks (OSNs) would result in broad consensus on contentious issues, we instead frequently observe the formation of polarised echo chambers, in which only one side of an argument is entertained. These can progress to filter bubbles, actively filtering contrasting opinions, resulting in vulnerability to misinformation and increased polarisation on social and political issues. These have real-world effects when they spread offline, such as vaccine hesitation and violence. This work seeks to develop a better understanding of how echo chambers manifest in different discussions dealing with different issues over an extended period of time. We explore the activities of two groups of polarised accounts across three Twitter discussions in the Australian context. We found Australian Twitter accounts arguing against marriage equality in 2017 were more likely to support the notion that arsonists were the primary cause of the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires, and those supporting marriage equality argued against that arson narrative. We also found strong evidence that the stance people took on marriage equality in 2017 did not predict their political stance in discussions around the Australian federal election two years later. Although mostly isolated from each other, we observe that in certain situations the polarised groups may interact with the broader community, which offers hope that the echo chambers may be reduced with concerted outreach to members.",

            "abstract": "People turn to search engines and social media to seek information during population-level events, such as during civil unrest, disease outbreaks, fires, or flood. They also tend to participate in discussions and disseminate information and opinions via social media forums, and smartphone messaging applications. COVID-19 pandemic was not any different. However, the proper medical awareness and correct information dissemination is critical during a pandemic. An unprecedented amount of internet traffic related to this topic was generated during the start of the pandemic all over the world. In this work, we have analysed the electronic data generated by users from Pakistan on Google Search Engine and WhatsApp to understand their information-seeking behavior during the first wave of the pandemic. The paper aims at analysing how the Pakistani public developed their understanding about the disease, (its origin, cures, and preventive measures to name a few) by analysing digital data. We found that the public actively searched and discussed information at the start of the pandemic. However, their interest waned with time and was reinvigorated only when something novel or shocking seemed to have occurred. Understanding this information seeking behavior will allow corrective actions to be taken by health policymakers to better inform the public for possible future waves of a pandemic through electronic media, as well as and the social media companies and search engines to address misinformation among the users in the emergent markets.",

            "abstract": "Executive managers are not all equipped with the cyber security expertise necessary to enable them to make business decisions that accurately represent the status and needs of the cyber security side of the business. Unfortunately, the lack of understanding between the business and cyber security domains contribute to structurally endorsed vulnerabilities within a business context, where either the business needs were considered without understanding the impact on cyber security, or alternatively, the cyber security needs were considered without fully understanding the impact this would have on the business strategy and financial stability. To combat this dilemma, a gamified approach to cyber security training for executives is proposed as a solution to not only minimise the realisation of cyber vulnerabilities within a business context, but also to improve business outcomes that are supported by cyber security measures. We developed a serious game software platform, Aurelius, to simulate an executive decision maker\u2019s role in managing the everyday cyber security investment decisions, and linking that to business metrics to incorporate the business and cyber security understanding. Our game includes simulated cyber security attacks that would require the executive decision maker (the player) to respond appropriately. The algorithms underpinning our simulated cyber security game are a product of a complex systems approach, as this most accurately models an executive\u2019s experience. In our design, we set up Aurelius to fulfil eight of the nine criteria specified for a state of the art serious game in the cyber security domain.",

We present a case study around the hashtag #ArsonEmergency, collected from Australian Twittersphere during the unprecedented bushfires of 2019/2020. The dataset consists of two polarised groups and one unaffiliated group. We examine the linguistic style, moral language, and happiness profiles of 1786 users active during this catastrophic event.

            "title": "Systematic Literature Review on Cyber Situational Awareness Visualizations",
            "abstract": "The dynamics of cyber threats are increasingly complex, making it more challenging than ever for organizations to obtain in-depth insights into their cyber security status. Therefore, organizations rely on Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) to support them in better understanding the threats and associated impacts of cyber events. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of cyber security data, often with multidimensional attributes, sophisticated visualization techniques are needed to achieve CSA. However, there have been no previous attempts to systematically review and analyze the scientific literature on CSA visualizations. In this paper, we systematically select and review 54 publications that discuss visualizations to support CSA. We extract data from these papers to identify key stakeholders, information types, data sources, and visualization techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the level of CSA supported by the visualizations, alongside examining the maturity of the visualizations, challenges, and practices related to CSA visualizations to prepare a full analysis of the current state of CSA in an organizational context. Our results reveal certain gaps in CSA visualizations. For instance, the largest focus is on operational-level staff, and there is a clear lack of visualizations targeting other types of stakeholders such as managers, higher-level decision makers, and non-expert users. Most papers focus on threat information visualization, and there is a dearth of papers that visualize impact information, response plans, and information shared within teams. Interestingly, we find that only a few studies proposed visualizations to facilitate up to the projection level (i.e., the highest level of CSA), whereas most studies facilitated only the perception level (i.e., the lowest level of CSA). Most of the studies provide evidence of the proposed visualizations through toy examples and demonstrations, while only a few visualizations are employed in industrial practice. Based on the results that highlight the important concerns in CSA visualizations, we recommend a list of future research directions.",

            "abstract": "In order to study the effects of Online Social Network (OSN) activity on real-world offline events, researchers need access to OSN data, the reliability of which has particular implications for social network analysis. This relates not only to the completeness of any collected dataset, but also to constructing meaningful social and information networks from them. In this multidisciplinary study, we consider the question of constructing traditional social networks from OSN data and then present a measurement case study showing how the reliability of OSN data affects social network analyses. To this end we developed a systematic comparison methodology, which we applied to two parallel datasets we collected from Twitter. We found considerable differences in datasets collected with different tools and that these variations significantly alter the results of subsequent analyses. Our results lead to a set of guidelines for researchers planning to collect online data streams to infer social networks.",
