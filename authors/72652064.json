            "abstract": "In this article, a method of extending airborne weather radar modeling to incorporate high-ice-water-content (HIWC) conditions has been developed. A novel aspect is incorporating flight test measurement data, including forward-looking radar measurements and in situ microphysics probes data, into the model and part of the evaluations of modeling. The simulation models assume a dual-polarized, airborne forward-looking radar, while for single-polarized operations, the index-of-dispersion is included as a helpful indicator for HIWC detection. The radar system simulation models are useful for design evaluations for the next generation of airborne aviation hazard monitoring and incorporate HIWC hazard detection algorithms. Example applications of the simulator, such as hazard detection based on the simulated HIWC flight encounter scenarios based on specific numeric weather prediction (NWP) model outputs, are discussed.",

The specific radar being developed is the \u201cPARADOX\u201d radar, which is based on the GSX-70 and GSX-80 radar system hardware from Garmin International. The processing framework is designed to enhance the resolution, improve signal processing, and achieve \u201cresearch-grade\u201d data quality control for both application domains. The processing framework is also applicable to other multi-mission radars that seek optimal weather measurement performance using hardware designed for other functions.

            "title": "Matched filter based iterative adaptive approach",
            "abstract": "Matched Filter sidelobes from diversified LPI waveform design and sensor resolution are two important considerations in radars and active sensors in general. Matched Filter sidelobes can potentially mask weaker targets, and low sensor resolution not only causes a high margin of error but also limits sensing in target-rich environment/ sector. The improvement in those factors, in part, concern with the transmitted waveform and consequently pulse compression techniques. An adaptive pulse compression algorithm is hence desired that can mitigate the aforementioned limitations. A new Matched Filter based Iterative Adaptive Approach, MF-IAA, as an extension to traditional Iterative Adaptive Approach, IAA, has been developed. MF-IAA takes its input as the Matched Filter output. The motivation here is to facilitate implementation of Iterative Adaptive Approach without disrupting the processing chain of traditional Matched Filter. Similar to IAA, MF-IAA is a user parameter free, iterative, weighted least square based spectral identification algorithm. This work focuses on the implementation of MF-IAA. The feasibility of MF-IAA is studied using a realistic airborne radar simulator as well as actual measured airborne radar data. The performance of MF-IAA is measured with different test waveforms, and different Signal-to-Noise (SNR) levels. In addition, Range-Doppler super-resolution using MF-IAA is investigated. Sidelobe reduction as well as super-resolution enhancement is validated. The robustness of MF-IAA with respect to different LPI waveforms and SNR levels is also demonstrated.",

            "title": "Efficient pulse compression for LPI waveforms based on a nonparametric iterative adaptive approach",
            "abstract": "In order to achieve low probability-of-intercept (LPI), radar waveforms are usually long and randomly generated. Due to the randomized nature, Matched filter responses (autocorrelation) of those waveforms can have high sidelobes which would mask weaker targets near a strong target, limiting radar\u2019s ability to distinguish close-by targets. To improve resolution and reduced sidelobe contaminations, a waveform independent pulse compression filter is desired. Furthermore, the pulse compression filter needs to be able to adapt to received signal to achieve optimized performance. As many existing pulse techniques require intensive computation, real-time implementation is infeasible. This paper introduces a new adaptive pulse compression technique for LPI waveforms that is based on a nonparametric iterative adaptive approach (IAA). Due to the nonparametric nature, no parameter tuning is required for different waveforms. IAA can achieve super-resolution and sidelobe suppression in both range and Doppler domains. Also it can be extended to directly handle the matched filter (MF) output (called MF-IAA), which further reduces the computational load. The practical impact of LPI waveform operations on IAA and MF-IAA has not been carefully studied in previous work. Herein the typical LPI waveforms such as random phase coding and other non- PI waveforms are tested with both single-pulse and multi-pulse IAA processing. A realistic airborne radar simulator as well as actual measured radar data are used for the validations. It is validated that in spite of noticeable difference with different test waveforms, the IAA algorithms and its improvement can effectively achieve range-Doppler super-resolution in realistic data.",

            "abstract": "We discuss results from a high-sensitivity, multichannel, very high frequency, and surface-based radar depth sounder/imager. The instrument was used to map deep internal layers and characterize basal conditions over a 240- km2 grid in the vicinity of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core site. The ice thickness at the core site was found to be about 3470 m, and we detected internal layers to within 350 m of the ice/bed interface. Radar-detected layer stratigraphy does not show evidence of flow-induced disturbances that might complicate the depth-age relationship and the interpretation of climate history preserved in the ice. We also found that bed reflectivity over the region varies by more than 30 dB. Approximately 15 dB of this variability appears to be the result of transitions from a frozen to a thawed bed in a number of places. The remainder probably results from changes in bed roughness. Our data are important for planning drilling to the bed, as well as providing constraints and boundary conditions for regional ice-flow models.",

            "abstract": "In August of 2008 a radar survey was conducted at the NEEM site in Greenland. An example echogram showing internal layers all the way to the bed, a digital elevation map around the drill site, and a side looking synthetic aperture radar image will be presented. The echogram appears to show a fairly continuous Eemian layer where predicted by modeling. Additionally the area around the drill site is very flat although some slope variation is observed. Finally side looking SAR images show reflected power variations that need more analysis to determine their source.",

            "abstract": "Sea-level rise will affect populations worldwide with considerable and lasting consequences in the not-too-distant future. Accurate measurement of fast flowing outlet glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica are of vital importance to ice sheet models that predict the course of sea-level rise. The Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) has developed a suite of tools designed for use with data collected by CReSIS depth sounding radar platforms. This suite includes algorithms for removing clutter and noise from coherent radar data, and the results show successful sounding of some of these fast-flowing glaciers for the first time.",
