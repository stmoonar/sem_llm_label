            "abstract": "Trajectory data combines the complexities of time series, spatial data, and (sometimes irrational) movement behavior. As data availability and computing power have increased, so has the popularity of deep learning from trajectory data. This review paper provides the first comprehensive overview of deep learning approaches for trajectory data. We have identified eight specific mobility use cases which we analyze with regards to the deep learning models and the training data used. Besides a comprehensive quantitative review of the literature since 2018, the main contribution of our work is the data-centric analysis of recent work in this field, placing it along the mobility data continuum which ranges from detailed dense trajectories of individual movers (quasi-continuous tracking data), to sparse trajectories (such as check-in data), and aggregated trajectories (crowd information).",

            "abstract": "Post-hoc explainability methods aim to clarify predictions of black-box machine learning models. However, it is still largely unclear how well users comprehend the provided explanations and whether these increase the users ability to predict the model behavior. We approach this question by conducting a user study to evaluate comprehensibility and predictability in two widely used tools: LIME and SHAP. Moreover, we investigate the effect of counterfactual explanations and misclassifications on users ability to understand and predict the model behavior. We find that the comprehensibility of SHAP is significantly reduced when explanations are provided for samples near a model's decision boundary. Furthermore, we find that counterfactual explanations and misclassifications can significantly increase the users understanding of how a machine learning model is making decisions. Based on our findings, we also derive design recommendations for future post-hoc explainability methods with increased comprehensibility and predictability.",

            "abstract": "Coating chambers create thin layers that improve the mechanical and optical surface properties in jewelry production using physical vapor deposition. In such a process, evaporated material condensates on the walls of such chambers and, over time, causes mechanical defects and unstable processes. As a result, manufacturers perform extensive maintenance procedures to reduce production loss. Current rule-based maintenance strategies neglect the impact of specific recipes and the actual condition of the vacuum chamber. Our overall goal is to predict the future condition of the coating chamber to allow cost and quality optimized maintenance of the equipment. This paper describes the derivation of a novel health indicator that serves as a step toward condition-based maintenance for coating chambers. We indirectly use gas emissions of the chamber\u2019s contamination to evaluate the machine\u2019s condition. Our approach relies on process data and does not require additional hardware installation. Further, we evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms for a condition-based forecast of the health indicator that also reflects production planning. Our results show that models based on decision trees are the most effective and outperform all three benchmarks, improving at least 0.22 in the mean average error. Our work paves the way for cost and quality optimized maintenance of coating applications.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC), the task of identifying the scene of an audio recording from its acoustic signature. In particular, we firstly propose an inception-based and low footprint ASC model, referred to as the ASC baseline. The proposed ASC baseline is then compared with benchmark and high-complexity network architectures of MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50V2, ResNet152V2, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, and Xception. Next, we improve the ASC baseline by proposing a novel deep neural network architecture which leverages residual-inception architectures and multiple kernels. Given the novel residual-inception (NRI) model, we further evaluate the trade off between the model complexity and the model accuracy performance. Finally, we evaluate whether sound events occurring in a sound scene recording can help to improve ASC accuracy, then indicate how a sound scene context is well presented by combining both sound scene and sound event information. We conduct extensive experiments on various ASC datasets, including Crowded Scenes, IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2018 Task 1A and 1B, 2019 Task 1A and 1B, 2020 Task 1A, 2021 Task 1A, 2022 Task 1. The experimental results on several different ASC challenges highlight two main achievements; the first is to propose robust, general, and low complexity ASC systems which are suitable for real-life applications on a wide range of edge devices and mobiles; the second is to propose an effective visualization method for comprehensively presenting a sound scene context.",

After training the teacher, the embeddings, which are the feature map of the second last layer of the teacher, are extracted. In the second phase, the student network, which presents a low complexity model, is trained with the embeddings extracted from the teacher.

However, gathering labeled training data for supervised tasks such as anomaly detection is costly and often difficult to implement in operational environments. Therefore, this work aims to design and implement a solution that reduces the required amount of data for training anomaly classification models on time series sensor data and thereby brings down the overall deployment effort of IoT anomaly detection sensors. We set up several in-lab experiments using three peristaltic pumps and investigated approaches for transferring trained anomaly detection models across assets of the same type. Our experiments achieved promising effectiveness and provide initial evidence that transfer learning could be a suitable strategy for using pre-trained anomaly classification models across industrial assets of the same type with minimal prior labeling and training effort. This work could serve as a starting point for more general, pre-trained sensor data embeddings, applicable to a wide range of assets.",

Three spectrograms are then fed into threeindividual back-end convolutional neural networks (CNNs),classifying into ten urban scenes. Finally, a late fusion ofthree predicted probabilities obtained from three CNNs isconducted to achieve the final classification result. To reducethe complexity of our proposed CNN network, we applytwo model compression techniques: model restriction anddecomposed convolution.

            "title": "Minimal-Configuration Anomaly Detection for IIoT Sensors",
            "abstract": "The increasing deployment of low-cost IoT sensor platforms in industry boosts the demand for anomaly detection solutions that fulfill two key requirements: minimal configuration effort and easy transferability across equipment. Recent advances in deep learning, especially long-short-term memory (LSTM) and autoencoders, offer promising methods for detecting anomalies in sensor data recordings. We compared autoencoders with various architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), LSTMs and convolutional neural networks (CNN) using a simple benchmark dataset, which we generated by operating a peristaltic pump under various operating conditions and inducing anomalies manually. Our preliminary results indicate that a single model can detect anomalies under various operating conditions on a four-dimensional data set without any specific feature engineering for each operating condition. We consider this work as being the first step towards a generic anomaly detection method, which is applicable for a wide range of industrial equipment.",
