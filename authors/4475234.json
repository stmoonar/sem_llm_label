            "abstract": "We demonstrate COVIZ , an interactive system to visually form and explore patient cohorts. COVIZ seamlessly integrates visual cohort formation and exploration, making it a single destination for hypothesis generation. COVIZ is easy to use by medical experts and o\ufb00ers many features: (1) It provides the ability to isolate patient demographics (e.g., their age group and location), health markers (e.g., their body mass index), and treatments (e.g., Ventilation for respiratory problems), and hence facilitates cohort formation; (2) It summarizes the evolution of treatments of a cohort into health trajectories, and lets medical experts explore those trajectories; (3) It guides them in examining di\ufb00erent facets of a cohort and generating hypotheses for future analysis; (4) Finally, it provides the ability to compare the statistics and health trajectories of multiple cohorts at once. COVIZ relies on QDS , a novel data structure that encodes and indexes various data distributions to enable their e\ufb03cient retrieval. Additionally, COVIZ visualizes air quality data in the regions where patients live to help with data interpretations. We demonstrate two key scenarios. In the ecological scenario , we show how COVIZ can be used to explore patient data to generate hypotheses on the health evolution of cohorts. In the case cross-over scenario , we show how COVIZ can be used to generate hypotheses on cohort health and pollution data.

            "title": "A Systematic Comparison of Linear Regression\u2013Based Statistical Methods to Assess Exposome-Health Associations",
            "abstract": "Background: The exposome constitutes a promising framework to improve understanding of the effects of environmental exposures on health by explicitly considering multiple testing and avoiding selective reporting. However, exposome studies are challenged by the simultaneous consideration of many correlated exposures. Objectives: We compared the performances of linear regression\u2013based statistical methods in assessing exposome-health associations. Methods: In a simulation study, we generated 237 exposure covariates with a realistic correlation structure and with a health outcome linearly related to 0 to 25 of these covariates. Statistical methods were compared primarily in terms of false discovery proportion (FDP) and sensitivity. Results: On average over all simulation settings, the elastic net and sparse partial least-squares regression showed a sensitivity of 76% and an FDP of 44%; Graphical Unit Evolutionary Stochastic Search (GUESS) and the deletion/substitution/addition (DSA) algorithm revealed a sensitivity of 81% and an FDP of 34%. The environment-wide association study (EWAS) underperformed these methods in terms of FDP (average FDP, 86%) despite a higher sensitivity. Performances decreased considerably when assuming an exposome exposure matrix with high levels of correlation between covariates. Conclusions: Correlation between exposures is a challenge for exposome research, and the statistical methods investigated in this study were limited in their ability to efficiently differentiate true predictors from correlated covariates in a realistic exposome context. Although GUESS and DSA provided a marginally better balance between sensitivity and FDP, they did not outperform the other multivariate methods across all scenarios and properties examined, and computational complexity and flexibility should also be considered when choosing between these methods.
