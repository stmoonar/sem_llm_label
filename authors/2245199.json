            "title": "Managing Diverse Sentiments at Large Scale",
            "abstract": "The large-scale aggregation and analysis of user opinions is becoming increasingly relevant to a variety of applications, from detecting social mood on some political topics to tracking their sentiment changes related to events. The analysis of diverse sentiments is another important application, which becomes possible based on the ability of modern methods to capture sentiment polarity on various topics with high precision and on the ever-growing scale. Therefore, there is a need for a scalable way of sentiment aggregation with respect to the time dimension, which stores enough information to preserve diversity, and which allows statistically accurate analysis of sentiment trends and opinion shifts. In this paper, we are focusing on the novel problem of aggregating diverse sentiments at a large scale, based on data sources that are continuously updated. First, we develop a theoretical framework that models sentiment diversity (contradiction) and defines two types of contradictions, depending on the distribution of sentiments over time. Second, we introduce novel measures that capture sentiment diversity from aggregated sentiment statistics. Third, we develop robust and scalable indexing and storage methods for diverse sentiments. Finally, we propose an adaptive approach for identifying contradictions at different time scales. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method of capturing contradictions and its superiority over relational databases in real-world scenarios.",

Which of the other hundreds of events spread around in Milano shall you attend now? This paper presents a system able to recommend venues to the visitors of such a city-scale event based on the digital footprints they left on Social Media. By combining deductive and inductive stream reasoning techniques with visitor-modeling functionality, this system semantically analyses and links visitors' social network activities to produce high-quality recommendations even when information about visitors' preferences for venues and events is sparse.",

In this paper, we study the dynamics of news events and their relation to changes of sentiment expressed on relevant topics. We propose a novel framework, which models the behavior of news and social media in response to events as a convolution between event's importance and media response function, specific to media and event type. This framework is suitable for detecting time and duration of events, as well as their impact and dynamics, from time series of publication volume. These data can greatly enhance events analysis; for instance, they can help distinguish important events from unimportant, or predict sentiment and stock market shifts. As an example of such application, we extracted news events for a variety of topics and then correlated this data with the corresponding sentiment time series, revealing the connection between sentiment shifts and event dynamics.",

            "abstract": "In the past years we have witnessed Sentiment Analytics becoming increasingly popular topic in Information Retrieval, which has established itself as a promising direction of research. \nWith the rapid growth of the user-generated content represented in blogs, forums, social networks and micro-blogs, it became a useful tool for social studies, market analysis and reputation management, since it made possible capturing sentiments and opinions at a large scale and with the ever-growing precision. \nSentiment Analytics came a long way from product review mining to full-fledged multi-dimensional analysis of social sentiment, exposing people attitude towards any topic aggregated along different dimensions, such as time and demographics. \n \nThe novelty of our work is that it approaches Sentiment Analytics from the perspective of Data Mining, addressing some important problems which fall out of the scope of Opinion Mining. \nWe develop a framework for Large Scale Aggregated Sentiment Analytics, which allows to capture and quantify important changes in aggregated sentiments or in their dynamics, evaluate demographical aspects of these changes, and explain the underlying events and mechanisms which drive them. \nThe first component of our framework is Contradiction Analysis, which studies diverse opinions and their interaction, and allows tracking the quality of aggregated sentiment or detecting interesting sentiment differences. \nTargeting large scale applications, we develop a sentiment contradiction measure based on the statistical properties of sentiment and allowing efficient computation from aggregated sentiments. \nAnother important component of our framework addresses the problem of monitoring and explaining temporal sentiment variations. \nAlong this direction, we propose novel time series correlation methods tailored specifically for large scale analysis of sentiments aggregated over users demographics. \nOur methods help to identify interesting correlation patterns between demographic groups and thus better understand the demographical aspect of sentiment dynamics. \nWe bring another interesting dimension to the problem of sentiment evolution by studying the joint dynamics of sentiments and news, uncovering the importance of news events and assessing their impact on sentiments. \nWe propose a novel and universal way of modeling different media and their dynamics, which aims to describe the information propagation in news- and social media. \nFinally, we propose and evaluate an updateable method of sentiment aggregation and retrieval, which preserves important properties of aggregated sentiments and also supports scalability and performance requirements of our applications.",

            "abstract": "Analyzing sentiments of demographic groups is becoming important for the Social Web, where millions of users provide opinions on a wide variety of content. While several approaches exist for mining sentiments from product reviews or micro-blogs, little attention has been devoted to aggregating and comparing extracted sentiments for different demographic groups over time, such as 'Students in Italy' or 'Teenagers in Europe'. This problem demands efficient and scalable methods for sentiment aggregation and correlation, which account for the evolution of sentiment values, sentiment bias, and other factors associated with the special characteristics of web data. We propose a scalable approach for sentiment indexing and aggregation that works on multiple time granularities and uses incrementally updateable data structures for online operation. Furthermore, we describe efficient methods for computing meaningful sentiment correlations, which exploit pruning based on demographics and use top-k correlations compression techniques. We present an extensive experimental evaluation with both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pruning techniques and the efficiency of our solution.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases. A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive item sets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the item set space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and delicious, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains.",

It can be used to analyze and track sentiment evolution over time, to identify interesting trends and patterns or even to enable argument extraction. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing contradictions on noisy data.

We describe an approach for solving the above problem, which consists of the following steps. We first introduce a technique for topic and opinion extraction that operates at the sentence level. Then, we propose a novel measure for contradictions that can effectively aggregate the relevant information from the weblog posts. We discuss its properties, and show how it can be used to detect two different types of contradictions, namely, simultaneous contradictions, and change of sentiment. Finally, we describe an efficient data structure for answering queries related to contradiction detection, and show that it has the additional property of being incrementally maintainable.
