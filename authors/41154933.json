            "abstract": "In this article, an open-circuit fault diagnostic method is proposed for three-phase permanent magnet machines. By individually applying inverse coordination transformation to d- and q-axis currents, per-phase current can be decomposed into flux- and torque-producing currents. Their postfault behaviors are found to be highly related with the fault types and locations. Hence, the normalized flux-producing current can be used as a single fault index to detect and identify both open-switch and open-phase faults. Since the established fault index is close to zero, the proposed fault diagnostic method is naturally robust to load/speed variations. In addition, a low decision threshold can be set to reduce fault diagnostic time. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by the experiments on one prototype.",

            "abstract": "For prognostics and health management of industrial systems, machine remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an essential task. While deep learning-based methods have achieved great successes in RUL prediction tasks, large-scale neural networks are still difficult to deploy on edge devices owing to the constraints of memory capacity and computing power. In this article, we propose a lightweight and adaptive knowledge distillation (KD) framework to alleviate this problem. First, multiple teacher models are compressed into a student model through KD to improve the industrial prediction accuracy. Second, a dynamic exiting method is studied to enable an adaptive inference on the distilled student model. Finally, we develop a reparameterization scheme to further lessen the student network. Experiments on two turbofan engine degradation datasets and a bearing degradation dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and enables the distilled model with an adaptive inference ability.",

However, health information is considered highly sensitive. How to securely store and dynamically process massive patients\u2019 PHR data in a public cloud environment has become one of the most important challenges. Therefore, we introduce a novel solution to the problems of privacy exposure, data security and flexible access of storage modules in medical systems. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving certificateless broadcast encryption with authorization for the PHR system, which is the best approach to effectively solve the above problems and avoid key escrow. In our work, users (patients) outsource their encrypted data to the cloud server and reallocate data accessing rights of recipients through an authorization set, sharing with a group of authorized receivers (doctors) in a secure and efficient manner. In addition, it is shown to be capable of achieving both plaintext confidentiality and receiver anonymity under the random oracle model. Moreover, the experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme enjoys low computational and communication overhead, indicating the feasibility and practicality of the scheme.",

            "abstract": "Recent advance of deep learning has seen remarkable progress in compound fault diagnosis modeling for industrial robots. Nevertheless, the data scarcity of compound fault samples jeopardizes the modeling performance of deep learning algorithms. Meta-learning has become an effective tool in few-shot fault diagnosis modeling. However, due to the training instability of meta-learning, it is challenging to deploy advanced networks such as transformers as the base learner due to the extremely large model size. Therefore, this study proposes a lightweight convolutional transformers (LCT) network enhanced meta-learning (Meta-LCT) method to achieve accurate compound fault diagnosis with limited compound fault samples. Specifically, the LCT is first designed by taking the advantage of linear spatial reduction (LSR) attention and spatial pooling mechanism to achieve high computational efficiency. LCT is adopted as the base learner in the Meta-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, and then, the meta-training is performed based on the single fault data. Subsequently, the limited compound fault samples are used in the meta testing stage to obtain a compound fault diagnosis model. An experimental study based on the real-world compound fault dataset of industrial robots is presented. The experimental results indicate that the proposed Meta-LCT can achieve the compound fault diagnosis accuracy of 81.1% when only 40 data samples in each compound fault category are available.",

A soft synchronization frequency modulated continuous wave (SS-FMCW) radar has a wider application prospect in HMR by virtue of its signal diversity and structural flexibility. In this article, a new spatiotemporal weighted micro-Doppler (SWMD) spectrum is proposed, which is more competitive for the application of the SS-FMCW radar in HMR. First, to facilitate the understanding of the SWMD spectrum construction method, we introduce the principle behind the SS-FMCW radar based on intermittent ramp signals. Specifically, the SWMD spectrum is constructed by a weighted data fusion algorithm and a time series data fusion algorithm. In addition, we collect data from six different motions from eight testers and demonstrate and analyze the validity of the SWMD spectrum by multiple dimensions. The experimental results show that compared with the conventional time micro-Doppler (MD) spectrum, the accuracy of the SWMD spectrum in HMR is improved by about 7.2%, which is an average of multiple comparison experiments of different classification algorithms with different features.",

Therefore, effective climate adaptation strategies for urban rail transit (URT) should be adopted to cope with extreme precipitation events (EPEs). This study proposes a decision-making model based on climate change for drainage renovation, which consists of an optimal renovation sequence model and an optimal investment timing model. This study analyzes the inundation risk of each station and its node importance in the URT network and then uses a multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) to determine the optimal renovation sequence. This study also uses a real options pricing approach to calculate the value of an option in order to defer the renovation project and determine the optimal investment timing. Then, the Beijing Urban Rail Transit (BURT) is taken as an example to conduct an empirical analysis of the proposed model. Considering the uncertainty of climate change and the complexity of the URT network, the model can obtain the optimal renovation sequence and the investment timing of each station, which is expected to provide a decision-making tool for urban governments to formulate an optimal plan that strengthens the prevention of flooding disasters.",

Supervised MAR methods don\u2019t perform well in clinical due to the domain gap between simulated and clinical data. Although this problem can be avoided in an unsupervised way, severe artifacts cannot be well suppressed. Semi-supervised MAR methods can alleviate the domain gap problem. However, the existing ones are usually accompanied by boosted model scale, which is challenging for optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework for MAR, termed SemiMAR. First, we only use one generator to learn the clean part, instead of multiple encoders and decoders disentangling artifacts. Thus, the model naturally becomes much smaller. To recover more tissue details, the advanced dual-domain MAR network knowledge is distilled into our model in both the image domain and latent feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our model.",

Although transformer-based models have demonstrated strong ability in natural image classification, transformer-based methods on VHR aerial image tasks are still lack of concern because the complexity of self-attention in the transformer grows quadratically with the image resolution. To address this issue, we decompose the self-attention via Fourier Transform and propose a novel Fourier self-attention (FSA) mechanism. Based on FSA, we design a highly efficient network named DecomFormer, which learns contextual relationships in the real part and imaginary part of the Fourier field, respectively. Theoretically, the DecomFormer reduces the complexity of the naive self-attention mechanism from O(n2) to O(nlog(n)). Universal experiments on public VHR aerial image classification benchmarks demonstrated the DecomFormer\u2019s efficiency, especially on images with very high-resolution.",

Although there are existing methods that aim to conceal identifiable information by adding adversarial perturbations to faces, they suffer from noticeable distortions that significantly compromise visual perception, and therefore, offer limited protection to privacy. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of appearance anxiety on social media has led to users preferring to beautify their faces before uploading images. In this paper, we design a novel face database protection scheme via beautification with chaotic systems. Specifically, we construct the adversarial face with better visual perception via beautification for each face in the database. In the training, the face matcher and the beautification discriminator are federated against the generator, prompting it to generate beauty-like perturbations on the face to confuse the face matcher. Namely, the pixel changes produced by face beautification mask the adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we use chaotic systems to disrupt the order of adversarial faces in the database, further mitigating the risk of privacy leakage. Our scheme has been extensively evaluated through experiments, which show that it effectively defends against unauthorized attacks while also yielding good visual results.",

            "title": "A Seawater Conductivity Measurement Method Based on Magnetic Resonance Coupling",
            "abstract": "This paper proposes a magnetic resonance coupling seawater conductivity measurement method with a dual-coil structure. The passive transceiver coil is composed of two detection coils and capacitive elements placed in seawater. The seawater conductivity measurement is realized by analyzing the relationship between the transmission loss of the resonant magnetic field between the passive transceiver coils in the seawater and the seawater conductivity. In the article, the magnetic resonance coupling measurement method is established and analyzed, the circuit model of the magnetic resonance coupling measurement system transmitted in seawater is established, the experimental device is set up for laboratory testing, and the corresponding test situation is simulated by finite element electromagnetic modelling. The test and simulation results show that the measurement method is feasible; the system has the best performance at the resonant frequency, especially for low-conductivity conditions, and better sensitivity. In addition, the resonant frequency increases, and the conductivity resolution of the measurement system for seawater increases.",
