            "abstract": "To exploit the massive amounts of onboard data in vehicular networks while protecting data privacy and security, federated learning (FL) is regarded as a promising technology to support enormous vehicular applications. Despite that FL has great potential to improve the architecture of intelligent vehicular networks, the mobility of the vehicles and the dynamic nature of wireless channels make the integration of FL and vehicular networks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a vehicle mobility- and channel dynamic-aware FL (MADCA-FL) scheme to fit vehicular networks and enhance learning performances. This novel scheme enables the RSU to select appropriate vehicles and weightedly average the local models. Afterward, MADCA-FL formulates a problem to maximize the model accuracy while assuring the latency and energy restrictions, by jointly optimizing the computation and communication resources. With a mixed-integer non-linear programming structure, the problem is NP-hard. First, we utilize the successive convex approximation algorithm to handle the non-convexity, and then apply the Lagrange multiplier method and the block coordinate descent method to obtain the optimal solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",

            "abstract": "Electric Vehicle-assisted Multi-access Edge Computing (EV-MEC) is a promising paradigm where EVs share their computation resources at the network edge to perform intensive computing tasks while charging. In EV-MEC, a fundamental problem is to jointly decide the charging power of EVs and computation task allocation to EVs, for meeting both the diverse charging demands of EVs and stringent performance requirements of heterogeneous tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a new joint charging scheduling and computation offloading scheme (OCEAN) for EV-MEC. Specifically, we formulate a cooperative two-timescale optimization problem to minimize the charging load and its variance subject to the performance requirements of computation tasks. We then decompose this sophisticated optimization problem into two sub-problems: charging scheduling and computation offloading. For the former, we develop a novel safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, and theoretically prove the feasibility of learned charging scheduling policy. For the latter, we reformulate it as an integer non-linear programming problem to derive the optimal offloading decisions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OCEAN can achieve similar performances as the optimal strategy and realize up to 24% improvement in charging load variance over three state-of-the-art algorithms while satisfying the charging demands of all EVs.",

            "title": "Accurate Prediction of Network Distance via Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "A large number of distributed applications necessitate accurate network distance, for example, in the form of delay or latency, to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). Due to high network measurement overhead and severe traffic congestion, network distance prediction has been introduced, instead of direct network measurements, to infer the unknown network distance with the partial measurements. However, most existing efforts neglect to fully capitalize on the potential latent factors, such as spatial correlations, long-existing temporal results and multi-rule exploration fusion, to achieve better accuracies with quicker convergence. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose an Accurate Prediction of Network Distance (APND) solution via Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL), which has four novel features distinguishing from the previous work. Firstly, a local feature-based matrix with low rank is established in each network cluster, referring to a set of neighbor nodes, to represent the potential spatial correlations among reachable node-pairs. Secondly, the parallel FDRL-based matrix factorization with multi-rule exploration fusion is introduced into APND and executed in all local clusters to minimize prediction errors and accelerate learning convergence. Thirdly, the long-existing learning experience is designed for local model training via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with rapid convergence. Fourthly, following the real-world routing paths, the cross-domain network nodes are simultaneously classified into adjacent clusters, built on the spatial correlations among them, and their coordinates will be further refined with error-based and average-based policies. Extensive experiments built on available real-world datasets illustrate that APND can accurately predict network distance compared with state-of-the-art approaches at the moderate computing cost.",

            "abstract": "Topology robustness is critical to the connectivity and lifetime of large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To improve robustness while reducing the execution cost, the existing robustness optimization methods utilize neural learning schemes, including neural networks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. However, insufficient exploration of reinforcement learning agents for topological environments is likely to yield local optima. Moreover, convergence speed is influenced by the sparse reward problem generated while exploring topological environments. To address these problems, this study proposes a self-adaptive robustness optimization method with an evolutionary multi-agent for IoT topology (ROMEM). ROMEM introduces a new multi-agent co-evolution scheme that leverages a non-deterministic strategy to extend the exploration in multi-directions, enabling the reinforcement learning agent to transcend local optima. Furthermore, ROMEM presents a novel distributed training mechanism for multiple agents to accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMEM can achieve multi-directional collaborative training and outperform other state-of-the-art learning-based robustness optimization methods in terms of convergence efficiency and robustness.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning-based semantic communication is a promising enabler for future-generation wireless network systems such as 6G networks. In practice, effective semantic communication requires online training for unknown content. In highly mobile vehicular networks, however, reliable, and efficient model training becomes significantly challenging. The existing distributed learning approaches are also unable to effectively operate in highly dynamic vehicular semantic communication networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel mobility-aware split-federated with transfer learning (MSFTL) framework based on vehicle task offloading scenarios in this article. To enable adaptation to the complex vehicle semantic communication, the proposed framework divides the training of the model into four parts and uses the proposed new split-federated learning. Furthermore, to improve training efficiency, model accuracy, and the ability to adapt in highly mobile environments, we also present a new transfer learning approach integrated into the proposed framework. Particularly, we propose a high-mobility training resource optimisation mechanism based on a Stackelberg game for MSFTL to further reduce training costs and adapt vehicle mobility scenarios. We also investigate the performance of the proposed schemes through extensive simulations. The results validate the proposed approach and indicate its superiority compared to the conventional learning frameworks for semantic communication in vehicular networks.",

            "abstract": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) introduces a new network architecture that offers different network services flexibly and dynamically in the form of Service Function Chains (SFCs), which refer to a set of Virtualization Network Functions (VNFs) chained in a specific order. However, the service latency often increases linearly with the length of SFCs due to the sequential execution of VNFs, resulting in sub-optimal performance for most delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, a novel Parallel VNF Placement (PVFP) approach is proposed for real-world networks via Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL). PVFP has three remarkable characteristics distinguishing from previous work: 1) PVFP designs a specific parallel principle, with three parallelism identification rules, to reasonably decide partial VNF parallelism; 2) PVFP considers SFC partition in multi-domains built on their remaining resources and potential parallel VNFs to ensure that VNFs can be reasonably distributed for resource balancing among domains; 3) FDRL-based framework of parallel VNF placement is designed to train a global intelligent model, with time-variant local autonomy explorations, for cross-domain SFC deployment, avoiding data sharing among domains. Simulation results in different scenarios demonstrate that PVFP can significantly reduce the end-to-end latency of SFCs at the medium resource expenditures to place VNFs in multiple administrative domains, compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "One fundamental problem of content caching in edge computing is how to replace contents in edge servers with limited capacities to meet the dynamic requirements of users without knowing their preferences in advance. Recently, online deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based caching methods have been developed to address this problem by learning an edge cache replacement policy using samples collected from continuous interactions (trial and error) with the environment. However, in practice, the online data collection phase is often expensive and time-consuming, thus hindering the practical deployment of online DRL-based methods. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Agile edge Cache replacement method based on Offline-online deep Reinforcement learNing (ACORN), which can efficiently learn an edge cache replacement policy offline from a training dataset collected by a behavior policy (e.g., Least Recently Used) and then improve it with fast online fine-tuning. We also design a specific convolutional neural network structure with multiple branches to effectively extract content popularity knowledge from the dataset. Experimental results show that the offline policy generated by ACORN outperforms the behavior policy by up to 38%. Through online fine-tuning, ACORN also achieves the number of cache hits as good as that of several advanced DRL-based methods while significantly reducing the number of training epochs by up to 40%.",

            "abstract": "This century has been a major avenue for revolutionary changes in technology and industry. Industries have transitioned towards intelligent automation, relying less on human intervention, resulting in the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. That is why IoT has been the researcher\u2019s arena for quite some time. With Industry 4.0 still in motion, the world is on the verge of the $5^{\\textit {th}}$ industrial revolution, a relatively new concept with many unclear opinions regarding its potential benefits, challenges, opportunities, trends, and impact on society. There is a dire need for a broader and more critical perspective. This research paints a bigger picture of \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat to expect?\u201d during the transition phase of Industry 5.0. In this comprehensive review, we have addressed the state-of-the-art practices in Industry 4.0 and the transitional phase of Industry 5.0. We have highlighted the most promising key enabling technologies, trends, research topics, rising challenges, and unfolding opportunities that can help prepare society for this paradigm shift. The paper then surveys the work toward the outstanding key enablers, challenges, trends, and opportunities in the IoT evolution for Industry 5.0. To spur further avenues for researchers and industrialists, the paper offers conclusive insights at the end. In addition, the article has a precise set of research questions answered in consequent sections and subsections for the reader\u2019s clarity.",

            "title": "Real-Time Contactless Eye Blink Detection Using UWB Radar",
            "abstract": "Blink detection is essential for various human-computer interaction scenarios, such as virtual reality and driving state detection. It has gained significant attention from industry and academia alike in recent years. Existing non-contact detection systems (cameras, acoustics, etc.) have made significant progress, but various issues have prevented their widespread adoption, including privacy concerns, line-of-sight requirements, and cost issues. Therefore, there is a critical need for a simple and robust system that can detect eye blinks using common commercial equipment. In this paper, we propose BlinkRadar, which uses a low-cost customized impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar for non-contact and fine-grained blink detection. BlinkRadar can reliably detect driver blinks in driving conditions, making it possible to infer drowsy driving. To effectively extract the eye blink signal, we analyzed real experimental data to study the characteristics of the eye blink pattern and successfully used the multi-sequence variational mode decomposition (MS-VMD) algorithm to separate the blink signal from the noise signal. We conducted extensive experiments in two different environments (a quiet room and moving vehicles) and found that BlinkRadar had an average blink detection accuracy of over 96.2%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using UWB radar for non-contact eye blink detection.",
