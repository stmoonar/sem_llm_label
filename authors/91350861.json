            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a rapidly growing paradigm and technology stack for integrating large-scale, heterogeneous data in an AI-ready form, i.e., combining data with the formal semantics required to understand it. However, toolchains that support data synthesis and knowledge discovery through information organization, search, filtering, and visualization have been developed at a pace lagging knowledge graph technology. In this paper, we present Knowledge Explorer, an open-source faceted search interface that provides environmentally intelligent services for interactively browsing and navigating KnowWhereGraph. Currently one of the largest open knowledge graphs, KnowWhereGraph contains over 12 billion statements with rich spatial and temporal information from more than 30 data layers. With an extensive collection of facets, Knowledge Explorer enables spatial, temporal, full-text, and expert search with dereferencing functionality to support \"follow-your-nose\" exploration, and it allows users to narrow their search by selecting facets. Given the size of the underlying graph and dependency on GeoSPARQL, we have improved query performance by implementing Elasticsearch indexing, spatial query generation, and caching. Knowledge Explorer is capable of retrieving information within seconds, answering a wide variety of competency questions posed by researchers, humanitarian relief organizations, and the broader public, thus helping better perform tasks such as cross-gazetteer place retrieval and disaster assessment from global to local geographic scales.",

            "abstract": "The capability and synergistic use of multisource satellite observations for flood monitoring and forecasts is crucial for improving disaster preparedness and mitigation. Here, surface fractional water cover (FW) retrievals derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) brightness temperatures were used for flood assessment over southeast Africa during the Cyclone Idai event. We then focused on five subcatchments of the Pungwe basin and developed a machine learning based approach with the support of Google Earth Engine for daily (24-h) forecasting of FW and 30-m inundation downscaling and mapping. The Classification and Regression Trees model was selected and trained using retrievals derived from SMAP and Landsat coupled with rainfall forecasts from the NOAA Global Forecast System. Independent validation showed that FW predictions over randomly selected dates are highly correlated (R = 0.87) with the Landsat observations. The forecast results captured the flood temporal dynamics from the Idai event; and the associated 30-m downscaling results showed inundation spatial patterns consistent with independent satellite synthetic aperture radar observations. The data-driven approach provides new capacity for flood monitoring and forecasts leveraging synergistic satellite observations and big data analysis, which is particularly valuable for data sparse regions.",

            "abstract": "Disasters are often unpredictable and complex events, requiring humanitarian organizations to understand and respond to many different issues simultaneously and immediately. Often the biggest challenge to improving the effectiveness of the response is quickly finding the right expert, with the right expertise concerning a specific disaster type/disaster and geographic region. To assist in achieving such a goal, this paper demonstrates a knowledge graph-based search engine developed on top of an expert knowledge graph. It accommodates three modes of information retrieval, including a follow-your-nose search, an expert similarity search, and a SPARQL query interface. We will demonstrate utilizing the system to rapidly navigate from a hazard event to a specific expert who may be helpful, for example. More importantly, as the data is fully integrated including links between hazards and their abstract topics, we can find experts who have relevant expertise while navigating the graph.",

            "abstract": "The integration of data along a common spatial component remains an obstacle in many problem spaces. One promising method for integrating data in such a way is through the use of a common, underlying spatial reference system, such as a Discrete Global Grid (e.g., the S2 Grid System), and pre-computing spatial relations between features and the constituent components at a spatial resolution appropriate for the data and use case. That is, by emphasizing the notion of the cell, we can examine what is in a cell, predict contents of its parent and child cells, and quickly get an overview of spatially co-located features and regions of interest without having to directly compute spatial interactions. This paper provides an ontology design pattern, to be used as a structural template, for modeling how features or regions map onto a hierarchical grid system and addresses how the attributes of these features may be inherited upwards or downwards through the hierarchy. We furthermore provide a motivating example and implementation.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Over the past decade, there has been appreciable progress towards modeling the water, energy, and carbon cycles at field-scales (10\u2013100\u2009m) over continental to global extents. One such approach, named HydroBlocks, accomplishes this task while maintaining computational efficiency via sub-grid tiles, or Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), learned via a hierarchical clustering approach from available global high-resolution environmental data. However, until now, there has yet to be a macroscale river routing approach that is able to leverage HydroBlocks' approach to sub-grid heterogeneity, thus limiting the added value of field-scale land surface modeling in Earth System Models (e.g., riparian zone dynamics, irrigation from surface water, and interactive floodplains). This paper introduces a novel dynamic river routing scheme in HydroBlocks that is intertwined with the modeled field-scale land surface heterogeneity. The primary features of the routing scheme include: 1) the fine-scale river network of each macroscale grid cell's is derived from very high resolution (",

In this study, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) fractional water (FW) data sets were used for flood mapping over southeast Africa during the Cyclone Idai event. We then developed a machine-learning approach with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for 24-hour flood forecasting and 30-m inundation mapping using observations from SMAP and Landsat coupled with rainfall forecasts from Global Forecast System (GFS) 384-Hour Predicted Atmosphere Data. The forecast results for the Idai event captured the flood dynamics at 30-m resolution and showed inundation patterns consistent with independent satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. The approach provides new capacity for flood monitoring and forecasts from synergistic satellite observations and is particularly valuable for data sparse regions.",
