            "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) technology uses Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect real-world data and build a virtual world in the DT cloud. However, many IoT devices collect data in harsh natural environments, and these data cannot be transmitted through fixed base stations. Thus, many DT services adopt dynamic data transmission methods, such as transmission through unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs). However, UAV-BS approaches have many communication constraints, such as limitations on the transmission bandwidth, data throughput, and number of channels. In addition, when integrating a large amount of data submitted by IoT devices, DT service providers need a corresponding mechanism to select the most valuable device data, which can be described by a winner decision problem with the goal of maximizing utility. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a DT model under UAV-BS network transmission, transform it into a mixed integer programming model with communication and computing constraints, and adopt a reverse auction mechanism to solve it. Specifically, we design an optimal reverse auction mechanism based on optimal allocation and Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves (VCG) theory. Additionally, a reverse auction mechanism with polynomial execution time is designed based on monotonic allocation, network maximum flow and critical value theory. These two mechanisms are proven to satisfy individual rationality and truthfulness. Experimental results indicate the favorable performance of the designed mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "UAV data collection problems have been a popular research topic in many fields, and the use of UAV-assisted rescue in earthquake-affected areas can significantly increase the rescue success rate. In this paper, we model the UAV data collection problem for earthquake disaster areas based on the mobile crowdsensing point of interest (POI) model, with the goal of maximizing the value of the collected data, and we transform the problem into an integer programming model with ordered submodularity properties and constraints. Additionally, we design an evolutionary algorithm (Max-UDC) to solve the problem; this algorithm iteratively computes new UAV sequences and eliminates inferior sequences using mutation to obtain a sequence of length K with the maximum data value. Through theoretical analysis and experimental proof, we demonstrate that the Max-UDC algorithm can obtain an approximation ratio related to forward curvature and backward curvature with an expected number of iterations. In the experimental section, the superior performance of Max-UDC is shown by comparing it with the OPT, G-Greedy, and Greedy algorithms.",

            "title": "An Ordered Submodularity-Based Budget-Feasible Mechanism for Opportunistic Mobile Crowdsensing Task Allocation and Pricing",
            "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing services are divided into two categories: opportunistic and participatory. In opportunistic mobile crowdsensing services, users do not need to specify the crowdsensing tasks to be completed. Compared with participatory crowdsensing services, the application scope is wider and more user-friendly. In participatory crowdsensing, the service provider assumes that the user can successfully complete the data collection task. However, such an approach cannot work in an opportunistic crowdsensing service because in opportunistic crowdsensing, the user\u2019s execution of the task is uncertain, which brings great challenges to the quality of the crowdsensing service. This article is based on the assumption of the user coverage probability model and transforms the opportunistic mobile crowdsensing value maximization problem into an ordered submodularity value function model with budget constraints. This model is also good at representing participatory crowdsourcing problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the ordered submodularity feature to a mobile crowdsensing service. Furthermore, we combine the properties of ordered submodular and auction models and propose an ordered submodularity-proportional share mechanism (O-PSM) to solve the allocation and payment problems in opportunistic mobile crowdsensing services. Specifically, in the allocation stage, the winning users are selected based on the proportional share threshold, and in the payment stage, the payment price for the winning users is designed based on critical value theory. We prove that the mechanism satisfies the economic characteristics of individual rationality, truthfulness, and budget feasibility. In the experimental section, the mechanism design based on ordered submodularity is shown to enable the service provider to obtain a higher value and a lower payment.",

            "abstract": "Real-time resource allocation has become a hot topic in vehicular edge computing environment. However, vehicle equipment with limited computing capability cannot meet the Quality of service of computation intensive and delay sensitive vehicle applications. Moreover, in most studies, the deployment constraints in edge computing and users\u2019 resource demand are static, which is inconsistent with real scenarios. In this paper, an online auction mechanism with double time-varying constraints is proposed to solve the resource allocation problem in a vehicular edge computing environment. Specifically, we first formulate the resource allocation problem between edge computing servers (ECSs) and vehicles as a novel integer programming model with time-varying deployment constraint and time-varying resource demand. Then, we design an online auction mechanism based on heuristics. In the resource allocation algorithm, a matching model and dominant-resource-proportion strategy are adopted to improve the resource utilization and social welfare. Simultaneously, a payment pricing algorithm based on the dichotomy is proposed. Finally, we prove that the online mechanism is individually rational and truthful. The experimental results demonstrate that our online mechanism has higher social welfare and resource utilization than existing research.",

            "abstract": "Task offloading is a major problem in edge computing. In existing research, tasks are generally portrayed as requiring specific resources and time, and the task owner provides the value that he is willing to pay. The goal of the resource provider is to obtain the maximum social welfare and profit. However, this approach cannot cover all task offloading scenarios. 1) This paper innovatively considers a continuous task offloading problem in mobile edge computing in which the task can be partially executed and the task owner provides a nonlinear value function to pay for the executed task. The resource provider needs to decide which tasks to execute at each moment in order to obtain the maximum social welfare and profit. We represent the problem as a nonlinear integer programming model with multiple resource constraints. 2). We design an auction mechanism to solve the continuous task offloading problem in a competitive environment. Specifically, we propose a resource allocation algorithm based on the remaining value strategy and a payment price algorithm based on the critical value theory to guarantee truthful task information. Our approach is experimentally compared with existing research in terms of execution time, social welfare, and resource utilization.",
