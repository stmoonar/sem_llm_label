            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that a top priority for society, now and in the future, is to be able to respond quickly to diseases with effective treatments. Among the new tools that pharmaceutical industries and researchers have in their hands nowadays, there are the extensive computer simulations capable of evaluating in-silico the interaction between possible drugs and the target proteins. The central goal of the LIGATE project is to create and validate a leading application solution for drug discovery in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems up to the exascale level. The overall project purpose is the automation of the drug design process, which is currently performed with substantial human effort throughout the different phases of the process: preparation of input parameters, management of data sets with billions of molecules, interaction with HPC queue management systems to handle jobs, and optimization of scoring function parameters and thresholds.",

The implementation of machine learning, extreme-scale computer simulations, and big data analytics in the drug design and development process offers an excellent opportunity to lower the risk of investment and reduce the time to the patient. Within the LIGATE project 1, we aim to integrate, extend, and co-design best-in-class European components to design Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) solutions exploiting today's high-end supercomputers and tomorrow's Exascale resources, fostering European competitiveness in the field. The proposed LIGATE solution is a fully integrated workflow that enables to deliver the result of a virtual screening campaign for drug discovery with the highest speed along with the highest accuracy. The full automation of the solution and the possibility to run it on multiple supercomputing centers at once permit to run an extreme scale in silico drug discovery campaign in few days to respond promptly for example to a worldwide pandemic crisis.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

We demonstrate how Celerity, a high-level C++ programming model for distributed accelerator computing based on the open SYCL standard, allows for the quick development of - and experimentation with - distributed applications. To achieve scalability on large machines, we replace Celerity's existing master/worker scheduling model with a fully distributed scheme that reduces the worst-case scheduling complexity from quadratic to linear while maintaining the existing programming interface. We then show how this declarative, data-flow based API paired with a point-to-point communication model with eager data pushing can effectively expose and leverage opportunities for latency hiding and computation/communication overlapping with minimal or no manual guidance. We demonstrate how Celerity exhibits very good scalability on multiple benchmarks from several scientific domains and up to 128 GPUs.",

            "abstract": "The cloud has been widely used as a distributed computing platform for running scientific workflow applications. Most of the cloud providers encourage the use of their underutilized resources as spot instances for much cheaper prices compared with common resources as on-demand instances, however, the promise of lower costs for resources results in the volatility such that spot instances can be interrupted at any time by cloud providers. Many workflow scheduling algorithms have been proposed to deal with volatile resources. In this article, we consider the two most important features of the volatile resources namely fulfillment and interruption rates to fully model the instability of the cloud infrastructure. Subsequently, we propose a novel evolutionary multi-objective workflow scheduling approach to generate a set of trade-off solutions that outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in both makespan and economic costs. In addition, we explore the fluctuation of makespan and costs for our obtained schedules under different levels of fulfillment and interruption rates. Experimental results with the five well-known real-world workflows demonstrate that our evolutionary multi-objective workflow scheduling algorithm is competitive in terms of makespan and cost compared with state-of-the-art on-demand scheduling techniques.",

            "title": "FaaScinating Resilience for Serverless Function Choreographies in Federated Clouds",
            "abstract": "Cloud applications often benefit from deployment on serverless technology Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which may instantly spawn numerous functions and charges users for the period when serverless functions are running. Maximum benefit is achieved when functions are orchestrated in a workflow or function choreographies (FCs). However, many provider limitations specific for FaaS, such as maximum concurrency or duration often increase the failure rate, which can severely hamper the execution of entire FCs. Current support for resilience is often limited to function retries or try-catch, which are applicable within the same cloud region only. To overcome these limitations, we introduce rAFCL, a middleware platform that maintains reliability of complex FCs in federated clouds. In order to support resilient FC execution under rAFCL, our model creates an alternative strategy for each function based on the required availability specified by the user. Alternative strategies are not restricted to the same cloud region, but may contain alternative functions across five providers, invoked concurrently in a single alternative plan or executed subsequently in multiple alternative plans. With this approach, rAFCL offers flexibility in terms of cost-performance trade-off. We evaluated rAFCL by running three real-life applications across three cloud providers. Experimental results demonstrated that rAFCL outperforms the resilience of AWS Step Functions, increasing the success rate of entire FC by 53.45%, while invoking only 3.94% more functions with zero wasted function invocations. rAFCL significantly improves availability of entire FCs to almost 1 and survives even after massive failures of alternative functions.",

            "abstract": "The Khronos SYCL abstraction layer is designed to enable programming heterogeneous platforms, consisting of host and accelerator devices, with a single-source code base. In order to allow for a high level of abstraction while still providing competitive runtime performance, both SYCL implementations and the software ecosystems built around SYCL applications frequently make heavy use of C++ templates. A potential consequence of this design choice, as well as the need to generate code for both a host and at least one device architecture, are significant compilation times. In this work we set out to study the relative compile-time performance and the impact of various SYCL features on compilation times across a selection of the most widely-used SYCL implementations. To this end, we introduce a code generator which creates SYCL kernels stressing various API features and instruction types, either in isolation or in combination, as well as an infrastructure to largely automate related experiments. We apply this infrastructure in a large-scale synthetic evaluation totaling 96000 compiler runs, which also includes a study of the compilation performance over time of the most widespread implementations. In addition to these synthetic experiments, we validate the applicability of our findings by measuring the compile times of two real-world industrial SYCL applications. On the basis of these experiments, we point out particularly impactful \u2013 in terms of compile-time performance \u2013 changes during the development of some SYCL implementations, and formulate suggestions for SYCL implementation developers as well as users. We have made both the code generator and all the tools we developed to carry out the experiments in this paper available as open source.",

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",
