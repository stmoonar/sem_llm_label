            "abstract": "Digital History and Cultural Heritage encapsulate invaluable societal narratives, yet scholars and practitioners face challenges in data quality, accessibility, and engagement. Human-AI Interaction (HAI) holds promise to address these challenges, fostering enhanced analysis, discoverability, and storytelling at scale. However, its potential remains largely untapped by the HAI community. This workshop aimed to bridge this gap, inviting inviting scholars and practitioners from fields such as human-computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), history, cultural heritage, and GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) to explore innovative HAI methodologies and frameworks tailored to these domains. Through interdisciplinary dialogue, we aimed to propose tractable solutions, enriching both the Digital History and Cultural Heritage sectors, as well as the HAI field, while nurturing a fertile ground for historical storytelling and meaningful engagement with our shared past.",

            "abstract": "Text-to-image models are enabling efficient design space exploration, rapidly generating images from text prompts. However, many generative AI tools are imperfect for product design applications as they are not built for the goals and requirements of product design. The unclear link between text input and image output further complicates their application. This work empirically investigates design space exploration strategies that can successfully yield product images that are feasible, novel, and aesthetic, which are three common goals in product design. Specifically, user actions within the global and local editing modes, including their time spent, prompt length, mono vs. multi-criteria prompts, and goal orientation of prompts, are analyzed. Key findings reveal the pivotal role of mono vs. multi-criteria and goal orientation of prompts in achieving specific design goals over time and prompt length. The study recommends prioritizing the use of multi-criteria prompts for feasibility and novelty during global editing, while favoring mono-criteria prompts for aesthetics during local editing. Overall, this paper underscores the nuanced relationship between the AI-driven text-to-image models and their effectiveness in product design, urging designers to carefully structure prompts during different editing modes to better meet the unique demands of product design.",

            "abstract": "Text-to-image generative models have increasingly been used to assist designers during concept generation in various creative domains, such as graphic design, user interface design, and fashion design. However, their applications in engineering design remain limited due to the models' challenges in generating images of feasible designs concepts. To address this issue, this paper introduces a method that improves the design feasibility by prompting the generation with feasible CAD images. In this work, the usefulness of this method is investigated through a case study with a bike design task using an off-the-shelf text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion 2.1. A diverse set of bike designs are produced in seven different generation settings with varying CAD image prompting weights, and these designs are evaluated on their perceived feasibility and novelty. Results demonstrate that the CAD image prompting successfully helps text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion 2.1 create visibly more feasible design images. While a general tradeoff is observed between feasibility and novelty, when the prompting weight is kept low around 0.35, the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty remains on par with those generated by text prompts alone. The insights from this case study offer some guidelines for selecting the appropriate CAD image prompting weight for different stages of the engineering design process. When utilized effectively, our CAD image prompting method opens doors to a wider range of applications of text-to-image models in engineering design.",

            "abstract": "Crowdsourcing in China is a thriving industry. Among its most interesting structures, we find crowdfarms, in which crowdworkers self-organize as small organizations to tackle macrotasks. Little, however, is known as to which practices these crowdfarms use to tackle the macrotasks, and this goes hand in hand with the current practice of the HCI research community to treat all forms of complex crowdsourcing work as practically the same. However, macrotasks differ substantially regarding structure and decomposability. Treating them under one umbrella term - macrotasking - can lead to an imprecise understanding of the workforce involved. We address this gap by examining the work practices of 31 Chinese crowdfarms on the four main macrotask types, namely: modular, interlaced, wicked, and container macrotasks. Our results confirm essential differences in how these nascent crowd organizations address different macrotasks and shed light on what platforms can do to improve the uptake of such work.",

            "abstract": "Self-assembling team formation systems, where online users can select their teammates, are gaining research and industry interest. Still, the benefits of diversity remain frequently untapped for these teams, as people tend to choose others similar to them. In this study, we examine whether making users aware of the team\u2019s diversity can impact their selections. In a study involving 120 crowd participants, working on the scenario of a crowdsourced innovation project, we tested the effects of two choice architecture and nudging techniques. The first technique displayed explicit personalized diversity information in the form of the current team diversity score and diversity recommendations. The second technique used diversity priming, in the form of counter-stereotypes and all-inclusive multiculturalism. Our results indicate that, while priming deterred participants from picking teammates of different regions, displaying diversity information was the only factor to positively enhance diverse choices. These results were not moderated by the users\u2019 \u2019\u2018need to belong\u201d levels, an intrinsic motivation justifying one\u2019s need to form social ties. Other factors which we also find to predict selection behavior were the participants\u2019 region of origin, participants\u2019 gender, teammates\u2019 functional backgrounds, and teammates\u2019 order of appearance. In light of these findings, we suggest that nudging techniques need to be cautiously applied to online team formation as the different techniques differ in their ability to evoke diversity among intrinsically diverse crowds, and that personalised displaying of diversity information seems most promising.",

However, the vast scale of the crowd makes forming project teams an intractable problem to coordinate manually. To date, most crowdsourcing collaborative platforms rely on algorithms to automate team formation based on worker profiling data and task objectives. As a top-down strategy, algorithmic crowd team formation tends to alienate workers causing poor collaboration, interpersonal clashes, and dissatisfaction. In this paper, we investigate different ways that crowd teams can be formed through three team formation models namely bottom-up, top-down, and hybrid. By simulating an open collaboration scenario such as a hackathon, we observe that the bottom-up model forms the most competitive teams with the highest teamwork quality. Furthermore, we note that bottom-up approaches are particularly suitable for populations with high-risk appetites (most workers being lenient toward exploring new team configurations) and high degrees of homophily (most workers preferring to work with similar teammates). Our study highlights the importance of integrating worker agency in algorithm-mediated team formation systems, especially in collaborative/competitive settings, and bears practical implications for large-scale crowdsourcing platforms.",

On the one hand, the user modeling community focuses on the preferences aggregation problem: how to combine preferences of individuals in a group so as to personalize, adapt, and explain content for this group to consume or experience? On the other hand, the computer-supported collaboration community focuses on the group formation problem: how to construct a group that will work together efficiently to solve a particular task? This area becomes increasingly significant as work becomes more flexible, online, and distributed. The connecting tissue between both communities is the urgent need to design algorithms, whether for recommending group content or group formations, that steer away from top-down algorithmic decision-making, which has proven to stifle user agency and create power inequalities between users and algorithms. The aim of the workshop is, for the first time, to bring together the two communities working on the two sides of Group Recommendations, with an overall goal to rethink group recommendation and shift paradigms from the current algorithm-centric to a user- and group-centric focus.",

The aims of this SIG are as follows: Firstly, to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to engage with the various definitions and the ways in which the Metaverse is developing. Secondly, to discuss the opportunities, challenges, and future possibilities in the context of HCI.

            "abstract": "Critical, time-bounded, and high-stress tasks, like incident response, have often been solved by teams that are cohesive, adaptable, and prepared. Although a fair share of the literature has explored the effect of personality on various other types of teams and tasks, little is known about how it contributes to teamwork when teams of strangers have to cooperate ad-hoc, fast, and efficiently. This study explores the dynamics between 120 crowd participants paired into 60 virtual dyads and their collaboration outcome during the execution of a high-pressure, time-bound task. Results show that the personality trait of Openness to experience may impact team performance with teams with higher minimum levels of Openness more likely to defuse the bomb on time. An analysis of communication patterns suggests that winners made more use of action and response statements. The team role was linked to the individual's preference of certain communication patterns and related to their perception of the collaboration quality. Highly agreeable individuals seemed to cope better with losing, and individuals in teams heterogeneous in Conscientiousness seemed to feel better about collaboration quality. Our results also suggest there may be some impact of gender on performance. As this study was exploratory in nature, follow-on studies are needed to confirm these results. We discuss how these findings can help the development of AI systems to aid the formation and support of crowdsourced remote emergency teams.",

We have extended our study of solo crowdworker practices to include crowdfarms, a relatively new entry to the gig economy: small companies that carry out crowdwork as a key part of their business. We report here on interviews of people who work in 53 crowdfarms. We describe how crowdfarms procure jobs, carry out macrotasks and microtasks, manage their reputation, and employ different management practices to motivate crowdworkers and customers.",

Yet these studies often present this practice as being an a priori aspect of locative media. What is missing from this research is a more granular understanding of how this process develops over time. Accordingly, we focus on the first 6 weeks of 42 users beginning to use an LBSN we designed and named GeoMoments. Through our analysis of our users' activities, we contribute to understanding identity and LBSN in two distinct ways. First, we show how LBSN users develop and perform self-identity over time. Second, we highlight the extent these temporal processes reshape the behaviors of users. Overall, our results illustrate that although a performative use of GeoMoments does evolve, this development does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs within the dynamic context of everyday life, which is prompted, conditioned, and mediated by the way the affordances of GeoMoments digitally organize and archive past locational traces.",

            "abstract": "People are increasingly making use of professional online services to outsource projects and remote teams through crowdsourcing tools. In these online self-assembly team formation settings, profiling information is vital to crowd users; it is focal to gathering knowledge about others and constructing virtual identities of themselves. This study investigates crowd users' preferences of profiling attributes displayed on online team formation systems. To evaluate participants' preferences, we looked at their willingness to see and their perceived usefulness across several profiling attributes grouped into surface-level and deep-level traits. These are classes of profiling traits quantifying group diversity that we use to distinguish between surface-level demographic and deep-level attitudinal traits. A total of 117 crowd participants answered close-ended questions about their preferences of profiling information concerning theirs and other crowd users' profiles on team self-assembly systems. Results indicate that crowd users significantly prefer disclosing surface-level attributes, both for themselves and others in terms of willingness to see and perceived usefulness. Surface-level attributes such as age, education, and availability are favored over deep-level attributes concerning crowd users' mental states, beliefs, and political affiliation. These results lay the foundation for future studies on the effectiveness and appropriateness of user-centered profiling information displayed on online crowdsourcing team formation systems.",

In the context of a cultural experience, people may want to learn (with serious games) but also to have fun (with simple entertainment games), spend their free time (with casual games), socialize (with social or multiplayer games), or be creative (with collaborative creation games). Similarly, cultural institutions not only want to teach but also attract more visitors (promotional games or advergames). In the last decade, there have been significant developments in game technologies used for cultural heritage purposes. Technologies such as crowdsourcing and human computation have become increasingly sophisticated. New game-oriented (but not only) media such as mixed-reality, virtual reality, and natural interaction (e.g., motion-based gameplay) have become more prevalent. This special issue has two objectives: first, to broaden the scope and explore gaming in cultural heritage across several genres used in real-life, and second, to incorporate and present the latest gaming technologies in the field of culture.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents SemMR, a semantic framework for modelling interactions between human and non-human entities and managing reusable and optimized cultural experiences, towards a shared cultural experience ecosystem that might seamlessly accommodate mixed reality experiences. The SemMR framework synthesizes and integrates interaction data into semantically rich reusable structures and facilitates the interaction between different types of entities in a symbiotic way, within a large, virtual, and fully experiential open world, promoting experience sharing at the user level, as well as data/application interoperability and low-effort implementation at the software engineering level. The proposed semantic framework introduces methods for low-effort implementation and the deployment of open and reusable cultural content, applications, and tools, around the concept of cultural experience as a semantic trajectory or simply, experience as a trajectory (eX-trajectory). The methods facilitate the collection and analysis of data regarding the behaviour of users and their interaction with other users and the environment, towards optimizing eX-trajectories via reconfiguration. The SemMR framework supports the synthesis, enhancement, and recommendation of highly complex reconfigurable eX-trajectories, while using semantically integrated disparate and heterogeneous related data. Overall, this work aims to semantically manage interactions and experiences through the eX-trajectory concept, towards delivering enriched cultural experiences.",

            "abstract": "Expressions of territoriality have been positioned as one of the main reasons users alter their behaviors and perceptions of spatiality and sociality while engaging with location-based social networks (LBSN). Despite the potential for this interplay to further our understanding of LBSN usage in the context of identity, very little work has actually been done toward this. Addressing this gap in the literature is one of the chief aims of the article. Drawing on an original 6-week study with 42 participants utilizing a bespoke LBSN entitled \u201cGeoMoments,\u201d our research explores the following: (1) the way that territoriality is linked to self-identity; and (2) how this interplay affects the interactions between users as well as the environments they inhabit. Our findings suggest that participants affirmed their self-identity by selectively posting and claiming ownership of their neighborhood through the LBSN. Here, the locative decisions are made related to risk, hierarchies, and the users\u2019 relationship to the area. This practice then led participants to discover and interact with the digital information overlaying their physical environments in a playful manner. These interactions demonstrate the perceived power structures that are facilitated by identity claims over a virtual area. In the main, our results reaffirm that territoriality is a central concept in understanding LBSN use, while also drawing attention to the temporality involved in user-to-user and user-to-place interactions pertaining to physical place mediated by LBSN.",

            "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in crowdsourcing, this new labor model has recently received severe criticism. The most important point of this criticism is that crowdworkers are often underpaid and overworked. This severely affects job satisfaction and productivity. Although there is a growing body of evidence exploring the work experiences of crowdworkers in various countries, there have been a very limited number of studies to the best of our knowledge exploring the work experiences of Chinese crowdworkers. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Based on a framework of well-established approaches, namely the Job Demands-Resources model, the Work Design Questionnaire, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, we systematically study the work experiences of 289 crowdworkers who work for ZBJ.com - the most popular Chinese crowdsourcing platform. Our study examines these crowdworker experiences along four dimensions: (1) crowdsourcing job demands, (2) job resources available to the workers, (3) crowdwork experiences, and (4) platform commitment. Our results indicate significant differences across the four dimensions based on crowdworkers' gender, education, income, job nature, and health condition. Further, they illustrate that different crowdworkers have different needs and threshold of demands and resources and that this plays a significant role in terms of moderating the crowdwork experience and platform commitment. Overall, our study sheds light to the work experiences of the Chinese crowdworkers and at the same time contributes to furthering understandings related to the work experiences of crowdworkers.",

            "abstract": "Whether it's for altruistic reasons, personal gains or third party's interests, users are influenced by different kinds of motivations when making use of mobile geo-crowdsourcing applications (geoCAs). These reasons, extrinsic and/or intrinsic, must be factored in when evaluating the use intention of these applications and how effective they are. A functional geoCA, particularly if designed for Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), is the one that persuades and engages its users, by accounting for their diversity of needs across a period of time. This paper explores a number of proven and novel motivational factors destined for the preservation and collection of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) through geoCAs. By providing an overview of personalisation research and digital behaviour interventions for geo-crowdsoured ICH, the paper examines the most relevant usability and trigger factors for different crowd users, supported by a range of technology-based principles. In addition, we present the case of StoryBee, a mobile geoCA designed for \"crafting stories'' by collecting and sharing users' generated content based on their location and favourite places. We conclude with an open-ended discussion about the ongoing challenges and opportunities arising from the deployment of geoCAs for ICH.",

            "abstract": "We discuss the user study of a mobile cultural heritage game designed to stimulate reflection about a city's history. Aided by location-aware technology, the game fosters the serendipitous discovery of points of interest, historical images and stories, whilst players wander the city. This exploration differs from the typical precalculated path recommendations used by other location-based applications. It triggers reflection about the city's past that is as unique as its visitors. Ours is one of the first studies to attempt an understanding of the effects of serendipitous urban discovery and historic reflection-triggering technologies on user experience. We combined field trials with controlled experiments, analysing perceptions of the experience and value using responses expressed in open-ended questionnaire items. Using thematic coding and sentiment analysis, we observed types of emotional responses, indicating four potential profiles of their likelihood towards future technology adoption. Enthusiastic and Interested users appreciated the freedom of movement choice that created an autonomous experience that fostered a sense of personal accomplishment. The interface interactions of the game, designed to stimulate reflection, supported a feeling of connectedness to others. In contrast, Cynical and Sceptical users were less tolerant of perceived technological issues, requiring more perfection in functionality and design. These users are less likely to be the early adopters of serendipitous location-based apps. The game was developed as part of a large cultural informatics project but, unlike typical evaluations, we conducted this study midway through the project and not at its end. This approach (1) gave the team the possibility to take stock, pause, and reflect and (2) provided insight on future design improvements for increasing the perceived value of serendipitous urban discovery applications. Our results contribute towards a grounded understanding of user experience and help progress the development of cultural heritage applications that incorporate elements of reflection and/or place-based exploration into their functionalities.",

With this work we highlight an important change in the rapidly changing crowdsourcing landscape of China that merits more research in the future.",

            "abstract": "Following successful crowd ideation contests, organizations in search of the \"next big thing\" are left with hundreds of ideas. Expert-based idea filtering is lengthy and costly; therefore, crowd-based strategies are often employed. Unfortunately, these strategies typically (1) do not separate the mediocre from the excellent, and (2) direct all the attention to certain idea concepts, while others starve. We introduce DBLemons - a crowd-based idea filtering strategy that addresses these issues by (1) asking voters to identify the worst rather than the best ideas using a \"bag of lemons'' voting approach, and (2) by exposing voters to a wider idea spectrum, thanks to a dynamic diversity-based ranking system balancing idea quality and coverage. We compare DBLemons against two state-of-the-art idea filtering strategies in a real-world setting. Results show that DBLemons is more accurate, less time-consuming, and reduces the idea space in half while still retaining 94% of the top ideas.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the problem of Task Assignment and Sequencing, which models online optimization in expert crowdsourcing settings that involve non-decomposable macrotasks. Non-decomposition is a property of certain types of complex problems, like the formulation of an R&D approach or the definition of a research methodology, which cannot be handled through the \"divide-and-conquer\" approach typically used in microtask crowdsourcing. In contrast to splitting the macrotask to multiple microtasks and allocating them to several workers in parallel, our model supports the sequential improvement of the macrotask one worker at a time, across distinct time slots of a given timeline, until a sufficient quality level is achieved. Our model assumes an online environment where expert workers are available only at specific time slots and worker/task arrivals are not known a priori. With respect to this setting, we propose TAS-ONLINE, an online algorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget, required quality, and a given timeline, without any future input information regarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Experimental results comparing TAS-ONLINE to five benchmarks show that it achieves more completed jobs, lower flow times, and higher job quality. This work bears practical implications for providing performance and quality guarantees to expert crowdsourcing platforms that wish to integrate non-decomposable macrotasks into their offered services.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of museum visitors\u2019 Quality of Experience (QoE) optimization by viewing and treating the museum environment as a cyber-physical social system. To achieve this goal, we harness visitors\u2019 internal ability to intelligently sense their environment and make choices that improve their QoE in terms of which the museum touring option is the best for them and how much time to spend on their visit. We model the museum setting as a distributed non-cooperative game where visitors selfishly maximize their own QoE. In this setting, we formulate the problem of Recommendation Selection and Visiting Time Management (RSVTM) and propose a two-stage distributed algorithm based on game theory and reinforcement learning, which learns from visitor behavior to make on-the-fly recommendation selections that maximize visitor QoE. The proposed framework enables autonomic visitor-centric management in a personalized manner and enables visitors themselves to decide on the best visiting strategies. Experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed RSVTM algorithm under realistic simulation conditions indicate the high operational effectiveness and superior performance when compared to other recommendation approaches. Our results constitute a practical alternative for museums and exhibition spaces meant to enhance visitor QoE in a flexible, efficient, and cost-effective manner.",

            "abstract": "Forming work teams involves matching people with complementary skills and personalities, but requires obtaining such data a priori. We introduce team dating, where people interact on brief tasks before working with a dedicated partner for longer, more complex tasks. We studied team dating through two online experiments. In Experiment 1, workers from a crowd platform independently wrote an ad slogan, discussed it with three consecutive people and evaluated their team date interactions. They then selected preferred teammates from a list showing average ratings for people they had dated and not dated. Results show that participants evaluated their dates based on evidence beyond externally judged slogan quality, and relied heavily on their dyad-specific judgments in selecting teammates. In Experiment 2, we replicated the individual and team dating tasks, and formed teams, either i) by honoring pairwise team dating preferences, ii) randomly from their pool of dates, or iii) randomly from those not dated. Results show that teams formed from preferred dates performed better on a final creative task compared to random dates or non-dates. Team dating provides a dynamic technique for forming ad hoc teams accounting for interpersonal dynamics. The initial interactions provided information that helped people select and work with an appropriate teammate.",

Three play tests highlighted the users' interest and issues with the historical content, the way this content is represented, and the players' responses to the interactions and motivating mechanisms of the application. Results show that the board game helped capture important design preferences and problems, ensuring the improvement of our scenario.

            "abstract": "History, and in particular European history, is not merely a collection of unconnected events, but rather a complex mesh of interrelated facts, events and concepts, taking place within a wider context of previous and contemporary situations. Unfortunately when addressing the wider public, like in schools, museums and cultural spaces, history is often presented in a simplistic, siloed and localistic manner that promotes memorizing rather than understanding, does not account for cross-border cultural aspects and prevents historical events from being viewed as a shared, global experience. The goal of the CrossCult H2020 project, comprising 11 partners from 7 European countries, is to spur a change in the way European citizens appraise, interpret and access history, by enabling new and highlighting existing cross-border connections among pieces of cultural heritage, other citizens' viewpoints and physical venues. Facilitated by technology and mobile applications, with a strong background in social sciences, the project focuses on developing pilot experiences that build narratives of cross-border connections and crosscutting topics, to help visitors gain insight into how the same facts may be interpreted differently from different social realities and by different individuals. In this paper we introduce the CrossCult project and its goals, provide an overview of its four project pilots and discuss the technologies it employs to connect cultural heritage venues, repositories and people's viewpoints.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the problem of Task Assignment and Sequencing (TAS), which adds the timeline perspective to expert crowdsourcing optimization. Expert crowdsourcing involves macrotasks, like document writing, product design, or web development, which take more time than typical binary microtasks, require expert skills, assume varying degrees of knowledge over a topic, and require crowd workers to build on each other's contributions. Current works usually assume offline optimization models, which consider worker and task arrivals known and do not take into account the element of time. Realistically however, time is critical: tasks have deadlines, expert workers are available only at specific time slots, and worker/task arrivals are not known a-priori. Our work is the first to address the problem of optimal task sequencing for online, heterogeneous, time-constrained macrotasks. We propose tas-online, an online algorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget, required quality and a given timeline, without future input information regarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Results, comparing tas-online to four typical benchmarks, show that it achieves more completed jobs, lower flow times and higher job quality. This work has practical implications for improving the Quality of Service of current crowdsourcing platforms, allowing them to offer cost, quality and time improvements for expert tasks.",

            "abstract": "When personalities clash, teams operate less effectively. Personality differences affect face-to-face collaboration and may lower trust in virtual teams. For relatively short-lived assignments, like those of online crowdsourcing, personality matching could provide a simple, scalable strategy for effective team formation. However, it is not clear how (or if) personality differences affect teamwork in this novel context where the workforce is more transient and diverse. This study examines how personality compatibility in crowd teams affects performance and individual perceptions. Using the DISC personality test, we composed 14 five-person teams (N=70) with either a harmonious coverage of personalities (balanced) or a surplus of leader-type personalities (imbalanced). Results show that balancing for personality leads to significantly better performance on a collaborative task. Balanced teams exhibited less conflict and their members reported higher levels of satisfaction and acceptance. This work demonstrates a simple personality matching strategy for forming more effective teams in crowdsourcing contexts.",

Human factors designate workers' expertise in different skills, their expected minimum wage, and their availability.

We present rigorous theoretical analyses of the optimization problem and propose optimal and approximation algorithms. We finally perform extensive performance and quality experiments using real and synthetic data to demonstrate that adaptive indexing in SmartCrowd is necessary to achieve efficient high quality task assignment.",

This can be seen as enabling crowdsourcing work to be applied on a sample of large-scale data at high speed, or equivalently, enabling stream processing to employ human intelligence. It also leads to a substantial expansion of the capabilities of data processing systems. Engineering a CSP system requires the combination of human and machine computation elements. From a general systems theory perspective, this means taking into account inherited as well as emerging properties from both these elements. In this paper, we position CSP systems within a broader taxonomy, outline a series of design principles and evaluation metrics, present an extensible framework for their design, and describe several design patterns. We showcase the capabilities of CSP systems by performing a case study that applies our proposed framework to the design and analysis of a real system (AIDR) that classifies social media messages during time-critical crisis events. Results show that compared to a pure stream processing system, AIDR can achieve a higher data classification accuracy, while compared to a pure crowdsourcing solution, the system makes better use of human workers by requiring much less manual work effort.",

SmartCrowd oers opportunities in making crowdsourcing intelligent through iterative interaction with the workers, and adaptively learning and improving the underlying processes. Both existing (majority of which do not require longer engagement from volatile and mostly nonrecurrent workers) and next generation crowdsourcing applications (which require longer engagement from the crowd) stand to benefit from SmartCrowd.

The use of concept lattices to support the task of document retrieval in IR has proven effective since they allow querying in the space of terms modelled by concept intents and navigation in the space of documents modelled by concept extents. However, current approaches use binary representations to illustrate the relations between documents and terms (\"document D contains term T\") and disregard useful information present in document corpora (\"document D contains X references to term T\"). We propose using pattern structures, an extension of FCA on multi-valued and numerical data, to address the above. Given a set of weighted document-term relations, a concept lattice based on pattern structures is built and explored to find documents satisfying a given user query. We present the meaning and capabilities of this approach, as well as results of its application over a classic IR document corpus.",

            "abstract": "In this paper the authors propose a crowd coordination mechanism to increase the quality of articles produced in wiki systems. Wikis constitute promising social digital ecosystems for collaborative knowledge creation on the Web. However, as a result of the purely self-coordinated manner that they function, they cannot ensure the quality of the produced articles-an issue that affects their reliability and acceptance. The authors show that wiki article quality optimization can be formulated as a resource allocation problem. Contributors are selected from the wiki community crowd according to their skills, and matched to the articles they can improve the most. A model of the English Wikipedia is given, parameterized and validated from recent field studies results. Experimental results were obtained with simulation systems implementing this model and on a series of scenarios, which include an analysis of the impact of using semantic relations between wiki domains. The obtained results indicate that the proposed mechanism can lead to the production of wiki articles of higher quality, compared to the respective results achieved by the fully self-coordinated wiki.",

We focus on the problem of \"non-matching documents\", which are those that, despite being semantically relevant to the user query, do not contain the query's elements and hence cannot be retrieved by typical string matching approaches. In order to find these documents, we modify the initial user query using the concept lattice as a guide. We achieve this by identifying in the lattice a formal concept that represents the user query and then by finding potentially relevant concepts, identified as such through the proposed notion of cousin concepts. Finally, we use a concept semantic similarity metric to order and present retrieved documents. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the notion of cousin concepts of a given formal concept followed by a discussion on how this notion is useful for lattice-based information indexing and retrieval.",

ORM is performed through different systems in the different business units of the enterprise -- however a unified view of the operational risk management information is needed to enable its seamless exchange and horizontal expertise sharing. At the level of corporate governance this is already addressed but, at the technical level this issue is still open. As a solution in this paper we propose the development of an ORM ontology. The proposed ontology aims at facilitating ORM information sharing across organizational unit boundaries and at the enabling of computational inferences over the heterogeneous ORM applications of the organization.",

            "abstract": "Collective intelligence (CI) is an emerging research field that seeks to merge human and machine intelligence, with an aim to achieve results unattainable by either one of these entities alone. CI systems may significantly vary in nature, from collaborative systems, like open source software development communities, to competitive ones, like problem-solving companies that benefit from the competition among participating user teams to identify solutions to various R&D problems. The advantages that CI systems earn user communities, together with the fact that they share a number of basic common features, provide the potential for designing a general methodology for their efficient modeling, development and evaluation. In this paper we describe a modeling process which identifies the common features, as well as the main challenges that the construction of generic collective intelligence systems poses. First a basic categorization of CI systems is performed, followed by a description of the proposed modeling approach. This approach includes concepts such as the set of possible user actions, the CI system state and the individual and community objectives, as well as a number of necessary functions, which estimate various parameters of the CI system, such as the expected user actions, the future system state and the level of objective fulfillment. Finally, based on the proposed modeling approach, certain current CI systems are described, a number of problems that they face are identified and specific solutions are suggested. The proposed modeling approach is expected to promote more efficient CI system design, so that the benefit gained by the participating community and individuals, will be maximized.",

            "abstract": "Energy information systems, which manage energy consumptions over internet, have been evolving over the past decade and can be considered as a part of a specialised sequential decision process, regarding the provision of personalised energy services to the community. The aim of this study is to develop and present an innovative decision-support system and cloud computing software methodology that brings together energy consultants, consumers, energy services procedures and modern web interoperable technologies. The authors propose a web-based knowledge system, using distributed cloud architecture and metering grids over ADSL broadband connections. By using some clustering algorithms and a web middleware, energy profiles over time are analysed and observed. The resulting clusters and centroids are projected and statistically analysed over time, producing a centroid-locus. Hypercube topology was used for efficient data management and software agent-based parallel analysis. The system operates efficiently on a multi-tier cloud-based middleware that generates in real-time using various service software components to the end consumers. The case study on real Greek energy measurements, for the first time in Greece, indicated a compact and efficient distributed procedure that could analyse and produce adaptive personalised information services.",

            "abstract": "Collective intelligence (CI) is an emerging research field which aims at combining human and machine intelligence, to improve community processes usually performed by large groups. CI systems may be collaborative, like Wikipedia, or competitive, like a number of recently established problem-solving companies that attempt to find solutions to difficult R&D or marketing problems drawing on the competition among web users. The benefits that CI systems earn user communities, combined with the fact that they share a number of basic common characteristics, open up the prospect for the design of a general methodology that will allow the efficient development and evaluation of CI. In the present work, an attempt is made to establish the analytical foundations and main challenges for the design and construction of a generic collective intelligence system. First, collective intelligence systems are categorized into active and passive and specific examples of each category are provided. Then, the basic modeling framework of CI systems is described. This includes concepts such as the set of possible user actions, the CI system state and the individual and community objectives. Additional functions, which estimate the expected user actions, the future state of the system, as well as the level of objective fulfillment, are also established. In addition, certain key issues that need to be considered prior to system launch are also described. The proposed framework is expected to promote efficient CI design, so that the benefit gained by the community and the individuals through the use of CI systems, will be maximized.",

Multiple choice test grades were used as the input data set of the networks. This form of tests was preferred for its objectivity. Results showed that accurate prediction is possible at an early stage, more specifically at the third week of the ten-week course. In addition, when students were clustered, low misplacement rates demonstrated the adequacy of the approach. The results of the proposed method were compared against those of linear regression and the neural network approach was found to be more effective in",

However, as Web-based cooperating environments continuously grow in popularity, there is a need to develop intelligent mechanisms that will retrieve the optimal group of reviewers to comment on the work of each author, with a view to increasing the usefulness that these comments will have on the author\u00bfs final result. This paper introduces a novel technique that incorporates feed forward neural networks to determine the optimal reviewers for a specific author during a peer assessment procedure.
