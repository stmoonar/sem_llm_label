            "title": "Temporal Graph Generation Featuring Time-Bound Communities",
            "abstract": "Synthetic graph datasets are crucial for the assessment of network analysis algorithms, providing a measure of their effectiveness and efficiency. However, most existing generation techniques typically focus on community formation, neglecting the fact that real-world communities not only emerge but may also dissipate over time. This lifecycle occurs within a finite timeframe, adding complexity to the community dynamics. In this paper, firstly we introduce the concept of time-bound community to characterize communities that are destined to disintegrate. Secondly, we devise GTB, a temporal graph Generation method featuring Time-Bound communities, leveraging newly identified patterns within real datasets that we have collected. Additionally, we propose the advanced Temporal Edge Distribution (TED) model, a key component of G TB, designed for the swift generation of temporal edges within distribution limits and offering a constant time complexity to generate each edge. The TED model not only accommodates diverse distribution configurations but also facilitates its seamless transfer between time-bound communities to enhance time and space efficiency. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by delivering generated content of superior Quality with notably competitive time and space consumption.",

            "abstract": "Contrastive learning, a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm, has shown its efficacy in learning embed dings from independent and identically distributed (IID) as well as non-IID data without relying on label information. Since high-quality discriminative embeddings form a rich embedding space, which benefits model performance on downstream tasks, it is necessary to study how to improve the quality of contrastive node embeddings in graph contrastive learning. However, there has been limited research on this area. In this paper, we investigate how to generate high-quality contrastive node embeddings based on an in-depth analysis of graph contrastive losses. Firstly, we propose a novel and effective method, GLATE, for estimating the temperatures in three mainstream graph contrastive losses during the training phase. Secondly, we conduct the derivation of GLATE, and the derivation results reveal the specific relationship between the quality of contrastive node embeddings and tem-peratures. Finally, the extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that GLATE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning models in terms of both model performance and training efficiency.",

In this paper, we focus on methods for boosting the performance of existing GNN models and propose GraphHI, a GNN framework that integrates Hidden Insights to enhance the performance of a given GNN model. We propose to utilize both inter-model and intra-model hidden insights. The inter-model hidden insights encompass the embedding vectors and logit vectors derived from other pretrained models using the same graph data. The intra-model hidden insights incorporate the embedding vectors of other nodes from the same GNN model. To optimize the suitability of hidden insights for GNN model training, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the influence of various forms of the transformed logits and the parameter $T$ in the data transformation function. Based on this analysis, a method for setting dynamic personalized parameters in the data transformation is proposed, which is tailored to the current state of each node in the GNN model. To integrate multiple sources of hidden insights, we propose ALC, an algorithm that dynamically sets appropriate combination coefficients for various loss terms. The experimental results show that GraphHI can boost the performance of GNN models using different pretrained models in four different tasks.",

            "title": "Fast Unsupervised Graph Embedding via Graph Zoom Learning",
            "abstract": "Unsupervised graph representation learning, i.e., learning node or graph embeddings from graph data in an unsupervised manner, has become an important problem when we study graph data. With the development of self-supervised learning, researchers have designed graph-level self-supervised learning paradigms and learn embeddings under these paradigms. The learned embeddings can serve as a fine initial solution to downstream tasks such as node classification or graph classification. In this paper, we propose a fast unsupervised graph embedding method, which follows the way of self-supervised learning. This method performs representation learning on the graph under a novel concept called Graph Zoom Learning (abbr. GZL), which is orthogonal to the existing concepts of unsupervised graph embedding, such as random walk and contrastive learning. Two crucial components, graph zoom-out and point-to-point contrast, help GZL reduce the overall training time cost. Specifically, on the one hand, a lightweight miniature graph is generated from the raw graph by graph zoom-out and the learning on the miniature graph is more efficient than the learning on the raw graph; on the other hand, we design the miniature-scale learning on the miniature graph and introduce community structure into this learning pattern, which contributes to the final point-to-point contrast. Since point-to-point contrast is independent of negatives, it makes the whole training more efficient. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the advantage of GZL on representation learning. On two downstream tasks of node classification and graph classification, GZL outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised graph embedding methods. Particularly, on the largest experimental graph dataset (ogbn-arxiv) with 169k nodes and 1.1m edges, GZL outperforms the runner-up by 3.3% relative accuracy and achieves up to 22.6x speedup over it.",

            "title": "Learning Adaptive Node Embeddings Across Graphs",
            "abstract": "Recently, learning embeddings of nodes in graphs has attracted increasing research attention. There are two main kinds of graph embedding methods, i.e., transductive embedding methods and inductive embedding methods. The former focuses on directly optimizing the embedding vectors, and the latter tries to learn a mapping function for the given nodes and features. However, little work has focused on applying the learned model from one graph to another, which is a pervasive idea in Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. Although some of the graph neural networks (GNNs) present a similar motivation, none of them considers both the structure bias and the feature bias between graphs. In this paper, we present a novel graph embedding problem called Adaptive Task (AT), and propose a unified framework for the adaptive task, which introduces two types of alignment to learn adaptive node embeddings across graphs. Then, based on the proposed framework, a novel Graph Adaptive Embedding network (GraphAE) is designed to address the adaptive task. Furthermore, we extend GraphAE to a multi-graph version to consider a more complex adaptive situation. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and also show that our framework can make a great improvement over a number of existing GNNs.",

In this paper, we design an efficient knowledge distillation framework for e-commerce relevance matching to integrate the respective advantages of Transformer-style models and classical relevance matching models. Especially for the core student model of the framework, we propose a novel method using $k$-order relevance modeling.

            "abstract": "\n Many real-world networks have been evolving, and are finely modeled as temporal graphs from the viewpoint of the graph theory. A temporal graph is informative, and always contains two types of information, i.e., the temporal information and topological information, where the temporal information reflects the time when the relationships are established, and the topological information focuses on the structure of the graph. In this paper, we perform time-topology analysis on temporal graphs to extract useful information. Firstly, a new metric named T-cohesiveness is proposed to evaluate the cohesiveness of a temporal subgraph. It defines the cohesiveness of a temporal subgraph from the time and topology dimensions jointly. Specifically, given a temporal graph\n \n G\n s\n \n = (\n Vs\n , \u03b5\n Es\n ), cohesiveness in the time dimension reflects whether the connections in\n \n G\n s\n \n happen in a short period of time, while cohesiveness in the topology dimension indicates whether the vertices in\n \n V\n s\n \n are densely connected and have few connections with vertices out of\n \n G\n s\n \n . Then, T-cohesiveness is utilized to perform time-topology analysis on temporal graphs, and two time-topology analysis methods are proposed. In detail, T-cohesiveness evolution tracking traces the evolution of the T-cohesiveness of a subgraph, and combo searching finds out all the subgraphs that contain the query vertex and have T-cohesiveness larger than a given threshold. Moreover, a pruning strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of combo searching. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed time-topology analysis methods and the pruning strategy.\n",

            "title": "FastSNG: The Fastest Social Network Dataset Generator",
            "abstract": "Large-scale social networks have become more and more popular with the rapid progress of social media. A number of social network analysis tasks have been developed to conduct on the real large-scale networks. However, the prohibitive cost of achieving the underlying large network, including time cost and data privacy, makes it hard to evaluate the performance of analysis algorithms on real-world social networks. In this paper, we present a tool called FastSNG, which generates heterogeneous social network datasets according to the user-defined configuration depicting the rich characteristics of the expected social network, such as community structures, attributes, and node degree distributions. Moreover, the generation algorithm of FastSNG adopts a degree distribution generation (D2G) model which is efficient to generate web-scale social network datasets. Finally, the tool provides user-friendly and succinct user interfaces for the interaction with general users.",
