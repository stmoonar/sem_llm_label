            "title": "If in a Crowdsourced Data Annotation Pipeline, a GPT-4",
            "abstract": "Recent studies indicated GPT-4 outperforms online crowd workers in data labeling accuracy, notably workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). However, these studies were criticized for deviating from standard crowdsourcing practices and emphasizing individual workers\u2019 performances over the whole data-annotation process. This paper compared GPT-4 and an ethical and well-executed MTurk pipeline, with 415 workers labeling 3,177 sentence segments from 200 scholarly articles using the CODA-19 scheme. Two worker interfaces yielded 127,080 labels, which were then used to infer the final labels through eight label-aggregation algorithms. Our evaluation showed that despite best practices, MTurk pipeline\u2019s highest accuracy was 81.5%, whereas GPT-4 achieved 83.6%. Interestingly, when combining GPT-4\u2019s labels with crowd labels collected via an advanced worker interface for aggregation, 2 out of the 8 algorithms achieved an even higher accuracy (87.5%, 87.0%). Further analysis suggested that, when the crowd\u2019s and GPT-4\u2019s labeling strengths are complementary, aggregating them could increase labeling accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Most existing large-scale academic search engines are built to retrieve text-based information. However, there are no large-scale retrieval services for scientific figures and tables. One challenge for such services is understanding scientific figures' semantics, such as their types and purposes. A key obstacle is the need for datasets containing annotated scientific figures and tables, which can then be used for classification, question-answering, and auto-captioning. Here, we develop a pipeline that extracts figures and tables from the scientific literature and a deep-learning-based framework that classifies scientific figures using visual features. Using this pipeline, we built the first large-scale automatically annotated corpus, ACL-Fig, consisting of 112,052 scientific figures extracted from ~56K research papers in the ACL Anthology. The ACL-Fig-Pilot dataset contains 1,671 manually labeled scientific figures belonging to 19 categories. The dataset is accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/citeseerx/ACL-fig under a CC BY-NC license.",

            "abstract": "Recent ubiquity and disruptive impacts of large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about their potential to be misused (.i.e, generating large-scale harmful and misleading content). To combat this emerging risk of LLMs, we propose a novel\"Fighting Fire with Fire\"(F3) strategy that harnesses modern LLMs' generative and emergent reasoning capabilities to counter human-written and LLM-generated disinformation. First, we leverage GPT-3.5-turbo to synthesize authentic and deceptive LLM-generated content through paraphrase-based and perturbation-based prefix-style prompts, respectively. Second, we apply zero-shot in-context semantic reasoning techniques with cloze-style prompts to discern genuine from deceptive posts and news articles. In our extensive experiments, we observe GPT-3.5-turbo's zero-shot superiority for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, where GPT-3.5-turbo consistently achieved accuracy at 68-72%, unlike the decline observed in previous customized and fine-tuned disinformation detectors.

            "abstract": "We present ACL OCL, a scholarly corpus derived from the ACL Anthology to assist Open scientific research in the Computational Linguistics domain. Integrating and enhancing the previous versions of the ACL Anthology, the ACL OCL contributes metadata, PDF files, citation graphs and additional structured full texts with sections, figures, and links to a large knowledge resource (Semantic Scholar). The ACL OCL spans seven decades, containing 73K papers, alongside 210K figures. We spotlight how ACL OCL applies to observe trends in computational linguistics. By detecting paper topics with a supervised neural model, we note that interest in\"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing\"is waning and\"Natural Language Generation\"is resurging. Our dataset is available from HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/WINGNUS/ACL-OCL).",

            "abstract": "The advancement of web programming techniques, such as Ajax and jQuery, and datastores, such as Apache Solr and Elasticsearch, have made it much easier to deploy small to medium scale web-based search engines. However, developing a sustainable search engine that supports scholarly big data services is still challenging often because of limited human resources and financial support. Such scenarios are typical in academic settings or small businesses. Here, we showcase how four key design decisions were made by trading-off competing factors such as performance, cost, and efficiency, when developing the Next Generation CiteSeerX (NGX), the successor of CiteSeerX, which was a pioneering digital library search engine that has been serving academic communities for more than two decades. This work extends our previous work in Wu et al. (2021) and discusses design considerations of infrastructure, web applications, indexing, and document filtering. These design considerations can be generalized to other web-based search engines with a similar scale that are deployed in small business or academic settings with limited resources.",

Despite the importance of studying the quality and impact of mentorship, there are few large representative mentorship datasets available. We contribute two datasets to the study of mentorship. The first has over 300,000 ground truth academic mentor-mentee pairs obtained from multiple diverse, manually-curated sources, and linked to the Semantic Scholar (S2) knowledge graph. We use this dataset to train an accurate classifier for predicting mentorship relations from bibliographic features, achieving a held-out area under the ROC curve of 0.96. Our second dataset is formed by applying the classifier to the complete co-authorship graph of S2. The result is an inferred graph with 137 million weighted mentorship edges among 24 million nodes. We release this first-of-its-kind dataset to the community to help accelerate the study of scholarly mentorship:https://github.com/allenai/S2AMP-dataCCS CONCEPTS\u2022 Information systems \u2192 Data mining.",

We also provide a detailed analysis of what the transformers are learning and why is it hard to train a math language model using transformers. This year\u2019s submission to Task-1 includes summarizing long question-answer pairs to augment and index documents, using byte-pair encoding to tokenize formula and then re-rank them, and finally important keywords extraction from posts. Using an ensemble of these methods our approach shows a 20% improvement than our ARQMath\u20192020 Task-1 submission.",

In this work, we present our findings of analyzing the query log of an academic search engine in the past four years. We study the distribution of query intents to understand the information requested by users. We classify query strings by topics using shallow and latent features captured using a customized word embedding model. To this end, we create a dataset that has scientific keywords and titles labeled with fields of study. This dataset is later used to train a classifier that discriminates query logs by topics. Our work will help to train better learning-based ranking functions that improve user experiences for an academic search engine. In addition, we anonymize our 14,759,852 query logs and make them available to the research community for further exploration.",

            "abstract": "Since the emergence of scholarly big data, there have been several efforts for web-based services such as digital library search engines (DLSEs). However, much of the design and specifications of an accessible, usable, scalable, and sustainable DLSE have not been well represented and discussed in the literature. We argue that these four characteristics are essential to providing a high-quality service for scholarly big data from both the user and developer\u2019s perspectives. This paper reviews the design, implementation, and operation experiences, and lessons of CiteSeerX, a real-world digital library search engine. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current design, and proposed a new design with a revised architecture, enhanced hardware, and software infrastructure. The Alpha version of the new design has been implemented and tested. The new system replaces MySQL and Apache Solr with a single instance of Elasticsearch, which plays a dual role of data storage and search. Another major improvement is the integration of extraction and ingestion, which significantly boosts document ingestion speed. The web application is re-engineered to enhance the user experience by applying a learning-to-rank model and offering more refined search tools. The system is also improved in many other aspects. We believe the design considerations and experience can benefit researchers and engineers who plan, design, and upgrade future systems with comparable scales and functionalities.",
