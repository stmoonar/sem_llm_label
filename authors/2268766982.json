            "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Ship Location Estimation using Multiple Cameras in Coastal Areas",
            "abstract": "Recent advances, especially in deep learning, allow to effectively detect ship targets in surveillance videos. However, the translation of these detections to the real-world locations of ships has not been sufficiently explored. The common approach in the literature is using a transformation matrix to convert a pixel to a real-world coordinate. However, this approach has three shortcomings: first, a set of reference point pairs has to be manually prepared to establish the matrix; second, the matrix always maps a pixel to the same real-world coordinate, ignoring that there is no one-to-one correspondence between discrete pixel coordinates and continuous real-world coordinates; third, this approach can only work with one camera. In light of this, we propose a technique PixelToRegion that explicitly takes into account the uncertainty in coordinate conversion by mapping each pixel to a spatial polygon. Next, we propose a new algorithm MCbSLE that can estimate ship locations using pixel sets from multiple cameras. The precision of location estimation by MCbSLE is enhanced through spatial intersection between polygons from different cameras. Experiments are conducted under 16 carefully designed multi-camera settings to evaluate MCbSLE w.r.t. four factors: different ports, the number of cameras, the distance between cameras, and camera headings. Results on one-day ship trajectory data show that (1) an 79.8% accuracy in the number of coordinates can be achieved by MCbSLE when there are no more than 10 ships in camera views; (2) using multiple cameras can improve the precision of location estimation by one order of magnitude compared with using one camera.",

            "abstract": "Analysing traffic data is an important task in the context of intelligent transportation systems within cities. Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have appeared to be an important tool for performing this task due to their promising performance in extracting spatial correlations in graphs. Nevertheless, the design of these networks and the effectiveness of the networks\u2019 layers-or components-remains unclear and lacks intuition. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting an ablation study that compares the impact of components that are commonly used in the literature, including spatial and temporal convolution layers within GCNN models performance. To achieve this goal, we utilize a baseline network wherein each layer can be replaced by different approaches, allowing the generation of results under various scenarios. Our focus is on resolving the problem of estimating missing values for road segments\u2019 average speeds. We examine various GCNN components utilizing two real-world datasets to assess their effectiveness.",

In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how the energy consumption of electrical vehicles behave on intersections can be paramount to save on electricity and reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. This study uses a large dataset of high-frequency trajectory data to verify the feasibility of intersection analysis and study how roundabouts fare against each other when it comes to the energy consumption of EVs. The results show that there can be a difference of 25--33% in the consumption inside roundabouts depending on their category. They also show that the speed of the vehicles as they enter the roundabouts correlates to their energy consumption in a polynomial fashion.",

            "abstract": "Urban mobility evolution poses challenges that necessitate the integration of quality-assured, diverse data. Although open data initiatives provide some resources, the published data often lacks utility and quality. This challenge is further magnified by the lack of specialized skills needed to process mobility data. This paper introduces the Brussels Mobility Observatory (BMT), a platform for publishing mobility data in Brussels. The platform collects, archives, enriches and republishes open mobility data, serving as a centralized access point for mobility-related information. It presents the opportunity for bringing research results in data cleaning and fusion to end users in authorities and businesses, transforming challenges into opportunities for innovation in urban mobility.",

            "abstract": "There is more and more data on transportation becoming available, thanks to the open data initiatives. Yet issues persist with its quality and usability. These inconsistencies pose challenges for authorities and businesses aiming to utilize this data in service of sustainable cities and improved transportation. Moreover, the scarcity of professionals with specialized skills in mobility data science further hinders the use of data. We envision a data-driven digital mobility twin as a potential solution that bridges the gap between authorities and businesses on the one hand, and mobility data scientists on the other hand. This solution allows data scientists to apply their expertise to curate, integrate, and enrich the data, thereby elevating its value and usability. Consequently, authorities and businesses gain access to high-quality data, enhancing their capacity to deliver effective services. We anticipate that this approach will foster more extensive data sharing, feeding a culture of data sharing and ultimately facilitating an efficient, data-driven mobility ecosystem. This talk presents our vision, the existing works supporting this vision, challenges towards fully achieving it, and an initial implementation of a mobility twin for the capital of Brussels.",

The architecture makes use of a data lake for scalable storage of diverse mobility data sets, on top of which separate computing and storage layers are implemented to allow independent scaling with a data operations toolbox providing all data operations. Furthermore, to cater for mobility analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence support, an edge analytics suite is provided that encompasses distributed algorithms for mobility analytics and federated learning, thereby exploiting edge computing technologies. In turn, this is supported by a resource allocator that monitors the energy consumption of data-intensive operations and provides this information to the platform for intelligent task placement in edge devices, aiming at energy-efficient operations. As a result, an end-to-end platform is proposed that combines data services and infrastructure services towards supporting mobility application domains, such as urban and maritime.",
