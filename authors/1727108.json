            "abstract": "Trajectory data combines the complexities of time series, spatial data, and (sometimes irrational) movement behavior. As data availability and computing power have increased, so has the popularity of deep learning from trajectory data. This paper aims to provide an overview of deep neural networks designed to learn from trajectory data, focusing on recent work published between 2020 and 2022. We take a data-centric approach and distinguish between deep learning models trained using dense trajectories (quasi-continuous tracking data), sparse trajectories (such as check-in data), and aggregated trajectories (crowd information).",

            "abstract": "This chapter presents some of the fundamental assumptions and principles that could form the philosophical foundation of GeoAI and spatial data science. Instead of reviewing the well-established characteristics of spatial data (analysis), including interaction, neighborhoods, and autocorrelation, the chapter highlights themes such as sustainability, bias in training data, diversity in schema knowledge, and the (potential lack of) neutrality of GeoAI systems from a unifying ethical perspective. Reflecting on our profession's ethical implications will assist us in conducting potentially disruptive research more responsibly, identifying pitfalls in designing, training, and deploying GeoAI-based systems, and developing a shared understanding of the benefits but also potential dangers of artificial intelligence and machine learning research across academic fields, all while sharing our unique (geo)spatial perspective with others.",

            "abstract": "Generating learning-friendly representations for points in space is a fundamental and long-standing problem in ML. Recently, multi-scale encoding schemes (such as Space2Vec and NeRF) were proposed to directly encode any point in 2D/3D Euclidean space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been successfully applied to various geospatial prediction and generative tasks. However, all current 2D and 3D location encoders are designed to model point distances in Euclidean space. So when applied to large-scale real-world GPS coordinate datasets, which require distance metric learning on the spherical surface, both types of models can fail due to the map projection distortion problem (2D) and the spherical-to-Euclidean distance approximation error (3D). To solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale location encoder called Sphere2Vec which can preserve spherical distances when encoding point coordinates on a spherical surface. We developed a unified view of distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the DFS. We also provide theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec preserves the spherical surface distance between any two points, while existing encoding schemes do not. Experiments on 20 synthetic datasets show that Sphere2Vec can outperform all baseline models on all these datasets with up to 30.8% error rate reduction. We then apply Sphere2Vec to three geo-aware image classification tasks - fine-grained species recognition, Flickr image recognition, and remote sensing image classification. Results on 7 real-world datasets show the superiority of Sphere2Vec over multiple location encoders on all three tasks. Further analysis shows that Sphere2Vec outperforms other location encoder models, especially in the polar regions and data-sparse areas because of its nature for spherical surface distance preservation.

            "abstract": "Qualitative spatio-temporal reasoning (QSTR) plays a key role in spatial cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) research. In the past, research and applications of QSTR have often taken place in the context of declarative forms of knowledge representation. For instance, conceptual neighborhoods (CN) and composition tables (CT) of relations are introduced explicitly and utilized for spatial/temporal reasoning. Orthogonal to this line of study, we focus on bottom-up machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate QSTR. More specifically, we are interested in questions of whether similarities between qualitative relations can be learned from data purely based on ML models, and, if so, how these models differ from the ones studied by traditional approaches. To achieve this, we propose a graph-based approach to examine the similarity of relations by analyzing trained ML models. Using various experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the relationships discovered by ML models are well-aligned with CN structures introduced in the (theoretical) literature, for both spatial and temporal reasoning. Noticeably, even with significantly limited qualitative information for training, ML models are still able to automatically construct neighborhood structures. Moreover, patterns of asymmetric similarities between relations are disclosed using such a data-driven approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to automatically discover CNs without any domain knowledge. Our results can be applied to discovering CNs of any set of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) relations.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Qualitative spatial reasoning has been a core research topic in GIScience and AI for decades. It has been adopted in a wide range of applications such as wayfinding, question answering, and robotics. Most developed spatial inference engines use symbolic representation and reasoning, which focuses on small and densely connected data sets, and struggles to deal with noise and vagueness. However, with more sensors becoming available, reasoning over spatial relations on large-scale and noisy geospatial data sets requires more robust alternatives. This paper, therefore, proposes a subsymbolic approach using neural networks to facilitate qualitative spatial reasoning. More specifically, we focus on higher-order spatial relations as those have been largely ignored due to the binary nature of the underlying representations, e.g. knowledge graphs. We specifically explore the use of neural networks to reason over ternary projective relations such as between. We consider multiple types of spatial constraint, including higher-order relatedness and the conceptual neighborhood of ternary projective relations to make the proposed model spatially explicit. We introduce evaluating results demonstrating that the proposed spatially explicit method substantially outperforms the existing baseline by about 20%.",

            "abstract": "Disasters are often unpredictable and complex events, requiring humanitarian organizations to understand and respond to many different issues simultaneously and immediately. Often the biggest challenge to improving the effectiveness of the response is quickly finding the right expert, with the right expertise concerning a specific disaster type/disaster and geographic region. To assist in achieving such a goal, this paper demonstrates a knowledge graph-based search engine developed on top of an expert knowledge graph. It accommodates three modes of information retrieval, including a follow-your-nose search, an expert similarity search, and a SPARQL query interface. We will demonstrate utilizing the system to rapidly navigate from a hazard event to a specific expert who may be helpful, for example. More importantly, as the data is fully integrated including links between hazards and their abstract topics, we can find experts who have relevant expertise while navigating the graph.",
