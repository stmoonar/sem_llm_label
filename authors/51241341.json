            "title": "The optimal carbon emission reduction and advertising strategy with dynamic market share in the supply chain",
            "abstract": "PurposeAs the quality of the environment decreases, enterprises and consumers' awareness of environmental protection is constantly improving. More and more enterprises begin to increase their investment in carbon emission reduction and attract environmentally friendly consumers to buy low-carbon products through advertising. The purpose of this paper is to utilize a realistic differential game model to provide dynamic carbon emission reduction strategies, advertising strategies and cooperation methods for complex supply chain members from a long-term perspective.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses the extend Vidale-Wolfe model (V-W model) to discuss the dynamic joint emission reduction strategy in the supply chain.Findings(1) When consumers' awareness of environmental protection increases, on the whole, carbon emission reduction and profit of products show an upward trend. (2) From a long-term perspective, the manufacturer's advertising subsidy to one of the retailers is the best choice. If the strength of the two retailers is unbalanced, the manufacturer will choose to cooperate with the dominant retailer. (3) Advertising, as a marketing means for retailers to promote low-carbon products, can alleviate the adverse effects of prisoner's dilemma in a semi-cooperative state, but it cannot achieve the Pareto optimization result.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper focuses on the analysis of the situation that when the manufacturer is the leader and thinks that consumers are active advocates of low-carbon products.Originality/valueThe results of this paper can provide theoretical basis for the joint emission strategy of supply chain members in low-carbon environment.",

            "title": "Evaluation of Cruise Ship Supply Logistics Service Providers with ANP-RBF",
            "abstract": "To overcome challenges like market dynamic configuration, information integration, and quick response, it is necessary to build an efficient, stable, and well-coordinated supply chain relationship for cruise ship supply. This requires building of a solid evaluation index system of logistics service providers (LSPs) in the cruise ship supply chain. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation index system that consists of four dimensions, based on the characteristics of cruise ship supply and the connotation and type of cruise ship supply LSPs. The four dimensions are business level, collaborative capacity, service price, and information level, including ten subcriteria. We first establish an evaluation decision model for the interdependence and feedback relationship between the criteria by using analytic network process (ANP) for weight definition of each index; then, we use Super Decisions software to simulate the results, combine RBF neural network training and validation, and extract implicit knowledge and laws. We propose an incremental algorithm that can effectively avoid the influence of subjective factors and increase the dynamic nature of evaluation. The results show that the ANP-RBF method has strong practicability in the evaluation of cruise ship supply LSPs.",

            "abstract": "According to the specialty of fresh agricultural products, a delivery model was established. The model consists of single distribution center and multiple demand points. The integrated cost which consists of transport cost and time cost was taken as the optimization objective. It is used as weight in classic Dijkstra algorithm instead of distance. We also used a case study to illustrate saving method and classic Dijkstra algorithm with integrated cost. The comparison was conducted by calculating the integrated cost of optimal routes separately. Following the comparison, we draw a conclusion that in the field of fresh agricultural products distribution, classic Dijkstra algorithm which takes integrated cost as optimization objective is superior to the saving method in which distance is the optimization objective.",

            "title": "Value-based design of electronic commerce servers",
            "abstract": "The explosive growth in online shopping has provided online retailers impressive opportunities to increase market share. At the same time, research has identified that slow response time at electronic shopping sites is the No. I reason that buyers leave and take their business elsewhere. Thus, retailers who are not ready could miss huge revenue opportunities. \nSolving this congestion problem is especially important for holiday seasons. Increasing server capacity may solve response time problem in the short run, but resources and capital may be wasted during off-peak periods. In this study, a scheme is proposed that can improve a server's performance under its current capacity. This scheme is based on priority order processing, where the priority of an order depends on the potential value of the order. The results for a single-period analysis show that the benefit from priority processing increases as the server becomes busier. \nThis study also models a multi-period version of the problem, where the demand in a period depends on the Quality of Service (QoS) that buyers receive in the previous period. In multi-period problem, the server capacity planning in each period is determined optimally. Here, it is observed that the retailer usually looses money in the first period in order to provide better service and thereby achieve growth in future demand. The operating policy of the server evolves from an emphasis on QoS in initial periods, to one on profit in subsequent periods. \nIn addition this dissertation has set up a model to study the issue of balancing an E-retailer's spending on information technology and advertising. Both analytical and numerical results are presented. It is shown that E-retailers should place a higher priority on keeping current customers satisfied, rather than attracting excess demand for undercapacitated servers.",
