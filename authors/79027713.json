            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Location measurements from people are very often sparsely sampled due to power constraints or as an attempt at location privacy. However, we would still like to reason about location changes between samples in order to infer visits or understand moving behavior. In this work, we present a method for representing this location uncertainty while constraining the moving object to the road network, which is more realistic and precise for human mobility. Unlike the most straightforward method, fastest path, our method explicitly represents the location uncertainty between location measurements with probabilities. We introduce road network-based bridgelets, which are spatiotemporal probability clouds that model the location uncertainty between two endpoints, and we propose an algorithm, APD*, to generate bridgelets efficiently. In our experimental section, we evaluate the performance of APD* and provide visual examples to compare its output with other baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Regular people give away their location data without much knowledge about what can be inferred from it. This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of location disclosure, showing what can be inferred from even just a few place visits. The aim is to highlight how modern inference algorithms can take small location disclosures and create detailed inferences about where else a person is likely to go and what sorts of places they tend to visit. Based on an analysis of over 100,000 people, we show how disclosing just one location point can be used to predict other visits with an AUC of 0.88. We develop another algorithm that shows the types of places a person has an unusually high propensity to visit, and we use this result as part of an economic analysis of delivering targeted advertising. This research serves to raise awareness about what can be inferred from even very small location disclosures, which can in turn inform regular people about their true privacy risks.",

            "abstract": "Geofences are a fundamental tool of location-based services. A geofence is usually activated by detecting a location measurement inside the geofence region. However, location measurements such as GPS often appear sporadically on smart-phones, partly due to weak signals or privacy preservation. Users may restrict location sensing, or conserve energy, because sensing locations can consume a significant amount of battery. These unpredictable, and sometimes long, gaps between measurements mean that entry into a geofence can go completely undetected. In this paper we argue that short term location prediction can help alleviate this problem by computing the probability of entering a geofence in the future. Complicating this prediction approach is the fact that another location measurement could appear at any time, making the prediction redundant and wasteful. Therefore, we develop a framework that accounts for uncertain location predictions and the possibility of new measurements to trigger geofence activations. Our framework optimizes over the benefits and costs of correct and incorrect geofence activations, leading to an algorithm that reacts intelligently to the uncertainties of future movements and measurements.",

This paper presents a new method for filling these gaps that is both principled and data-driven. Unlike the most common method, linear interpolation, our method explicitly represents the location uncertainty in the gaps with probability. It also learns from actual mobility data. We introduce bridgelets, which are small, spatio-temporal, maximum entropy clouds that model spatial uncertainty over small gaps. Using actual trajectories, we combine bridgelets into probabilistic bridges that are specific to absolute start and end locations on the map. The resulting bridges give the probability of visiting certain in-between locations given only the start and end points. Using real trajectory data, we compare our maximum entropy bridges to a popular baseline to show how our approach is much more accurate.",

            "abstract": "Mobile apps that use location data are pervasive, spanning domains such as transportation, urban planning, and healthcare. Important use cases for location data rely on statistical queries, e.g., identifying hotspots where users work and travel. Such queries can be answered efficiently by building histograms. However, precise histograms can expose sensitive details about individual users. Differential privacy (DP) is a mature and widely adopted protection model, but most approaches for DP-compliant histograms work in a data-independent fashion, leading to poor accuracy. The few proposed data-dependent techniques attempt to adjust histogram partitions based on dataset characteristics, but they do not perform well due to the addition of noise required to achieve DP. In addition, they use ad hoc criteria to decide the depth of the partitioning. We identify density homogeneity as a main factor driving the accuracy of DP-compliant histograms, and we build a data structure that splits the space such that data density is homogeneous within each resulting partition. We propose a self-tuning approach to decide the depth of the partitioning structure that optimizes the use of privacy budget. Furthermore, we provide an optimization that scales the proposed split approach to large datasets while maintaining accuracy. We show through extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy compared to existing approaches.",

            "abstract": "The Brownian bridge is a method for probabilistically interpolating the location of a moving person, animal, or object between two measured points. This type of probabilistic interpolation is useful, because it represents the uncertainty of the interpolated points. It can be used to infer the probability of having visited a certain location, including possible exposure to disease. In the class of probabilistic interpolators, the Brownian bridge is attractive, because it has only a single adjustable parameter, the diffusion coefficient. This paper investigates the suitability of the Brownian bridge for interpolating human locations using mobility data from over 12 million people. One section looks at the consistency of the diffusion coefficient from person to person. As part of this, the paper presents, for the first time, a closed form solution for the maximum likelihood estimate of this parameter. The paper also presents statistical tests aimed at evaluating the accuracy of the Brownian bridge for interpolating human location.",

            "abstract": "Mobile apps that use location data are pervasive, spanning domains such as transportation, urban planning and healthcare. Important use cases for location data rely on statistical queries, e.g., identifying hotspots where users work and travel. Such queries can be answered efficiently by building histograms. However, precise histograms can expose sensitive details about individual users. Differential privacy (DP) is a mature and widely-adopted protection model, but most approaches for DP-compliant histograms work in a data-independent fashion, leading to poor accuracy. The few proposed data-dependent techniques attempt to adjust histogram partitions based on dataset characteristics, but they do not perform well due to the addition of noise required to achieve DP. We identify density homogeneity as a main factor driving the accuracy of DP-compliant histograms, and we build a data structure that splits the space such that data density is homogeneous within each resulting partition. We show through extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy compared to existing approaches.",

            "abstract": "A trajectory, defined as a sequence of location measurements, contains valuable information about movements of an individual. Its value of information (VOI) may change depending on the specific application. However, in a variety of applications, knowing the intrinsic VOI of a trajectory is important to guide other subsequent tasks or decisions. This work aims to find a principled framework to quantify the intrinsic VOI of trajectories from the owner's perspective. This is a challenging problem because an appropriate framework needs to take into account various characteristics of the trajectory, prior knowledge, and different types of trajectory degradation. We propose a framework based on information gain (IG) as a principled approach to solve this problem. Our IG framework transforms a trajectory with discrete-time measurements to a canonical representation, i.e., continuous in time with continuous mean and variance estimates, and then quantifies the reduction of uncertainty about the locations of the owner over a period of time as the VOI of the trajectory. Qualitative and extensive quantitative evaluation show that the IG framework is capable of effectively capturing important characteristics contributing to the VOI of trajectories.",
