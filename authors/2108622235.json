            "title": "Alleviating Matthew Effect of Offline Reinforcement Learning in Interactive Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), a technology that offline learns a policy from logged data without the need to interact with online environments, has become a favorable choice in decision-making processes like interactive recommendation. Offline RL faces the value overestimation problem. To address it, existing methods employ conservatism, e.g., by constraining the learned policy to be close to behavior policies or punishing the rarely visited state-action pairs. However, when applying such offline RL to recommendation, it will cause a severe Matthew effect, i.e., the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, by promoting popular items or categories while suppressing the less popular ones. It is a notorious issue that needs to be addressed in practical recommender systems. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the Matthew effect in offline RL-based recommendation. Through theoretical analyses, we find that the conservatism of existing methods fails in pursuing users' long-term satisfaction. It inspires us to add a penalty term to relax the pessimism on states with high entropy of the logging policy and indirectly penalizes actions leading to less diverse states. This leads to the main technical contribution of the work: Debiased model-based Offline RL (DORL) method. Experiments show that DORL not only captures user interests well but also alleviates the Matthew effect. The implementation is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/DORL-codes",

            "title": "Improvement of Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm Based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Reasoning Under Missing Data",
            "abstract": "Commodity recommendation plays an essential role in the marketing field in the Internet era, and collaborative filtering, as a powerful technique of commodity recommendation, has been widely concerned in both academic studies and practical applications. Existing research on collaborative filtering often uses methods such as genetic algorithm and neural network to solve the sparsity and cold start problems while ignoring the fuzziness of users\u2019 ratings on goods or services. To solve the problems, we propose a recommendation algorithm (IFR-CF) based on intuitionistic fuzzy reasoning and collaborative filtering. In this algorithm, the characteristic coefficient in intuitionistic fuzzy reasoning is used to replace the traditional similarity coefficient to determine neighbor set, and the finite prior ordering method is used to replace traditional algorithm to recommend commodity. Two groups of data are extracted from Movielens and Jester datasets for experiments, and the MAE value generated by the recommended items is taken as the metric to verify the algorithm performance. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional algorithms, our algorithm achieves lower MAE value and higher recommendation accuracy. Meanwhile, the intuitionistic index of fuzzy set is taken into account in the calculation of the hesitation coefficient, which provides a novel solution to the problem of missing scoring data of users.",
