            "abstract": "Decision-making through artificial neural networks with minimal latency is critical for numerous applications such as navigation, tracking, and real-time machine action systems. This requires machine learning hardware to process multidimensional data at high throughput. Unfortunately, handling convolution operations, the primary computational tool for data classification tasks, obeys challenging runtime complexity scaling laws. However, homomorphically implementing the convolution theorem in a Fourier optics display light processor can achieve a non-iterative O(1) runtime complexity for data inputs beyond 1,000 \u00d7 1,000 large matrices. Following this approach, here we demonstrate data streaming multi-kernel image batching using a Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) accelerator. We show image batch processing of large-scale matrices as 2 million dot product multiplications performed by a digital light processing module in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, we further parallelize this optical FCNN system by exploiting multiple spatially parallel diffraction orders, achieving a 98x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art FCNN accelerators. A comprehensive discussion of the practical challenges associated with working at the edge of system capabilities highlights the problem of crosstalk and resolution scaling laws in the Fourier domain. Accelerating convolution by exploiting massive parallelism in display technology brings non-Van Neumann-based machine learning acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks are paramount in image and signal processing, and are responsible for the majority of image recognition power consumption today, concentrated mainly in convolution computations. With convolution operations being computationally intensive, next\u2010generation hardware accelerators need to offer parallelization and high efficiency. Diffractive optics offers the promise of low\u2010latency, highly parallel convolution operations. However, thus far parallelism is only partially harvested, thereby significantly underdelivering in comparison to its throughput potential. Here, a parallelized operation high\u2010throughput Fourier optic convolutional accelerator is demonstrated. For the first time, simultaneous processing of multiple kernels in Fourier domain enabled by optical diffraction orders is achieved alongside input parallelism. The proposed approach can offer \u2248100\u00d7 speedup over the previous generation optical diffraction\u2010based processor and 10\u00d7 speedup over other state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art optical Fourier classifiers.",

            "title": "Shannon entropy as a measure of structure in optical beams",
            "abstract": "While information is ubiquitously generated, shared, and analyzed in a modern-day life, there is still some controversy around the ways to asses the amount and quality of information inside a noisy channel. A number of theoretical approaches based on, e.g., conditional Shannon entropy and Fisher information have been developed, along with some experimental validations. Some of these approaches are limited to a certain alphabet, while others tend to fall short when considering optical beams with non-trivial wavefront topology, such as orbital momentum laser modes. Here, we introduce the concept of expressing information as a measure of structure in a laser beam. We propose a new definition of classical Shannon information via the Wigner distribution function, while respecting the Heisenberg inequality. Following this, we calculate the amount of information in a Gaussian, Hermite-Gaussian, and Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in juxtaposition and experimentally validate it by reconstruction of the Wigner distribution function from the intensity distribution of structured laser beams. We experimentally demonstrate measuring structure of the laser beams in singular optics to assess the amount of contained information. Given the generality of this approach of defining information via analyzing the beam complexity is applicable to laser modes of any topology that can be described by 'well-behaved' functions. Classical Shannon information defined in this way is detached from a particular alphabet, i.e. communication scheme, and scales with the structural complexity of the system. Such a synergy between the Wigner distribution function encompassing the information in both real and reciprocal space, and information being a measure of disorder, can contribute into future coherent detection algorithms and remote sensing.",
