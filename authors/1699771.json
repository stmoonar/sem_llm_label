            "abstract": "One of the current key challenges in Explainable AI is in correctly interpreting activations of hidden neurons. It seems evident that accurate interpretations thereof would provide insights into the question what a deep learning system has internally \\emph{detected} as relevant on the input, thus lifting some of the black box character of deep learning systems. The state of the art on this front indicates that hidden node activations appear to be interpretable in a way that makes sense to humans, at least in some cases. Yet, systematic automated methods that would be able to first hypothesize an interpretation of hidden neuron activations, and then verify it, are mostly missing. In this paper, we provide such a method and demonstrate that it provides meaningful interpretations. It is based on using large-scale background knowledge -- a class hierarchy of approx. 2 million classes curated from the Wikipedia Concept Hierarchy -- together with a symbolic reasoning approach called \\emph{concept induction} based on description logics that was originally developed for applications in the Semantic Web field. Our results show that we can automatically attach meaningful labels from the background knowledge to individual neurons in the dense layer of a Convolutional Neural Network through a hypothesis and verification process.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we propose a sustainable path-finding application for grain transportation during the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine. This application is to build a suite of algorithms to find possible optimal paths for transporting grain that remains in Ukraine. The application uses the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology(KNARM) and the KnowWhereGraph to achieve this goal. Currently, we are working towards creating an ontology that will allow for a more effective heuristic approach by incorporating the lessons learned from the KnowWhereGraph. The aim is to enhance the path-finding process and provide more accurate and efficient results. In the future, we will continue exploring and implementing new techniques that can further improve the sustainability of the path-finding applications with a knowledge graph backend for grain transportation through hazardous and adversarial environments. The code is available upon reviewer\u2019s request. It can not be made public due to the sensitive nature of the data.",

We have therefore developed the Modular MODS Ontology (MMODS-O) which incorporates all elements and attributes of the MODS XML schema. In designing the ontology, we adopt the recent Modular Ontology Design Methodology (MOMo) with the intention to strike a balance between modularity and quality ontology design on the one hand, and conservative backward compatibility with MODS on the other.",

            "title": "Modeling Hierarchical Reasoning Chains by Linking Discourse Units and Key Phrases for Reading Comprehension",
            "abstract": "Machine reading comprehension (MRC) poses new challenges to logical reasoning, which aims to understand the implicit logical relations entailed in the given contexts and perform inference over them. Due to the complexity of logic, logical connections exist at different granularity levels. However, most existing methods of logical reasoning individually focus on either entity-aware or discourse-based information but ignore the hierarchical relations that may even have mutual effects. This paper proposes a holistic graph network (HGN) that deals with context at both discourse-level and word-level as the basis for logical reasoning to provide a more fine-grained relation extraction. Specifically, node-level and type-level relations, which can be interpreted as bridges in the reasoning process, are modeled by a hierarchical interaction mechanism to improve the interpretation of MRC systems. Experimental results on logical reasoning QA datasets (ReClor and LogiQA) and natural language inference datasets (SNLI and ANLI) show the effectiveness and generalization of our method, and in-depth analysis verifies its capability to understand complex logical relations.",

The proposed pattern is a modified merger of a standard Agent Role and a standard Name pattern stub.",

They provide for a very tight integration of DL and rules. Nominal schemas can be understood as syntactic sugar on top of OWL. However, this naive perspective leads to inefficient reasoning procedures. In order to develop an efficient reasoning procedure for the language ELV ++ , which results from extending the OWL profile language OWL EL with nominal schemas, we propose a transformation from ELV ++ ontologies into Datalog-like rule programs that can be used for satisfiability checking and assertion retrieval. The use of this transformation enables the use of powerful Datalog engines to solve reasoning tasks over ELV ++ ontologies. We implement and then evaluate our approach on several real-world, data-intensive ontologies, and find that it can outperform state-of-the-art reasoners such as Konclude and ELK. As a lesser side result we also provide a self-contained description of a rule-based algorithm for EL ++ which does not require a normal form transformation.",
