            "title": "Cross-Lingual Link Discovery for Under-Resourced Languages",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an overview of current technologies for cross-lingual link discovery, and we discuss challenges, experiences and prospects of their application to under-resourced languages. We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

            "abstract": "Multilingualism is a cultural cornerstone of Europe and firmly anchored in the European treaties including full language equality. However, language barriers impacting business, cross-lingual and cross-cultural communication are still omnipresent. Language Technologies (LTs) are a powerful means to break down these barriers. While the last decade has seen various initiatives that created a multitude of approaches and technologies tailored to Europe\u2019s specific needs, there is still an immense level of fragmentation. At the same time, AI has become an increasingly important concept in the European Information and Communication Technology area. For a few years now, AI \u2013 including many opportunities, synergies but also misconceptions \u2013 has been overshadowing every other topic. We present an overview of the European LT landscape, describing funding programmes, activities, actions and challenges in the different countries with regard to LT, including the current state of play in industry and the LT market. We present a brief overview of the main LT-related activities on the EU level in the last ten years and develop strategic guidance with regard to four key dimensions.",

One intensively-studied problem is that of automatically generating text from images. In this paper, we extend this problem to the more specific domain of face description. Unlike scene descriptions, face descriptions are more fine-grained and rely on attributes extracted from the image, rather than objects and relations. Given that no data exists for this task, we present an ongoing crowdsourcing study to collect a corpus of descriptions of face images taken `in the wild'. To gain a better understanding of the variation we find in face description and the possible issues that this may raise, we also conducted an annotation study on a subset of the corpus. Primarily, we found descriptions to refer to a mixture of attributes, not only physical, but also emotional and inferential, which is bound to create further challenges for current image-to-text methods.",

            "abstract": "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are a class of linguistic forms spanning conventional word boundaries that are both idiosyncratic and pervasive across different languages. The structure of linguistic processing that depends on the clear distinction between words and phrases has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs. The issue of MWE handling is crucial for NLP applications, where it raises a number of challenges. The emergence of solutions in the absence of guiding principles motivates this survey, whose aim is not only to provide a focused review of MWE processing, but also to clarify the nature of interactions between MWE processing and downstream applications. We propose a conceptual framework within which challenges and research contributions can be positioned. It offers a shared understanding of what is meant by \u201cMWE processing,\u201d distinguishing the subtasks of MWE discovery and identification. It also elucidates the interactions between MWE processing and two use cases: Parsing and machine translation. Many of the approaches in the literature can be differentiated according to how MWE processing is timed with respect to underlying use cases. We discuss how such orchestration choices affect the scope of MWE-aware systems. For each of the two MWE processing subtasks and for each of the two use cases, we conclude on open issues and research perspectives.",

She had a fundamental role in the founding and successful development of SIGDAT. Susan arrived in Switzerland from the United States in 1978 to work at the University of Lausanne in the German Department teaching literature and linguistics, as well as pursuing her interest in computers and language as translator and consultant to Logitech. She then moved to Geneva to work at the ISSCO research institute where she participated in a number of European research projects related to natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation, also working with corpora in translation applications. She joined what has now become the University of Geneva\u2019s Faculty of Translation and Interpretation in 1985. As of 1996, she worked in the Department of Multilingual Language Processing, contributing to new programs in information communications technology for translators and, more recently, exploring e-learning possibilities for translation technology courses in collaboration with European and Swiss centers. At the University of Geneva she progressed in the academic ranking to become Full Professor in 2010. Susan was a pioneer. At a time when there was still a great deal of skepticism in Europe about working with corpora, Susan was very active with the European Corpus Initiative (ECI). ECI was founded to oversee the acquisition and preparation of a large multilingual corpus, supporting national and international efforts to design, collect, and publish large-scale multilingual corpora, both written and spoken. Multilingual Corpus I (ECI/MCI) was made available on CD in April 1994. She was the guest editor of the two issues of Computational Linguistics that brought about the paradigm shift towards statistical methods: In these issues, she recognized and collected papers of ground-breaking nature, such as the description of the Penn Treebank, and other early papers on statistical modeling in NLP.
