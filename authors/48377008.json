            "title": "A Novel Method to Design Steerable Differential Beamformer Using Linear Acoustics Vector Sensor Array",
            "abstract": "Differential beamforming techniques have gained significant attention due to their frequency-independent beampatterns, applicability for small apertures, and super-directivity. It is commonly known that the main lobe of a beam pattern based on a linear array is typically aligned with the end-fire direction. However, in some application scenarios, aligning the main lobe in the end-fire direction may not meet the actual requirements. This article focuses on studying the steering problem of differential beamformers based on linear acoustics vector sensor arrays (LAVSs). We propose a steerable differential beamformer for LAVSs, which addresses the problem of non-steerable beam patterns of linear arrays. Our approach involves approximating the beam pattern using a series expansion of the weighted steering vector to achieve frequency-independent differential directivity. The major contributions of this article include, but are not limited to, the following: First, we derive the first-order to third-order differential directivity based on the acoustics vector sensor (AVS) signal model, and obtain the weights of the corresponding channels using the least squares method. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of the steering differential beamformer, demonstrating that the maximum directivity factor (DF) is a function of the steering angle. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the proposed method.",

            "title": "Sound Source Localization Using Non-Conformal Surface Sound Field Transformation Based on Spherical Harmonic Wave Decomposition",
            "abstract": "Spherical microphone arrays have been paid increasing attention for their ability to locate a sound source with arbitrary incident angle in three-dimensional space. Low-frequency sound sources are usually located by using spherical near-field acoustic holography. The reconstruction surface and holography surface are conformal surfaces in the conventional sound field transformation based on generalized Fourier transform. When the sound source is on the cylindrical surface, it is difficult to locate by using spherical surface conformal transform. The non-conformal sound field transformation by making a transfer matrix based on spherical harmonic wave decomposition is proposed in this paper, which can achieve the transformation of a spherical surface into a cylindrical surface by using spherical array data. The theoretical expressions of the proposed method are deduced, and the performance of the method is simulated. Moreover, the experiment of sound source localization by using a spherical array with randomly and uniformly distributed elements is carried out. Results show that the non-conformal surface sound field transformation from a spherical surface to a cylindrical surface is realized by using the proposed method. The localization deviation is around 0.01 m, and the resolution is around 0.3 m. The application of the spherical array is extended, and the localization ability of the spherical array is improved.",

            "title": "Line spectrum tracking control based on the method of biorthogonal demodulation",
            "abstract": "The low-frequency characteristic line spectrum contains significant information about underwater targets, which makes both its detection and control a hot topic of research. Attempts to suppress the characteristic line spectrum by active control strategy are greatly influenced by the tracking effect of the instantaneous information of the line spectrum, and have to deal with two specific technical problems in underwater applications. Firstly, the instability of the line spectrum; and, secondly, uncertain compensation of time delay, which is closely related to hydrological parameters. In order to cope with these problems, a tracking control strategy was proposed. This idea is based on biorthogonal demodulation, by smoothing phase-difference and cross-correlation time-delay estimation. This makes it possible to track the phase and frequency information of a signal. Secondly, the performance of the tracking algorithm for several typical models of signals under additive Gaussian white noise environment was simulated, and the accuracy of the tracked instantaneous information was given. Thirdly, the factors influencing the performance of the algorithm are discussed and the measures to improve accuracy are introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy was confirmed through the validation of the measured data obtained by an experiment.",

Therefore, noise source positioning is regarded as the core of noise control. In order to make the measuring system more effective, a new method for underwater near field moving sources is proposed in this paper. The new method establishes a mathematical model based on the correlation between two vector hydrophones and come up with an improved coherent sources positioning method.
