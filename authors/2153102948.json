            "title": "Hybrid Attention Network for Epileptic EEG Classification",
            "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) based on deep learning has been significantly improved. However, existing works have not adequately excavate the spatial-temporal information between EEG channels. Besides, most works mainly focus on patient-specific scenarios while cross-patient seizure detection is more challenging and meaningful. Regarding the above problems, we propose a hybrid attention network (HAN) for automatic seizure detection. Specifically, the graph attention network (GAT) extracts spatial features at the front end, and Transformer gets time features as the back end. HAN leverages the attention mechanism and fully extracts the spatial-temporal correlation of EEG signals. The focal loss function is introduced to HAN to deal with the imbalance of the dataset accompanied by seizure detection based on EEG. Both patient-specific and patient-independent experiments are carried out on the public CHB-MIT database. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HAN in both experimental settings.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder caused by brain dysfunction, which could cause uncontrolled behavior, loss of consciousness and other hazards. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an indispensable auxiliary tool for clinical diagnosis. Great progress has been made by current seizure identification methods. However, the performance of the methods on different patients varies a lot. In order to deal with this problem, we propose an automatic seizure identification method based on brain connectivity learning. The connectivity of different brain regions is modeled by a graph. Different from the manually defined graph structure, our method can extract the optimal graph structure and EEG features in an end-to-end manner. Combined with the popular graph attention neural network (GAT), this method achieves high performance and stability on different patients from the CHB-MIT dataset. The average values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and AUC of the proposed model are 98.90[Formula: see text], 98.33[Formula: see text], 98.48[Formula: see text], 97.72% and 98.54%, respectively. The standard deviations of the above five indicators are 0.0049, 0.0125, 0.0116 and 0.0094, respectively. Compared with the existing seizure identification methods, the stability of the proposed model is improved by 78-95%.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease resulted from the central nervous system lesion, which leads to repeated seizure occurs for the patients. Automatic seizure detection with Electroencephalogram (EEG) has witnessed great progress. However, existing methods paid little attention to the topological relationships of different EEG electrodes. Latest neuroscience researches have demonstrated the connectivity between different brain regions. Besides, class-imbalance is a common problem in EEG based seizure detection. The duration of epileptic EEG signals is much shorter than that of normal signals. In order to deal with the above mentioned two challenges, we propose to model the multi-channel EEG data using the Attention-based Graph ResNet (AGRN). In particular, each channel of the EEG signal represents a node of the graph and the inter-channel relations are modeled via the adjacency matrix in the graph. The loss function of the ARGN model is re-designed using focal loss to cope with the class-imbalance problem. The proposed ARGN with focal model could learn discriminative features from the raw EEG data. Experiments are carried out on the CHB-MIT dataset. The proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 98.70%, a sensitivity of 97.94%, a specificity of 98.66% and a precision of 98.62%. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is 98.69%.",
