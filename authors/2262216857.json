            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant promise in recommender systems by empowering user profiles with their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, LLMs face challenges like unstable instruction compliance, modality gaps, and high inference latency, leading to textual noise and limiting their effectiveness in recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose UserIP-Tuning, which uses prompt-tuning to infer user profiles. It integrates the causal relationship between user profiles and behavior sequences into LLMs' prompts. And employs expectation maximization to infer the embedded latent profile, minimizing textual noise by fixing the prompt template. Furthermore, A profile quantization codebook bridges the modality gap by categorizing profile embeddings into collaborative IDs, which are pre-stored for online deployment. This improves time efficiency and reduces memory usage. Experiments on four public datasets show that UserIP-Tuning outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Additional tests and case studies confirm its effectiveness, robustness, and transferability.",

            "abstract": "With the increase in the business scale and number of domains in online advertising, multi-domain ad recommendation has become a mainstream solution in the industry. The core of multi-domain recommendation is effectively modeling the commonalities and distinctions among domains. Existing works are dedicated to designing model architectures for implicit multi-domain modeling while overlooking an in-depth investigation from a more fundamental perspective of feature distributions. This paper focuses on features with significant differences across various domains in both distributions and effects on model predictions. We refer to these features as domain-sensitive features, which serve as carriers of domain distinctions and are crucial for multi-domain modeling. Experiments demonstrate that existing multi-domain modeling methods may neglect domain-sensitive features, indicating insufficient learning of domain distinctions. To avoid this neglect, we propose a domain-sensitive feature attribution method to identify features that best reflect domain distinctions from the feature set. Further, we design a memory architecture that extracts domain-specific information from domain-sensitive features for the model to retrieve and integrate, thereby enhancing the awareness of domain distinctions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in capturing domain distinctions and improving multi-domain recommendation performance.",

            "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental technique for online advertising recommendation and the complex online competitive auction process also brings many difficulties to CTR optimization. Recent studies have shown that introducing posterior auction information contributes to the performance of CTR prediction. However, existing work doesn't fully capitalize on the benefits of auction information and overlooks the data bias brought by the auction, leading to biased and suboptimal results. To address these limitations, we propose Auction Information Enhanced Framework (AIE) for CTR prediction in online advertising, which delves into the problem of insufficient utilization of auction signals and first reveals the auction bias. Specifically, AIE introduces two pluggable modules, namely Adaptive Market-price Auxiliary Module (AM2) and Bid Calibration Module (BCM), which work collaboratively to excavate the posterior auction signals better and enhance the performance of CTR prediction. Furthermore, the two proposed modules are lightweight, model-agnostic, and friendly to inference latency. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public dataset and an industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of AIE. Besides, a one-month online A/B test in a large-scale advertising platform shows that AIE improves the base model by 5.76% and 2.44% in terms of eCPM and CTR, respectively.",

Previous studies primarily focus on refining model architectures to generate more informative explanations, assuming that the explanation data is sufficient and easy to acquire.

In this paper, we study a novel problem in the field of explainable recommendation, that is, \u201cgiven a limited budget to incentivize users to provide behavior explanations, how to effectively collect data such that the downstream models can be better optimized?\u201d To solve this problem, we propose an active learning framework for recommender system, which consists of an acquisition function for sample collection and an explainable recommendation model to provide the final results. We consider both uncertainty and influence based strategies to design the acquisition function, which can determine the sample effectiveness from complementary perspectives.

            "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction holds a paramount position in recommender systems. The prevailing ID-based paradigm underperforms in cold-start scenarios due to the skewed distribution of feature frequency. Additionally, the utilization of a single modality fails to exploit the knowledge contained within textual features. Recent efforts have sought to mitigate these challenges by integrating Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). They design hard prompts to structure raw features into text for each interaction and then apply PLMs for text processing. With external knowledge and reasoning capabilities, PLMs extract valuable information even in cases of sparse interactions. Nevertheless, compared to ID-based models, pure text modeling degrades the efficacy of collaborative filtering, as well as feature scalability and efficiency during both training and inference. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{C}ost-\\textbf{E}fficient \\textbf{L}anguage Model \\textbf{A}lignment (\\textbf{CELA}) for CTR prediction. CELA incorporates textual features and language models while preserving the collaborative filtering capabilities of ID-based models. This model-agnostic framework can be equipped with plug-and-play textual features, with item-level alignment enhancing the utilization of external information while maintaining training and inference efficiency. Through extensive offline experiments, CELA demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an online A/B test conducted on an industrial App recommender system showcases its practical effectiveness, solidifying the potential for real-world applications of CELA.",

            "abstract": "Feature crosses, which represent joint features synthesized by two single features, are critical for deep recommender systems to model sophisticated feature relations. In practice, only a tiny fraction of feature crosses among massive possible ones are informative, while introducing irrelevant or noisy ones may increase online service latency and boost the risk of overfitting. Therefore, picking high-quality feature crosses is essential in practical recommender systems. However, even for selecting quadratic feature crosses, existing algorithms still incur either o(n2) time complexity or o(n2) space complexity, which is inefficient and unscalable in industrial scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient and accurate quadratic feature cross selection method with both linear time and space complexity. Motivated by the idea of Quasi-Newton methods, we propose to use 2nd-order derivative matrix to evaluate all theoretically possible feature crosses concurrently without the need of constructing them explicitly, where an approximation of 2nd-order gradient is applied to guarantee both low time and space complexity. Furthermore, we decouple the feature crosses' novelty from single features' joint importance. Experiments on two public recommendation datasets and a private dataset validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, and it has also become a fundamental feature cross selection tool used by Huawei Ads Platform.",

            "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an indispensable role in online recommendation and advertising platforms. Numerous deep learning based models have been proposed to improve CTR prediction accuracy, and they typically leverage user behavior sequences to capture users' shifting preferences. However, these historical sequences of user interactions often suffer from severe homogeneity and scarcity compared to the extensive item pool. Relying solely on such sequences for user representations is inherently restrictive, as user interests extend beyond the scope of items they have previously engaged with. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach to enrich user representations.We recognize user profiling and recall items as two ideal data sources within the cross-stage framework, encompassing the u2u (user-to-user) and i2i (item-to-item) aspects, respectively, because of their higher relevance to target users and ranking items, as well as their greater diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Recall-Augmented Ranking (RAR).RAR consists of two key sub-modules, namely the Cross-Stage User and Item Selection Module and the Co-Interaction Module. These sub-modules synergistically gather information from a vast pool of look-alike users and recall items, resulting in enriched user representations. Notably, RAR is orthogonal to many existing CTR models, allowing for seamless integration and consistent performance improvements in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on CTR prediction benchmarks, which verify the efficacy and compatibility of RAR against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Estimating conditional average treatment effect from observational data is highly challenging due to the existence of treatment selection bias. Prevalent methods mitigate this issue by aligning distributions of different treatment groups in the latent space. However, there are two critical problems that these methods fail to address: (1) mini-batch sampling effects (MSE), which causes misalignment in non-ideal mini-batches with outcome imbalance and outliers; (2) unobserved confounder effects (UCE), which results in inaccurate discrepancy calculation due to the neglect of unobserved confounders. To tackle these problems, we propose a principled approach named Entire Space CounterFactual Regression (ESCFR), which is a new take on optimal transport in the context of causality. Specifically, based on the framework of stochastic optimal transport, we propose a relaxed mass-preserving regularizer to address the MSE issue and design a proximal factual outcome regularizer to handle the UCE issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ESCFR can successfully tackle the treatment selection bias and achieve significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Explainable recommendation has attracted much attention from the industry and academic communities. It has shown great potential to improve the recommendation persuasiveness, informativeness and user satisfaction. In the past few years, while a lot of promising explainable recommender models have been proposed, the datasets used to evaluate them still suffer from several limitations, for example, the explanation ground truths are not labeled by the real users, the explanations are mostly single-modal and around only one aspect. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we build a new explainable recommendation dataset, which, to our knowledge, is the \ufb01rst contribution that provides a large amount of real user labeled multi-modal and multi-aspect explanation ground truths. In speci\ufb01c, we \ufb01rstly develop a video recommendation platform, where a series of questions around the recommendation explainability are carefully designed. Then, we recruit about 3000 high-quality labelers with different backgrounds to use the system, and collect their behaviors and feedback to our questions. In this paper, we detail the construction process of our dataset and also provide extensive analysis on its characteristics. In addition, we develop a library, where many well-known explainable recommender models are implemented in a uni\ufb01ed framework. Based on this library, we build several benchmarks for different explainable recommendation tasks. At last, we present many new opportunities brought by our dataset, which are expected to promote the \ufb01eld of explainable recommendation. Our dataset, library and the related documents have been released at https://reasoner2023.github.",

            "abstract": "Recent research in self-supervised contrastive learning of music representations has demonstrated remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks. However, a prevailing trend in existing methods involves representing equally-sized music clips in either waveform or spectrogram formats, often overlooking the intrinsic part-whole hierarchies within music. In our quest to comprehend the bottom-up structure of music, we introduce MART, a hierarchical music representation learning approach that facilitates feature interactions among cropped music clips while considering their part-whole hierarchies. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical part-whole transformer to capture the structural relationships between music clips in a part-whole hierarchy. Furthermore, a hierarchical contrastive learning objective is crafted to align part-whole music representations at adjacent levels, progressively establishing a multi-hierarchy representation space. The effectiveness of our music representation learning from part-whole hierarchies has been empirically validated across multiple downstream tasks, including music classification and cover song identification.",
