            "title": "ADAM: A Sandbox for Implementing Language Learning",
            "abstract": "We present ADAM, a software system for designing and running child language learning experiments in Python. The system uses a virtual world to simulate a grounded language acquisition process in which the language learner utilizes cognitively plausible learning algorithms to form perceptual and linguistic representations of the observed world. The modular nature of ADAM makes it easy to design and test different language learning curricula as well as learning algorithms. In this report, we describe the architecture of the ADAM system in detail, and illustrate its components with examples. We provide our code.",

            "abstract": "We explore a human-driven approach to annotation, curated training (CT), in which annotation is framed as teaching the system by using interactive search to identify informative snippets of text to annotate, unlike traditional approaches which either annotate preselected text or use active learning. A trained annotator performed 80 hours of CT for the thirty event types of the NIST TAC KBP Event Argument Extraction evaluation. Combining this annotation with ACE results in a 6% reduction in error and the learning curve of CT plateaus more slowly than for full-document annotation. 3 NLP researchers performed CT for one event type and showed much sharper learning curves with all three exceeding ACE performance in less than ninety minutes, suggesting that CT can provide further benefits when the annotator deeply understands the system.",

It is extreme in that (1) from receipt of the ontology specifying the target concepts and relations, development is limited to one week and that (2) relatively little training data is assumed. We are able to surpass human recall and achieve an F1 of 0.51 on a question-answering task with less than 50 hours of effort using a hybrid approach that mixes active learning, bootstrapping, and limited (5 hours) manual rule writing. We compare the performance of three systems: extraction with handwritten rules, bootstrapped extraction, and a combination. We show that while the recall of the handwritten rules surpasses that of the learned system, the learned system is able to improve the overall recall and F1.",

Most techniques assume that the examples are based on easily spotted anchors, e.g., names or dates. Sentences in a corpus which contain the anchors are then used to induce alternative ways of expressing the relation. We explore whether coreference can improve the learning process. That is, if the algorithm considered examples such as his sister, would accuracy be improved? With coreference, we see on average a 2-fold increase in F-Score. Despite using potentially errorful machine coreference, we see significant increase in recall on all relations. Precision increases in four cases and decreases in six.",

The field of natural language processing has achieved a high degree of accuracy in parsing, at least in English. However, the syntactic structures produced by the most commonly used parsers are less detailed than those structures found in the treebanks the parsers were trained on. In particular, these parsers typically lack the null elements used to indicate wh-movement, control, and other phenomena. \nThis thesis presents a system for inserting these null elements into parse trees in English. It then examines the problem in Arabic, which motivates a second, joint-inference system which has improved performance on English as well. Finally, it examines the application of information derived from the Google Web 1T corpus as a way of reducing certain data sparsity issues related to wh-movement.",
