            "abstract": "Background articles are crucial for readers to grasp the context of news stories fully. However, existing approaches of background article search tend to apply a single ranking method to all types of search topics. In this paper, we focus on exploring search topics on news articles by classifying them into two types:time-sensitive andnon-time-sensitive. To verify whether or not these two types of search topics can benefit from different retrieving methods, we examined a suite of strategies such as document expansion, query rewriting, and semantic re-ranking. Moreover, the relationship between background articles and topics is verified by the two strategies of document expansion (specificity and diversity). The experimental results demonstrate that the optimal usage of the aforementioned strategies is indeed different between the two types of search topics. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis of topics and search results verified that: time-sensitive topics benefit from background articles that can provide more specific knowledge, while non-time-sensitive topics benefit from diversified retrieved documents.",

            "abstract": "An accurate understanding of the temporal dynamics of Web content and user behaviors plays a crucial role during the interactive process between search engine and users. In this work, we focus on how to improve the retrieval performance via a better understanding of the time factor. On the one hand, we proposed a novel method to estimate the focus-time of documents leveraging their semantic information. On the other hand, we introduced query trend time for understanding the temporal intent underlying a search query based on Google Trend. Furthermore, we applied the proposed methods to two search scenarios: temporal information retrieval and temporal diversity retrieval. Our experimental results based on NTCIR Temporalia test collections show that: (1) Semantic information can be used to predict the temporal tendency of documents. (2) The semantic-based model works effectively even when few temporal expressions and entity names are available in documents. (3) The effectiveness of the estimated focus-time was comparable to that of the article\u2019s publication time in relevance modelling, and thus, our method can be used as an alternative or supplementary tool when reliable publication dates are not available. (4) The trend time can improve the representation of temporal intents behind queries over query issue time.",

We incorporated dense retrieval methods into the conversational task. We leveraged a Dual-encoder structure[2] to encode the user\u2019s utterance together with the conversation context and each document of the corpus into dense vector representation. After embedding we computed their relevance score by the dot product of the dense vectors. Our four submitted runs show an competitive performance compared to a sparse retrieval model. In addition to the submitted runs, we further conducted experiments and created two unofficial runs, which followed ConvDR\u2019s [29] strategy and trained the conversational dense retrieval model and performed inference on CAsT21 dataset. The results of these two unofficial runs show an effective use of multiple loss functions for conversational search.",

            "abstract": "Fairness ranking has been recently focused on, which aims to make ranking results fair while keeping relevant. The definition of fairness is diverse. TREC Fairness Ranking Track in 2021 took attention-weighted rank fairness (AWRF) [12] to fit the fairness aspect distribution of ranking results to a population estimator \u02c6p reflecting the target distribution. TKB48\u2019s approach was a post-processing method. We obtained an initial ranking using the BM25 score. We then set a bucket for each of 7 geographic areas in the dataset, and iterated the initial BM25 ranking to choose documents and put them into the bucket in a round-robin manner. As the track evaluated the top 20 results of the final ranking, the goal for us was to make the distribution of each area be the same as the target distribution in the top 20 results. We defined the individual fairness score so that we could choose whether a document should be put into the bucket by comparing an individual fairness score and BM25 score. The individual fairness score was based on how many documents in a certain area has been put into the final ranking. We chose one document with the highest combined score of fairness and relevance for one iterate turn of initial ranking. And we iterated 1000 times so that we could get a final ranking with 1000 documents. Our results ranked fifth out of 13 submissions on the TREC Fairness Ranking Track. Finally, we compared the results of different methods on the TREC Fairness Ranking Track and analyzed it.",

            "abstract": "In Social Networking Services (SNS), user profiles, which often consist of an image, texts, and other items, have an important role to connect with other users. However, in a preliminary study with 3,193 sample profiles on Twitter, we found that the average length of profile texts was 40 characters ( \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 32 . 52 ) where the maximum length is 160. This suggests that many SNS users are missing potential opportunities to expand their social network due to the short profile texts. Therefore, we proposed a search-based interactive system to support the writing of profile texts in SNS. The proposed system was designed to dynamically search for similar profile texts while users were typing their profile so that they can get new ideas such as what to write or how to express. We evaluated the effect of the proposed system by a user study with 24 participants, and found that the proposed system enabled participants to significantly increase the length of written profile texts (+92.5% on average), compared to a baseline system with no assistance.",

            "abstract": "Payments in online ad auctions are typically derived from click-through rates, so that advertisers do not pay for ineffective ads. But advertisers often care about more than just clicks. That is, for example, if they aim to raise brand awareness or visibility. There is thus an opportunity to devise a more effective ad pricing paradigm, in which ads are paid only if they are actually noticed. This article contributes a novel auction format based on a pay-per-attention (PPA) scheme. We show that the PPA auction inherits the desirable properties (strategy-proofness and efficiency) as its pay-per-impression and pay-per-click counterparts, and that it also compares favourably in terms of revenues. To make the PPA format feasible, we also contribute a scalable diagnostic technology to predict user attention to ads in sponsored search using raw mouse cursor coordinates only, regardless of the page content and structure. We use the user attention predictions in numerical simulations to evaluate the PPA auction scheme. Our results show that, in relevant economic settings, the PPA revenues would be strictly higher than the existing auction payment schemes.",
