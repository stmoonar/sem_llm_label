            "abstract": "The quality of Machine Learning (ML) models strongly depends on the input data, as such generating high-quality features is often required to improve the predictive accuracy. This process is referred to as Feature Engineering (FE). However, since manual feature engineering is time-consuming and requires case-by-case domain knowledge, Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE) is crucial. A major challenge that remains is to generate interpretable features. To tackle this problem, we introduce SMART, a hybrid approach that uses semantic technologies to guide the generation of interpretable features through a two-step process: Exploitation and Exploration. The former uses Description Logics (DL) to reason on the semantics embedded in Knowledge Graphs (KG) to infer domain-specific features, while the latter exploits the knowledge graph to conduct a guided exploration of the search space through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate that SMART significantly improves prediction accuracy while ensuring a high level of interpretability.",

            "title": "Leveraging Knowlegde Graphs for Interpretable Feature Generation",
            "abstract": "The quality of Machine Learning (ML) models strongly depends on the input data, as such Feature Engineering (FE) is often required in ML. In addition, with the proliferation of ML-powered systems, especially in critical contexts, the need for interpretability and explainability becomes increasingly important. Since manual FE is time-consuming and requires case specific knowledge, we propose KRAFT, an AutoFE framework that leverages a knowledge graph to guide the generation of interpretable features. Our hybrid AI approach combines a neural generator to transform raw features through a series of transformations and a knowledge-based reasoner to evaluate features interpretability using Description Logics (DL). The generator is trained through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to maximize the prediction accuracy and the interpretability of the generated features. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that KRAFT significantly improves accuracy while ensuring a high level of interpretability.",

            "abstract": "Our work aims to develop novel technologies for building an efficient data infrastructure as a backbone for a human behavior management system. Our infrastructure aims at facilitating behavior modeling, discovery, and exploitation, leading to two major outcomes: a behavior data management back-end and a high-level behavior specification API that supports mining, indexing and search, and AI-powered algorithms that provide the ability to extract insights on human behavior and to leverage data to advance human capital. We discuss the role of ML in populating and maintaining the back-end, and in exploiting it for human interest.",
