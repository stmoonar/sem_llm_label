            "abstract": "A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "Nonmonotonic dl-programs provide a loose integration of Description Logic (DL) ontologies and Logic Programming (LP) rules with negation, where a rule engine can query an ontology with a native DL reasoner. However, even for tractable dl-programs, the overhead of an external DL reasoner might be considerable. Datalog-rewritable DL ontologies, such as LDL, can be rewritten to Datalog programs, such that dl-programs can be reduced to Datalog\u00ac, i.e, Datalog with negation, under well-founded semantics. We developed the reasoner DReW that uses the Datalog-rewriting technique. DReW can as such answer conjunctive queries over LDL ontologies, as well as reason on dlprograms over LDL ontologies under well-founded semantics. The preliminary but encouraging experimental results show that DReW can efficiently handle large knowledge bases.",

            "title": "Updating Ontologies and General Rules",
            "abstract": "Inconsistencies or conflicts appearing in the integration of ontologies and general rules are handled by applying prioritizing and updating. First, a prioritized knowledge base is obtained by weighting information weight. Then, based on the idea \u201dabandoning the old for the new\u201d, the weight of each rule is greater than that of the information in ontologies. If ontologies conflict with general rules, then a new knowledge-base without any inconsistency or conflict is obtained by using rules with big weight updating information in ontologies with small weight. Thus, current logic programming solvers and description logic reasoners are employed to implement the reasoning services, such as querying etc. Updating based on prioritizing is more suitable for handling inconsistencies than other approaches to introducing non-standard semantics if knowledge bases are dynamically evolving. Moreover, a consistent knowledge base can be always maintained in the dynamical environment by updating outdated information with new information based on weighting. Finally, this approach to dealing with inconsistencies is feasibly exemplified.",
