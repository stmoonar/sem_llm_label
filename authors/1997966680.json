            "title": "Leveraging GPT-4 for Food Effect Summarization to Enhance Product-Specific Guidance Development via Iterative Prompting",
            "abstract": "Food effect summarization from New Drug Application (NDA) is an essential component of product-specific guidance (PSG) development and assessment, which provides the basis of recommendations for fasting and fed bioequivalence studies to guide the pharmaceutical industry for developing generic drug products. However, manual summarization of food effect from extensive drug application review documents is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop automated methods to generate food effect summary. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have demonstrated great potential in improving the effectiveness of automated text summarization, but its ability with regard to the accuracy in summarizing food effect for PSG assessment remains unclear. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach,iterative prompting, which allows one to interact with ChatGPT or GPT-4 more effectively and efficiently through multi-turn interaction. Specifically, we propose a three-turn iterative prompting approach to food effect summarization in which the keyword-focused and length-controlled prompts are respectively provided in consecutive turns to refine the quality of the generated summary. We conduct a series of extensive evaluations, ranging from automated metrics to FDA professionals and even evaluation by GPT-4, on 100 NDA review documents selected over the past five years. We observe that the summary quality is progressively improved throughout the iterative prompting process. Moreover, we find that GPT-4 performs better than ChatGPT, as evaluated by FDA professionals (43% vs. 12%) and GPT-4 (64% vs. 35%). Importantly, all the FDA professionals unanimously rated that 85% of the summaries generated by GPT-4 are factually consistent with the golden reference summary, a finding further supported by GPT-4 rating of 72% consistency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a great potential for GPT-4 to draft food effect summaries that could be reviewed by FDA professionals, thereby improving the efficiency of the PSG assessment cycle and promoting generic drug product development.",

            "title": "Learning, visualizing and exploring 16S rRNA structure using an attention-based deep neural network",
            "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with memory (e.g. LSTMs) and attention mechanisms are widely used in natural language processing because they can capture short and long term sequential information for diverse tasks. We propose an integrated deep learning model for microbial DNA sequence data, which exploits convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms to perform sample-associated attribute prediction\u2014phenotype prediction\u2014and extract interesting features, such as informative taxa and predictive k-mer context. In this paper, we develop this novel deep learning approach and evaluate its application to amplicon sequences. We focus on typically short DNA reads of 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) marker genes, which identify the heterogeneity of a microbial community sample. Our deep learning approach enables sample-level attribute and taxonomic prediction, with the aim of aiding biological research and supporting medical diagnosis. We demonstrate that our implementation of a novel attention-based deep network architecture, Read2Pheno, achieves read-level phenotypic prediction and, in turn, that aggregating read-level information can robustly predict microbial community properties, host phenotype, and taxonomic classification, with performance comparable to conventional approaches. Most importantly, as a further result of the training process, the network architecture will encode sequences (reads) into dense, meaningful representations: learned embedded vectors output on the intermediate layer of the network model, which can provide biological insight when visualized. Finally, we demonstrate that a model with an attention layer can automatically identify informative regions in sequences/reads which are particularly informative for classification tasks. An implementation of the attention-based deep learning network is available at https://github.com/EESI/sequence_attention.",
