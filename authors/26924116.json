            "title": "Diffusion Model-based Incentive Mechanism with Prospect Theory for Edge AIGC Services in 6G IoT",
            "abstract": "The fusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) with Sixth-Generation (6G) technology has significant potential to revolutionize the IoT landscape. With the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication capabilities of 6G, 6G-IoT networks can transmit high-quality and diverse data to enhance edge learning. Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) harnesses advanced AI algorithms to automatically generate various types of content. The emergence of edge AIGC integrates with edge networks, facilitating real-time provision of customized AIGC services by deploying AIGC models on edge devices. However, the current practice of edge devices as AIGC Service Providers (ASPs) lacks incentives, hindering the sustainable provision of high-quality edge AIGC services amidst information asymmetry. In this paper, we develop a user-centric incentive mechanism framework for edge AIGC services in 6G-IoT networks. Specifically, we first propose a contract theory model for incentivizing ASPs to provide AIGC services to clients. Recognizing the irrationality of clients towards personalized AIGC services, we utilize Prospect Theory (PT) to capture their subjective utility better. Furthermore, we adopt the diffusion-based soft actor-critic algorithm to generate the optimal contract design under PT, outperforming traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

            "abstract": "Aerial acoustic communication in a peer-to-peer manner attracts much attention recently thanks to its ubiquitous device support. These benefits have led Google's nearby platform to adopt this communication paradigm to establish copresence between nearby devices. However, state-of-the-art research cannot reliably work under dynamic channels and long communication distance. In particular, current proposals have to trade-off between communication distance and transmission rate, when the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) is within a certain threshold. Meanwhile, the performance of existing works is vulnerable to channel dynamics such as the near-far problem, device diversity, and multipath effects. To this end, we propose HiRA, a reliable High thRoughput aerial Acoustic communication system. In HiRA, we design a loose orthogonality condition for chirp carriers, which allows us to overlap multiple loose orthogonal carriers in a single time slot or data symbol, thus notably boosting the transmission rate. To make it reliable, we design a range and Doppler aware beacon detection algorithm and rate adaptation mechanism. Evaluation results show that HiRA achieves $20\\times$ improvements over existing methods in data rate: a maximum of 500 bps data rate can be achieved with a BER of 0.64% at 11.5 m. And it can reliably work under dynamic channels but still keep BER under a desired threshold.",

            "abstract": "Lightweight training and distributed tiny data storage in the local model will lead to the severe challenge of convergence for tiny federated learning (FL). Achieving fast convergence in tiny FL is crucial for many emerging applications in Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (IUAVs) networks. Excessive information exchange between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices could lead to security risks and data breaches, while insufficient information can slow down the learning process and negatively system performance experience due to significant computational and communication constraints in tiny FL hardware system. This article proposes a trusting, low latency, and energy-efficient tiny wireless FL framework with blockchain (TBWFL) for IUAV systems. We develop a quantifiable model to determine the trustworthiness of IoT devices in IUAV networks. This model incorporates the time spent in communication, computation, and block production with a decay function in each round of FL at the UAVs. Then it combines the trust information from different UAVs, considering their credibility of trust recommendation. We formulate the TBWFL as an optimization problem that balances trustworthiness, learning speed, and energy consumption for IoT devices with diverse computing and energy capabilities. We decompose the complex optimization problem into three subproblems for improved local accuracy, fast learning, trust verification, and energy efficiency of IoT devices. Our extensive experiments show that TBWFL offers higher trustworthiness, faster convergence, and lower energy consumption than the existing state-of-the-art FL scheme.",

            "abstract": "Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs), the Vehicle Twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses.",

            "abstract": "Embodied AI is a rapidly advancing field that bridges the gap between cyberspace and physical space, enabling a wide range of applications. This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Instead of directly using coarse-grained feature fusion methods, we capture deep semantics in self-attention manner, achieving fine-grained multi-modal feature fusion thereby strengthening the representation ability of hash codes. To enhance adaptability in practical situations, we then design a modality-completion module to address missing modalities in data, accommodating scenarios with both single-modal and cross-modal data. We evaluate the proposed semantic extraction framework on two popular multi-modal datasets, comparing it with the latest hashing methods and then demonstrate the effectiveness in various channel conditions.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we study a joint computation offloading and resource allocation optimization problem for the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system. Specifically, we consider an IRS-assisted multi-device MEC system, where mobile devices (MDs) can either execute the computation-intensive tasks locally or offload their tasks to the MEC server. With the aim of minimizing the maximum weighted consumed energy, the offloading decisions, the transmit power at the MDs, the central processing unit (CPU) clock frequencies at the MDs and the MEC server, the receive beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), and the reflecting coefficient matrix at the IRS are jointly optimized. To handle the underlying mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a bisection search based alternate feasibility verification suboptimal algorithm. In particular, we use the bisection search method to optimize the offloading decision threshold which determines the offloading MDs' set. Subsequently, the alternate optimization (AO) method is employed to solve the feasibility verification problem by decomposing it into four feasibility-checking subproblems and then separately tackling each of them. Finally, we use simulations to validate the advantages of deploying IRS and optimizing its reflecting phase shift for the considered system, and also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its performance gain over the benchmark schemes.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Edge Intelligence (EI) services, especially within Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, accompanied by a growing demand for multi-modal content generation. In response, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a promising solution, equipping EI to produce diverse Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) for ubiquitous edge services. However, existing cloud-based GAI capabilities, which are mostly provided via the web and the Internet, introduce unacceptable latency overhead and heightened security risks for vehicular services. To address the above shortcomings and the lack of endogenous mechanisms for applying GAI to IoV scenarios, in this paper, we propose a layered vehicular GAI framework that seamlessly integrates GAI and EI. Within this framework, we devise a distributed collaborative inference mechanism between Road-Side Units (RSUs) and vehicles. Furthermore, we formulate the shared and local inference splitting problem, a pivotal challenge influencing both GAI service latency and content-generation capability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a backward induction-based algorithm, which enables the system can make splitting decisions using a simple threshold-based policy. Simulation results underscore the remarkable performance of the proposed system and vehicular collaborative inference mechanism, promising to facilitate diverse content generation within vehicular networks.",

            "abstract": "Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for generating high-quality, creative content across various media, including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.",

            "abstract": "The utilization of emergent Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAl) within the realm of Internet of Vehicles (loV) can augment edge intelligence, thereby catering to the diverse content-generation needs of novel in-vehicle services. Nonethe-less, existing cloud-centric GAl paradigms are not inherently suitable for wireless vehicular networks, primarily due to their extensive computing requirements, lack of specificity, and spatial detachment from end users. To cope with these challenges, we introduce an innovative Generative 10 V (g 10 V)architecture that employs a collaborative fine-tuning mechanism for pre-trained GAl models. The mechanism is mainly orchestrated collaboratively by Road-Side Units (RSUs) and vehicles within a Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Here, we take text-to-image diffusion models as typical examples to show the co-fine-tuning workflow in detail, aiming to utilize edge traffic data to realize rapid, customized, and lightweight GAl in the resource-limited 10 V scenario. Thereafter, we formulate the problem of edge communication and computation resource allocation during RSU-vehicle co-fine-tuning, which is pivotal for optimizing time and energy consumption within this process. To address the challenge, we deploy a Self-adaptive Harmony Search (SHS)-based resource allocation strategy. Experiments based on Stable Diffusion vl-4 model validate the excellent performance in image generating and the time and energy consumption during co-fine-tuning in resource-limited and fast-changing 10 V scenarios.",
