It serves as a forum for multidisciplinary discussions about the use of psychological constructs, theories, and empirical findings for modeling and predicting user preferences, intents, and behaviors. PsyIAS particularly focuses on research that incorporates such psychology-inspired models into the search, retrieval, and recommendation processes, creates corresponding algorithms and systems, or looks into the role of cognitive processes underlying human information access.

Among them, the audio-visual systems are one of the widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and voice of a person has gained attention due to presence of unique correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) Challenge 2024 focuses on exploring face-voice association under a unique condition of multilingual scenario. This condition is inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and most often people communicate under multilingual scenario. The challenge uses a dataset namely, Multilingual Audio-Visual (MAV-Celeb) for exploring face-voice association in multilingual environments.

            "abstract": "Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR's recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.",

            "abstract": "Emotions constitute an important aspect when listening to music. While manual annotations from user studies grounded in psychological research on music and emotions provide a well-defined and fine-grained description of the emotions evoked when listening to a music track, user-generated tags provide an alternative view stemming from large-scale data. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two emotional characterizations of music and analyze their impact on the performance of emotion-based music recommender systems individually and jointly. Our analysis shows that (i) the agreement between the two characterizations, as measured with Cohen\u2019s \u03ba coefficient and Kendall rank correlation, is often low, (ii) Leveraging the emotion profile based on the intensity of evoked emotions from high-quality annotations leads to performances that are stable across different recommendation algorithms; (iii) Simultaneously leveraging the emotion profiles based on high-quality and large-scale annotations allows to provide recommendations that are less exposed to the low accuracy that algorithms might reach when leveraging one type of data, only.",

            "abstract": "Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.",

            "abstract": "The quality of recommendations can be evaluated in terms of accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics; this renders recommendation a multiobjective task. Several works apply multiobjective optimization techniques for training recommender systems (RSs) or for late fusion of recommendations. However, for the hyperparameter selection, only accuracy is considered. In this paper, we include metrics for accuracy, coverage, novelty, and fairness of recommendations towards groups of users of different activity, and items of different popularity, in the hyperparameter optimization of RSs. We apply the concept of Pareto dominance to select the optimal hyperparameter configurations. Then, by performing multiple univariate linear regressions of the values of beyond-accuracy metrics on the values of NDCG for the optimal hyperparameter configurations, we quantify the interplay of accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics in terms of the the slope of the lines of best fit. Furthermore, by performing experiments in the domains of movie rating, music streaming, and food and household delivery and with four recommendation algorithms we provide insight in the generalizability of the interplay between accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics. Our analysis shows that for 8 out of 12 combinations of algorithms and domains, the line of best fit for at least one beyond-accuracy metric has a negative slope, indicating a trade-off relationship and supporting the multiobjective hyperparameter optimization. Our analysis further shows that both the sign and the absolute value of the slope of the line of best fit depend on the recommendation algorithm as well as the recommendation domain, indicating the non-generalizability of the interplay between accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics in the hyperparameter optimization.",

            "abstract": "When we appreciate a piece of music, it is most naturally because of its content, including rhythmic, tonal, and timbral elements as well as its lyrics and semantics. This suggests that the human affinity for music is inherently content-driven. This kind of information is, however, still frequently neglected by mainstream recommendation models based on collaborative filtering that rely solely on user-item interactions to recommend items to users. A major reason for this neglect is the lack of standardized datasets that provide both collaborative and content information. The work at hand addresses this shortcoming by introducing Music4All-Onion, a large-scale, multi-modal music dataset. The dataset expands the Music4All dataset by including 26 additional audio, video, and metadata characteristics for 109,269 music pieces. In addition, it provides a set of 252,984,396 listening records of 119,140 users, extracted from the online music platform Last.fm, which allows leveraging user-item interactions as well. We organize distinct item content features in an onion model according to their semantics, and perform a comprehensive examination of the impact of different layers of this model (e.g., audio features, user-generated content, and derivative content) on content-driven music recommendation, demonstrating how various content features influence accuracy, novelty, and fairness of music recommendation systems. In summary, with Music4All-Onion, we seek to bridge the gap between collaborative filtering music recommender systems and content-centric music recommendation requirements.",
