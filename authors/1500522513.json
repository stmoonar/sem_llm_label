            "title": "PosMonitor: Fine-Grained Sleep Posture Recognition With mmWave Radar",
            "abstract": "Sleep posture recognition is practically important in various scenarios, such as sleep healthcare, bedridden patient care, and chronic disease diagnosis. With concerns of user privacy preserving, we prefer the wireless sensing methods to computer vision methods when dealing with sleep posture recognition. However, the existing wireless sensing methods suffer from at least one of the following major limitations: 1) difficult to deploy in practice; 2) few posture categories; 3) insufficient accuracy; and 4) poor generalization ability. In this article, we use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) millimeter-wave radar to implement a sleep posture recognition system called PosMonitor. When designing the PosMonitor system, we need to address the following challenging issues. First, we propose an angle purification method based on multiframe joint analysis to alleviate the sparsity and instability of the point cloud. Then, we endow the point cloud with respiratory features to enhance its representation of the sleep posture. Further, to make the system applicable to different users, we extract relative respiratory features by normalization to overcome individual differences. Extensive experimental results show that our PosMonitor system can achieve 98% accuracy on average in recognizing 6 typical sleep postures and has good reliability across different conditions.",

            "abstract": "The ubiquitous Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate vast amounts of multimodal data, and the deep multimodal fusion network (DMFN) is a promising technology for processing multimodal data. Deploying DMFNs locally on embedded IoT devices is a profitable way to provide privacy-preserving and robust sensing services. However, the current compression methods suffer from the following limitations: First, they are designed based on unimodal networks or specific model structures. Hence, it is hard to extend these methods to diverse DMFNs; Second, existing works never relate their efforts to disparate computational demands of multimodal data and modalities. Easy samples and redundant modalities consume the same computational resources as powerful modalities and complex samples. We propose an <bold>A</bold>daptive <bold>C</bold>ompression <bold>F</bold>ramework (ACF) for DMFNs to address those challenges. It enables input-dependent runtime compression locally on resource-constrained embedded devices. Specifically, we propose an offline model transformation module to upgrade the static network with two kinds of dynamic components to support online structural adjustment. Then we design a lightweight policy network to generate multi-granularity and data-dependent compression strategies for different model parts. Finally, we evaluate ACF on four DMFNs across three embedded platforms.

            "abstract": "As the demand for the Internet of Things (IoT) grows, it becomes crucial to possess systems capable of detecting any data leakage used for authentication. Within IoT camera systems based on facial bio-metric recognition, there is a risk of deepfake bypassed facial feature authentication due to the widespread use of deepfake video technologies, such as DeepFaceLive and expression manipulation. Traditional face anti-spoofing (FAS) detection techniques may struggle to detect real-time deepfake videos within IoT contexts. Moreover, constrained by the scale of FAS detection data sets, current detection models primarily focus on recognizing the entire face in videos, neglecting the intercomponent correlations of facial features. However, our investigation indicates that different parts of the face have varying impacts on deepfake detection. To address this issue, we segment the face into several regions within video frames and explore the relationships between these regions. Our approach involves constructing feature graphs that represent such correlations, aiming to leverage the relationships between facial regions and the temporal characteristics of real-time facial manipulation videos for use in live facial detection cameras. Initially, features for each facial region are extracted via convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Subsequently, with these features as vertices and their correlations as edges, a feature graph of the entire video is constructed. Ultimately, a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to determine whether the video has been tampered with. Experiments conducted on several publicly accessible data sets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art FAS detection techniques in most scenarios. Thus, the aforementioned advanced GNN model exhibits exceptional performance in real-time deepfake detection tailored for live facial detection cameras.",

            "abstract": "Social Internet of Things (SIoT), a promising and emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (i.e., things), paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation. Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward way such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node characteristics, which ignores the valuable semantic knowledge attached to nodes. Moreover, the underlying structure of SIoT is usually complex, including both the heterogeneous graph structure and pairwise trust relationships, which renders hard to preserve the properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. To address these aforementioned problems, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced graph neural network (KGTrust) for better trust evaluation in SIoT. Specifically, we first extract useful knowledge from users\u2019 comment behaviors and external structured triples related to object descriptions, in order to gain a deeper insight into the semantics of users and objects. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative convolutional layer that utilizes heterogeneous graph structure, node semantics, and augmented trust relationships to learn node embeddings from the perspective of a user as a trustor or a trustee, effectively capturing multi-aspect properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. Finally, a trust prediction layer is developed to estimate the trust relationships between pairwise nodes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of KGTrust over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the attractive properties of decentralization, unforgeability, transparency, and traceability, blockchain is increasingly being used in various scenarios such as supply chain and public services, where massive Spatial-Temporal-Keywords (STK) transactions need to be packaged. However, due to the multi-dimensionality and randomness of STK transactions, existing solutions fail to enable queries in a verifiable and efficient way for blockchains storing multidimensional transactions. To this end, this article takes the first step to propose an authenticated and efficient query approach in hybrid blockchain systems consisting of on-chain and off-chain parts. We first design a data structure named MRK-Tree in the block body, which organizes STK transactions for efficient nodes pruning of both kNN and range queries. Then we propose an improved block header, which improves the efficient pruning of blocks on the basis of ensuring the authentication of query results. Also, we design a cross-block searching algorithm named Efficient Block Pruning (EBP) and intra-block searching algorithms named Authenticated kNN/Range Query (AKQ/ARQ) to accelerate authenticated queries for multiple MRK-Trees in the hybrid blockchain systems. Authentication mechanisms are proposed to ensure the soundness and completeness of query results. Rigorous security analysis validates the practicability of the proposed approach. We build a blockchain prototype to comprehensively evaluate the performance of proposed query schemes. Extensive evaluation results with real datasets reveal that our approach can ensure authenticated queries, meanwhile improving the time efficiency by up to 36.45x and space efficiency by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared with the well-known benchmark query schemes.",

However, current device-free Wi-Fi tracking systems suffer from two limitations: First, abnormal signals interfere with tracking performance when the user walks across the direct link of the transceivers and second, the tracking error based on the velocity integral accumulates over time. This article proposes CrossTrack, the first device-free cross-link tracking system with commodity Wi-Fi. Our inspiration is to regard the cross-link behavior as an opportunity to correct the trajectory instead of disturbing noise like previous work. Our approach involves three main steps. First, we devise a metric that is capable of detecting cross-link behavior. Second, we propose a new theoretical model that identifies the cross-link position as a landmark. Third, we develop a path revision technique that utilizes this landmark to optimize the trajectory. The technique innovation of this article is to reveal the theoretical approach to transform cross-link interference into optimization in device-free tracking for the first time. We implement CrossTrack based on commercial Wi-Fi devices and conduct comprehensive experiments. Our results show that CrossTrack can reduce tracking errors by 48.75%, and the median tracking error is 0.41 m.",

            "abstract": "Wireless sensing technology allows for non-intrusive sensing without the need for physical sensors worn by the target, enabling a wide range of applications, such as indoor tracking, and activity identification. To theoretically reveal the fundamental principles of wireless sensing, the Fresnel zone model has been introduced in the field of Wi-Fi sensing. While the Fresnel zone model is effective in explaining the sensing mechanism in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios, achieving accurate sensing in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) situations continues to pose a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical model called the Hyperbolic zone to reveal the fundamental sensing mechanism in NLoS scenarios. The main principle is to eliminate the complex NLoS path shared among different transmitter-receiver pairs, which allows us to obtain a series of simple \"virtual\" reflection paths among receivers. Since these \"virtual\" reflection paths satisfy the properties of the hyperbola, we propose the hyperbolic tracking model. Based on the proposed model, we implement the HyperTracking system using commercial Wi-Fi devices. The experimental results show that the proposed hyperbolic model is suitable for accurate tracking in both LoS and NLoS scenarios. We can reduce 0.36 m tracking error in contrast to the Fresnel zone model in NLoS scenarios. When we utilize the proposed hyperbolic model to train a typical LSTM neural network, we are able to further reduce the tracking error by 0.13 m and save the execution time by 281% with the same data. As a whole, our method can reduce the tracking error by 54% in NLoS scenarios compared with the Fresnel zone model.",

            "abstract": "The difficulty in obtaining targets' identity poses a significant obstacle to the pursuit of personalized and customized millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing. Existing solutions that learn individual differences from signal features have limitations in practical applications. This paper presents a Personalized mmWave-based human Tracking system, PmTrack, by introducing inertial measurement units (IMUs) as identity indicators. Widely available in portable devices such as smartwatches and smartphones, IMUs utilize existing wireless networks for data uploading of identity and data, and are therefore able to assist in radar target identification in a lightweight manner with little deployment and carrying burden for users. PmTrack innovatively adopts orientation as the matching feature, thus well overcoming the data heterogeneity between radar and IMU while avoiding the effect of cumulative errors. In the implementation of PmTrack, we propose a comprehensive set of optimization methods in detection enhancement, interference suppression, continuity maintenance, and trajectory correction, which successfully solved a series of practical problems caused by the three major challenges of weak reflection, point cloud overlap, and body-bounce ghost in multi-person tracking. In addition, an orientation correction method is proposed to overcome the IMU gimbal lock. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PmTrack achieves an identification accuracy of 98% and 95% with five people in the hall and meeting room, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The voice assistants benefit from the ability to localize users, especially, we can analyze the user\u2019s habits from the historical trajectory to provide better services. However, current voice localization method requires the user to actively issue voice commands, which makes voice assistants unable to track silent users most of the time. This paper presents WSTrack, a Wi-Fi and Sound fusion tracking system for device-free human. In particular, current voice assistants naturally support both Wi-Fi and acoustic functions. Accordingly, we are able to build up the multi-modal prototype with just voice assistants and Wi-Fi routers. To track the movement of silent users, our insights are as follows: (1) the voice assistants can hear the sound of the user\u2019s pace, and then extract which direction the user is in; (2) we can extract the user\u2019s velocity from the Wi-Fi signal. By fusing multi-modal information, we are able to track users with a single voice assistant and Wi-Fi router. Our implementation and evaluation on commodity devices demonstrate that WSTrack achieves better performance than current systems, where the median tracking error is 0.37m.",

            "abstract": "Major manufacturers and retailers are increasingly using RFID systems in supply-chain scenarios, where theft of goods during transport typically causes significant economic losses. This paper studies how to achieve time-efficient and secure integrity authentication solutions for RFID systems. We start with a straightforward solution called SecAuth, which uses a secure identity stored on reserved memory to securely authenticate the tags. We then propose a time efficient KTAuth protocol, which designs a verification chain mechanism to efficiently authenticate a large set of tags based on a small set of pre-defined key tags. We point out that the limitation of KTAuth is that it takes too much overhead to write a large block of data to tag memory, which leads to the proposed group selection mechanism. The KTAuth with group selection (KTAuth-GS) could select key tags with a single select command, which helps to quickly identify the key tags and reduces the data writes on them. Experiments and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed KTAuth-GS can defend against counterfeiting attacks by providing more reliable results and reducing the execution time by as much as a factor of 5 when compared with a baseline tag identification protocol.",
