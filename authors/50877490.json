            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on large volumes of data excel at various natural language tasks, but they cannot handle tasks requiring knowledge that has not been trained on previously. One solution is to use a retriever that fetches relevant information to expand LLM's knowledge scope. However, existing textual-oriented retrieval-based LLMs are not ideal on structured table data due to diversified data modalities and large table sizes. In this work, we propose OpenTab, an open-domain table reasoning framework powered by LLMs. Overall, OpenTab leverages table retriever to fetch relevant tables and then generates SQL programs to parse the retrieved tables efficiently. Utilizing the intermediate data derived from the SQL executions, it conducts grounded inference to produce accurate response. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that OpenTab significantly outperforms baselines in both open- and closed-domain settings, achieving up to 21.5% higher accuracy. We further run ablation studies to validate the efficacy of our proposed designs of the system.",

            "abstract": "Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) powered question answering (QA) performs complex reasoning over language semantics as well as knowledge facts. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn to aggregate information from the underlying KG, which is combined with Language Models (LMs) for effective reasoning with the given question. However, GNN-based methods for QA rely on the graph information of the candidate answer nodes, which limits their effectiveness in more challenging settings where critical answer information is not included in the KG. We propose a simple graph pooling approach that learns useful semantics of the KG that can aid the LM's reasoning and that its effectiveness is robust under graph perturbations. Our method, termed SemPool, represents KG facts with pre-trained LMs, learns to aggregate their semantic information, and fuses it at different layers of the LM. Our experimental results show that SemPool outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based methods by 2.27% accuracy points on average when answer information is missing from the KG. In addition, SemPool offers interpretability on what type of graph information is fused at different LM layers.",

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning (ICL). ICL is efficient as it does not require any parameter updates to the trained LLM, but only few annotated examples as input for the LLM. In this work, we investigate an active learning approach for ICL, where there is a limited budget for annotating examples. We propose a model-adaptive optimization-free algorithm, termed AdaICL, which identifies examples that the model is uncertain about, and performs semantic diversity-based example selection. Diversity-based sampling improves overall effectiveness, while uncertainty sampling improves budget efficiency and helps the LLM learn new information. Moreover, AdaICL poses its sampling strategy as a Maximum Coverage problem, that dynamically adapts based on the model's feedback and can be approximately solved via greedy algorithms. Extensive experiments on nine datasets and seven LLMs show that AdaICL improves performance by 4.4% accuracy points over SOTA (7.7% relative improvement), is up to 3x more budget-efficient than performing annotations uniformly at random, while it outperforms SOTA with 2x fewer ICL examples.",

            "abstract": "Large language models of code (Code-LLMs) have recently brought tremendous advances to code completion, a fundamental feature of programming assistance and code intelligence. However, most existing works ignore the possible presence of bugs in the code context for generation, which are inevitable in software development. Therefore, we introduce and study the buggy-code completion problem, inspired by the realistic scenario of real-time code suggestion where the code context contains potential bugs -- anti-patterns that can become bugs in the completed program. To systematically study the task, we introduce two datasets: one with synthetic bugs derived from semantics-altering operator changes (buggy-HumanEval) and one with realistic bugs derived from user submissions to coding problems (buggy-FixEval). We find that the presence of potential bugs significantly degrades the generation performance of the high-performing Code-LLMs. For instance, the passing rates of CODEGEN-2B-MONO on test cases of buggy-HumanEval drop more than 50% given a single potential bug in the context. Finally, we investigate several post-hoc methods for mitigating the adverse effect of potential bugs and find that there remains a significant gap in post-mitigation performance.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have revolutionized many sectors, including the database industry. One common challenge when dealing with large volumes of tabular data is the pervasive use of abbreviated column names, which can negatively impact performance on various data search, access, and understanding tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a new task, called NameGuess, to expand column names (used in database schema) as a natural language generation problem. We create a training dataset of 384K abbreviated-expanded column pairs using a new data fabrication method and a human-annotated evaluation benchmark that includes 9.2K examples from real-world tables. To tackle the complexities associated with polysemy and ambiguity in NameGuess, we enhance auto-regressive language models by conditioning on table content and column header names -- yielding a fine-tuned model (with 2.7B parameters) that matches human performance. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis (on multiple LLMs) to validate the effectiveness of table content in NameGuess and identify promising future opportunities.

            "title": "Train Your Own GNN Teacher: Graph-Aware Distillation on Textual Graphs",
            "abstract": "How can we learn effective node representations on textual graphs? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that use Language Models (LMs) to encode textual information of graphs achieve state-of-the-art performance in many node classification tasks. Yet, combining GNNs with LMs has not been widely explored for practical deployments due to its scalability issues. In this work, we tackle this challenge by developing a Graph-Aware Distillation framework (GRAD) to encode graph structures into an LM for graph-free, fast inference. Different from conventional knowledge distillation, GRAD jointly optimizes a GNN teacher and a graph-free student over the graph's nodes via a shared LM. This encourages the graph-free student to exploit graph information encoded by the GNN teacher while at the same time, enables the GNN teacher to better leverage textual information from unlabeled nodes. As a result, the teacher and the student models learn from each other to improve their overall performance. Experiments in eight node classification benchmarks in both transductive and inductive settings showcase GRAD's superiority over existing distillation approaches for textual graphs.",

            "abstract": "Jointly utilizing multiple GPUs to train graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial for handling large graphs and achieving high efficiency. However, we find that existing systems suffer from high communication costs and low GPU utilization due to improper data layout and training procedures. Thus, we propose a system dubbed Distributed Sampling and Pipelining (DSP) for multi-GPU GNN training. DSP adopts a tailored data layout to utilize the fast NVLink connections among the GPUs, which stores the graph topology and popular node features in GPU memory. For efficient graph sampling with multiple GPUs, we introduce a collective sampling primitive (CSP), which pushes the sampling tasks to data to reduce communication. We also design a producer-consumer-based pipeline, which allows tasks from different mini-batches to run congruently to improve GPU utilization. We compare DSP with state-of-the-art GNN training frameworks, and the results show that DSP consistently outperforms the baselines under different datasets, GNN models and GPU counts. The speedup of DSP can be up to 26x and is over 2x in most cases.",
