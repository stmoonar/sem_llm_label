            "title": "SynerGPT: In-Context Learning for Personalized Drug Synergy Prediction and Drug Design",
            "abstract": "Predicting synergistic drug combinations can help accelerate discovery of cancer treatments, particularly therapies personalized to a patient\u2019s specific tumor via biopsied cells. In this paper, we propose a novel setting and models for in-context drug synergy learning. We are given a small \u201cpersonalized dataset\u201d of 10-20 drug synergy relationships in the context of specific cancer cell targets. Our goal is to predict additional drug synergy relationships in that context. Inspired by recent work that pre-trains a GPT language model (LM) to \u201cin-context learn\u201d common function classes, we devise novel pre-training schemes that enable a GPT model to in-context learn \u201cdrug synergy functions\u201d. Our model\u2014which does not use any textual corpora, molecular fingerprints, protein interaction or any other domain-specific knowledge\u2014 is able to achieve competitive results. We further integrate our in-context approach with a genetic algorithm to optimize model prompts and select synergy candidates to test after conducting a patient biopsy. Finally, we explore a novel task of inverse drug design which can potentially enable the design of drugs that synergize specifically to target a given patient\u2019s \u201cpersonalized dataset\u201d. Our findings can potentially have an important impact on precision cancer medicine, and also raise intriguing questions on non-textual pre-training for LMs.",

            "title": "Property-Guided Generative Modelling for Robust Model-Based Design with Imbalanced Data",
            "abstract": "The problem of designing protein sequences with desired properties is challenging, as it requires to explore a high-dimensional protein sequence space with extremely sparse meaningful regions. This has led to the development of model-based optimization (MBO) techniques that aid in the design, by using effective search models guided by the properties over the sequence space. However, the intrinsic imbalanced nature of experimentally derived datasets causes existing MBO approaches to struggle or outright fail. We propose a property-guided variational auto-encoder (PGVAE) whose latent space is explicitly structured by the property values such that samples are prioritized according to these properties. Through extensive benchmarking on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets, we demonstrate that MBO with PGVAE robustly finds sequences with improved properties despite significant dataset imbalances. We further showcase the generality of our approach to continuous design spaces, and its robustness to dataset imbalance in an application to physics-informed neural networks.",

            "abstract": "We propose REACTCLASS that automatically maps the low-level concrete chemical entities into the high-level reactant groups without human effort for training data annotation. REACTCLASS is designed to take two special characteristics of the chemical molecules into consideration. The first characteristic is that each chemical molecule can be represented in two modalities: a chemical name in the text and a molecular structure in the graph. We propose to use cross-modal supervision to automatically create the training data for chemical name classification in the text via molecular structure matching in the graph. The second characteristic is that there is a knowledge-aware subword correlation between the surface names of the chemical entities to be classified and that of the reactant groups as class labels. We propose to train a classification model based on the subword cross-attention map between each chemical name and the corresponding reaction group. Experiments demonstrate that REACTCLASS is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance in classifying the chemical names into human-defined reactant groups without requiring human effort for training data annotation.",
