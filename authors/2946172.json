            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

This has made the technology compelling as an expansion to main memory. Rethinking PMEM as storage devices can offer a high performance buffering layer for HPC applications to temporarily, but safely store data. However, modern parallel I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and pNetCDF, are complicated and introduce significant software and metadata overheads when persisting data to these storage devices, wasting much of their potential. In this work, we explore the potential of PMEM as storage through pMEMCPY: a simple, lightweight, and portable I/O library for storing data in persistent memory. We demonstrate that our approach is up to 2x faster than other popular parallel I/O libraries under real workloads.",

            "abstract": "The FAIR principles of open science (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) have had transformative effects on modern large-scale computational science. In particular, they have encouraged more open access to and use of data, an important consideration as collaboration among teams of researchers accelerates and the use of workflows by those teams to solve problems increases. How best to apply the FAIR principles to workflows themselves, and software more generally, is not yet well understood. We argue that the software engineering concept of technical debt management provides a useful guide for application of those principles to workflows, and in particular that it implies reusability should be considered as \u2018first among equals\u2019. Moreover, our approach recognizes a continuum of reusability where we can make explicit and selectable the tradeoffs required in workflows for both their users and developers.To this end, we propose a new abstraction approach for reusable workflows, with demonstrations for both synthetic workloads and real-world computational biology workflows. Through application of novel systems and tools that are based on this abstraction, these experimental workflows are refactored to rightsize the granularity of workflow components to efficiently fill the gap between end-user simplicity and general customizability. Our work makes it easier to selectively reason about and automate the connections between trade-offs across user and developer concerns when exposing degrees of freedom for reuse. Additionally, by exposing fine-grained reusability abstractions we enable performance optimizations, as we demonstrate on both institutional-scale and leadership-class HPC resources.",

            "abstract": "Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capabilities have been provided by high-end networks for many years, but the network environments surrounding RDMA are evolving. RDMA performance has historically relied on using strict ordering guarantees to determine when data transfers complete, but modern adaptively-routed networks no longer provide those guarantees. RDMA also exposes low-level details about memory buffers: either all clients are required to coordinate access using a single shared buffer, or exclusive resources must be allocatable per-client for an unbounded amount of time. This makes RDMA unattractive for use in many-to-one communication models such as those found in public internet client-server situations.Remote Virtual Memory Access (RVMA) is a novel approach to data transfer which adapts and builds upon RDMA to provide better usability, resource management, and fault tolerance. RVMA provides a lightweight completion notification mechanism which addresses RDMA performance penalties imposed by adaptively-routed networks, enabling high-performance data transfer regardless of message ordering. RVMA also provides receiver-side resource management, abstracting away previously-exposed details from the sender-side and removing the RDMA requirement for exclusive/coordinated resources. RVMA requires only small hardware modifications from current designs, provides performance comparable or superior to traditional RDMA networks, and offers many new features.In this paper, we describe RVMA\u2019s receiver-managed resource approach and how it enables a variety of new data-transfer approaches on high-end networks. In particular, we demonstrate how an RVMA NIC could implement the first hardware-based fault tolerant RDMA-like solution. We present the design and validation of an RVMA simulation model in a popular simulation suite and use it to evaluate the advantages of RVMA at large scale. In addition to support for adaptive routing and easy programmability, RVMA can outperform RDMA on a 3D sweep application by 4.4X.",

            "abstract": "Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is an increasingly important technology in high-performance computing (HPC). RDMA provides low-latency, high-bandwidth data transfer between compute nodes. Additionally, it does not require explicit synchronization with the destination processor. Eliminating unnecessary synchronization can significantly improve the communication performance of large-scale scientific codes. A long-standing challenge presented by RDMA communication is mitigating the cost of registering memory with the network interface controller (NIC). Reusing memory once it is registered has been shown to significantly reduce the cost of RDMA communication. However, existing approaches for reusing memory rely on implicit memory semantics. In this paper, we introduce an approach that makes memory reuse semantics explicit by exposing a separate allocator for registered memory. The data and analysis in this paper yield the following contributions: (i) managing registered memory explicitly enables efficient reuse of registered memory; (ii) registering large memory regions to amortize the registration cost over multiple user requests can significantly reduce cost of acquiring new registered memory; and (iii) reducing the cost of acquiring registered memory can significantly improve the performance of RDMA communication. Reusing registered memory is key to high-performance RDMA communication. By making reuse semantics explicit, our approach has the potential to improve RDMA performance by making it significantly easier for programmers to efficiently reuse registered memory.",

            "abstract": "Performance variation deriving from hardware and software sources is common in modern scientific and data-intensive computing systems, and synchronization in parallel and distributed programs often exacerbates their impacts at scale. The decentralized and emergent effects of such variation are, unfortunately, also difficult to systematically measure, analyze, and predict; modeling assumptions which are stringent enough to make analysis tractable frequently cannot be guaranteed at meaningful application scales, and longitudinal methods at such scales can require the capture and manipulation of impractically large amounts of data. This paper describes a new, scalable, and statistically robust approach for effective modeling, measurement, and analysis of large-scale performance variation in HPC systems. Our approach avoids the need to reason about complex distributions of runtimes among large numbers of individual application processes by focusing instead on the maximum length of distributed workload intervals. We describe this approach and its implementation in MPI which makes it applicable to a diverse set of HPC workloads. We also present evaluations of these techniques for quantifying and predicting performance variation carried out on large-scale computing systems, and discuss the strengths and limitations of the underlying modeling assumptions.",

            "abstract": "Scientific data collections grow ever larger, both in terms of the size of individual data items and of the number and complexity of items. To use and manage them, it is important to directly address issues of robust and actionable provenance. We identify three key drivers as our focus: managing the size and complexity of metadata, lack of a priori information to match usage intents between publishers and consumers of data, and support for campaigns over collections of data driven by multi-disciplinary, collaborating teams. We introduce the Hoarde abstraction as an attempt to formalize a way of looking at collections of data to make them more tractable for later use. Hoarde leverages middleware and systems infrastructures for scientific and technical data management. Through the lens of a select group of challenging data usage scenarios, we discuss some of the aspects of implementation, usage, and forward portability of this new view on data management.",

            "abstract": "Composition of computational science applications, whether into ad hoc pipelines for analysis of simulation data or into well-defined and repeatable workflows, is becoming commonplace. In order to scale well as projected system and data sizes increase, developers will have to address a number of looming challenges. Increased contention for parallel filesystem bandwidth, accomodating in situ and ex situ processing, and the advent of decentralized programming models will all complicate application composition for next-generation systems. In this paper, we introduce a set of data services, Faodel, which provide scalable data management for workflows and composed applications. Faodel allows workflow components to directly and efficiently exchange data in semantically appropriate forms, rather than those dictated by the storage hierarchy or programming model in use. We describe the architecture of Faodel and present preliminary performance results demonstrating its potential for scalability in workflow scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Coordinated checkpoint/restart is currently the dominant approach to mitigating the impact of failures on important scientific applications running on large\u2010scale distributed systems. However, there is widespread evidence that coordinated checkpointing may no longer be viable on next\u2010generation systems. Uncoordinated checkpoint/restart attempts to address the shortcomings of coordinated checkpoint/restart by allowing application processes to checkpoint their state independently. However, eliminating coordination may significantly degrade application performance. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages existing coordination in important scientific applications to approximately coordinate checkpoints. Specifically, we propose to extend MPI implementations to force checkpoints to occur immediately after the completion of a collective operation. We evaluate the performance implications of this approach using an existing validated simulation framework. Our results demonstrate that approximately coordinated checkpointing can significantly improve application performance relative to totally uncoordinated checkpointing. We also show that forcing checkpoints to occur following a collective operation has a small impact on the nominal checkpoint interval for several important workloads. As a whole, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that approximately coordinated checkpointing may provide significant performance benefits without significantly increasing the cost of failure recovery.",

            "abstract": "Multi-step scientific workflows have become prominent and powerful tools of data-driven scientific discovery. Run-time analytic techniques are now commonly used to mitigate the performance effects of using parallel file systems as staging areas during workflow execution. However, workflow construction and deployment for extreme-scale computing is still largely an ad hoc process with uneven support from existing tools. In this paper, we present SMARTBLOCK, an approach to designing generic, reusable components for end-to-end construction of workflows. Specifically, we demonstrate that a small set of SMARTBLOCK generic components can be reused to build a diverse set of workflows, using examples based on actual analytic processes with three well-known scientific codes. Our evaluation shows promising scaling properties as well as negligible overheads for using a modular approach over a custom, \"all-in-one\" solution. As extreme-scale systems incorporate data analytics on simulation data as it is generated at rates that far outstrip available I/O bandwidth, tools such as SMARTBLOCK will become increasingly valuable for defining and deploying flexible, efficient workflows.",
