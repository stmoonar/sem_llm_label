            "title": "Click-Conversion Multi-Task Model with Position Bias Mitigation for Sponsored Search in eCommerce",
            "abstract": "Position bias, the phenomenon whereby users tend to focus on higher-ranked items of the search result list regardless of the actual relevance to queries, is prevailing in many ranking systems. Position bias in training data biases the ranking model, leading to increasingly unfair item rankings, click-through-rate (CTR), and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. To jointly mitigate position bias in both item CTR and CVR prediction, we propose two position-bias-free CTR and CVR prediction models: Position-Aware Click-Conversion (PACC) and PACC via Position Embedding (PACC-PE). PACC is built upon probability decomposition and models position information as a probability. PACC-PE utilizes neural networks to model product-specific position information as embedding. Experiments on the E-commerce sponsored product search dataset show that our proposed models have better ranking effectiveness and can greatly alleviate position bias in both CTR and CVR prediction.",

Forecasting, in general, has led to broad impact and a diverse range of applications. However, with large-scale, high-dimensional time-series data available, more advanced techniques must be invented or improved for highly accurate predictions. Latest data mining and machine learning techniques play a crucial role in the next generation of forecasting models. In this Applied Machine Learning Methods for Time Series Forecasting (AMLTS) workshop, we focus on effective and accurate latest machine learning approaches to solve various real-world problems. With this workshop's ability to attract audiences across various domains, we invite experienced industrial practitioners and researchers to help uncover new approaches and break new ground in time-series modelings' challenging and vital settings.",

Such managed platforms are often multi tenant by nature and not speci\ufb01cally tied to a single use-case. Smaller footprint of infrastructure on a managed cloud platform has its own set of challenges especially when applications are required to be infrastructure aware for quicker deployments and response times. There are often times and challenges to quickly spawn ready to use instances or hosts on such infrastructure. As part of this paper we outline mechanisms to quickly spawn ready to use instances for application while also being infrastructure aware. In addition, paper proposes architecture that provides high availability to deployed distributed applications.",

            "abstract": "Programmatic ad buying, the use of technology to automate and optimize the ad buying process in real-time, has been emerging to be the major form of online advertising. For each online campaign, advertisers generally want to specify a certain group of audience that they want to target at. Among these, demographics (user age and gender) is the fundamental and most common targeting option. On the other side, due to the huge volume of bid-requests flowing into the exchange, majority of those users (i.e. cookies) are either completely new to the ad platform or has too little historical behavior information to determine their demographics. In this paper, we present and discuss the methods, system and practical lessons in tackling this problem at massive scale.",

            "abstract": "Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) or Item Aspect Recognition task is fundamental to e-commerce marketplace. A structured listing (i.e. item aspect and catalog) is critical to the success of the marketplace - it helps the seller to put their listings to the right catalog and aspects so that the buyers can easily find the most relevant and accurate listings they are looking for. For e-commerce search engine, item aspects (brand, color, size, texture, etc.) should be automatically recognized from users' shopping queries in order to accurate understand their shopping intent. An accurate query and item aspect understanding helps to match seller's listing to buyer's purchase intend. However, in practice, this still remains challenge in e-commerce marketplace due to a couple reasons, e.g. the sparsity of the data - hundreds of millions of item aspect-name and aspect-value pairs (e.g. brand=Nike); noisy (low quality), not scalable but expensive label data that are obtained via human labeling \\citeb12 effort; the lack of context in generally very short search queries; the disperse of context and dis-orderedness in listing title or descriptions, etc. among others. All those imposes a big challenge that affect the performance of aspect recognition for e-commerce practice. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end machine learning system to build an effective aspect recognition system for search engine that leverages the generated label data from different legacy systems and effort, without any extra human-label effort (and thus no incurred cost). The framework is constructed with multiple machine learning components that are built to optimize the search relevance and conversion as an end goal. We show that the proposed aspect recognition machine learning system improved search results quality and relevance greatly compared to the existing already strong baseline system for e-commerce search.",

            "abstract": "The lack of high-quality labeled training data has been one of the critical challenges facing many industrial machine learning tasks. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to utilize unlabeled data and user feedback signals to improve the performance of ML models. The method employs a primary model Main and an auxiliary evaluation model Eval, where Main and Eval models are trained iteratively by automatically generating labeled data from unlabeled data and/or users\u2019 feedback signals. The proposed approach is applied to different text classification tasks. We report results on both the publicly available Yahoo! Answers dataset and our e-commerce product classification dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the classification error rate by 4% and up to 15% across various experimental setups and datasets. A detailed comparison with other semi-supervised learning approaches is also presented later in the paper. The results from various text classification tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms those developed in previous related studies.",

In this paper, we present our newly developed graph-based look-alike system in Yahoo! advertising platform which provides look-alike audiences for thousands of campaigns. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare our look-alike model with three other existing look-alike systems using billions of users and millions of user features.

Such model can successfully capture some distinguished nonlinear non-Gaussian time series features, such as the irregular bursts or jumps that are so widely observed in the transaction data set and other more general marked point processes. We illustrate the new time series model and related methods by modeling three pieces of IBM stock transaction data, and show its advantages over some benchmark models.",
