            "abstract": "Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph1, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The `pre-train, prompt, predict' paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However, few works explore this paradigm in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design and retrieval augmented generation for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.",

Many important applications on these data can be treated as computational tasks on graphs. Recently, machine learning techniques are widely developed and utilized to effectively tame graphs for discovering actionable patterns and harnessing them for advancing various graph-related computational tasks. Huge success has been achieved and numerous real-world applications have benefited from it. However, since in today's world, we are generating and gathering data in a much faster and more diverse way, real-world graphs are becoming increasingly large-scale and complex. More dedicated efforts are needed to propose more advanced machine learning techniques and properly deploy them for real-world applications in a scalable way. Thus, we organize The 3rd International Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs (MLoG), held in conjunction with the 16th ACM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), which provides a venue to gather academia researchers and industry researchers/practitioners to present the recent progress on machine learning on graphs.",

            "abstract": "As widely used in data-driven decision-making, recommender systems have been recognized for their capabilities to provide users with personalized services in many user-oriented online services, such as E-commerce (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, etc.) and Social Media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Recent works have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to promote or demote a set of target items. Instead of generating users with fake profiles from scratch, in this article, we introduce a novel strategy to obtain \u201cfake\u201d user profiles via copying cross-domain user profiles, where a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking framework (CopyAttack+) is developed to effectively and efficiently select cross-domain user profiles from the source domain to attack the target system. Moreover, we propose to train a local surrogate system for mimicking adversarial black-box attacks in the source domain, so as to provide transferable signals with the purpose of enhancing the attacking strategy in the target black-box recommender system. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework.",

With the aim to address these issues, here we propose THINK, a novel framework based on hypergraph learning that captures the hyperbolic properties of time-evolving dynamic hypergraphs. We design an elegant hyperbolic distance-aware hypergraph attention mechanism to better capture informative internal structural features on the Poincar\u00e9 ball.

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great power in learning node representations on graphs. However, they may inherit historical prejudices from training data, leading to discriminatory bias in predictions. Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown satisfying performance in various graph analytical problems. Hence, they have become the de facto solution in a variety of decision-making scenarios. However, GNNs could yield biased results against certain demographic subgroups. Some recent works have empirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a significant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have systematically scrutinized which part of the input network structure leads to biased predictions for any given node. The low transparency on how the structure of the input network influences the bias in GNN outcome largely limits the safe adoption of GNNs in various decision-critical scenarios. In this paper, we study a novel research problem of structural explanation of bias in GNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel post-hoc explanation framework to identify two edge sets that can maximally account for the exhibited bias and maximally contribute to the fairness level of the GNN prediction for any given node, respectively. Such explanations not only provide a comprehensive understanding of bias/fairness of GNN predictions but also have practical significance in building an effective yet fair GNN model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework towards delivering effective structural explanations for the bias of GNNs.

            "abstract": "In computer-aided drug discovery, quantitative structure activity relation models are trained to predict biological activity from chemical structure. Despite the recent success of applying graph neural network to this task, important chemical information such as molecular chirality is ignored. To fill this crucial gap, we propose Molecular-Kernel Graph Neural Network (MolKGNN) for molecular representation learning, which features SE(3)-/conformation invariance, chiralityawareness, and interpretability. For our MolKGNN, we first design a molecular graph convolution to capture the chemical pattern by comparing the atom\u2019s similarity with the learnable molecular kernels. Furthermore, we propagate the similarity score to capture the higher-order chemical pattern. To assess the method, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with nine well-curated datasets spanning numerous important drug targets that feature realistic high class imbalance and it demonstrates the superiority of MolKGNN over other GNNs in CADD. Meanwhile, the learned kernels identify patterns that agree with domain knowledge, confirming the pragmatic interpretability of this approach.

            "title": "Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network for Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully adopted in recommender systems by virtue of the message-passing that implicitly captures collaborative effect. Nevertheless, most of the existing message-passing mechanisms for recommendation are directly inherited from GNNs without scrutinizing whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences. In this paper, we first analyze how message-passing captures the collaborative effect and propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighbors. After demonstrating the benefits of leveraging collaborations from neighbors with higher CIR, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN), that goes beyond 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman(1-WL) test in distinguishing non-bipartite-subgraph-isomorphic graphs. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that the best CAGCN variant outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by nearly 10% in Recall@20 and also achieves around 80% speedup.
