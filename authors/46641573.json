            "title": "Influence of Parasitic Capacitance on Turn-Off Current and Its Optimization Method for Transient Electromagnetic System",
            "abstract": "In transient electromagnetic (TEM) inverter circuits, a damping resistor is typically connected in parallel to the transmitting coil to prevent overshoot during the turn-off period of the pulse current. This configuration results in an exponential decay waveform for the pulse current, which prolongs the turn-off time and increases the nonlinear error. This article analyzes the impact of the parasitic capacitance on the value of the damping resistor and the end-period waveform of the pulse current base on the inverter circuits, and proposes an optimized control method to reduce both the turn-off time and the nonlinear error of the pulse current. The method is validated through the construction of an experimental circuit. According to the experimental data, this optimization method reduces the turn-off time by 23.8% and the nonlinear error by 5.5%. In the unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection experiment, the optimization method\u2019s detection results exhibit higher resolution.",

            "abstract": "The cooperation between a manned aerial vehicle (MAV) and an unmanned aerial vehicle swarm (UAVS) to perform tasks will be a new focus of UAVS application in the foreseeable future. It is expected that a UAVS should be able to complete time-varying formation (TVF) flight while simultaneously tracking the trajectory of a MAV. This article studies the tracking-oriented TVF control problem of UAVSs under jointly-connected directed switching topologies (JCDST). To begin with, a distributed formation controller with one intermediate variable for estimating each UAV's state is devised based upon dynamic output feedback control approach. Then, the tracking-oriented TVF formation control issue is converted into an issue about the asymptotic stability control of a fast time averaging system via an appropriate variable conversion. Furthermore, the sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of the fast time averaging system, and the computing approach of the unknown control matrices are acquired and proved through a special kind of similar matrix transformation and Hurwitz stability criterion. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method are verified by comparing simulation results.",

            "title": "Smooth Deep Learning Magnetotelluric Inversion Based on Physics-Informed Swin Transformer and Multiwindow Savitzky\u2013Golay Filter",
            "abstract": "Despite exhibiting excellent inversion results for synthetic data in magnetotelluric (MT) inversion, applying deep learning (DL) to directly inverting MT field data remains challenging. In this study, different from most previous works that mainly focus on generating massive representative resistivity models to cover the solutions of the field data or constructing a strong network by employing advanced DL techniques, we provide a new perspective in that a multiwindow Savitzky\u2013Golay (MWSG) filter is proposed to first smooth the apparent resistivity and phase derived from the MT field measurements before network prediction. This smoothing operation aims to promote the actual apparent resistivity and phase to be close in morphology and smoothness to the training input data, i.e., to adapt the field data to the training sample data. Then, the smoothed apparent resistivity and phase, instead of the original ones, are fed into the well-trained network for instantaneous inversion. Because we create a set of layered resistivity models with gradual-changing resistivity to act as desired output during network training, it together with the proposed MWSG filter enables this work to achieve smooth inversion. Besides, we introduce Swin Transformer (SwinT) to improve the efficiency of MT DL inversion, based on which a physics-informed SwinT (PISwinT) is implemented to enhance the generalization capability. We demonstrate the proposed PISwinT-MWSG smooth inversion method in both synthetic and field MT cases, and it is expected to improve the adaptability and practicability of the DL method to directly solve the inverse problems in MT surveys.",

This paper proposes a system of key-points detection and registration based on image feature space, and uses the GAN for motion transfer, which is used to automatically generate oral and tongue articulatory animation of English. First, by obtaining the standard articulation image of the International Phonetic Alphabet from the public dataset, we train a deep-learning motion model according to the characteristics of the tongue, upper jaw, lower jaw, small tongue, soft palate and other motion features, according to the characteristics of articulatory organ, and automatically detect the key-points in the image feature space. According to the existing MRI articulatory videos, using different styles of articulatory images, a generative model is used to generate end-to-end animation of different styles automatically. For different combinations of consonants and vowels, generate animation of different syllables, and according to different categories of articulatory, such as stress and light tone, adjust the duration of articulatory to form different animation of stress and light tone of the same syllable. And form the animation of words through syllables, and then form the animation of each sentence. Experiments show that this method can simulate realistic articulatory animation according to input phonetic symbols, and has a very positive effect on English articulatory correction.",

This paper proposes an in-situ 3D scanning system by integrating laser sensor with dual linear rail and robot and simultaneously develops a accurate calibration method of systematic orientation parameters. Firstly, according to the mechanism analysis, 3D measurement model based on 2D scanning data are presented. Then, a calibration model of orientation parameters is established based on multiple geometric constraints without additional measurement device. In this model, the parallel constraints and distance constraints can be obtained by only scanning a single high-precision sphere from multiple perspectives. Then, the analytical solution of unknown orientation parameters is derived with consideration of redundant measurement data. Experimental results show that the root mean square error and the standard deviation are less than 15 \u03bcm and 7\u03bcm within 200 mm \u00d7 200 mm respectively, which verifies the accuracy and reliability.",

Thus, the communication resources can be saved. Second, by integrating the distributed ETO and the modified adaptive control technique, an adaptive control law that can be implemented in digital platforms and an event-triggered mechanism are designed to address our problem. Third, for the leader and all followers, the state tracking errors can converge exponentially to any small specified neighborhood of the origin at an arbitrarily fast specified convergence rate.

The self-supervised monocular paradigm has gained significant attention since it can free training from the reliance on depth annotations. Despite recent advancements, existing self-supervised methods still underutilize the available training data, limiting their generalization ability. In this letter, we take two data augmentation techniques, namely Resizing-Cropping and Splitting-Permuting, to fully exploit the potential of training datasets. Specifically, the original image and the generated two augmented images are fed into the training pipeline simultaneously and we leverage them to conduct self-distillation. Additionally, we introduce the detail-enhanced DepthNet with an extra full-scale branch in the encoder and a grid decoder to enhance the restoration of fine details in depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets. Moreover, our KITTI models also show superior generalization performance when transferring to Make3D, NYUv2 and Cityscapes datasets.",
