            "abstract": "Advances in generative AI, the proliferation of large multimodal models (LMMs), and democratized open access to these technologies have direct implications for the production and diffusion of misinformation. In this prequel, we address tackling misinformation in the unique and increasingly popular context of podcasts. The rise of podcasts as a popular medium for disseminating information across diverse topics necessitates a proactive strategy to combat the spread of misinformation. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of \\textit{auditory alerts} in contexts like collision alerts for drivers and error pings in mobile phones, our work envisions the application of auditory alerts as an effective tool to tackle misinformation in podcasts. We propose the integration of suitable auditory alerts to notify listeners of potential misinformation within the podcasts they are listening to, in real-time and without hampering listening experiences. We identify several opportunities and challenges in this path and aim to provoke novel conversations around instruments, methods, and measures to tackle misinformation in podcasts.",

            "abstract": "The increasing reliance on digital information necessitates advancements in conversational search systems, particularly in terms of information transparency. While prior research in conversational information-seeking has concentrated on improving retrieval techniques, the challenge remains in generating responses useful from a user perspective. This study explores different methods of explaining the responses, hypothesizing that transparency about the source of the information, system confidence, and limitations can enhance users' ability to objectively assess the response. By exploring transparency across explanation type, quality, and presentation mode, this research aims to bridge the gap between system-generated responses and responses verifiable by the user. We design a user study to answer questions concerning the impact of (1) the quality of explanations enhancing the response on its usefulness and (2) ways of presenting explanations to users. The analysis of the collected data reveals lower user ratings for noisy explanations, although these scores seem insensitive to the quality of the response. Inconclusive results on the explanations presentation format suggest that it may not be a critical factor in this setting.",

            "abstract": "Instruments such as eye-tracking devices have contributed to understanding how users interact with screen-based search engines. However, user-system interactions in audio-only channels -- as is the case for Spoken Conversational Search (SCS) -- are harder to characterize, given the lack of instruments to effectively and precisely capture interactions. Furthermore, in this era of information overload, cognitive bias can significantly impact how we seek and consume information -- especially in the context of controversial topics or multiple viewpoints. This paper draws upon insights from multiple disciplines (including information seeking, psychology, cognitive science, and wearable sensors) to provoke novel conversations in the community. To this end, we discuss future opportunities and propose a framework including multimodal instruments and methods for experimental designs and settings. We demonstrate preliminary results as an example. We also outline the challenges and offer suggestions for adopting this multimodal approach, including ethical considerations, to assist future researchers and practitioners in exploring cognitive biases in SCS.",

            "abstract": "Information access systems are getting complex, and our understanding of user behavior during information seeking processes is mainly drawn from qualitative methods, such as observational studies or surveys. Leveraging the advances in sensing technologies, our study aims to characterize user behaviors with physiological signals, particularly in relation to cognitive load, affective arousal, and valence. We conduct a controlled lab study with 26 participants, and collect data including Electrodermal Activities, Photoplethysmogram, Electroencephalogram, and Pupillary Responses. This study examines informational search with four stages: the realization of Information Need (IN), Query Formulation (QF), Query Submission (QS), and Relevance Judgment (RJ). We also include different interaction modalities to represent modern systems, e.g., QS by text-typing or verbalizing, and RJ with text or audio information. We analyze the physiological signals across these stages and report outcomes of pairwise non-parametric repeated-measure statistical tests. The results show that participants experience significantly higher cognitive loads at IN with a subtle increase in alertness, while QF requires higher attention. QS involves demanding cognitive loads than QF. Affective responses are more pronounced at RJ than QS or IN, suggesting greater interest and engagement as knowledge gaps are resolved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores user behaviors in a search process employing a more nuanced quantitative analysis of physiological signals. Our findings offer valuable insights into user behavior and emotional responses in information seeking processes. We believe our proposed methodology can inform the characterization of more complex processes, such as conversational information seeking.",

This reflects a shift in user expectations from traditional search to more interactive question-answering models. However, presenting information effectively in voice-only channels remains challenging due to their linear nature. This limitation can impact the presentation of complex queries involving controversial topics with multiple perspectives. Failing to present diverse viewpoints may perpetuate or introduce biases and affect user attitudes. Balancing information load and addressing biases is crucial in designing a fair and effective voice-based system. To address this, we (i) review how biases and user attitude changes have been studied in screen-based web search, (ii) address challenges in studying these changes in voice-based settings like SCS, (iii) outline research questions, and (iv) propose an experimental setup with variables, data, and instruments to explore biases in a voice-based setting like Spoken Conversational Search.",

            "abstract": "I M A G E B Y H U R C A A DOMINANT NARRATIVE of the past decade is that algorithms contribute to a misinformed and segregated society. Perhaps paradoxically, algorithms are often sought as solutions to such problems. We describe a significant emerging trend away from this techno-solutionist approach that seeks to create and understand a new paradigm: a productive interplay between algorithms and people. Two relevant test cases are being explored in our region: The first addresses a new framework to tackle misinformation by assisting fact-checkers with computational methods, and the second seeks new models to understand how search engines deliver personalized search results when little or no algorithmic personalization exists. In late 2020 and early 2021, the Australian Communication and Media Authority conducted a study to analyze the state of misinformation in Australia. The findings, reported to the Australian Government in June 2021, showed that four out of five Australian adults had been exposed to misinformation about COVID-19. They also found that online misinformation, such as the propagation of anti-vaccine narratives within the Australian community, had a direct negative impact on the trust that people place in democratic institutions and public health agencies. These narratives often originate overseas but quickly spread through local communities. The fact-checking organizations that have traditionally verified statements made by public figures or politicians in public and mainstream media now must also monitor and debunk dramatically faster-spreading claims on social media platforms. Narratives containing misinformation are having a direct and negative impact on how people consume information: They may influence the content we engage with and the search terms we enter.10 Given that an informed citizenry is a cornerstone of democracy, public decision making is at risk. The significance of the problem was also recognized in the International Cyber and Critical Technology Engagement Strategy released by the Australian Government, which identifies digital misinformation as a clear risk to the security and safety of Australia, the Indo-Pacific region, and beyond. Countries across East Asia and Oceania introduced legislation that specifically targets so-called \u2018fake news\u2019 and they created voluntary codes of practice developed in partnership with the technology industry.

            "abstract": "Physiological signals can potentially be applied as objective measures to understand the behavior and engagement of users interacting with information access systems. However, the signals are highly sensitive, and many controls are required in laboratory user studies. To investigate the extent to which controlled or uncontrolled (i.e., confounding) variables such as task sequence or duration influence the observed signals, we conducted a pilot study where each participant completed four types of information-processing activities (READ, LISTEN, SPEAK, and WRITE). Meanwhile, we collected data on blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and pupil responses. We then used machine learning approaches as a mechanism to examine the influence of controlled and uncontrolled variables that commonly arise in user studies. Task duration was found to have a substantial effect on the model performance, suggesting it represents individual differences rather than giving insight into the target variables. This work contributes to our understanding of such variables in using physiological signals in information retrieval user studies.",

            "abstract": "This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 23031 \"Frontiers of Information Access Experimentation for Research and Education\", which brought together 38 participants from 12 countries. The seminar addressed technology-enhanced information access (information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing) and specifically focused on developing more responsible experimental practices leading to more valid results, both for research as well as for scientific education. The seminar featured a series of long and short talks delivered by participants, who helped in setting a common ground and in letting emerge topics of interest to be explored as the main output of the seminar. This led to the definition of five groups which investigated challenges, opportunities, and next steps in the following areas: reality check, i.e. conducting real-world studies, human-machine-collaborative relevance judgment frameworks, overcoming methodological challenges in information retrieval and recommender systems through awareness and education, results-blind reviewing, and guidance for authors.
