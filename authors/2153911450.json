            "title": "A Survey on Privacy in Graph Neural Networks: Attacks, Preservation, and Applications",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention owing to their ability to handle graph-structured data and the improvement in practical applications. However, many of these models prioritize high utility performance, such as accuracy, with a lack of privacy consideration, which is a major concern in modern society where privacy attacks are rampant. To address this issue, researchers have started to develop privacy-preserving GNNs. Despite this progress, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the attacks and the techniques for preserving privacy in the graph domain. In this survey, we aim to address this gap by summarizing the attacks on graph data according to the targeted information, categorizing the privacy preservation techniques in GNNs, and reviewing the datasets and applications that could be used for analyzing/solving privacy issues in GNNs. We also outline potential directions for future research in order to build better privacy-preserving GNNs.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully adopted in recommender systems by virtue of the message-passing that implicitly captures collaborative effect. Nevertheless, most of the existing message-passing mechanisms for recommendation are directly inherited from GNNs without scrutinizing whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences. In this paper, we first analyze how message-passing captures the collaborative effect and propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighbors. After demonstrating the benefits of leveraging collaborations from neighbors with higher CIR, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN), that goes beyond 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman(1-WL) test in distinguishing non-bipartite-subgraph-isomorphic graphs. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that the best CAGCN variant outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by nearly 10% in Recall@20 and also achieves around 80% speedup.

            "abstract": "By virtue of the message-passing that implicitly injects collaborative effect into the embedding process, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully adopted in recommendation systems (e.g., LightGCN, GTN, and UltraGCN). Nevertheless, most of existing message-passing mechanisms in recommendation are directly inherited from GNNs without any recommendation-tailored modification. Although some efforts have been made towards simplifying GNNs to improve the performance/efficiency of recommendation, no study has comprehensively scrutinized how message-passing captures collaborative effect and whether the captured effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences over items. Therefore, in this work we aim to demystify the collaborative effect captured by message-passing in GNNs and develop new insights towards customizing message-passing for recommendation. First, we theoretically analyze how message-passing captures and leverages the collaborative effect in predicting user preferences. Then, to determine whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences, we propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighborhood set. Inspired by our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Augmented Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN*), that extends upon the LightGCN framework and is able to selectively pass information of neighbors based on their CIR via the Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolution. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that CAGCN* outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by 9% in Recall@20 and also achieves more than 79% speedup.
