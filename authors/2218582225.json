            "title": "A Survey on Fairness-aware Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "As information filtering services, recommender systems have extremely enriched our daily life by providing personalized suggestions and facilitating people in decision-making, which makes them vital and indispensable to human society in the information era. However, as people become more dependent on them, recent studies show that recommender systems potentially own unintentional impacts on society and individuals because of their unfairness (e.g., gender discrimination in job recommendations). To develop trustworthy services, it is crucial to devise fairness-aware recommender systems that can mitigate these bias issues. In this survey, we summarise existing methodologies and practices of fairness in recommender systems. Firstly, we present concepts of fairness in different recommendation scenarios, comprehensively categorize current advances, and introduce typical methods to promote fairness in different stages of recommender systems. Next, after introducing datasets and evaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we will delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender systems exert on real-world industrial applications. Subsequently, we highlight the connection between fairness and other principles of trustworthy recommender systems, aiming to consider trustworthiness principles holistically while advocating for fairness. Finally, we summarize this review, spotlighting promising opportunities in comprehending concepts, frameworks, the balance between accuracy and fairness, and the ties with trustworthiness, with the ultimate goal of fostering the development of fairness-aware recommender systems.",

            "title": "GBG++: A Fast and Stable Granular Ball Generation Method for Classification",
            "abstract": "Granular ball computing (GBC), as an efficient, robust, and scalable learning method, has become a popular research topic of granular computing. GBC includes two stages: granular ball generation (GBG) and multi-granularity learning based on the granular ball (GB). However, the stability and efficiency of existing GBG methods need to be further improved due to their strong dependence on <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-means or <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-division. In addition, GB-based classifiers only unilaterally consider the GB's geometric characteristics to construct classification rules, but the GB's quality is ignored. Therefore, in this paper, based on the attention mechanism, a fast and stable GBG (GBG++) method is proposed first. Specifically, the proposed GBG++ method only needs to calculate the distances from the data-driven center to the undivided samples when splitting each GB instead of randomly selecting the center and calculating the distances between it and all samples. Moreover, an outlier detection method is introduced to identify local outliers. Consequently, the GBG++ method can significantly improve effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency while being absolutely stable. Second, considering the influence of the sample size within the GB on the GB's quality, based on the GBG++ method, an improved GB-based <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors algorithm (GB<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>NN++) is presented, which can reduce misclassification at the class boundary. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms several existing GB-based classifiers and classical machine learning classifiers on 24 public benchmark datasets.",
