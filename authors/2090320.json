            "abstract": "We have tested recently published foundation models for histopathology for image retrieval. We report macro average of F1 score for top-1 retrieval, majority of top-3 retrievals, and majority of top-5 retrievals. We perform zero-shot retrievals, i.e., we do not alter embeddings and we do not train any classifier. As test data, we used diagnostic slides of TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 23 organs and 117 cancer subtypes. As a search platform we used Yottixel that enabled us to perform WSI search using patches. Achieved F1 scores show low performance, e.g., for top-5 retrievals, 27% +/- 13% (Yottixel-DenseNet), 42% +/- 14% (Yottixel-UNI), 40%+/-13% (Yottixel-Virchow), 41%+/-13% (Yottixel-GigaPath), and 41%+/-14% (GigaPath WSI).",

            "abstract": "Digital pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by enabling the digitization, storage, and analysis of tissue samples as whole slide images (WSIs). WSIs are gigapixel files that capture the intricate details of tissue samples, providing a rich source of information for diagnostic and research purposes. However, due to their enormous size, representing these images as one compact vector is essential for many computational pathology tasks, such as search and retrieval, to ensure efficiency and scalability. Most current methods are\"patch-oriented,\"meaning they divide WSIs into smaller patches for processing, which prevents a holistic analysis of the entire slide. Additionally, the necessity for compact representation is driven by the expensive high-performance storage required for WSIs. Not all hospitals have access to such extensive storage solutions, leading to potential disparities in healthcare quality and accessibility. This paper provides an overview of existing set-based approaches to single-vector WSI representation, highlighting the innovations that allow for more efficient and effective use of these complex images in digital pathology, thus addressing both computational challenges and storage limitations.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) have been applied for cell-level genomic profiling. For mutation profiling, the latter seems more natural. However, the task is highly challenging due to the limited input materials from only two copies of DNA molecules, while whole-genome amplification generates biases and other technical noises. ScRNA-seq starts with a higher input amount, so generally has better data quality. There exists various methods for mutation detection from DNA sequencing, it is not clear whether these methods work for scRNA-seq data. Results Mutation detection methods developed for either bulk-cell sequencing data or scDNA-seq data do not work well for the scRNA-seq data, as they produce substantial numbers of false positives. We develop a novel and robust statistical method\u2014called SCmut\u2014to identify specific cells that harbor mutations discovered in bulk-cell data. Statistically SCmut controls the false positives using the 2D local false discovery rate method. We apply SCmut to several scRNA-seq datasets. In scRNA-seq breast cancer datasets SCmut identifies a number of highly confident cell-level mutations that are recurrent in many cells and consistent in different samples. In a scRNA-seq glioblastoma dataset, we discover a recurrent cell-level mutation in the PDGFRA gene that is highly correlated with a well-known in-frame deletion in the gene. To conclude, this study contributes a novel method to discover cell-level mutation information from scRNA-seq that can facilitate investigation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity.

            "abstract": "High throughput assays allow researchers to identify sets of genes related to experimental conditions or phenotypes of interest. These gene sets are frequently subjected to functional interpretation using databases of gene annotations. Recent approaches have extended this approach to also consider networks of gene-gene relationships and interactions when attempting to characterize properties of a gene set. We present here a supervised learning algorithm for gene set analysis, called \u2018GeneSet MAPR\u2019, that for the first time explicitly considers the patterns of direct as well as indirect relationships present in the network to quantify gene-gene similarities and then report shared properties of the gene set. Our extensive evaluations show that GeneSet MAPR performs better than other network-based methods for the task of identifying genes related to a given gene set, enabling more reliable functional characterizations of the gene set. When applied to the set of response-associated genes from a triple negative breast cancer study, GeneSet MAPR uncovers gene families such as claudins, kallikreins, and collagen type alpha chains related to patient\u2019s response to treatment, and which are not uncovered with traditional analysis.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Estimation of isoform-level gene expression from RNA-seq data depends on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform read distribution, that are easily violated in real data. Such violations typically lead to biased estimates. Most existing methods provide bias correction step(s), which is based on biological considerations\u2014such as GC content\u2014and applied in single samples separately. The main problem is that not all biases are known. Results We have developed a novel method called XAEM based on a more flexible and robust statistical model. Existing methods are essentially based on a linear model X\u03b2, where the design matrix X is known and is computed based on the simplifying assumptions. In contrast XAEM considers X\u03b2 as a bilinear model with both X and \u03b2 unknown. Joint estimation of X and \u03b2 is made possible by a simultaneous analysis of multi-sample RNA-seq data. Compared to existing methods, XAEM automatically performs empirical correction of potentially unknown biases. We use an alternating expectation-maximization (AEM) algorithm, alternating between estimation of X and \u03b2. For speed XAEM utilizes quasi-mapping for read alignment, thus leading to a fast algorithm. Overall XAEM performs favorably compared to recent advanced methods. For simulated datasets, XAEM obtains higher accuracy for multiple-isoform genes. In a differential-expression analysis of a real single-cell RNA-seq dataset, XAEM achieves substantially better rediscovery rates in independent validation sets.

            "abstract": "Purpose The majority of cancer patients receive treatments that are minimally informed by omics data. We propose a precision medicine computational framework (PANOPLY: Precision cancer genomic report: single sample inventory) to identify and prioritize drug targets and cancer therapy regimens. Methods The PANOPLY approach integrates clinical data with germline and somatic features obtained from multi-omics platforms, and apply machine learning, and network analysis approaches in the context of the individual patient and matched controls. The PANOPLY workflow employs four steps (i) selection of matched controls to the case of interest (ii) identification of case-specific genomic events (iii) identification of suitable drugs using the driver-gene network and random forest analyses and (iv) provide an integrated multi-omics case report of the patient with prioritization of anti-cancer drugs. Results The PANOPLY workflow can be executed on a stand-alone virtual machine and is also available for download as an R package. We applied the method to an institutional breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy study which collected clinical and genomic data as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to investigate the prioritization offered by PANOPLY. In a chemotherapy-resistant PDX model, we found that that the prioritized drug, olaparib, was more effective than placebo in treating the tumor (P < 0.05). We also applied PANOPLY to in-house and publicly accessible multi-omics tumor datasets with therapeutic response or survival data available. Conclusion PANOPLY shows promise as a means to prioritize drugs based on clinical and multi-omics data for an individual cancer patient. Additional studies are needed to confirm this approach.",

            "abstract": "This paper demonstrates an unsupervised learning approach to identify genes with significant differential expression across single-cell subpopulations induced by therapeutic treatment. Identifying this set of genes makes it possible to use well-established bioinformatics approaches such as pathway analysis to establish their biological relevance. Then, a biologist can use his/her prior knowledge to investigate in the laboratory, a few particular candidates among the subset of genes overlapping with relevant pathways. Due to the large size of the human genome and limitations in cost and skilled resources, biologists benefit from analytical methods combined with pathway analysis to design laboratory experiments focusing on only a few significant genes. As an example, we show how model-based unsupervised methods can identify a small set of genes (1% of the genome) that have significant differential expression in single-cells and are also highly correlated to pathways (p-value < 1E \u2212 7) with anticancer effects driven by the antidiabetic drug metformin. Further analysis of genes on these relevant pathways reveal three candidate genes previously implicated in several anticancer mechanisms in other cancers, not driven by metformin. Identification of these genes can help biologists and clinicians design laboratory experiments to establish the molecular mechanisms of metformin in triple-negative breast cancer. In a domain where there is no prior knowledge of small biologically significant data, we demonstrate that careful data-driven methods can infer such significant small data to explain biological mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Accurate assessment of genetic variation in human DNA sequencing studies remains a nontrivial challenge in clinical genomics and genome informatics. Ascribing functional roles and/or clinical significances to single nucleotide variants identified from a next-generation sequencing study is an important step in genome interpretation. Experimental characterization of all the observed functional variants is yet impractical; thus, the prediction of functional and/or regulatory impacts of the various mutations using in silico approaches is an important step toward the identification of functionally significant or clinically actionable variants. The relationships between genotypes and the expressed phenotypes are multilayered and biologically complex; such relationships present numerous challenges and at the same time offer various opportunities for the design of in silico variant assessment strategies. Over the past decade, many bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict functional consequences of single nucleotide variants in the protein coding regions. In this review, we provide an overview of the bioinformatics resources for the prediction, annotation and visualization of coding single nucleotide variants. We discuss the currently available approaches and major challenges from the perspective of protein sequence, structure, function and interactions that require consideration when interpreting the impact of putatively functional variants. We also discuss the relevance of incorporating integrated workflows for predicting the biomedical impact of the functionally important variations encoded in a genome, exome or transcriptome. Finally, we propose a framework to classify variant assessment approaches and strategies for incorporation of variant assessment within electronic health records.",

One typical feature of the data is a bimodality in the cellular distribution even for highly expressed genes, primarily caused by a proportion of non-expressing cells. The standard and the over-dispersed gamma-Poisson models that are commonly used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing are not able to capture this property.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe introduce a beta-Poisson mixture model that can capture the bimodality of the single-cell gene expression distribution. We further integrate the model into the generalized linear model framework in order to perform differential expression analyses. The whole analytical procedure is called BPSC. The results from several real single-cell RNA-seq datasets indicate that \u223c90% of the transcripts are well characterized by the beta-Poisson model; the model-fit from BPSC is better than the fit of the standard gamma-Poisson model in\u2009>\u200980% of the transcripts. Moreover, in differential expression analyses of simulated and real datasets, BPSC performs well against edgeR, a conventional method widely used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing data, and against scde and MAST, two recent methods specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nAn R package BPSC for model fitting and differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data is available under GPL-3 license at https://github.com/nghiavtr/BPSC CONTACT: yudi.pawitan@ki.se or mattias.rantalainen@ki.se\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
