            "title": "Contrast then Memorize: Semantic Neighbor Retrieval-Enhanced Inductive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion",
            "abstract": "A large number of studies have emerged for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) to predict the missing links in MKGs. However, fewer studies have been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging entities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on learning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic information in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural neighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited. However, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and usually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task and a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the contrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize supports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we first propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously capture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity pairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the similarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations of helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge representations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we retrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the query-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/OreOZhao/CMR.",

            "title": "Bring Invariant to Variant: A Contrastive Prompt-based Framework for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting",
            "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph forecasting aims to reason over known facts to complete the missing links in the future. Existing methods are highly dependent on the structures of temporal knowledge graphs and commonly utilize recurrent or graph neural networks for forecasting. However, entities that are infrequently observed or have not been seen recently face challenges in learning effective knowledge representations due to insufficient structural contexts. To address the above disadvantages, in this paper, we propose a Contrastive Prompt-based framework with Entity background information for TKG forecasting, which we named CoPET. Specifically, to bring the time-invariant entity background information to time-variant structural information, we employ a dual encoder architecture consisting of a candidate encoder and a query encoder. A contrastive learning framework is used to encourage the query representation to be closer to the candidate representation. We further propose three kinds of trainable time-variant prompts aimed at capturing temporal structural information. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method is effective and stays competitive in inference with limited structural information.
