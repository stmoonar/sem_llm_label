            "title": "Dynamic Sizing of Cloud-Native Telco Data Centers With Digital Twin and Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Telco edge data centers (DCs) accommodate applications whose load fluctuates considerably during a day. This variability mandates swift and responsive resource adjustments to mitigate the risk of incurring unnecessary costs during off-peak periods, where a significant fraction of nodes may be under-utilized. Tackling this challenge is integral to optimizing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of telco edge DCs. To this end, this article aims to address the Dynamic Data Center Sizing (DDS) problem, which boils down to optimizing the number of active nodes as per current resource demand. The proposed DDS solution consists of two core modules, namely a forecasting module, which predicts resource demands, and a decision-making module, which acts upon predicted demands. The decision-making of DDS is implemented via the filtering and the rank-drain-observe (RDO) algorithms. Filtering is based on integer linear programming, and it computes the theoretically optimal state of the DC based on predicted resource demands. RDO is a heuristic that strives to realize the optimal DC state in an iterative and robust fashion. To expedite RDO in large-scale clusters, we further devise a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-enabled DDS variant (i.e., RL-DDS), in which RDO integrates an RL agent that computes optimized batches of nodes for concurrent deactivation. We propose an innovative solution based on the notion of Digital Twin to train the RL agent in emulation mode. DDS and RL-DDS are evaluated upon real-life testbeds resembling actual DCs. Results demonstrate significant cost reduction, ranging from 7% in conservative and relatively static scenarios, up to 38% in highly dynamic settings.",

            "abstract": "In data exploration, users need to analyze large data files quickly, aiming to minimize data-to-analysis time. While recent adaptive indexing approaches address this need, they are cases where demonstrate poor performance. Particularly, during the initial queries, in regions with a high density of objects, and in very large files over commodity hardware. This work introduces an approach for adaptive indexing driven by both query workload and user-defined accuracy constraints to support approximate query answering. The approach is based on partial index adaptation which reduces the costs associated with reading data files and refining indexes. We leverage a hierarchical tile-based indexing scheme and its stored metadata to provide efficient query evaluation, ensuring accuracy within user-specified bounds. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates improvement on query evaluation time, especially during initial user exploration.",

Traditional data reduction techniques may improve latency but can distort visualizations. State-of-the-art methods aimed at 100% accurate visualization often fail to maintain interactive response times or require excessive preprocessing and additional storage. We propose an in-memory adaptive caching approach, MinMaxCache, that efficiently reuses previous query results to accelerate visualization performance within accuracy constraints. MinMaxCache fetches data at adaptively determined aggregation granularities to maintain interactive response times and generate approximate visualizations with accuracy guarantees. Our results show that it is up to 10 times faster than current solutions without significant accuracy compromise.",

            "abstract": "Soiling is the accumulation of dirt in solar panels that leads to a decreasing trend in solar energy yield and may be the cause of vast revenue losses. The effect of soiling can be reduced by washing the panels, which is, however, a procedure of non-negligible cost. Moreover, soiling monitoring systems are often unreliable or very costly. We study the problem of estimating the soiling ratio in photovoltaic (PV) modules, i.e., the ratio of the real power output to the power output that would be produced if solar panels were clean. A key advantage of our algorithms is that they estimate soiling, without needing to train on labeled data, i.e., periods of explicitly monitoring the soiling in each park, and without relying on generic analytical formulas that do not take into account the peculiarities of each installation. We consider as input a time series comprising a minimum set of measurements that are available to most PV park operators. Our experimental evaluation shows that we significantly outperform current state-of-the-art methods for estimating soiling ratio.",

            "abstract": "The deployment of emerging cloud computing technologies onto telecommunication (telco) infrastructures, coupled with highly stringent regulations relating to energy efficiency, power consumption, and CO2 emissions, put telco datacenters and their associated operations under a drastic transformation process. This paves the way for new optimization opportunities, such as dynamic datacenter sizing (DDS) with respect to power consumption constraints and volatile demands across multiple resource types. DDS boils down to determining the optimal subset of active servers in a datacenter, and it can be modeled as a planning problem where decisions regarding resource availability are based on projections of resource demands. This raises the need for accurate and efficient forecasting solutions, which shall be tailored to the problem at hand.To this end, our work focuses on the investigation, the development, and the evaluation of forecasting methods which predict the demand of 5G (and beyond) workloads across multiple resources. Concretely, using the daily pattern of load data pertaining to an operational data-plane function and the prevailing way of horizontal scaling in virtualized datacenters, we exemplify the evolution of resource demands of 5G applications residing at the network edge. This lets us simulate a dataset of demands across various resource types, upon which we study informative features, and then train and evaluate a wide suite of forecasting methods. Our experiments show that the intrinsic characteristics of the data render simple statistical algorithms capable of accurately capturing the underlying patterns, and even outperforming more complex algorithms. Last, we evaluate and discuss the trade-off between single- and multi-output forecasting models.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies algorithmic fairness when the protected attribute is location. To handle protected attributes that are continuous, such as age or income, the standard approach is to discretize the domain into predefined groups, and compare algorithmic outcomes across groups. However, applying this idea to location raises concerns of gerrymandering and may introduce statistical bias. Prior work addresses these concerns but only for regularly spaced locations, while raising other issues, most notably its inability to discern regions that are likely to exhibit spatial unfairness. Similar to established notions of algorithmic fairness, we define spatial fairness as the statistical independence of outcomes from location. This translates into requiring that for each region of space, the distribution of outcomes is identical inside and outside the region. To allow for localized discrepancies in the distribution of outcomes, we compare how well two competing hypotheses explain the observed outcomes. The null hypothesis assumes spatial fairness, while the alternate allows different distributions inside and outside regions. Their goodness of fit is then assessed by a likelihood ratio test. If there is no significant difference in how well the two hypotheses explain the observed outcomes, we conclude that the algorithm is spatially fair.",

            "title": "Machine Learning Platform for Extreme Scale Computing on Compressed IoT Data",
            "abstract": "With the lowering costs of sensors, high-volume and high-velocity data are increasingly being generated and analyzed, especially in IoT domains like energy and smart homes. Consequently, applications that require accurate short-term forecasts and predictions are also steadily increasing. In this paper, we provide an overview of a novel end-to-end platform that provides efficient ingestion, compression, transfer, query processing, and machine learning-based analytics for high-frequency and high-volume time series from IoT. The performance of the platform is evaluated using real-world dataset from RES installations. The results show the importance of high-frequency analytics and the surprisingly positive impact of error bounded lossy compression on machine learning in the form of AutoML. For example, when detecting yaw misalignments in wind turbines, an improvement of 9% in accuracy was observed for AutoML models on lossy compressed data compared to the current industry standard of 10-minute aggregated data. Thus, these small-scale experiments show the potential of the platform, and larger pilots are planned.",
