            "abstract": "Protein-ligand interactions are essential to drug discovery and drug development efforts. Desirable on-target or multi-target interactions are a first step in finding an effective therapeutic; undesirable off-target interactions are a first step in assessing safety. In this work, we introduce a novel ligand-based featurization and mapping of human protein pockets to identify closely related protein targets, and to project novel drugs into a hybrid protein-ligand feature space to identify their likely protein interactions. Using structure-based template matches from PDB, protein pockets are featurized by the ligands which bind to their best co-complex template matches. The simplicity and interpretability of this approach provides a granular characterization of the human proteome at the protein pocket level instead of the traditional protein-level characterization by family, function, or pathway. We demonstrate the power of this featurization method by clustering a subset of the human proteome and evaluating the predicted cluster associations of over 7,000 compounds.",

            "abstract": "Structure-based Deep Fusion models were recently shown to outperform several physics- and machine learning-based protein-ligand binding affinity prediction methods. As part of a multi-institutional COVID-19 pandemic response, over 500 million small molecules were computationally screened against four protein structures from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Three enhancements to Deep Fusion were made in order to evaluate more than 5 billion docked poses on SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. First, the Deep Fusion concept was refined by formulating the architecture as one, coherently backpropagated model (Coherent Fusion) to improve binding-affinity prediction accuracy. Secondly, the model was trained using a distributed, genetic hyper-parameter optimization. Finally, a scalable, high-throughput screening capability was developed to maximize the number of ligands evaluated and expedite the path to experimental evaluation. In this work, we present both the methods developed for machine learning-based high-throughput screening and results from using our computational pipeline to find SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.",

KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules.
