            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "title": "Performance Analysis of CUPS-Enabled Space-Ground Cellular Networks",
            "abstract": "Control- and User-Plane Separation (CUPS) and Space Cellular Networks (SCNs) are promising solutions for delivering ubiquitous connectivity and high-traffic wireless services on a global scale. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of CUPS in the separation networks' coverage and data service functions has not been fully leveraged in enabling reliable connectivity. In this paper, we propose a CUPS-enabled Integrated Space-Ground Cellular Network (CUPS-ISGCN). Specifically, Control Base Stations (CBSs) are optimized by deploying them on the space layer to form the Control Plane (CP) and increase coverage for more users over a wide area. Meanwhile, Traffic Base Stations (TBSs) located on the ground layer form the User Plane (UP) and deliver high bit rates within the coverage area of the CP. To maximize CP coverage and improve UP efficiency, we introduce CUPS-enabled SCN into the CP and provide the analytical models to analyze the performance of the CUPS-ISGCN in terms of CP coverage and UP efficiency. By using stochastic geometry, we derive the general closed-form expressions for CP coverage. Then, we thoroughly study UP's performance as a function of the channel parameters between 2-planes, CP and UP. Based on the analysis results, it's proved that the proposed CUPS-ISGCN structure improved the CP coverage performance and UP efficiency.",

            "title": "Smart Parking System Based on mmWave Radars and Bluetooth Low Energy: Prototype Implementation",
            "abstract": "Smart Parking has gained so much popularity in recent years due to the increasing number of vehicles in big cities, resulting in traffic congestion in urban areas. Not only on the streets but also in places such as educational institutions, hospitals, commercial activities, special events, and entertainment uses. Finding a free parking lot in these places has evolved difficulty for the drivers. To solve such a problem, governments and researchers tried to find alternative solutions to overcome or mitigate the traffic congestion. Many solutions have been proposed, such as increasing the parking capacities, which takes much time or makes it hard to find a square area in crowded places. Most existing studies, do not consider the cost of deployment, energy, and time-to-market consideration which makes the available systems need further investigation. In this paper, we propose an intelligent parking system prototype that can be useful for the drivers to have a prior knowledge about the available parking lots in the area of interest. Our proposed system involves deploying mmWave Radar sensor nodes in each parking lot to detect the availability of parking vehicle through transmitting radio pulses periodically. The detected information can be sent to the gateway through multi-hop for further statistics and reports. We also give an intensive analysis and study about the challenges and consideration on the mmWave radar design aiming to improve the detection accuracy and avoid false-detection that occurs from objects near to the sensor. To ensure continuous operation and extend sensor life-time, we propose Bluetooth Low Energy BLE-enabled relay-feature as the communication protocol between the nodes.",

            "abstract": "Recently, energy provisioning problem has become one of the leading research interests in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Deploying Mobile Charger Vehicles (MCVs) (e.g., robots, drones) equipped with high capacity-battery and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) transmitter to charge the sensor nodes in the network wirelessly, is a promising solution. Existing scheduling policies mostly concentrated on charging tasks scheduling, but neglected the influences of network topology and energy threshold distribution. Furthermore, schedulability test of existing studies remain infeasible and we can\u2019t guarantee implementing them for larger set of tasks, making them unsuitable for real-time WRSNs. To fill this gap, in this paper, first, we propose hexagonal clustered-based deployment of sensor nodes and MCVs to provide large coverage and a robust connected network through alternative routes. Second, we propose an efficient Non-Preemptive Priority on-Demand Charging scheduling (NPDC) scheme for the mobile chargers to schedule the charging tasks according to Earliest Deadline First EDF algorithm. Third, we propose an energy threshold distribution and algorithm to assign threshold value for nodes and optimize the arrivals of charge requests. Fourth, we propose a traffic intensity-based partial charging distribution to minimize the dead node density. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve good performance in terms of queue length, dead nodes density, response time, and energy efficiency.",
