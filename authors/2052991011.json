            "abstract": ". We present Neguess, an entity-guessing game with unique emphasis on challenging negative clues. The clues have been automati-cally generated using the peer-based negation inference methodology [3]. The game can be used i) as an entertaining way to familiarize partici-pants with the novel area of explicit negative knowledge in open-world knowledge bases; and ii) has the potential to be adopted in pedagogical approaches, like game-based teaching practices. The demo is available at: https://neguess.mpi-inf.mpg.de.",
