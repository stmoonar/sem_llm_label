            "abstract": "Novel infectious disease outbreaks, including most recently that of the COVID-19 pandemic, could be detected by non-specific syndromic surveillance systems. Such systems, utilizing a variety of data sources ranging from Electronic Health Records to internet data such as aggregated search engine queries, create alerts when unusually high rates of symptom reports occur. This is especially important for the detection of novel diseases, where their manifested symptoms are unknown. Here we improve upon a set of previously-proposed non-specific syndromic surveillance methods by taking into account both how unusual a preponderance of symptoms is and their effect size. We demonstrate that our method is as accurate as previously-proposed methods for low dimensional data and show its effectiveness for high-dimensional aggregated data by applying it to aggregated time-series health-related search engine queries. We find that in 2019 the method would have raised alerts related to several disease outbreaks earlier than health authorities did. During the COVID-19 pandemic the system identified the beginning of pandemic waves quickly, through combinations of symptoms which varied from wave to wave. Thus, the proposed method could be used as a practical tool for decision makers to detect new disease outbreaks using time series derived from search engine data even in the absence of specific information on the diseases of interest and their symptoms.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nHealthcare providers and organizations occasionally use electronic messages to provide information to patients. There is insufficient data on whether patients actually read the emails they receive. In this study, we aimed to assess the cooperation of patients in reading multiple information pages sent over 6\u00a0months from their diabetologist via email.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAdults with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes received via email, once every 2\u00a0weeks for 6\u00a0months, a message containing information and tips on how to improve diabetes control through lifestyle choices. The information was provided in a format that required the recipient to actively click on a \"read more\" tab in order to reveal the entire text. Each email contained a short questionnaire requesting a response. Analysis compared the effect of patient variables on co-operation with reading the emails and answering the questionnaires.\n\n\nMAIN FINDINGS\n45 patients completed the study, 53.3% of them read 66-100% of the emails, 17.8% read 34-65% of the emails and only 26.7% read less than 33% of the emails. Women answered more questionnaires than men did. Answering a questionnaire on nutrition or medications correlated with reading the following email sent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that most patients do indeed read a significant portion of emails sent by their physician. Email could be an effective means of sharing information and improving patient engagement with treatment.",

We show how this measure can be calculated when the classifier's conditional confusion matrices are known. We further propose methods for auditing classifiers for their fairness when the confusion matrices cannot be obtained or even estimated. Our approach lower-bounds the unfairness of a classifier based only on aggregate statistics, which may be provided by the owner of the classifier or collected from freely available data. We use the equalized odds criterion, which we generalize to the multiclass case. We report experiments on data sets representing diverse applications, which demonstrate the effectiveness and the wide range of possible uses of the proposed methodology. An implementation of the procedures proposed in this paper and as the code for running the experiments are provided in https://github.com/sivansabato/unfairness.",

            "abstract": "Suicide, one of the top causes of life lost in developed countries, is a major health problem, especially today, with the dramatic increase in mental health difficulties that was triggered during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Opportunely, the recent emergence of internet-based crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk) may accelerate research on suicide prevention, however, this type of suicide research online involves a difficult ethical challenge: how to keep participants\u2019 safe without compromising their privacy. To address this ethical challenge, a consortium of experts from multiple research institutions was assembled. The consortium discussed the advantages and disadvantages for participants involved in crowdsourcing-based studies that address suicide risk. This discussion resulted in a consensual step-by-step protocol for researchers who wish to conduct suicide research online, using the crowdsourcing platforms. This article provides a detailed description of the protocol and outlines key ethical arguments that led to its formulation. Unresolved issues are discussed as well and other researchers are encouraged to implement the proposed protocol and suggest further improvements. It is our hope that the current protocol will facilitate the research on large and diverse populations online and thus contribute to the global efforts to reduce suicide rates around the world.",

            "abstract": "Triggered by the COVID-19 crisis, Israel's Ministry of Health (MoH) held a virtual Datathon based on deidentified governmental data. Organized by a multidisciplinary committee, Israel's research community was invited to offer insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1) develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy challenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry, and government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies, special needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance with COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable, up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80 participants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent all sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18 multidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5 presentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future projects. Detailed feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the structure and organization of future government-led datathons.",

            "title": "Bounding the fairness and accuracy of classifiers from population statistics",
            "abstract": "We consider the study of a classification model whose properties are impossible to estimate using a validation set, either due to the absence of such a set or because access to the classifier, even as a black-box, is impossible. Instead, only aggregate statistics on the rate of positive predictions in each of several sub-populations are available, as well as the true rates of positive labels in each of these sub-populations. We show that these aggregate statistics can be used to lowerbound the discrepancy of a classifier, which is a measure that balances inaccuracy and unfairness. To this end, we define a new measure of unfairness, equal to the fraction of the population on which the classifier behaves differently, compared to its global, ideally fair behavior, as defined by the measure of equalized odds. We propose an efficient and practical procedure for finding the best possible lower bound on the discrepancy of the classifier, given the aggregate statistics, and demonstrate in experiments the empirical tightness of this lower bound, as well as its possible uses on various types of problems, ranging from estimating the quality of voting polls to measuring the effectiveness of patient identification from internet search queries. The code and data are available on GitHub.",

            "title": "How Search Engine Data Enhance the Understanding of Determinants of Suicide in India and Inform Prevention: Observational Study",
            "abstract": "Background India is home to 20% of the world\u2019s suicide deaths. Although statistics regarding suicide in India are distressingly high, data and cultural issues likely contribute to a widespread underreporting of the problem. Social stigma and only recent decriminalization of suicide are among the factors hampering official agencies\u2019 collection and reporting of suicide rates. Objective As the product of a data collaborative, this paper leverages private-sector search engine data toward gaining a fuller, more accurate picture of the suicide issue among young people in India. By combining official statistics on suicide with data generated through search queries, this paper seeks to: add an additional layer of information to more accurately represent the magnitude of the problem, determine whether search query data can serve as an effective proxy for factors contributing to suicide that are not represented in traditional datasets, and consider how data collaboratives built on search query data could inform future suicide prevention efforts in India and beyond. Methods We combined official statistics on demographic information with data generated through search queries from Bing to gain insight into suicide rates per state in India as reported by the National Crimes Record Bureau of India. We extracted English language queries on \u201csuicide,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201changing,\u201d \u201cpesticide,\u201d and \u201cpoison\u201d. We also collected data on demographic information at the state level in India, including urbanization, growth rate, sex ratio, internet penetration, and population. We modeled the suicide rate per state as a function of the queries on each of the 5 topics considered as linear independent variables. A second model was built by integrating the demographic information as additional linear independent variables. Results Results of the first model fit (R2) when modeling the suicide rates from the fraction of queries in each of the 5 topics, as well as the fraction of all suicide methods, show a correlation of about 0.5. This increases significantly with the removal of 3 outliers and improves slightly when 5 outliers are removed. Results for the second model fit using both query and demographic data show that for all categories, if no outliers are removed, demographic data can model suicide rates better than query data. However, when 3 outliers are removed, query data about pesticides or poisons improves the model over using demographic data. Conclusions In this work, we used search data and demographics to model suicide rates. In this way, search data serve as a proxy for unmeasured (hidden) factors corresponding to suicide rates. Moreover, our procedure for outlier rejection serves to single out states where the suicide rates have substantially different correlations with demographic factors and query rates.",

            "abstract": "Search advertising is one of the most commonly-used methods of advertising. Past work has shown that search advertising can be employed to improve health by eliciting positive behavioral change. However, writing effective advertisements requires expertise and (possible expensive) experimentation, both of which may not be available to public health authorities wishing to elicit such behavioral changes, especially when dealing with a public health crises such as epidemic outbreaks. \nHere we develop an algorithm which builds on past advertising data to train a sequence-to-sequence Deep Neural Network which \"translates\" advertisements into optimized ads that are more likely to be clicked. The network is trained using more than 114 thousands ads shown on Microsoft Advertising. We apply this translator to two health related domains: Medical Symptoms (MS) and Preventative Healthcare (PH) and measure the improvements in click-through rates (CTR). \nOur experiments show that the generated ads are predicted to have higher CTR in 81% of MS ads and 76% of PH ads. To understand the differences between the generated ads and the original ones we develop estimators for the affective attributes of the ads. We show that the generated ads contain more calls-to-action and that they reflect higher valence (36% increase) and higher arousal (87%) on a sample of 1000 ads. Finally, we run an advertising campaign where 10 random ads and their rephrased versions from each of the domains are run in parallel. We show an average improvement in CTR of 68% for the generated ads compared to the original ads. \nOur results demonstrate the ability to automatically optimize advertisement for the health domain. We believe that our work offers health authorities an improved ability to help nudge people towards healthier behaviors while saving the time and cost needed to optimize advertising campaigns.",
