            "abstract": "Time-series data are widespread and have inspired numerous research works in machine learning and data analysis fields for the classification and clustering of temporal data. While there are several clustering methods for univariate time series and a few for multivariate series, most methods are based on distance and/or dissimilarity measures that do not fully utilize the time-dependency information inherent to time-series data. To highlight the main dynamic structure of a set of multivariate time series, this study extends the use of standard variance\u2013covariance matrices in principal component analysis to cross-autocorrelation matrices at time lags k=1,2,\u2026. This results in \u201cprincipal component time series\u201d. Simulations and a sign language dataset are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its benefits in exploring the main structural features of multiple time series.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a novel interactive framework to handle both instance-level and temporal smoothness constraints for clustering large temporal data. It consists of a constrained clustering algorithm which optimizes the clustering quality, constraint violation and the historical cost between consecutive data snapshots. At the center of our framework is a simple yet effective active learning technique for iteratively selecting the most informative pairs of objects to query users about, and updating the clustering with new constraints. Those constraints are then propagated inside each snapshot and between snapshots via constraint inheritance and propagation to further enhance the results. Experiments show better or comparable clustering results than existing techniques as well as high scalability for large datasets.",

Most of these studies rely on point-wise, regression-like prediction algorithms and focus on few, usually unambiguous, keywords. We study in this paper the impact of keyword activity on three different problems: a) classification of keywords according to the increase of their activity in the near future; b) prediction of the activity value of each keyword in the near future; c) ranking of a set of keywords according to their future activity values. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that such dimensions are evaluated in this framework. Our experiments are conducted on a large dataset built by monitoring Twitter over a year. The different methods tested are evaluated using standard scores as well as a newly defined, application driven quality measure.",

To classify time series, promising solutions refer to the combination of multiple basic metrics to compare time series according to several characteristics.

To do so, we first formulate the general Instance Selection Problem (ISP) and then study three variants of that in order to select instances from different regions of the data. These variants aim at finding the objects located in three very different locations of the data: the inner frontier, the central area and the outer frontier. Solutions to these problems have been discussed and their complexities have been studied. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, we first use a small, synthetic dataset for visualization purpose. We then study them on the Reuters dataset and show that the integration of instances selected by the ISP techniques is able to provide a good representation of the data and can be considered as a complementary approach for the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we examine the quality of the selected objects by applying a topic-based analysis in order to show how well the selected documents cover the topics in the Reuters dataset.",

It also introduces the concept of vertex contributions to the underlying principal components, a concept not possible for classical data, but one which provides a visualization method that further aids in the interpretation of the methodology. The method is illustrated in a dataset using measurements of facial characteristics obtained from a study of face recognition patterns for surveillance purposes. A comparison with analyses in which classical surrogates replace the intervals, shows how the symbolic analysis gives more informative conclusions. A second example illustrates how the method can be applied even when the number of parameters exceeds the number of observations, as well as how uncertainty data can be accommodated. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

            "abstract": "Recent days advancement in sensor and instrumentation technology has seen a large amount of time series data being recorded in our day-to-day life. Knowledge and data mining research has taken up the responsibility of mining the hidden patterns in these huge collection of time series data during the past decade. In this paper we propose methodologies to extract hidden knowledge in a time series data through an unsupervised approach by using the novel WaveSim transform. This recently introduced transform is a novel perspective of wavelet transform and it is defined by keeping pattern analysis and recognition in mind. Time series data mining has been classified broadly into whole series mining and subsequence series mining. We propose a hierarchical tree based approach for subsequence mining in a time series using a modified WaveSim transform called Adaptive WaveSim transform. The technique has been illustrated through a set of experimentation results which is expected to open up a wide arena for future work.",
