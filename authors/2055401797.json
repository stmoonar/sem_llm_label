            "abstract": "In the age of the Digital Revolution, almost all human activities, from industrial and business operations to medical and academic research, are reliant on the constant integration and utilisation of ever-increasing volumes of data. However, the explosive volume and complexity of data makes data querying and exploration challenging even for experts, and makes the need to democratise the access to data, even for non-technical users, all the more evident. It is time to lift all technical barriers, by empowering users to access relational databases through conversation. We consider 3 main research areas that a natural language data interface is based on: Text-to-SQL, SQL-to-Text, and Data-to-Text. The purpose of this tutorial is a deep dive into these areas, covering state-of-the-art techniques and models, and explaining how the progress in the deep learning field has led to impressive advancements. We will present benchmarks that sparked research and competition, and discuss open problems and research opportunities with one of the most important challenges being the integration of these 3 research areas into one conversational system.",

            "abstract": "Enabling users to query data in a relational database using natural language has long been considered the holy grail of the database community. Towards this direction, there has been an increasing research focus on Natural Language Data Interfaces that allow users to pose queries in natural language and translate these queries to the underlying database query language. Several approaches have emerged especially due to the recent advances in deep neural networks. Despite this blooming, not only these systems are very complicated and difficult to understand, but they have yet to deliver their promise of enabling users to use natural language to access data easily. Hence, they have failed to see widespread adoption. A question naturally arises: is natural language access to data going to be the elusive holy grail of databases? We hope not. With the aim of fostering research on these open issues, in this position paper, we discuss (currently unmet) requirements for effective natural language data exploration and highlight promising research directions. Finally, we describe how to rethink the text-to-SQL problem and how this should be realized as an integral capability of a DBMS for the realization of a system that fully supports natural language queries over data.",

            "title": "ScienceBenchmark: A Complex Real-World Benchmark for Evaluating Natural Language to SQL Systems",
            "abstract": "Natural Language to SQL systems (NL-to-SQL) have recently shown improved accuracy (exceeding 80%) for natural language to SQL query translation due to the emergence of transformer-based language models, and the popularity of the Spider benchmark. However, Spider mainly contains simple databases with few tables, columns, and entries, which do not reflect a realistic setting. Moreover, complex real-world databases with domain-specific content have little to no training data available in the form of NL/SQL-pairs leading to poor performance of existing NL-to-SQL systems.\n \n In this paper, we introduce\n ScienceBenchmark\n , a new complex NL-to-SQL benchmark for three real-world, highly domain-specific databases. For this new benchmark, SQL experts and domain experts created high-quality NL/SQL-pairs for each domain. To garner more data, we extended the small amount of human-generated data with synthetic data generated using GPT-3. We show that our benchmark is highly challenging, as the top performing systems on Spider achieve a very low performance on our benchmark. Thus, the challenge is many-fold: creating NL-to-SQL systems for highly complex domains with a small amount of hand-made training data augmented with synthetic data. To our knowledge,\n ScienceBenchmark\n is the first NL-to-SQL benchmark designed with complex real-world scientific databases, containing challenging training and test data carefully validated by domain experts.\n",

Recently, novel text-to-SQL systems are adopting deep learning methods with very promising results. At the same time, several challenges remain open making this area an active and flourishing field of research and development. To make real progress in building text-to-SQL systems, we need to de-mystify what has been done, understand how and when each approach can be used, and, finally, identify the research challenges ahead of us. The purpose of this tutorial is to present recent advances of deep learning techniques for text-to-SQL translation, and to highlight open problems and new research opportunities for researchers and practitioners in the fields of database systems, natural language processing and deep learning.",

For this reason, numerous text-to-SQL systems have been developed that enable querying relational databases using natural language. The recent advances on deep neural networks along with the creation of two large datasets specifically made for training text-to-SQL systems, have paved the path for a novel and very promising research area.
