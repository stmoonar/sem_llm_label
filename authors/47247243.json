            "abstract": "Causal neurosymbolic AI (NeSyAI) combines the benefits of causality with NeSyAI. More specifically, it 1) enriches NeSyAI systems with explicit representations of causality, 2) integrates causal knowledge with domain knowledge, and 3) enables the use of NeSyAI techniques for causal AI tasks. The explicit causal representation yields insights that predictive models may fail to analyze from observational data. It can also assist people in decision-making scenarios where discerning the cause of an outcome is necessary to choose among various interventions.",

            "title": "CausalLP: Learning causal relations with weighted knowledge graph link prediction",
            "abstract": "Causal networks are useful in a wide variety of applications, from medical diagnosis to root-cause analysis in manufacturing. In practice, however, causal networks are often incomplete with missing causal relations. This paper presents a novel approach, called CausalLP, that formulates the issue of incomplete causal networks as a knowledge graph completion problem. More specifically, the task of finding new causal relations in an incomplete causal network is mapped to the task of knowledge graph link prediction. The use of knowledge graphs to represent causal relations enables the integration of external domain knowledge; and as an added complexity, the causal relations have weights representing the strength of the causal association between entities in the knowledge graph. Two primary tasks are supported by CausalLP: causal explanation and causal prediction. An evaluation of this approach uses a benchmark dataset of simulated videos for causal reasoning, CLEVRER-Humans, and compares the performance of multiple knowledge graph embedding algorithms. Two distinct dataset splitting approaches are used for evaluation: (1) random-based split, which is the method typically employed to evaluate link prediction algorithms, and (2) Markov-based split, a novel data split technique that utilizes the Markovian property of causal relations. Results show that using weighted causal relations improves causal link prediction over the baseline without weighted relations.",

In this work we propose the use of a knowledge graph based semantic data exchange layer, the Metaverse Knowledge Graph, to enable seamless transfer of information across platforms. We discuss how this approach addresses the challenge of interoperability and leads to better interactivity and synchronization across tools.",

This paper evaluates the suitability of long-term monitoring of pediatric asthma using diverse data to qualify and quantify triggers that contribute to the asthma symptoms and control to enable a personalized management plan. \nMaterials and Methods: Asthma condition, environment, and adherence to the prescribed care plan were continuously tracked for 97 pediatric patients using kHealth-Asthma technology for one or three months. \nResult: At the cohort level, among 21% of the patients deployed in spring, 63% and 19% indicated pollen and Particulate Matter (PM2.5), respectively, as the major asthma contributors. Of the 18% of the patients deployed in fall, 29% and 21% found pollen and PM2.5 respectively, to be the contributors. For the 28% of the patients deployed in winter, PM2.5 was identified as the major contributor for 80% of them. One patient across each season has been chosen to explain the determination of personalized triggers by observing correlations between triggers and asthma symptoms gathered from anecdotal evidence. \nDiscussion and Conclusion: Both public and personal health signals including compliance to prescribed care plan have been captured through continuous monitoring using the kHealth-Asthma technology which generated insights on causes of asthma symptoms across different seasons. Collectively, they can form the underlying basis for personalized management plan and intervention. \nKEYWORDS: Personalized Digital Health, Medical Internet of Things, Pediatric Asthma Management, Patient Generated Health Data, Personalized Triggers, Telehealth,",

            "title": "PhD Forum: Multimodal IoT and EMR Based Smart Health Application for Asthma Management in Children",
            "abstract": "According to a study done in 2014 by National Health Interview Survey around 6.3 million children in United States suffer from asthma [1]. Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth\u00b9, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using an inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.",

            "abstract": "Healthcare as we know it is in the process of going through a massive change \u2014 from episodic to continuous, from disease focused to wellness and quality of life focused, from clinic centric to anywhere a patient is, from clinician controlled to patient empowered, and from being driven by limited data to 360-degree, multimodal personal-public-population physical-cyber-social big data driven. While ability to create and capture data is already here, the upcoming innovations will be in converting this big data into smart data through contextual and personalized processing such that patients and clinicians can make better decisions and take timely actions for augmented personalized health. This paper outlines current opportunities and challenges, with a focus on key AI approaches to make this a reality. The broader vision is exemplified using three ongoing applications (asthma in children, bariatric surgery, and pain management) as part of the Kno.e.sis kHealth personalized digital health initiative.",
