            "abstract": "Accurate alignment of calcium imaging data, which is critical for the extraction of neuronal activity signals, is often hindered by the image noise and the neuronal activity itself. To address the problem, we propose an algorithm named REALS for robust and efficient batch image alignment through simultaneous transformation and low rank and sparse decomposition. REALS is constructed upon our finding that the low rank subspace can be recovered via linear projection, which allows us to perform simultaneous image alignment and decomposition with gradient-based updates. REALS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in terms of accuracy and speed compared to the state-of-the-art robust image alignment algorithms.",

            "title": "Generating 3D Bio-Printable Patches Using Wound Segmentation and Reconstruction to Treat Diabetic Foot Ulcers",
            "abstract": "We introduce AiD Regen, a novel system that generates 3D wound models combining 2D semantic segmentation with 3D reconstruction so that they can be printed via 3D bio-printers during the surgery to treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). AiD Regen seamlessly binds the full pipeline, which includes RGB-D image capturing, semantic segmentation, boundary-guided point-cloud processing, 3D model reconstruction, and 3D printable G-code generation, into a single system that can be used out of the box. We developed a multi-stage data preprocessing method to handle small and unbalanced DFU image datasets. AiD Regen's human-in-the-loop machine learning interface enables clinicians to not only create 3D regenerative patches with just a few touch interactions but also customize and confirm wound boundaries. As evidenced by our experiments, our model outperforms prior wound segmentation models and our reconstruction algorithm is capable of generating 3D wound models with compelling accuracy. We further conducted a case study on a real DFU patient and demonstrated the effectiveness of AiD Regen in treating DFU wounds.",

            "abstract": "Positioning based on long-term evolution (LTE) signals has been introduced as an alternative positioning method when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable. One option for positioning based on LTE signals is to utilize received signal strength (RSS) measurements. There is a relationship between the distance from user equipment (UE) to an LTE base station (BS) and the measured LTE RSS. In this paper, we analyzed the aforementioned relationship and developed an application that can measure LTE RSS and return the predicted distance from a UE to a BS in an Android smartphone environment.",

            "abstract": "The coupled movement of humans and robots is an integral aspect of human-robot cooperation. However, while extensive research has been conducted on robot movement, research on human movement in collaboration with robot movement is relatively rare. In this study, we performed an experiment to analyze the walking trajectory of a blindfolded participant receiving haptic feedback from a mobile robot. For this experiment, we employed a mobile robot system equipped with a haptic device. In order to observe the effects of haptic feedback on human and robot movements, we generated appropriate haptic feedback that can guide humans to the desired path. The experiment was performed in a laboratory environment equipped with a motion capture system in order to analyze the participant's walking trajectory when the appropriate haptic feedback was provided. We also compared the effects of haptic feedback on the human trajectory at large and small turning angles. The findings of this research indicate that human movement can be controlled though provision of appropriate haptic instruction by mobile robots.",
