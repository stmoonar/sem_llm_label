            "title": "A Dynamics and Task Decoupled Reinforcement Learning Architecture for High-Efficiency Dynamic Target Intercept",
            "abstract": "Due to the flexibility and ease of control, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly used in various scenarios and applications in recent years. Training UAVs with reinforcement learning (RL) for a specific task is often expensive in terms of time and computation. However, it is known that the main effort of the learning process is made to fit the low-level physical dynamics systems instead of the high-level task itself. In this paper, we study to apply UAVs in the dynamic target intercept (DTI) task, where the dynamics systems equipped by different UAV models are correspondingly distinct. To this end, we propose a dynamics and task decoupled RL architecture to address the inefficient learning procedure, where the RL module focuses on modeling the DTI task without involving physical dynamics, and the design of states, actions, and rewards are completely task-oriented while the dynamics control module can adaptively convert actions from the RL module to dynamics signals to control different UAVs without retraining the RL module. We show the efficiency and efficacy of our results in comparison and ablation experiments against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Show Me The Best Outfit for A Certain Scene: A Scene-aware Fashion Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Fashion recommendation (FR) has received increasing attention in the research of new types of recommender systems. Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric.",
