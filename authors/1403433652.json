We present the results of our first phase in a multi-year collaboration with analysts and physicians aiming at improved inter-disciplinary biomarker identification. We also outline our user-centered approach along its challenges, describe the intermediate technical artifacts that serve as a basis for summative and formative evaluation for the second project phase. Finally, we sketch the road ahead and how we intend to combine visualization research with user-centered design through problem-based prioritization.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present our design study on developing an interactive visual firewall log analysis system in collaboration with an IT service provider. We describe the human-centered design process, in which we additionally considered hedonic qualities by including the usage of personas, psychological need cards and interaction vocabulary. For the problem characterization we especially focus on the demands of the two main clusters of requirements: high-level overview and low-level analysis, represented by the two defined personas, namely information security officer and network analyst. This resulted in the prototype of a visual analysis system consisting of two interlinked parts. One part addresses the needs for rather strategical tasks while also fulfilling the need for an appealing appearance and interaction. The other part rather addresses the requirements for operational tasks and aims to provide a high level of flexibility. We describe our design journey, the derived domain tasks and task abstractions as well as our visual design decisions, and present our final prototypes based on a usage scenario. We also report on our capstone event, where we conducted an observed experiment and collected feedback from the information security officer. Finally, as a reflection, we propose the extension of a widely used design study process with a track for an additional focus on hedonic qualities.",

Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

We present a system that aims at easing design, creation and execution of controlled experiments for visualizations in the web. We include of parameterizable visualization generation services, thus separating the visualization implementation from study design and execution. This enables experimenters to design and run multiple experiments on the same visualization service in parallel, replicate experiments, and compare different visualization services quickly. The system supports the range from simple questionnaires to visualization-specific interaction techniques as well as automated task generation based on dynamic sampling of parameter spaces. We feature two examples to demonstrate our service-based approach. One example demonstrates how a suite of successive experiments can be conducted, while the other example includes an extended replication study.",

We describe the context of this vision and our experience with the \ufb01rst achievements in this direction. With our new prototype, anyone can analyze their network traf\ufb01c logs and get security-relevant information out of it, a task that was too dif\ufb01cult and sometimes too expensive in the past.

The first is a research agenda, which we divide into methods for presentation, interaction & computation, and scale-up. Second, we introduce the concept of Event Maps to help with scale-up, and illustrate coarse-, medium- and fine-grained Event Maps with electronic health record (EHR) data for prostate cancer. Third, in an experiment we investigated participants\u2019 ability to judge the similarity of event sequences. Contrary to previous research into categorical data, color and shape were better than position for encoding event type. However, even with simple sequences (5 events of 3 types in the target sequence), participants only got 88% correct despite averaging 7.4 seconds to respond. This indicates that simple visualization techniques are not effective.",

Large amounts of textual information to be considered in decision making processes can be found on the web. This includes general information about policy models, individual arguments in favor or against these policies, and public opinions. Monitoring large text collections and extracting the relevant information is time consuming. In this approach we present a visual analytics system that supports users in assessing the results of automatic text analysis methods. The methods extract text segments from large document collections and associate them with prede\ufb01ned policy domains, policy models, and policy arguments. Moreover, sentiment analysis is applied on the text segments. Visualization techniques provide non-IT experts an intuitive access to the results. With the system, users can monitor public debates on the web. In addition, we analyze concepts that enable the user to give visual-interactive feedback on the text analysis results. This direct user feedback can help to improve the accuracy of individual text analysis modules and the credibility of the overall text analysis process. The system was tested with real users from the political decision making domain.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of research data plays a key role in data\u2010driven areas of science. Varieties of mixed research data sets exist and scientists aim to derive or validate hypotheses to find undiscovered knowledge. Many analysis techniques identify relations of an entire dataset only. This may level the characteristic behavior of different subgroups in the data. Like automatic subspace clustering, we aim at identifying interesting subgroups and attribute sets. We present a visual\u2010interactive system that supports scientists to explore interesting relations between aggregated bins of multivariate attributes in mixed data sets. The abstraction of data to bins enables the application of statistical dependency tests as the measure of interestingness. An overview matrix view shows all attributes, ranked with respect to the interestingness of bins. Complementary, a node\u2010link view reveals multivariate bin relations by positioning dependent bins close to each other. The system supports information drill\u2010down based on both expert knowledge and algorithmic support. Finally, visual\u2010interactive subset clustering assigns multivariate bin relations to groups. A list\u2010based cluster result representation enables the scientist to communicate multivariate findings at a glance. We demonstrate the applicability of the system with two case studies from the earth observation domain and the prostate cancer research domain. In both cases, the system enabled us to identify the most interesting multivariate bin relations, to validate already published results, and, moreover, to discover unexpected relations.",

            "abstract": "Decision making in the field of policy making is a complex task. On the one hand conflicting objectives influence the availability of alternative solutions for a given problem. On the other hand economic, social, and environmental impacts of the chosen solution have to be considered. In the political context, these solutions are called policy options. To tackle societal problems a thorough analysis of policy options needs to be executed before a policy can be put into practice. Computational simulation is a method considered for measuring the impacts of policy options. However, due to their complexity, the underlying models and their output may be difficult to access by decision makers. In this work, we present a visual-interactive interface for an agent-based simulation model that enables decision makers to evaluate the impacts of alternative policy options in the field of regional energy planning. The decision maker can specify different subsidy strategies for supporting public photovoltaic installations as input and evaluate their impact on the actual adoption via the simulation output. We show the usability and usefulness of the visual interface in a real-world example evolved from the European research project ePolicy.",

These layouts can be optimized to minimize changes when navigating to other parts of the graph. Dynamic graph layout techniques do not, however, guarantee that a local layout is recognizable when the user visits the same area twice. In this paper we present a method to create stable and deterministic layouts of dynamic views of large graphs. It is based on a well-known panorama-stitching algorithm from the image processing domain. Given a set of overlapping photographs it creates a larger panorama that combines the original images. In analogy to that our algorithm stitches pre-computed layouts of subgraphs to form a larger, single layout. This deterministic approach makes structures and node locations persistent which creates identical visual representations of the graph. This enables the user to recognize previously encountered parts and to decide whether a certain part of a dataset has already been explored before or not.",
