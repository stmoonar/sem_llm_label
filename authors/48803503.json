            "abstract": "Imbalanced node classification widely exists in real-world networks where graph neural networks (GNNs) are usually highly inclined to majority classes and suffer from severe performance degradation on classifying minority class nodes. Various imbalanced node classification methods have been proposed recently which construct synthetic nodes and edges w.r.t. minority classes to balance the label and topology distribution. However, they are all based on the homophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the wide existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs. Thus, they uniformly aggregate features from both homophilic and heterophilic neighbors and rely on feature similarity to generate synthetic edges, which cannot be applied to imbalanced graphs in high heterophily. To address this problem, we propose a novel GraphSANN for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Firstly, we propose a unified feature mixer to generate synthetic nodes with both homophilic and heterophilic interpolation in a unified way. Next, by randomly sampling edges between synthetic nodes and existing nodes as candidate edges, we design an adaptive subgraph extractor to adaptively extract the contextual subgraphs of candidate edges with flexible ranges. Finally, we develop a multi-filter subgraph encoder that constructs different filter channels to discriminatively aggregate neighbor's information along the homophilic and heterophilic edges. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",

            "title": "BOURNE: Bootstrapped Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Unified Graph Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its critical application in a wide range of domains, such as social networks, financial risk management, and traffic analysis. Existing GAD methods can be categorized into node and edge anomaly detection models based on the type of graph objects being detected. However, these methods typically treat node and edge anomalies as separate tasks, overlooking their associations and frequent co-occurrences in real-world graphs. As a result, they fail to leverage the complementary information provided by node and edge anomalies for mutual detection. Additionally, state-of-the-art GAD methods, such as CoLA and SL-GAD, heavily rely on negative pair sampling in contrastive learning, which incurs high computational costs, hindering their scalability to large graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified graph anomaly detection framework based on bootstrapped self-supervised learning (named BOURNE). We extract a subgraph (graph view) centered on each target node as node context and transform it into a dual hypergraph (hypergraph view) as edge context. These views are encoded using graph and hypergraph neural networks to capture the representations of nodes, edges, and their associated contexts. By swapping the context embeddings between nodes and edges and measuring the agreement in the embedding space, we enable the mutual detection of node and edge anomalies. Furthermore, BOURNE can eliminate the need for negative sampling, thereby enhancing its efficiency in handling large graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of BOURNE in detecting both node and edge anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Data warehouse and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) are effective tools for decision support on traditional relational data and static multidimensional network data. However, many real-world multidimensional networks are often modeled as temporal multidimensional networks, where the edges in the network are associated with temporal information. Such temporal multidimensional networks typically cannot be handled by traditional data warehouse and OLAP techniques.

Through supporting OLAP queries in any time range, users can obtain summarized information of the network in the time range of interest, which cannot be derived by using traditional static graph OLAP techniques. We propose a segment-tree based indexing technique to speed up the OLAP queries, and also develop an index-updating technique to maintain the index when the temporal multidimensional network evolves over time.

            "abstract": "Cross-Modal Zero-Shot Hashing (CMZSH) is an important image retrieval technique, e.g., Text Based Image Retrieval. Most of existing CMZSH methods mainly use semantic attributes as guidance to generate hash codes for both the images and texts of seen and unseen categories. However, existing CMZSH methods only focus on learning global attribute vectors and hash codes for images, which mixes up information of complex semantics and background clutters, and thus impedes the retrieval performance. To solve this issue, we propose an Attribute-Guided Multiple Instance Hashing (AG-MIH) network for CMZSH, where each instance represents one image region. Instead of generating global image hash codes, AG-MIH can effectively learn instance-level hash codes based on instance attributes. To improve the attribute learning for instances, AG-MIH can exploia novel 2-D Category-Attribute Relation (CAR) layer, which uses different matching templates to model the relationships between each instance and the attributes for different categories. Under the guidance of semantic attributes, AG-MIH can effectively learn hash codes for each visual instance and texts by a Multi-stream Instance Hashing Refinement (MIHR) procedure. In the MIHR, the pseudo supervisions for the instance-level attributes and hash codes in each stream are from its proceeding stream. Empirical studies on benchmark datasets show that AG-MIH achieves state-of-the-art performance on both cross-modal and single-modal zero-shot image retrieval tasks.",

This study shows that the progress towards this task can be accelerated by using learning record data to feed a deep learning model that considers the intrinsic course association and the structured features. We proposed a multi-source sparse attention convolutional neural network (MsaCNN) to predict the course grades in a general formulation. MsaCNN adopts multi-scale convolution kernels on student grade records to capture structured features, a global attention strategy to discover the relationship between courses, and multiple input-heads to integrate multi-source features. All achieved features are then poured into a softmax classifier towards an end-to-end supervised deep learning model. Conducting insights into higher education on real-world university datasets, the results show that MsaCNN achieves better performance than traditional methods and delivers an interpretation of student performance by virtue of the resulted course relationships. Inspired by this interpretation, we created an association map for all mentioned courses, followed by evaluating the map with a questionnaire survey. This study provides computer-aided system tools and discovers the course-space map from the educational data, potentially facilitating the personalized learning progress.",

However, most existing methods suffer from inaccurate dimensionality reduction for the joint-modality data, hindering their discovery of novel or rare cell subpopulations. Results Here, we present VIMCCA, a computational framework based on variational-assisted multi-view canonical correlation analysis to integrate paired multimodal single-cell data. Our statistical model uses a common latent variable to interpret the common source of variances in two different data modalities. Our approach jointly learns an inference model and two modality-specific non-linear models by leveraging variational inference and deep learning. We perform VIMCCA and compare it with 10 existing state-of-the-art algorithms on four paired multi-modal datasets sequenced by different protocols. Results demonstrate that VIMCCA facilitates integrating various types of joint-modality data, thus leading to more reliable and accurate downstream analysis. VIMCCA improves our ability to identify novel or rare cell subtypes compared to existing widely used methods. Besides, it can also facilitate inferring cell lineage based on joint-modality profiles. Availability and implementation The VIMCCA algorithm has been implemented in our toolkit package scbean (\u22650.5.0), and its code has been archived at https://github.com/jhu99/scbean under MIT license.

            "abstract": "Emerging studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in a variety of biological processes and play a key role in disease diagnosing, treating and inferring. Although many methods, including traditional machine learning and deep learning, have been developed to predict associations between circRNAs and diseases, the biological function of circRNAs has not been fully exploited. Some methods have explored disease-related circRNAs based on different views, but how to efficiently use the multi-view data about circRNA is still not well studied. Therefore, we propose a computational model to predict potential circRNA-disease associations based on collaborative learning with circRNA multi-view functional annotations. First, we extract circRNA multi-view functional annotations and build circRNA association networks, respectively, to enable effective network fusion. Then, a collaborative deep learning framework for multi-view information is designed to get circRNA multi-source information features, which can make full use of the internal relationship among circRNA multi-view information. We build a network consisting of circRNAs and diseases by their functional similarity and extract the consistency description information of circRNAs and diseases. Last, we predict potential associations between circRNAs and diseases based on graph auto encoder. Our computational model has better performance in predicting candidate disease-related circRNAs than the existing ones. Furthermore, it shows the high practicability of the method that we use several common diseases as case studies to find some unknown circRNAs related to them. The experiments show that CLCDA can efficiently predict disease-related circRNAs and are helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",

            "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have important effects on various biological processes, and their dysfunction is closely related to the emergence and development of diseases. Identifying the associations between circRNAs and diseases is helpful in analyzing the pathogenesis of diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective computational methods for predicting circRNA-disease associations. Here, we present a computational model called HRCDA to predict associations between circRNA and disease based on heterogeneous graph representation. Firstly, an integrated network of circRNA functional similarity is built by Random Walk with Restart in the view of biological functions of circRNA. Then, a heterogeneous graph of circRNAs and diseases is constructed with known circRNA-disease associations. Finally, we design a heterogeneous graph representation learn model based on Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) to predict circRNA-disease associations. Experiments have shown that the proposed method perform better than existing state-of-the-art methods and can be an effective tool to predict potential disease-related circRNAs.",

            "title": "Hypergraph-based Gene Ontology Embedding for Disease Gene Prediction",
            "abstract": "Disease gene identification has provided valuable insights into illuminating the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases. And it has been shown that novel drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in clinical trials. In recent years, multiple graph machine learning-based methods for this purpose have been proposed. However, those methods were mainly based on various well-established biological molecular networks, while seldomly considering the curated biological annotations of genes. To fill this gap, we aim to integrate the gene ontology annotations (GOA), including the biological process (BP), the cellular component (CC), and the molecular function (MF), into the process of disease gene prediction. Our method treated the GOA as a hypergraph and used the hypergraph-based embedding technique to extract the deep features underlying gene annotations. Besides, we also extracted gene features from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using graph representation learning methods. The convolutional neural network (CNN) framework was followed to fuse the features extracted from the two networks and make the final prediction. Experiments on a range of diseases have demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of our method. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) reached 0.85 and 0.79, respectively. Besides, the hypergraph-based gene ontology embedding can be generalized to other bioinformatics applications.",

            "abstract": "The joint problem of imbalance samples and noisy labels challenges the current text classifiers in real-world applications. Existing approaches are mostly devoted to handling either former or latter while fail to manage the fused issue. This paper introduces a novel weakly-supervised framework, dubbed WeSt-coin, to take into account the sensitivity cost on misclassifications between classes and seek seed words towards noisy-label corrections. After BERT that creates a contextualized corpus, WeStcoin learns a predicted label vector from the contextualized samples and meanwhile calculates a pseudo probability vector from seed words, and then projects the concatenated representation into an output space, followed by multiplying by a cost-sensitive matrix. WeStcoin is ultimately trained to decrease the residual between the model outputs and the noisy labels, where seed words are also updated in an iterative manner. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two public text datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model in the text classification with imbalance samples and noisy labels.
