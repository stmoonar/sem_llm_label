            "title": "Purity-Preserving Kernel Tensor Low-Rank Learning for Robust Subspace Clustering",
            "abstract": "In recent years, multi-kernel learning (MKL) methods have been widely used in performing nonlinear data subspace clustering tasks, benefiting from the fact that they do not require the selection and tuning of predefined kernels. However, the effect of raw noise on the data structure in the feature space has been neglected in most MKL studies so far. In this paper, we propose a robust subspace clustering method called purity kernel tensor low-rank learning (KTLL), which effectively isolates noise transfer from the original data space to the high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, we construct the kernel pool obtained by MKL as a primitive third-order kernel tensor, separate the corrupted information in the feature space, and use the separated pure kernel tensor to learn the optimal affinity matrix. The tensor learning of the kernel pool can effectively mine the higher-order correlations among different kernel matrices, thus improving the clustering performance of KTLL.We have conducted extensive experiments to compare KTLL with state-of-the-art MKL and deep subspace clustering algorithms, and our results demonstrate the superiority of KTLL.",

            "abstract": "The ability of anchor strategy based multi-view subspace clustering methods for effectively tackling large-scale data has led to its widespread attention in the research community. However, most of the existing algorithms usually focus on the problem of reducing complexity, and neglect to explore complementary information in the clustering process. Therefore, we propose a large-scale multi-view clustering method with anchor strategy and tensor collaborative learning (ASTCL). Specifically, we learn both consensus anchor and each view\u2019s anchor graph directly from the original data to make the learned anchors more representative. Then, we design a new structure of tensor low-rank norm to probe higher-order associations between anchor graphs. At the same time, in an attempt optimize the local structure of the tensor, symmetric constraints are applied to the front slice of the tensor. Finally, the experimental results conducted on datasets of varying scales validate that the methods outlined are relatively valid in terms of improving clustering performance.",

            "abstract": "Previous natural image segmentation algorithms through subspace learning method have over-segmentation issues in the pre-segmentation process, which will compromise the edge information, and the subspace learning model cannot effectively utilize the nonlinear structure in the image data and has weak resistance to multiple noises. To address these problems, a multi-kernel subspace learning method based on weight truncated Schatten-p norm for image segmentation is designed in this paper. First, the original natural image pre-processing operation, which is conducting adaptive morphological reconstruction watershed transformation on the image, then the original pixels are aggregated to form a superpixel image, of which the obtained superpixel block would retain more comprehensive local information; Secondly, perform feature extraction for each superpixel block, and stack the obtained feature vectors into the desired feature matrix; Then, it is input into the weighted truncated Schatten-p low-rank multi-kernel subspace learning model to obtain a similarity matrix with cluster structure on the diagonal; Finally, the similarity matrix is used as the adjacency matrix in the spectral clustering model, and the final feature data clustering and image segmentation results are obtained by the optimization solution. The final experimental results demonstrate that contrasts to existing clustering models, the proposed method accomplishes the best clustering property on two public datasets; Compared with seven segmentation algorithms on the BSDS500 dataset, and achieved the best segmentation effect on two evaluation metrics.",
