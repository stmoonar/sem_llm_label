            "abstract": "Differentially-Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) established itself as the most prominent technique for training neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. Almost a decade after its introduction, DP-SGD has become the de-facto standard for privacy-preserving learning from large datasets with individual records. However, important research and engineering issues remain open to more accurate and ef\ufb01cient solutions. Existing approaches either require large amounts of privacy budget to train accurately, and incur high overheads in terms of computational and memory resources consumption. In this article, we provide a critical review of some of the most prominent DP-SGD approaches, and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. Speci\ufb01cally, we look at several adaptive approaches that attempt to improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off during learning, by dynamically adjusting parameters such as clipping threshold, learning rate or budget allocation. We also provide an overview of important data management aspects in DP-SGD, which in\ufb02uence signi\ufb01cantly its computational and memory overhead. Finally, we review a novel approach to support heterogeneous privacy requirements, i.e., individualized privacy settings.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Bilinear maps are used as an essential cryptographic building block in many of the advanced encryption algorithms today, such as searchable encryption, identity-based encryption, group signatures, etc. Numerous data and application privacy techniques make use of such primitives. However, the performance overhead of bilinear map encryption, and in particular that of the \\em pairing operation, which is the predominant operation on bilinear maps, is still quite high. In this paper, we investigate in-depth the sequence of steps required to compute bilinear map pairings, and we identify the performance footprint of each step. We devise an implementation based on FPGA which reduces the overhead of bilinear pairings, in terms of both execution time and resource utilization (i.e., lookup tables and flip-flop units required). Our extensive performance evaluation shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmarks, and represents an important step towards the wide-scale deployment of bilinear map-based encryption protocol for large-scale applications.",
