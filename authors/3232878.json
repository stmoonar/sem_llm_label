            "abstract": "Complex network analysis is a fundamental tool to understand non-trivial aspects of graphs and networks and is widely used in many fields. In this paper, we apply complex network techniques to study port networks, in which nodes are ports and edges are maritime lines between ports. In particular, we study the temporal evolution of several topological features of a network of ports, including connected components, shortest paths, and clustering coefficients. We built the network with three years of Automatic Identification System data from 2017 to 2019. We highlight several interesting trends and behaviors that differentiate long-range vessels from short-range vessels",

            "abstract": "Corrosion identification and repair is a vital task in aircraft maintenance to ensure continued structural integrity. Regarding fuselage lap joints, typically, visual inspections are followed by non-destructive methodologies, which are time-consuming. The visual inspection of large areas suffers not only from subjectivity but also from the variable probability of corrosion detection, which is aggravated by the multiple layers used in fuselage construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatic image-based corrosion detection of aircraft structures using deep neural networks. For machine learning, we use a dataset that consists of D-Sight Aircraft Inspection System (DAIS) images from different lap joints of Boeing and Airbus aircrafts. We also employ transfer learning to overcome the shortage of aircraft corrosion images. With precision of over 93%, we demonstrate that our approach detects corrosion with a precision comparable to that of trained operators, aiding to reduce the uncertainties related to operator fatigue or inadequate training. Our results indicate that our methodology can support specialists and engineers in corrosion monitoring in the aerospace industry, potentially contributing to the automation of condition-based maintenance protocols.",

            "abstract": "Maritime autonomous transportation has played a crucial role in the globalization of the world economy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to automatic path planning to simulate vessel collision avoidance situations in open seas. End-to-end approaches that learn complex mappings directly from the input have poor generalization to reach the targets in different environments. In this work, we present a new strategy called state-action rotation to improve agent's performance in unseen situations by rotating the obtained experience (state-action-state) and preserving them in the replay buffer. We designed our model based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, local view maker, and planner. Our agent uses two deep Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the policy and action-value functions. The proposed model was exhaustively trained and tested in maritime scenarios with real maps from cities such as Montreal and Halifax. Experimental results show that the state-action rotation on top of the CVN consistently improves the rate of arrival to a destination (RATD) by up 11.96% with respect to the Vessel Navigator with Planner and Local View (VNPLV), as well as it achieves superior performance in unseen mappings by up 30.82%. Our proposed approach exhibits advantages in terms of robustness when tested in a new environment, supporting the idea that generalization can be achieved by using state-action rotation.",

            "title": "Pay Attention to Evolution: Time Series Forecasting With Deep Graph-Evolution Learning",
            "abstract": "Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in artificial intelligence. It has the power to bring light to problems in several areas of knowledge, such as epidemiological studies, healthcare inference, and climate change analysis. Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. An open gap in the literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. The existing applications consistently disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions, named after Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with tens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones. The results outperformed both statistical and ensemble-learning approaches, showing an improvement of 64.87 percent over the competing algorithms on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset of the renowned John Hopkins University for 188 countries simultaneously. For further validation, we tested our architecture in two other public datasets of different domains, the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012 and Brazilian Weather datasets. We also analyzed the Evolution Weights arising from the hidden layers of ReGENN to describe how the variables of the dataset interact with each other; and, as a result of looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, we concluded that time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.",

Currently, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the main line of investigation for the automated detection of this kind of disease. Most of the existing works, however, were designed based on transferlearning general-purpose architectures to the domain of skin lesions, posing inflexibility and high processing costs to the task. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture that benefits from cutting-edge CNNs techniques Aggregated Transformations combined to the mechanism of Squeeze-and-Excite organized in a residual block; our architecture is designed and trained from scratch having the melanoma problem as goal. Our results demonstrate that such an architecture is competitive to major state-of-the-art architectures adapted to the melanoma detection problem. Having a fraction of the number of weights of previous works, our architecture is prone to evolve and to provide low processing cost for real-world in situ applications.",

To evaluate if the embedded space reflects high-dimensional structures, measures are usually employed to return a quality score of the whole projection. In contrast to this idea, we evaluate the embedded layouts by assessing each class of the datasets at a time by using well-known quality measures. In addition, we propose assessing multidimensional projection techniques using ROC curves. Experimental results on two datasets show that our approach can be useful to discover how classes interact each other by using different visualization techniques and how close-related they are without thoroughly exploring the layouts. ROC curves proved to be a good measure for analyzing projection techniques and can give highly valuable feedback to users when exploring multidimensional data.",

The results show that, as the combination of sets of features and changes in parameters improves the quality of the visual representation, the accuracy of the classification for the computed features also improves.

            "abstract": "Classification is an important task for computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADs). However, many classifiers may not perform well, presenting poor generalization and high computational cost, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. Thus, feature selection can greatly mitigate these problems. In this paper, we propose two filter-based feature selection algorithms that calculate the simplified silhouette statistic as evaluation function: the silhouette-based greedy search (SiGS) and the silhouette-based genetic algorithm search (SiGAS). Silhouette statistic is used to guide the search for features that provide better class separability. Experiments performed on three datasets have shown that the SiGAS algorithm overcomes traditional filter algorithms, such as CFS, FCBF and reliefF. It also outperforms a similar algorithm, kNNGAS, based on genetic algorithm that minimizes the classification error of k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, results have shown that SiGAS produces better accuracy than SiGS.",
