            "abstract": "Human mobility data offers valuable insights for many applications such as urban planning and pandemic response, but its use also raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical and Multi-Resolution Network (HRNet), a novel deep generative model specifically designed to synthesize realistic human mobility data while guaranteeing differential privacy. We first identify the key difficulties inherent in learning human mobility data under differential privacy. In response to these challenges, HRNet integrates three components: a hierarchical location encoding mechanism, multi-task learning across multiple resolutions, and private pre-training. These elements collectively enhance the model's ability under the constraints of differential privacy. Through extensive comparative experiments utilizing a real-world dataset, HRNet demonstrates a marked improvement over existing methods in balancing the utility-privacy trade-off.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has demonstrated its effectiveness and has become the standard approach for tailoring language models to various tasks. Currently, community-based platforms offer easy access to various pre-trained models, as anyone can publish without strict validation processes. However, a released pre-trained model can be a privacy trap for fine-tuning datasets if it is carefully designed. In this work, we propose PreCurious framework to reveal the new attack surface where the attacker releases the pre-trained model and gets a black-box access to the final fine-tuned model. PreCurious aims to escalate the general privacy risk of both membership inference and data extraction on the fine-tuning dataset. The key intuition behind PreCurious is to manipulate the memorization stage of the pre-trained model and guide fine-tuning with a seemingly legitimate configuration. While empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that parameter-efficient and differentially private fine-tuning techniques can defend against privacy attacks on a fine-tuned model, PreCurious demonstrates the possibility of breaking up this invulnerability in a stealthy manner compared to fine-tuning on a benign pre-trained model. While DP provides some mitigation for membership inference attack, by further leveraging a sanitized dataset, PreCurious demonstrates potential vulnerabilities for targeted data extraction even under differentially private tuning with a strict privacy budget e.g. $\\epsilon=0.05$. Thus, PreCurious raises warnings for users on the potential risks of downloading pre-trained models from unknown sources, relying solely on tutorials or common-sense defenses, and releasing sanitized datasets even after perfect scrubbing.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic magnified the profound repercussions of modern health crises on a global level. To effectively prepare for subsequent outbreaks, a focus on hyperlocal, real-time tracking of disease trajectories is crucial. At the heart of this strategy lies the fusion of real-time mobility data with epidemiological insights and social determinants. This synergy enables authoritative entities to make timely and informed decisions. However, the intricate process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing data among diverse stakeholders is fraught with privacy dilemmas, thereby impeding optimal data-driven preparedness strategies. To address this, privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) have risen to prominence as indispensable tools in bolstering pandemic readiness.
