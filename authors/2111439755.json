            "title": "Superlubricity-Based Electrostatic Microgenerators",
            "abstract": "Although electrostatic microgenerators (ESMGs) have promised for nearly two decades extensive applications in wireless, self-powered microscale devices and sensors for security, personal health systems, communication, infrastructure and environmental monitoring, commercialized ESMGs are still scarce, mainly due to very low current densities and short product life for most applications. Here we demonstrate that a combination of structural superlubricity, a state of nearly zero friction and wear between two contacted solid surfaces, and nanotechnology can endow ESMGs with superlong life and high performances such as transferred charge, current, and power (at least three orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional ESMGs). Among a few significant advantages of superlubricity-based ESMGs, two are particularly noticeable. First, they can be driven by much lower external loads than conventional ESMGs; second, they can be massively fabricated by using micro-machining processes. The quantitative relationships, experimental proof of concept, and optimization results reported in this Letter can guide future design and facilitate the commercialization of ESMGs.",

            "title": "Error Analysis and Modeling for an Absolute Capacitive Displacement Measuring System with High Accuracy and Long Range",
            "abstract": "We proposed a novel kind of absolute capacitive grating displacement measuring system with both high accuracy and long range in a previous article. The measuring system includes both a MOVER and a STATOR, the contact surfaces of which are coated by a thin layer of dielectric film with a low friction coefficient and high hardness. The measuring system works in contact mode to minimize the gap changes. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the influence of some factors, including fabrication errors, installation errors, and environment disturbance, on measurement signals. The measuring signal model was modified according to the analysis. The signal processing methods were investigated to improve the signal sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The displacement calculation model shows that the design of orthogonal signals can solve the dead-zone problem. Absolute displacement was obtained by a simple method using two coarse signals and highly accurate displacement was further obtained while using two fine signals with the help of absolute information. According to the displacement calculation model and error analysis, the error in fine calculation functions mainly determines the model\u2019s accuracy and is locally affected by coarse calculation functions. It was also determined that amplitude differences, non-orthogonality, and signal offsets are not related to the accuracy of the displacement calculation model. The experiments were carried out to confirm the abovementioned theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that the displacement resolution and error in the displacement calculation model reach \u00b14.8 nm and \u00b134 nm, respectively, in the displacement range of 5 mm. The experiments and the theoretical analyses both indicate that our proposed measuring system has great potential for achieving an accuracy of tens of nanometers and a range of hundreds of millimeters.",

            "abstract": "Structural superlubricity (SSL) is a state of nearly zero friction and zero wear between two directly contacted solid surfaces. Recently, SSL was achieved in mesoscale and thus opened the SSL technology which promises great applications in Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS), sensors, storage technologies, etc. However, load issues in current mesoscale SSL studies are still not clear. The great challenge is to simultaneously measure both the ultralow shear forces and the much larger normal forces, although the widely used frictional force microscopes (FFM) and micro tribometers can satisfy the shear forces and normal forces requirements, respectively. Here we propose a hybrid two-axis force sensor that can well fill the blank between the capabilities of FFM and micro tribometers for the mesoscopic SSL studies. The proposed sensor can afford 1mN normal load with 10 nN lateral resolution. Moreover, the probe of the sensor is designed at the edge of the structure for the convenience of real-time optical observation. Calibrations and preliminary experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the design.",

            "abstract": "Nanogenerators promise self-powered sensors and devices for extensive applications in internet of things, sensor networks, big data, personal healthcare systems, artificial intelligence, et al. However, low electric current densities and short product lifespans have blocked nanogenerators' applications. Here we show that structural superlubricity, a state of nearly zero friction and wear between two contacted solid surfaces, provides a revolutionary solution to the above challenge. We investigate three types of superlubric nanogenerators (SLNGs), namely the capacitor-based, triboelectric, and electret-based SLNGs, and systematically analyze the influences of material and structural parameters to these SLNGs' performances. We demonstrate that SLNGs can achieve not only enduring lifespans, but also superb performances - three orders of magnitude in current densities and output powers higher than those of conventional nanogenerators. Furthermore, SLNGs can be driven by very weak external loads (down to ~1 ${\\mu}$N) in very low frequencies (down to ~1 ${\\mu}$Hz), and are thus capable to harvest electric energies from an extremely board spectrum of environments and biosystems. Among the three types of SLNGs, the capacitor-based is synthetically most competitive in the senses of performance, fabrication and maintaining. These results can guide designs and accelerate fabrications of SLNGs toward real applications.",

            "abstract": "This paper conducts an investigation on the operating cycle of Bus No. 306, which is equipped with wireless charging system, in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. The wireless charging system and electric buses are manufactured by ZTE Corporation (Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation) and BYD Company Limited, respectively. In this paper, the operating cycle is quantified and modeled based on experimental data. The real-time bus route and SOC (state of charge) during daytime operation are recorded with the help of GPS (global position system) and BMS (battery management system). The wireless charging process is tested with a power analyzer and its charging efficiency is compared with a plug-in system. Besides, the radiation level while charging is also taken into consideration. Currently, the buses are designed to operate in daytime and get charged at night. In order to explore the battery downsizing potential, plug-in buses, wireless charging buses with fixed and free departure schedule are simulated and compared. As a result, extra charging opportunities are introduced to daily operation so that the rated battery capacity can be reduced by more than 70%.
