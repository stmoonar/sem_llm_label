            "abstract": "Current approaches for service composition (assemblies of atomic services) require developers to use: (a) domain-specific semantics to formalize services that restrict the vocabulary for their descriptions, and (b) translation mechanisms for service retrieval to convert unstructured user requests to strongly-typed semantic representations. In our work, we claim that the effort to developing service descriptions, request translations, and service matching could be reduced using unrestricted natural language; allowing both: (1) end-users to intuitively express their needs using natural language, and (2) service developers to develop services without relying on syntactic/semantic description languages. Although there are some natural language-based service composition approaches, they restrict service retrieval to syntactic/semantic matching. With recent developments in Machine learning and Natural Language Processing, we motivate the use of Sentence Embeddings by leveraging richer semantic representations of sentences for service description, matching and retrieval. Experimental results show that service composition development effort may be reduced by more than 36% while keeping a high precision/recall when matching high-level user requests with low-level service method invocations.",

            "title": "Financial Portfolio Optimization: Computationally guided agents to investigate, analyse and invest!?",
            "abstract": "Financial portfolio optimization is a widely studied problem in mathematics, statistics, financial and computational literature. It adheres to determining an optimal combination of weights associated with financial assets held in a portfolio. In practice, it faces challenges by virtue of varying math. formulations, parameters, business constraints and complex financial instruments. Empirical nature of data is no longer one-sided; thereby reflecting upside and downside trends with repeated yet unidentifiable cyclic behaviours potentially caused due to high frequency volatile movements in asset trades. Portfolio optimization under such circumstances is theoretically and computationally challenging. This work presents a novel mechanism to reach an optimal solution by encoding a variety of optimal solutions in a solution bank to guide the search process for the global investment objective formulation. It conceptualizes the role of individual solver agents that contribute optimal solutions to a bank of solutions, a super-agent solver that learns from the solution bank, and, thus reflects a knowledge-based computationally guided agents approach to investigate, analyse and reach to optimal solution for informed investment decisions. Conceptual understanding of classes of solver agents that represent varying problem formulations and, mathematically oriented deterministic solvers along with stochastic-search driven evolutionary and swarm-intelligence based techniques for optimal weights are discussed. Algorithmic implementation is presented by an enhanced neighbourhood generation mechanism in Simulated Annealing algorithm. A framework for inclusion of heuristic knowledge and human expertise from financial literature related to investment decision making process is reflected via introduction of controlled perturbation strategies using a decision matrix for neighbourhood generation.",

            "abstract": "World Wide Web is hosting huge information regarding lots of areas and education is not an exception. Given the huge amount of data, searching for any educational resource manually is very difficult. To overcome this, an intelligent repository of educational resources that helps to decide among the available resources is needed. This paper discusses an attempt to build such repository. This will help users to decide among the available solutions for their needs by providing a comparative analysis among the solutions. The user will also be provided with user experience of the solutions. As the content over the web changes regularly and also new resources get added to the web, the repository will be updated dynamically. And all these tasks are done automatically as far as possible. This work uses crawling, classification, and information extraction techniques for the task of identifying the softwares/tools for education from the web. Our implementation focuses on the free open source softwares (FOSS) for education domain. The final framework of this system would be generic so that it can be extended to any other domain.",
