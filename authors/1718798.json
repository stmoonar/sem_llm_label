            "abstract": "Every day millions of people use online products and services to satisfy their information needs. While doing so, they produce large volumes of user-generated content (UGC). In this talk, we will distinguish between \"explicit\" UGC, which is intended to be made public (such as product ratings or reviews), and \"implicit\" UGC, which can be responsibly anonymized and aggregated in a privacy-preserving way to improve public health. We will analyze implicit UGC as a positive consumption externality, and will discuss its beneficial uses across a range of public health applications. The bulk of this talk will focus on methods for aggregating and analyzing the data to provide timely signals that help guide public health interventions and assess their efficacy. We will discuss applications such as estimating disease incidence, outbreak prediction, mitigating pandemic spread, and improving public health messaging.",

            "abstract": "With the devastating outbreak of COVID-19, vaccines are one of the crucial lines of defense against mass infection in this global pandemic. Given the protection they provide, vaccines are becoming mandatory in certain social and professional settings. This paper presents a classification model for detecting COVID-19 vaccination related search queries, a machine learning model that is used to generate search insights for COVID-19 vaccinations. The proposed method combines and leverages advancements from modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) natural language understanding (NLU) techniques such as pretrained Transformers with traditional dense features. We propose a novel approach of considering dense features as memory tokens that the model can attend to. We show that this new modeling approach enables a significant improvement to the Vaccine Search Insights (VSI) task, improving a strong well-established gradient-boosting baseline by relative +15% improvement in F1 score and +14% in precision.",

            "abstract": "Despite ample supply of COVID-19 vaccines, the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals remains suboptimal across much of the US. Rapid vaccination of additional people will prevent new infections among both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated, thus saving lives. With the rapid rollout of vaccination efforts this year, the internet has become a dominant source of information about COVID-19 vaccines, their safety and efficacy, and their availability. We sought to evaluate whether trends in internet searches related to COVID-19 vaccination - as reflected by Google's Vaccine Search Insights (VSI) index - could be used as a marker of population-level interest in receiving a vaccination. We found that between January and August of 2021: 1) Google's weekly VSI index was associated with the number of new vaccinations administered in the subsequent three weeks, and 2) the average VSI index in earlier months was strongly correlated (up to r = 0.89) with vaccination rates many months later. Given these results, we illustrate an approach by which data on search interest may be combined with other available data to inform local public health outreach and vaccination efforts. These results suggest that the VSI index may be useful as a leading indicator of population-level interest in or intent to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, especially early in the vaccine deployment efforts. These results may be relevant to current efforts to administer COVID-19 vaccines to unvaccinated individuals, to newly eligible children, and to those eligible to receive a booster shot. More broadly, these results highlight the opportunities for anonymized and aggregated internet search data, available in near real-time, to inform the response to public health emergencies.",

Our anonymization process is designed to ensure that no personal data, including an individual's location, movement, or contacts, can be derived from the resulting metrics. \nThe high-level description of the procedure is as follows: we first generate a set of anonymized metrics from the data of Google users who opted in to Location History. Then, we compute percentage changes of these metrics from a baseline based on the historical part of the anonymized metrics. We then discard a subset which does not meet our bar for statistical reliability, and release the rest publicly in a format that compares the result to the private baseline.",

            "abstract": "This document describes the aggregation and anonymization process applied to the initial version of Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (published at this http URL on April 2, 2020), a publicly available resource intended to help public health authorities understand what has changed in response to work-from-home, shelter-in-place, and other recommended policies aimed at flattening the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our anonymization process is designed to ensure that no personal data, including an individual's location, movement, or contacts, can be derived from the resulting metrics. \nThe high-level description of the procedure is as follows: we first generate a set of anonymized metrics from the data of Google users who opted in to Location History. Then, we compute percentage changes of these metrics from a baseline based on the historical part of the anonymized metrics. We then discard a subset which does not meet our bar for statistical reliability, and release the rest publicly in a format that compares the result to the private baseline.",

            "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the BIG Web Track of the Web Conference 2018. Many of today's most successful enterprises in business and in science are built on the collection and analysis of data. The sheer volume and richness of these data sets has stimulated a massive wave of innovation. In addition, this revolution has also sparked important debate on data privacy policies, ethics, and governance. This track started as a co-located event called BigData Innovators Gathering (BIG) with a vision to bring together academic and industry leaders in the Big Data space to share the state of the art and its successful applications in business. This event will be co-located with the Web conference for the fifth time, but now as a fully fledged alternate track named The BIG Web in The Web Conference 2018 in Lyon. This year's track consists of two keynotes, a panel on machine learning in the field of medicine, and 11 invited talks. In addition, we have accepted 6 papers from 35 submissions (with an acceptance ratio of 17%).",
