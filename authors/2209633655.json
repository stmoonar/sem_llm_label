We start by reviewing the research background of UBM, paving the way to a clearer understanding of the opportunities and challenges. Then, we present a systematic categorization of existing UBM research works, which can be categorized into four different directions including Conventional UBM, Long-Sequence UBM, Multi-Type UBM, and UBM with Side Information. To provide an expansive understanding, we delve into each category, discussing representative models while highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we elucidate on the industrial applications of UBM methods, aiming to provide insights into the practical value of existing UBM solutions. Finally, we identify some open challenges and future prospects in UBM.

            "abstract": "The sequential recommendation system has been widely studied for its promising effectiveness in capturing dynamic preferences buried in users' sequential behaviors. Despite the considerable achievements, existing methods usually focus on intra-sequence modeling while overlooking exploiting global collaborative information by inter-sequence modeling, resulting in inferior recommendation performance. Therefore, previous works attempt to tackle this problem with a global collaborative item graph constructed by pre-defined rules. However, these methods neglect two crucial properties when capturing global collaborative information, i.e., adaptiveness and personalization, yielding sub-optimal user representations. To this end, we propose a graph-driven framework, named Adaptive and Personalized Graph Learning for Sequential Recommendation (APGL4SR), that incorporates adaptive and personalized global collaborative information into sequential recommendation systems. Specifically, we first learn an adaptive global graph among all items and capture global collaborative information with it in a self-supervised fashion, whose computational burden can be further alleviated by the proposed SVD-based accelerator. Furthermore, based on the graph, we propose to extract and utilize personalized item correlations in the form of relative positional encoding, which is a highly compatible manner of personalizing the utilization of global collaborative information. Finally, the entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm, thus each part of APGL4SR can be mutually reinforced. As a generic framework, APGL4SR can not only outperform other baselines with significant margins, but also exhibit promising versatility, the ability to learn a meaningful global collaborative graph, and the ability to alleviate the dimensional collapse issue of item embeddings.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become increasingly important in our daily lives since they play an important role in mitigating the information overload problem, especially in many user-oriented online services. Recommender systems aim to identify a set of items that best match users' explicit or implicit preferences, by utilizing the user and item interactions to improve the accuracy. With the fast advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the past few decades, recommendation techniques have achieved promising performance. However, we still meet three inherent challenges to design deep recommender systems (DRS): 1) the majority of existing DRS are developed based on hand-crafted components, which requires ample expert knowledge recommender systems; 2) human error and bias can lead to suboptimal components, which reduces the recommendation effectiveness; 3) non-trivial time and engineering efforts are usually required to design the task-specific components in different recommendation scenarios. In this tutorial, we aim to give a comprehensive survey on the recent progress of advanced Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques for solving the above problems in deep recommender systems. More specifically, we will present feature selection, feature embedding search, feature interaction search, and whole DRS pipeline model training and comprehensive search for deep recommender systems. In this way, we expect academic researchers and industrial practitioners in related fields can get deep understanding and accurate insight into the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of technologies in recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Interactive recommender systems have attracted increasingly research attentions from both academia and industry. This workshop is a half-day event, which provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss recent research progress and novel research directions about interactive recommender systems. The program will include two keynotes and 6 to 8 research paper presentations. The objective of this workshop is to consolidate the recent technical progresses about interactive recommendation, which will be a promising research and development direction for future recommendation technologies. This workshop will attract the attention of researchers from both academia and industry. It aligns with WSDM's spirit of promoting the collaborations between academia and industry.",

            "abstract": "CTR prediction is critical to industrial recommender systems. Recently, with the growth of business domains in enterprises, much attention has been focused on the multi-domain CTR recommendation. Numerous models have been proposed that attempt to use a unified model to serve multiple domains. Although much progress has been made, we argue that they ignore the importance of feature interactions and user behaviors when modeling cross-domain relations, which is a coarse-grained utilizing of domain information. To solve this problem, we propose Domain Facilitated Feature Modeling (DFFM) for CTR prediction. It incorporates domain-related information into the parameters of the feature interaction and user behavior modules, allowing for domain-specific learning of these two aspects. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of DFFM. We deploy the DFFM model in Huawei advertising platform and gain a 4.13% improvement of revenue on a two week online A/B test. Currently DFFM model has been used as the main traffic model, serving for hundreds of millions of people.",
