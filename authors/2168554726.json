            "abstract": "Recently, sparse arrays have received considerable attention owing to their capability of achieving increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) by exploiting the virtual sensors resulting from their difference or sum-difference coarrays. Mutual coupling is another factor that attracts interest to these kinds of arrays. In this paper, both the fundamental criteria of high DoFs and reduced mutual coupling are considered in the design of the proposed array configuration for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of non-circular signals. Simulation results are provided to verify the robustness of the proposed array against heavy mutual coupling.",

            "title": "New Array Designs for DoA Estimation of Non-Circular Signals With Reduced Mutual Coupling",
            "abstract": "Recently, many sparse arrays are proposed to achieve increased uniform degrees of freedom (uDoFs) for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of non-circular sources. In light of this recent attention, the high number of uDoFs is the primary motivation for designing those sparse array structures. Although both the number of uDoF and mutual coupling can influence the DoA estimation performance. However, mutual coupling is not considered in many of those sparse array configurations. In this article, two optimized shifted coprime arrays with sum-difference coarrays, called OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II, are proposed to reduce mutual coupling. The OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II are obtained by rearranging actual sensors of the augmented coprime array. The proposed array designs have closed-form expressions for their sensor locations and achievable uDoFs. Additionally, it is proven that the first three weights of OSCAwSDCa-II are independent of the array size. Moreover, the number of virtual sensors co-locating at the same lag is reduced. Consequently, smaller weight values are obtained, resulting in more robustness against mutual coupling. Finally, extensive simulations show that OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II can achieve comparable uDoFs concerning the existing array structures. In the presence of strong mutual coupling, simulation results demonstrate the robustness of OSCAwSDCa-II more than other compared configurations.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a new type of coprime-array-based structure, named AtCADiS, is proposed to achieve increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) and reduced mutual coupling. The closed-form expressions for the sensor positions and the number of uniform DoFs (uDoFs) of AtCADiS are provided. Specifically, AtCADiS is constructed via two steps. First, we shift the leftmost sensor of tailored coprime array with displaced subarrays (tCADiS) to the right by N. Second, we increase the number of sensors of tCADiS by $\\left\\lfloor {\\frac{M}{2}} \\right\\rfloor $ that are appropriately placed to connect the positive and negative lags of difference coarray of tCADiS and further improved its uDoFs remarkably. Finally, simulations show that AtCADiS can achieve higher number of uDoFs than the existing coprime-array-based structures by using the same number of physical sensors, which leads to stronger resolution capability and higher direction of arrival (DoA) estimation accuracy. In the presence of mutual coupling, AtCADiS can achieve comparable mutual coupling leakage compared with the existing array structures.",
