            "title": "Insightful Dimensionality Reduction with Very Low Rank Variable Subsets",
            "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction techniques can be employed to produce robust, cost-effective predictive models, and to enhance interpretability in exploratory data analysis. However, the models produced by many of these methods are formulated in terms of abstract factors or are too high-dimensional to facilitate insight and fit within low computational budgets. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to interpretable dimensionality reduction. Given a data matrix, we study the following question: are there subsets of variables that can be primarily explained by a single factor? We formulate this challenge as the problem of finding submatrices close to rank one. Despite its potential, this topic has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature, and there exist virtually no algorithms for this purpose that are simultaneously effective, efficient and scalable. We formalize the task as two problems which we characterize in terms of computational complexity, and propose efficient, scalable algorithms with approximation guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate how our approach can produce insightful findings in data, and show our algorithms to be superior to strong baselines.",

            "title": "The Role of In-Group Bias and Balanced Data: A Comparison of Human and Machine Recidivism Risk Predictions",
            "abstract": "Fairness and bias in automated decision-making gain importance as the prevalence of algorithms increases in different areas of social life. This paper contributes to the discussion of algorithmic fairness with a crowdsourced vignette survey on recidivism risk assessment, which we compare to previous studies on this topic and to predictions of an automated recidivism risk tool. We use the case of the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) and the Broward County dataset of pre-trial defendants as a data source and for purposes of comparability with the earlier analysis. In our survey, each respondent assessed recidivism risk for a set of vignettes describing real defendants, where each set was balanced with regard to the defendants' race and re-offender status. The survey ensured a 50: 50 ratio of black and white respondents. We found that predictions in our survey---while less accurate---were considerably more fair in terms of equalized odds than previous surveys. We attribute it to the differences in survey design: using the balanced set of vignettes and not providing feedback after responding to each vignette. We also analyzed the performance and fairness of predictions by race of respondent and defendant. We found that both white and black respondents tend to favor defendants of their own race, but the magnitude of the effect is relatively small. In addition to the survey, we train two statistical models, one trained with balanced data and other with unbalanced data. We observe that the model trained on balanced data is substantially more fair and possess less in-group bias.",

            "abstract": "In the Harmonization Project we use data from 22 cross-national survey projects that cover a total of 142 countries or territories over a time span of almost 50 years (1966\u20132013). The large volume of the data, their multilevel structure as well as the large number of source files encouraged us to develop a set of custom tools for extracting, transforming, and loading data into a common database that allows for efficient automation of repeatable and otherwise manual routines. We created an environment based on freeware and open-source software that constitutes an alternative to statistical packages typically used for such purposes in social science research. This platform allows us to store and manage data in a single place, and\u2014what is crucial\u2014enables us to easily manipulate data in order to prepare the harmonized data set for use in substantive analyses. This article presents our motivation for choosing a custom programming and database environment, describes the principles guiding our software choices, and outlines the stages of data processing.",
