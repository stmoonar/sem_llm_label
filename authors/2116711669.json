            "title": "Task Assignment With Efficient Federated Preference Learning in Spatial Crowdsourcing",
            "abstract": "Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is finding widespread application in today's online world. As we have transitioned from desktop crowdsourcing applications (e.g., Wikipedia) to SC applications (e.g., Uber), there is a sense that SC systems must not only provide effective task assignment but also need to ensure privacy. To achieve these often-conflicting objectives, we propose a framework, Task Assignment with Federated Preference Learning, that performs task assignment based on worker preferences while keeping the data decentralized and private in each platform center (e.g., each delivery center of an SC company). The framework includes a federated preference learning phase and a task assignment phase. Specifically, in the first phase, we build a local preference model for each platform center based on historical data. We provide means of horizontal federated learning that makes it possible to collaboratively train these local preference models under the orchestration of a central server. Specifically, we provide a practical method that accelerates federated preference learning based on stochastic controlled averaging and achieves low communication costs while considering data heterogeneity among clients. The task assignment phase aims to achieve effective and efficient task assignment by considering workers\u2019 preferences. Extensive evaluations on real data offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the paper's proposals.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scenario recommender systems (MSRSs) have been increasingly used in real-world industrial platforms for their excellent advantages in mitigating data sparsity and reducing maintenance costs. However, conventional MSRSs usually use all relevant features indiscriminately and ignore that different kinds of features have varying importance under different scenarios, which may cause confusion and performance degradation. In addition, existing feature selection methods for deep recommender systems may lack the exploration of scenario relations. In this paper, we propose a novel automated multi-scenario feature selection (MultiFS) framework to bridge this gap, which is able to consider scenario relations and utilize a hierarchical gating mechanism to select features for each scenario. Specifically, MultiFS first efficiently obtains feature importance across all the scenarios through a scenario-shared gate. Then, some scenario-specific gate aims to identify feature importance to individual scenarios from a subset of the former with lower importance. Subsequently, MultiFS imposes constraints on the two gates to make the learning mechanism more feasible and combines the two to select exclusive features for different scenarios. We evaluate MultiFS and demonstrate its ability to enhance the multi-scenario model performance through experiments over two public multi-scenario benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of various commercial scenarios, there is an increasing number of studies on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) which trains the recommender system with the data from multiple scenarios, aiming to improve the recommendation performance on all these scenarios synchronously. However, due to the large discrepancy in the number of interactions among domains, multi-scenario recommendation models usually suffer from insufficient learning and negative transfer especially on the cold-start scenarios, thus exacerbating the data sparsity issue. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a novel diffusion model enhanced paradigm tailored for the cold-start problem in multi-scenario recommendation in a data-driven generative manner. Specifically, based on all-domain data, we leverage the diffusion model with our newly designed variance schedule and the proposed classifier, which explicitly boosts the recommendation performance on the cold-start scenarios by exploiting the generated high-quality and informative embedding, leveraging the abundance of rich scenarios. Our experiments on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate two strengths of the proposed paradigm: (i) its effectiveness with a significant increase of 8.5% and 1% in accuracy on the two datasets, and (ii) its compatibility with various multi-scenario backbone models. The implementation code is available for easy reproduction.",

            "title": "Denoising and Prompt-Tuning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In practical recommendation scenarios, users often interact with items under multi-typed behaviors (e.g., click, add-to-cart, and purchase). Traditional collaborative filtering techniques typically assume that users only have a single type of behavior with items, making it insufficient to utilize complex collaborative signals to learn informative representations and infer actual user preferences. Consequently, some pioneer studies explore modeling multi-behavior heterogeneity to learn better representations and boost the performance of recommendations for a target behavior. However, a large number of auxiliary behaviors (i.e., click and add-to-cart) could introduce irrelevant information to recommenders, which could mislead the target behavior (i.e., purchase) recommendation, rendering two critical challenges: (i) denoising auxiliary behaviors and (ii) bridging the semantic gap between auxiliary and target behaviors. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel framework\u2013Denoising and Prompt-Tuning (DPT) with a three-stage learning paradigm to solve the aforementioned challenges. In particular, DPT is equipped with a pattern-enhanced graph encoder in the first stage to learn complex patterns as prior knowledge in a data-driven manner to guide learning informative representation and pinpointing reliable noise for subsequent stages. Accordingly, we adopt different lightweight tuning approaches with effectiveness and efficiency in the following stages to further attenuate the influence of noise and alleviate the semantic gap among multi-typed behaviors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPT over a wide range of state-of-the-art methods.

            "abstract": "Self-attention models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommender systems by capturing the sequential dependencies among user\u2013item interactions. However, they rely on adding positional embeddings to the item sequence to retain the sequential information, which may break the semantics of item embeddings due to the heterogeneity between these two types of embeddings. In addition, most existing works assume that such dependencies exist solely in the item embeddings, but neglect their existence among the item features. In our previous study, we proposed a novel sequential recommendation model, i.e., MLP4Rec, based on the recent advances of MLP-Mixer architectures, which is naturally sensitive to the order of items in a sequence because matrix elements related to different positions of a sequence will be given different weights in training. We developed a tri-directional fusion scheme to coherently capture sequential, cross-channel, and cross-feature correlations with linear computational complexity as well as much fewer model parameters than existing self-attention methods. However, the cascading mixer structure, the large number of normalization layers between different mixer layers, and the noise generated by these operations limit the efficiency of information extraction and the effectiveness of MLP4Rec. In this extended version, we propose a novel framework \u2013 SMLP4Rec for sequential recommendation to address the aforementioned issues. The new framework changes the flawed cascading structure to a parallel mode, and integrates normalization layers to minimize their impact on the model\u2019s efficiency while maximizing their effectiveness. As a result, the training speed and prediction accuracy of SMLP4Rec are vastly improved in comparison to MLP4Rec. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, Multi-task Learning (MTL) has yielded immense success in Recommender System (RS) applications [40]. However, current MTL-based recommendation models tend to disregard the session-wise patterns of user-item interactions because they are predominantly constructed based on item-wise datasets. Moreover, balancing multiple objectives has always been a challenge in this field, which is typically avoided via linear estimations in existing works. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhanced MTL framework, namely RMTL, to combine the losses of different recommendation tasks using dynamic weights. To be specific, the RMTL structure can address the two aforementioned issues by (i) constructing an MTL environment from session-wise interactions and (ii) training multi-task actor-critic network structure, which is compatible with most existing MTL-based recommendation models, and (iii) optimizing and fine-tuning the MTL loss function using the weights generated by critic networks. Experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RMTL with a higher AUC against state-of-the-art MTL-based recommendation models. Additionally, we evaluate and validate RMTL\u2019s compatibility and transferability across various MTL models.",

            "title": "Mitigating Action Hysteresis in Traffic Signal Control with Traffic Predictive Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Traffic signal control plays a pivotal role in the management of urban traffic flow. With the rapid advancement of reinforcement learning, the development of signal control methods has seen a significant boost. However, a major challenge in implementing these methods is ensuring that signal lights do not change abruptly, as this can lead to traffic accidents. To mitigate this risk, a time-delay is introduced in the implementation of control actions, but usually has a negative impact on the overall efficacy of the control policy. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel Traffic Signal Control Framework (PRLight), which leverages an On-policy Traffic Control Model (OTCM) and an Online Traffic Prediction Model (OTPM) to achieve efficient and real-time control of traffic signals. The framework collects multi-source traffic information from a local-view graph in real-time and employs a novel fast attention mechanism to extract relevant traffic features. To be specific, OTCM utilizes the predicted traffic state as input, eliminating the need for communication with other agents and maximizing computational efficiency while ensuring that the most relevant information is used for signal control. The proposed framework was evaluated on both simulated and real-world road networks and compared to various state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing traffic congestion and accidents.",

            "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in sequential recommender systems (SRSs). However, computing the attention matrix in traditional dot-product attention mechanisms results in a quadratic complexity with sequence lengths, leading to high computational costs for long-term sequential recommendation. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel L2-Normalized Linear Attention for the Transformer-based Sequential Recommender Systems (LinRec), which theoretically improves efficiency while preserving the learning capabilities of the traditional dot-product attention. Specifically, by thoroughly examining the equivalence conditions of efficient attention mechanisms, we show that LinRec possesses linear complexity while preserving the property of attention mechanisms. In addition, we reveal its latent efficiency properties by interpreting the proposed LinRec mechanism through a statistical lens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two public benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the combination of LinRec and Transformer models achieves comparable or even superior performance than state-of-the-art Transformer-based SRS models while significantly improving time and memory efficiency. The implementation code is available online at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/LinRec.>",

            "title": "Towards Robust Knowledge Tracing Models via k-Sparse Attention",
            "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) is the problem of predicting students' future performance based on their historical interaction sequences. With the advanced capability of capturing contextual long-term dependency, attention mechanism becomes one of the essential components in many deep learning based KT (DLKT) models. In spite of the impressive performance achieved by these attentional DLKT models, many of them are often vulnerable to run the risk of overfitting, especially on small-scale educational datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we propose sparseKT, a simple yet effective framework to improve the robustness and generalization of the attention based DLKT approaches. Specifically, we incorporate a k-selection module to only pick items with the highest attention scores. We propose two sparsification heuristics: (1) soft-thresholding sparse attention and (2) top-K sparse attention. We show that our sparseKT is able to help attentional KT models get rid of irrelevant student interactions and improve the predictive performance when compared to 11 state-of-the-art KT models on three publicly available real-world educational datasets.
