            "abstract": "After the pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) powered support for mental health care has become increasingly important. The breadth and complexity of significant challenges required to provide adequate care involve:\n(a) Personalized patient understanding, (b) Safety-constrained and medically validated chatbot patient interactions, and (c) Support for continued feedback-based refinements in design using chatbot-patient interactions. \nWe propose Alleviate, a chatbot designed to assist patients suffering from mental health challenges with personalized care and assist clinicians with understanding their patients better. Alleviate draws from an array of publicly available clinically valid mental-health texts and databases, allowing Alleviate to make medically sound and informed decisions. In addition, Alleviate's modular design and explainable decision-making lends itself to robust and continued feedback-based refinements to its design. In this paper, we explain the different modules of Alleviate and submit a short video demonstrating Alleviate's capabilities to help patients and clinicians understand each other better to facilitate optimal care strategies.",

            "abstract": "Low self-esteem and interpersonal needs (i.e., thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB)) have a major impact on depression and suicide attempts. Individuals seek social connectedness on social media to boost and alleviate their loneliness. Social media platforms allow people to express their thoughts, experiences, beliefs, and emotions. Prior studies on mental health from social media have focused on symptoms, causes, and disorders. Whereas an initial screening of social media content for interpersonal risk factors and low self-esteem may raise early alerts and assign therapists to at-risk users of mental disturbance. Standardized scales measure self-esteem and interpersonal needs from questions created using psychological theories. In the current research, we introduce a psychology-grounded and expertly annotated dataset, LoST: Low Self esTeem, to study and detect low self-esteem on Reddit. Through an annotation approach involving checks on coherence, correctness, consistency, and reliability, we ensure gold-standard for supervised learning. We present results from different deep language models tested using two data augmentation techniques. Our findings suggest developing a class of language models that infuses psychological and clinical knowledge.",

With the arrival of automation and the help of Machine Learning (ML), models of complete or partial automation of HCM processes become more achievable.

In this paper, we present a stateless, scalable, micro-service based architecture to push towards automation through recommendation using Machine Learning and Statistical Methods. A recommendation system for candidates in finding jobs, and vice versa, is presented. A Profile Score is allotted to a candidate/job and used as the metric for ranking. We show solutions to engineering challenges for such systems, like evaluating the location, educational and professional background, and career interests.",

            "abstract": "In clinical NLP (Natural Language Processing), Knowledge extraction is a very important task to develop a highly accurate information retrieval system. The various approaches used to develop such systems include rule-based approach, statistical approach, shortest path algorithm or hybrid of these approaches. Accuracy and coverage are the most important parameters while comparing different approaches. Some methodologies have good accuracy but low coverage and vice-versa. In this paper, our focus is to extract domain relationships, for example to extract the relationship between \u2018Disease\u2019 and \u2018Procedure\u2019 or \u2018Symptom\u2019 and \u2018Disease\u2019 etc. from the clinical documents using three different approaches. These three approaches are i) Statistical ii) Shortest Path iii) Shortest Path Using Body System. All three approaches use our in-house existing NLP system to extract entities from the un-structured documents. The Statistical approach applies a probabilistic algorithm on clinical documents, whereas the Shortest Path algorithm uses the Ontological knowledge base for the hierarchical relationship between entities. This Ontological knowledge base is built upon the curated Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). For the Shortest Path Using Body System approach, we have used the domain relationship as well as hierarchical relationship. The output of these approaches is further validated by a domain expert and this validated relationship is used to enrich our ontological knowledge base. We have presented the details of these approaches one-by-one along with the comparative results of these approaches. We finally go through the analysis of the result and conclude on further work.",

            "abstract": "Efficient clinical information retrieval tasks like entity recognition, relation suggestions, summarization etc, require a comprehensive, extensive, unambiguous and well structured medical knowledge base. One of the largest Metathesaurus, UMLS (Unified Medical Language System), is a repository of biomedical dictionaries developed by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) and widely used in medical domain. UMLS Metathesaurus includes the dictionaries like SNOMED-CT, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) etc. As it has integrated data from different sources, it contains different kinds of ambiguity, which is problematic for all clinical information retrieval tasks that use it. In this paper, we describe our methodology of curating the UMLS metathesaurus to create a centralized knowledge base that can be used as a knowledge base for a variety of clinical NLP systems. We have also developed a process of updating the curated centralized knowledge base with a newer version of UMLS such that there is no need to repeat the whole process. We have also presented the comparative results of a Clinical Entity Recognition (CER) using our curated centralized knowledge base and original UMLS database.",

Automated Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) leverages the natural language processing (NLP) and contextual understanding of health record structure with additional business rules logic, helping CDI specialists identify critical documentation information that may be missing from the medical record. This results in more specific coding opportunity and better understanding of the clinical complexity for accurate reimbursement.
