            "abstract": "Over the past few years, consumer behavior has shifted from traditional in-store shopping to online shopping. For example, eCommerce sales have grown from around 5% of total US sales in 2012 to around 15.4% in year 2023. This rapid growth of eCommerce has created new challenges and vital new requirements for intelligent information retrieval systems. Which lead to the primary motivations of this workshop: (1) Since the pandemic hit, eCommerce became an important part of people's routine and they started using online shop- ping for smallest grocery items to big electronics as well as cars. With such a large assortment of products and millions of users, achieving higher scalability without losing accuracy is a leading concern for information retrieval systems for eCommerce. (2) The diverse buyers make the relevance of the results highly subjective, because relevance varies for different buyers. The most suitable and intuitive solution to this problem is to make the system interactive and provide correct relevance for different users. Hence, interactive information retrieval systems are becoming necessity in eCommerce. (3) To handle sudden change in buyers' behavior, industries adopted existing sub-optimal information retrieval techniques for various eCommerce tasks. Parallelly, they also started exploring/researching for better solutions and in dire need of help from research community. This workshop will provide a forum to discuss and learn the latest trends for interactive and scalable information retrieval approaches for eCommerce. It will provide academic and industrial researchers a platform to present their latest works, share research ideas, present and discuss various challenges, and identify the areas where further research is needed. It will foster the development of a strong research community focused on solving eCommerce-related information retrieval problems that provide superior eCommerce experience to all users.",

            "title": "Entity-aware Multi-task Learning for Query Understanding at Walmart",
            "abstract": "Query Understanding (QU) is a fundamental process in E-commerce search engines by extracting the shopping intents of customers. It usually includes a set of different tasks such as named entity recognization and query classification. Traditional approaches often tackle each task separately by its own network, which leads to excessive workload for development and maintenance as well as increased latency and resource usage in large-scale E-commerce platforms. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a multi-task learning approach to query understanding at Walmart. We experimented with several state-of-the-art multi-task learning architectures including MTDNN, MMoE, and PLE. Furthermore, we propose a novel large-scale entity-aware multi-task learning model (EAMT)1 by retrieving entities from engagement data as query context to augment the query representation. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior work on multi-task learning for E-commerce query understanding. Comprehensive offline experiments are conducted on industry-scale datasets (up to 965M queries) to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. The results from online experiments show substantial gains in key accuracy and latency metrics. https://github.com/zhiyuanpeng/KDD2023-EAMT",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems (RecSys) play important roles in helping users navigate, discover, and consume large and highly dynamic information. Today, many RecSys solutions deployed in the real world rely on categorical user-profiles and/or pre-calculated recommendation actions that stay static during a user session. However, recent trends suggest that RecSys need to model user intent in real time and constantly adapt to meet user needs at the moment or change user behavior in situ. There are three primary drivers for this emerging need of online adaptation. First, in order to meet the increasing demand for a better personalized experience, the personalization dimensions and space will grow larger and larger. It would not be feasible to pre-compute recommended actions for all personalization scenarios beyond a certain scale. Second, in many settings the system does not have user prior history to leverage. Estimating user intent in real time is the only feasible way to personalize. As various consumer privacy laws tighten, it is foreseeable that many businesses will reduce their reliance on static user profiles. Therefore, it makes the modeling of user intent in real time an important research topic.

            "abstract": "The name disambiguation task partitions a collection of records pertaining to a given name, such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the partitions and a group of people, all sharing that given name. Most existing solutions for this task are proposed for static data. However, more realistic scenarios stipulate emergence of records in a streaming fashion where records may belong to known as well as unknown persons all sharing the same name. This requires a flexible name disambiguation algorithm that can not only classify records of known persons represented in the training data by their existing records but can also identify records of new ambiguous persons with no existing records included in the initial training dataset. Toward achieving this objective, in this paper we present a non-parametric Bayesian framework that utilizes a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) as a core engine for online name disambiguation task. A Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling (SISR) technique, also known as particle filtering, is proposed for inference to simultaneously perform online classification and new class discovery. Specifically, for each online record, we approximate its class conditional posterior distribution by a set of particles and their weights, which are updated in a sequential manner without the need to re-access previously observed records. We also propose an interactive version of our online name disambiguation method, which improves the prediction accuracy by exploiting user feedback.",

The accuracy and reliability of the prediction mechanisms used for the estimation of software development effort is also important. A series of experiments are conducted to gradually progress towards the improved accurate estimation of the software development effort. However, while conducting these experiments, it was found that the size of the training set was not sufficient to train a large and complex artificial neural network (ANN). To overcome the problem of the size of the available training data set, a novel multilayered architecture based on a neural network model is proposed. The accuracy of the proposed multi-layered model is assessed using different criteria, which proves the pre-eminence of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Network embedding methodologies, which learn a distributed vector representation for each vertex in a network, have shown to achieve superior performance in many realworld applications, such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. However, the existing methods for network embedding are unable to generate representation vectors for unseen vertices; besides, these methods only utilize topological information from the network ignoring a rich set of nodal attributes, which is abundant in all real-life networks. In this paper, we present a novel network embedding approach called Neural-Brane, which overcomes both of the above limitations. For a given network, Neural-Brane extracts latent feature representation of its vertices using a designed neural network model that unifies network topological information and nodal attributes. Additionally, Neural-Brane is an inductive embedding approach, which enables generating embedding vectors for unseen future vertices of the attributed network. We evaluate the quality of vertex embedding produced by Neural-Brane by solving the node classification task on four realworld graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Neural-Brane over the state-of-the-art existing methods.",

            "abstract": "Counting and enumeration of local topological structures, such as triangles, is an important task for analyzing large real\u2010life networks. For instance, triangle count in a network is used to compute transitivity\u2014an important property for understanding graph evolution over time. Triangles are also used for various other tasks completed for real\u2010life networks, including community discovery, link prediction, and spam filtering. The task of triangle counting, though simple, has gained wide attention in recent years from the data mining community. This is due to the fact that most of the existing algorithms for counting triangles do not scale well to very large networks with millions (or even billions) of vertices. To circumvent this limitation, researchers proposed triangle counting methods that approximate the count or run on distributed clusters. In this paper, we discuss the existing methods of triangle counting, ranging from sequential to parallel, single\u2010machine to distributed, exact to approximate, and off\u2010line to streaming. We also present experimental results of performance comparison among a set of approximate triangle counting methods built under a unified implementation framework. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future works in this direction. WIREs Data Mining Knowl Discov 2018, 8:e1226. doi: 10.1002/widm.1226",
