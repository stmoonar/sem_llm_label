            "abstract": "In this demo we introduce Headwork, an open-source academic platform for the crowdsourcing of complex tasks. Besides classical crowdsourcing features, Headwork eases the development of crowdsourcing campaigns through a full relational abstraction of relevant concepts (participants, skills, tasks, current answers, decision procedures, GUI, etc.). It allows in particular the orchestration of complex dynamic tasks using so-called tuple artifacts (i",

            "title": "Yes, Topology Matters in Decentralized Optimization: Refined Convergence and Topology Learning under Heterogeneous Data",
            "abstract": "One of the key challenges in federated and decentralized learning is to design algorithms that e\ufb03ciently deal with highly heterogeneous data distributions across agents. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm (D-SGD), a popular decentralized learning algorithm, under data heterogeneity. We exhibit the key role played by a new quantity, that we call neighborhood heterogeneity, on the convergence rate of D-SGD. Unlike prior work, neighborhood heterogeneity is measured at the level of the neighborhood of an agent in the graph topology. By coupling the topology and the heterogeneity of the agents\u2019 distributions, our analysis sheds light on the poorly understood interplay between these two concepts in decentralized learning. We then argue that neighborhood heterogeneity provides a natural criterion to learn sparse data-dependent topologies that reduce (and can even eliminate) the otherwise detrimental e\ufb00ect of data heterogeneity on the convergence time of D-SGD. For the important case of classi\ufb01cation with label skew, we formulate the problem of learning such a good topology as a tractable optimization problem that we solve with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Our approach provides a principled way to design a sparse topology that balances the number of iterations and the per-iteration communication costs of D-SGD under data heterogeneity.",

Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

These include crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), CrowdWorks, Figure Eight; specialized services such as ride-hailing; matching markets such as TaskRabbit that matches workers with local demand and so on. It is widely anticipated that a vast majority of human workforce will be employed in these platforms. In this article, we initiate discussions about the under studied aspect of platform design \u2013 how to design platforms that maximize the satisfaction of various stakeholders. We also contribute a novel taxonomy for platform ecosystems that categorizes existing and emerging platforms. Finally, we discuss the need for interoperability between these platforms so that workers and requesters are not tied to a single platform.",
