            "abstract": "The half-day workshop on Cryptoasset Analytics allows researchers from different disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets. This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program features a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Workshop topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

            "abstract": "Blockchains are increasingly becoming popular due to the prevalence of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network that focuses on running code (smart contracts) for decentralized applications. More simply, it is a platform for sharing information in a global state that cannot be manipulated or changed. Ethereum blockchain introduces a novel ecosystem of human users and autonomous agents (smart contracts). In this network, we are interested in all possible interactions: user-to-user, user-to-contract, contract-to-user, and contract-to-contract. This requires us to construct interaction networks from the entire Ethereum blockchain data, where vertices are accounts (users, contracts) and arcs denote interactions. Our analyses on the networks reveal new insights by combining information from the four networks. We perform an in-depth study of these networks based on several graph properties consisting of both local and global properties, discuss their similarities and differences with social networks and the Web, draw interesting conclusions, and highlight important, future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Symbolic analysis of security exploits in smart contracts has demonstrated to be valuable for analyzing predefined vulnerability properties. While some symbolic tools perform complex analysis steps (which require predetermined invocation depth to search the execution paths), they employ fixed definitions of these vulnerabilities. However, vulnerabilities evolve. The number of contracts on blockchains like Ethereum has increased 176 fold since December 2015. If these symbolic tools fail to update over time, they could allow entire classes of vulnerabilities to go undetected, leading to unintended consequences. In this paper, we aim to have smart contracts that are less vulnerable to a broad class of emerging threats. In particular, we propose a novel approach of sequential learning of smart contract vulnerabilities using machine learning --- long-short term memory (LSTM) --- that perpetually learns from an increasing number of contracts handled over time, leading to safer smart contracts. Our experimental studies on approximately one million smart contracts for learning revealed encouraging results. A detection accuracy of 97% on contract vulnerabilities has been observed. In addition, our machine learning approach also correctly detected 76% of contract vulnerabilities that would otherwise be deemed as false positive errors by a symbolic tool. Last but not least, the proposed approach correctly identified a broader class of vulnerabilities when considering a subset of 10,000 contracts that are sampled from unflagged contracts.",

            "abstract": "The phases those turn the wheels of an autonomous vehicle, are perception, decision and actuation. Among these, the major highlight of recent research has been perception through diverse sensors, and decision through an ever-aggressive cloud/fog/mist computing setup. In this paper, we take a closer look into the flow of data, both internal and external to the autonomous vehicle. We argue that confidentiality, integrity and availability of these data are critical to the eventual adoption of higher-level security and privacy mechanisms in autonomous vehicles. To that effect, we propose a secure and tamper-resilient distributed ledger as an underlying enabler for intra-vehicular data aggregation, and study its security and privacy issues under appropriate adversarial models, where the distributed ledger is instantiated as a standard consortium blockchain.",

            "title": "A Blockchain Framework for Insurance Processes",
            "abstract": "We design a distributed platform with blockchain as a system service for supporting transaction execution in insurance processes. The insurance industry is heavily dependent on multiple processes between transacting parties for initiating, maintaining and closing diverse kind of policies. Transaction processing time, payment settlement time and security protection of the process execution are major concerns. Blockchain technology, originally conceived as an immutable distributed ledger for detecting double spending of cryptocurrencies, is now increasingly used in different FinTech systems to address productivity and security requirements. The application of blockchain in FinTech processing requires a deep understanding of the underlying business processes. It supports automated interactions between the blockchain and existing transaction systems through the notion of smart contracts. In this paper, we focus on the design of an efficient approach for processing insurance related transactions based on a blockchain-enabled platform. An experimental prototype is developed on Hyperledger fabric, an open source permissioned blockchain design framework. We discuss the main design requirements, corresponding design propositions, and encode various insurance processes as smart contracts. Extensive experiments were conducted to analyze performance of our framework and security of the proposed design.",
