            "abstract": "Revoking personal private data is one of the basic human rights, which has already been sheltered by several privacy-preserving laws in many countries. However, with the development of data science, machine learning and deep learning techniques, this right is usually neglected or violated as more and more patients\u2019 data are being collected and used for model training, especially in intelligent healthcare, thus making intelligent healthcare a sector where technology must meet the law, regulations, and privacy principles to ensure that the innovation is for the common good. In order to secure patients\u2019 right to be forgotten, we proposed a novel solution by using auditing to guide the forgetting process, where auditing means determining whether a dataset has been used to train the model and forgetting requires the information of a query dataset to be forgotten from the target model. We unified these two tasks by introducing a new approach called knowledge purification. To implement our solution, we developed AFS, a unified open-source software, which is able to evaluate and revoke patients\u2019 private data from pre-trained deep learning models. We demonstrated the generality of AFS by applying it to four tasks on different datasets with various data sizes and architectures of deep learning networks. The software is publicly available at https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/AFS.",

            "abstract": "The accurate annotation of transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage is critical for the mechanistic understanding of gene regulation under different biological contexts. To fulfill this, on one hand, specific high-throughput experimental technologies have been developed to capture TSSs in a genome-wide manner. On the other hand, various computational tools have also been developed for in silico prediction of TSSs solely based on genomic sequences. Most of these computational tools cast the problem as a binary classification task on a balanced dataset and thus result in drastic false positive predictions when applied on the genome-scale. To address these issues, we present DeeReCT-TSS, a deep-learning-based method that is capable of TSSs identification across the whole genome based on both DNA sequences and conventional RNA-seq data. We show that by effectively incorporating these two sources of information, DeeReCT-TSS significantly outperforms other solely sequence-based methods on the precise annotation of TSSs used in different cell types. Furthermore, we develop a meta-learning-based extension for simultaneous transcription start site (TSS) annotation on 10 cell types, which enables the identification of cell-type-specific TSS. Finally, we demonstrate the high precision of DeeReCT-TSS on two independent datasets from the ENCODE project by correlating our predicted TSSs with experimentally defined TSS chromatin states.

            "abstract": "COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic and become the most urgent threat to the entire world. Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients\u2019 data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease.",

            "title": "DeeReCT-APA: Prediction of Alternative Polyadenylation Site Usage Through Deep Learning",
            "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a crucial step in post-transcriptional regulation. Previous bioinformatic works have mainly focused on the recognition of polyadenylation sites (PAS) in a given genomic sequence, which is a binary classification problem. Recently, computational methods for predicting the usage level of alternative PAS in a same gene have been proposed. However, all of them cast the problem as a non-quantitative pairwise comparison task and do not take the competition among multiple PAS into account. To address this, here we propose a deep learning architecture, DeeReCT-APA, to quantitatively predict the usage of all alternative PAS of a given gene. To accommodate different genes with potentially different numbers of PAS, DeeReCT-APA treats the problem as a regression task with a variable-length target. Based on a CNN-LSTM architecture, DeeReCT-APA extracts sequence features with CNN layers, uses bidirectional LSTM to explicitly model the interactions among competing PAS, and outputs percentage scores representing the usage levels of all PAS of a gene. In addition to the fact that only our method can predict quantitatively the usage of all the PAS within a gene, we show that our method consistently outperforms other existing methods on three different tasks for which they are trained: pairwise comparison task, highest usage prediction task and ranking task. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to predict the effect of genetic variations on APA patterns and shed light on future mechanistic understanding in APA regulation.

With the advances of the big data era in biology, it is foreseeable that deep learning will become increasingly important in the field and will be incorporated in vast majorities of analysis pipelines. In this review, we provide both the exoteric introduction of deep learning, and concrete examples and implementations of its representative applications in bioinformatics. We start from the recent achievements of deep learning in the bioinformatics field, pointing out the problems which are suitable to use deep learning. After that, we introduce deep learning in an easy-to-understand fashion, from shallow neural networks to legendary convolutional neural networks, legendary recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoder, and the most recent state-of-the-art architectures. After that, we provide eight examples, covering five bioinformatics research directions and all the four kinds of data type, with the implementation written in Tensorflow and Keras. Finally, we discuss the common issues, such as overfitting and interpretability, that users will encounter when adopting deep learning methods and provide corresponding suggestions.

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Polyadenylation is a critical step for gene expression regulation during the maturation of mRNA. An accurate and robust method for poly(A) signals (PASs) identification is not only desired for the purpose of better transcripts\u2019 end annotation, but can also help us gain a deeper insight of the underlying regulatory mechanism. Although many methods have been proposed for PAS recognition, most of them are PAS motif- and human-specific, which leads to high risks of overfitting, low generalization power, and inability to reveal the connections between the underlying mechanisms of different mammals. Results In this work, we propose a robust, PAS motif agnostic, and highly interpretable and transferrable deep learning model for accurate PAS recognition, which requires no prior knowledge or human-designed features. We show that our single model trained over all human PAS motifs not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods trained on specific motifs, but can also be generalized well to two mouse datasets. Moreover, we further increase the prediction accuracy by transferring the deep learning model trained on the data of one species to the data of a different species. Several novel underlying poly(A) patterns are revealed through the visualization of important oligomers and positions in our trained models. Finally, we interpret the deep learning models by converting the convolutional filters into sequence logos and quantitatively compare the sequence logos between human and mouse datasets.

            "abstract": "A plain well-trained deep learning model often does not have the ability to learn new knowledge without forgetting the previously learned knowledge, which is known as catastrophic forgetting. Here we propose a novel method, SupportNet, to efficiently and effectively solve the catastrophic forgetting problem in the class incremental learning scenario. SupportNet combines the strength of deep learning and support vector machine (SVM), where SVM is used to identify the support data from the old data, which are fed to the deep learning model together with the new data for further training so that the model can review the essential information of the old data when learning the new information. Two powerful consolidation regularizers are applied to stabilize the learned representation and ensure the robustness of the learned model. We validate our method with comprehensive experiments on various tasks, which show that SupportNet drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art incremental learning methods and even reaches similar performance as the deep learning model trained from scratch on both old and new data.

            "abstract": "Motivation In most biological data sets, the amount of data is regularly growing and the number of classes is continuously increasing. To deal with the new data from the new classes, one approach is to train a classification model, e.g., a deep learning model, from scratch based on both old and new data. This approach is highly computationally costly and the extracted features are likely very different from the ones extracted by the model trained on the old data alone, which leads to poor model robustness. Another approach is to fine tune the trained model from the old data on the new data. However, this approach often does not have the ability to learn new knowledge without forgetting the previously learned knowledge, which is known as the catastrophic forgetting problem. To our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the field of bioinformatics despite its existence in many bioinformatic problems. Results Here we propose a novel method, SupportNet, to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem efficiently and effectively. SupportNet combines the strength of deep learning and support vector machine (SVM), where SVM is used to identify the support data from the old data, which are fed to the deep learning model together with the new data for further training so that the model can review the essential information of the old data when learning the new information. Two powerful consolidation regularizers are applied to ensure the robustness of the learned model. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks, including enzyme function prediction, subcellular structure classification and breast tumor classification, show that SupportNet drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art incremental learning methods and reaches similar performance as the deep learning model trained from scratch on both old and new data.
