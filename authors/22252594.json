            "abstract": "Similarity joins on multidimensional data are crucial operators for recommendation purposes. The classic \ud835\udf16 -join problem finds all pairs of points within \ud835\udf16 distance to each other among two \ud835\udc51 -dimensional datasets. In this paper, we consider a novel and alternative version of \ud835\udf16 -join named community similarity based on user profile joins (CSJ). The aim of CSJ problem is, given two communities having a set of \ud835\udc51 -dimensional users, to find how similar are the communities by matching every single pair of users (a user can be matched with at most one other user) having an absolute difference of at most \ud835\udf16 per dimension. Each dimension in each user vector stores a counter that measures the number of user preferences to a concrete general topic. CSJ uses low \ud835\udf16 and applies the strict condition per dimension so as to really find similar user profiles among two communities. CSJ applies to a number of cases in which the popular community detection and community search problems do not suit. This happens since CSJ treats existing communities as brands of a specific commercial value and does not search to form general communities as prior works do; these two community types semantically differ. Also, CSJ does not rely its execution on social or/and physical links among community users, instead, it only focus on the similarity of user profiles . We deploy a suite of 6 methods to solve CSJ; 3 approximate and 3 exact algorithms. We evaluate our solutions to meaningful case studies of real and synthetic datasets having different characteristics. Our experimental results show interesting and diverse conclusions of CSJ applicability to realistic scenarios.",

            "title": "Adaptive Content-Aware Influence Maximization via Online Learning to Rank",
            "abstract": "How can we adapt the composition of a post over a series of rounds to make it more appealing in a social network? Techniques that progressively learn how to make a fixed post more influential over rounds have been studied in the context of the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which seeks a set of seed users that maximize a post\u2019s influence. However, there is no work on progressively learning how a post\u2019s features affect its influence. In this article, we propose and study the problem of Adaptive Content-Aware Influence Maximization (ACAIM), which calls to find k features to form a post in each round so as to maximize the cumulative influence of those posts over all rounds. We solve ACAIM by applying, for the first time, an Online Learning to Rank (OLR) framework for IM purposes. We introduce the CATRID propagation model, which expresses how posts disseminate in a social network using click probabilities and post visibility criteria and develop a simulator that runs CATRID via a training-testing scheme based on real posts of the VK social network, so as to realistically represent the learning environment. We deploy three learners that solve ACAIM in an online (real-time) manner. We experimentally prove the practical suitability of our solutions via exhaustive experiments on multiple brands (operating as different case studies) and several VK datasets; the best learner is evaluated on 45 separate case studies yielding convincing results.",

            "title": "A Content Recommendation Policy for Gaining Subscribers",
            "abstract": "How can we recommend content for a brand agent to use over a series of rounds so as to gain new subscribers to its social network page? The Influence Maximization (IM) problem seeks a set of~k users, and its content-aware variants seek a set of~k post features, that achieve, in both cases, an objective of expected influence in a social network. However, apart from raw influence, it is also relevant to study gain in subscribers, as long-term success rests on the subscribers of a brand page; classic IM may select~k users from the subscriber set, and content-aware IM starts the post's propagation from that subscriber set. In this paper, we propose a novel content recommendation policy to a brand agent for Gaining Subscribers by Messaging (GSM) over many rounds. In each round, the brand agent messages a fixed number of social network users and invites them to visit the brand page aiming to gain their subscription, while its most recently published content consists of features that intensely attract the preferences of the invited users. To solve GSM, we find, in each round, which content features to publish and which users to notify aiming to maximize the cumulative subscription gain over all rounds. We deploy three GSM solvers, named \\sR, \\sSC, and \\sSU, and we experimentally evaluate their performance based on VKontakte (VK) posts by considering different user sets and feature sets. Our experimental results show that \\sSU provides the best solution, as it is significantly more efficient than \\sSC with a minor loss of efficacy and clearly more efficacious than \\sR with competitive efficiency.",

            "title": "Content Recommendation for Viral Social Influence",
            "abstract": "How do we create content that will become viral in a whole network after we share it with friends or followers' Significant research activity has been dedicated to the problem of strategically selecting a seed set of initial adopters so as to maximize a meme's spread in a network. This line of work assumes that the success of such a campaign depends solely on the choice of a tunable seed set of adopters, while the way users perceive the propagated meme is fixed. Yet, in many real-world settings, the opposite holds: a meme's propagation depends on users' perceptions of its tunable characteristics, while the set of initiators is fixed. In this paper, we address the natural problem that arises in such circumstances: Suggest content, expressed as a limited set of attributes, for a creative promotion campaign that starts out from a given seed set of initiators, so as to maximize its expected spread over a social network. To our knowledge, no previous work addresses this problem. We find that the problem is NP-hard and inapproximable. As a tight approximation guarantee is not admissible, we design an efficient heuristic, Explore-Update, as well as a conventional Greedy solution. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Explore-Update selects near-optimal attribute sets with real data, achieves 30% higher spread than baselines, and runs an order of magnitude faster than the Greedy solution.",
