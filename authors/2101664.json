Our nonparametric Bayesian approach is based on a modification of the stochastic block model (SBM), which can take advantage of rank alignment and coherence to produce parsimonious descriptions of networks that combine ordered hierarchies with arbitrary mixing patterns between groups. Since our model also includes directed degree correction, we can use it to distinguish nonlocal hierarchical structure from local in- and out-degree imbalance-thus, removing a source of conflation present in most ranking methods. We also demonstrate how we can reliably compare with the results obtained with the unordered SBM variant to determine whether a hierarchical ordering is statistically warranted in the first place. We illustrate the application of our method on a wide variety of empirical networks across several domains.",

            "abstract": "The task of community detection, which aims to partition a network into clusters of nodes to summarize its large-scale structure, has spawned the development of many competing algorithms with varying objectives. Some community detection methods are inferential, explicitly deriving the clustering objective through a probabilistic generative model, while other methods are descriptive, dividing a network according to an objective motivated by a particular application, making it challenging to compare these methods on the same scale. Here we present a solution to this problem that associates any community detection objective, inferential or descriptive, with its corresponding implicit network generative model. This allows us to compute the description length of a network and its partition under arbitrary objectives, providing a principled measure to compare the performance of different algorithms without the need for \"ground-truth\" labels. Our approach also gives access to instances of the community detection problem that are optimal to any given algorithm and in this way reveals intrinsic biases in popular descriptive methods, explaining their tendency to overfit. Using our framework, we compare a number of community detection methods on artificial networks and on a corpus of over 500 structurally diverse empirical networks. We find that more expressive community detection methods exhibit consistently superior compression performance on structured data instances, without having degraded performance on a minority of situations where more specialized algorithms perform optimally. Our results undermine the implications of the \"no free lunch\" theorem for community detection, both conceptually and in practice, since it is confined to unstructured data instances, unlike relevant community detection problems which are structured by requirement.",

This area deals with the automated division of a network into fundamental building blocks, with the objective of providing a summary of its large-scale structure. Despite its importance and widespread adoption, there is a noticeable gap between what is arguably the state-of-the-art and the methods which are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. The Elements attempts to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to whether they have a 'descriptive' or an 'inferential' goal. While descriptive methods find patterns in networks based on context-dependent notions of community structure, inferential methods articulate a precise generative model, and attempt to fit it to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights into formation mechanisms and separate structure from noise. This title is also available as open access on Cambridge Core.",

Here we present a generative model and corresponding inference procedure that are capable of distinguishing between both mechanisms. Our approach is based on a variation of the stochastic block model (SBM) with the addition of triadic closure edges, and its inference can identify the most plausible mechanism responsible for the existence of every edge in the network, in addition to the underlying community structure itself. We show how the method can evade the detection of spurious communities caused solely by the formation of triangles in the network, and how it can improve the performance of edge prediction when compared to the pure version of the SBM without triadic closure.",

            "abstract": "Community detection methods attempt to divide a network into groups of nodes that share similar properties, thus revealing its large-scale structure. A major challenge when employing such methods is that they are often degenerate, typically yielding a complex landscape of competing answers. As an attempt to extract understanding from a population of alternative solutions, many methods exist to establish a consensus among them in the form of a single partition \"point estimate\" that summarizes the whole distribution. Here we show that it is in general not possible to obtain a consistent answer from such point estimates when the underlying distribution is too heterogeneous. As an alternative, we provide a comprehensive set of methods designed to characterize and summarize complex populations of partitions in a manner that captures not only the existing consensus, but also the dissensus between elements of the population. Our approach is able to model mixed populations of partitions where multiple consensuses can coexist, representing different competing hypotheses for the network structure. We also show how our methods can be used to compare pairs of partitions, how they can be generalized to hierarchical divisions, and be used to perform statistical model selection between competing hypotheses.",

However, this sparsity tends not to be homogeneous, and networks can also be locally dense, for example, with a few nodes connecting to a large fraction of the rest of the network, or with small groups of nodes with a large probability of connections between them. Here we show how latent Poisson models that generate hidden multigraphs can be effective at capturing this density heterogeneity, while being more tractable mathematically than some of the alternatives that model simple graphs directly. We show how these latent multigraphs can be reconstructed from data on simple graphs, and how this allows us to disentangle disassortative degree-degree correlations from the constraints of imposed degree sequences, and to improve the identification of community structure in empirically relevant scenarios.",

We show that this approach succeeds in finding statistically significant assortative modules in networks, unlike alternatives such as modularity maximization, which systematically overfits both in artificial as well as in empirical examples. In addition, we show that our method is not subject to a resolution limit, and can uncover an arbitrarily large number of communities, as long as there is statistical evidence for them. Our formulation is amenable to model selection procedures, which allow us to compare it to more general approaches based on the stochastic block model, and in this way reveal whether assortativity is in fact the dominating large-scale mixing pattern. We perform this comparison with several empirical networks, and identify numerous cases where the network's assortativity is exaggerated by traditional community detection methods, and we show how a more faithful degree of assortativity can be identified.",

Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram of optimized structures, composed of many combinations of modular, core-periphery, and bipartite patterns. Furthermore, we observe parameter regions where the simultaneous optimization can be either synergistic or antagonistic, with the improvement of one criterion directly aiding or hindering the other, respectively. Our results show how interactions between different selective pressures can be pivotal in determining the emerging network structure, and that these interactions can be captured by simple network models.",
