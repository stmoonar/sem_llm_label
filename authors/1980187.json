            "title": "Guidelines for the reuse of ontology content",
            "abstract": "Reuse of elements from existing ontologies in the construction of new ontologies is a foundational principle in ontological design. It offers the benefits, among others, of consistency and interoperability between such knowledge structures as well as sharing resources. Reuse is widely found within important collections of established ontologies, such as BioPortal and the OBO Foundry. However, reuse comes with its own potential problems involving ontological commitment, granularity, and ambiguity. Guidelines are proposed to aid ontology developers and curators in their prospective reuse of content. These guidelines have been gleaned over years of practice in the ontology field. The guidelines are couched in experiential reports on designing and curating particular ontologies (e.g., EXACT and EXACT2) and using generally accepted approaches (e.g., MIREOT) in doing so. Various software tools to assist in ontology reuse are surveyed and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The wide-spread use of Common Data Models and information models in biomedical informatics encourages assumptions that those models could provide the entirety of what is needed for knowledge representation purposes. Based on the lack of computable semantics in frequently used Common Data Models, there appears to be a gap between knowledge representation requirements and these models. In this use-case oriented approach, we explore how a system-theoretic, architecture-centric, ontology-based methodology can help to better understand this gap. We show how using the Generic Component Model helps to analyze the data management system in a way that allows accounting for data management procedures inside the system and knowledge representation of the real world at the same time.",

Computerized support might help experts be more objective in assessing DDI evidence. A requirement for such systems is accurate automatic classification of evidence types. In this pilot study, we developed a hierarchical classifier to classify clinical DDI studies into formally defined evidence types. The area under the ROC curve for sub-classifiers in the ensemble ranged from 0.78 to 0.87. The entire system achieved an F1 of 0.83 and 0.63 on two held-out datasets, the latter consisting focused on completely novel drugs from what the system was trained on. The results suggest that it is feasible to accurately automate the classification of a sub-set of DDI evidence types and that the hierarchical approach shows promise. Future work will test more advanced feature engineering techniques while expanding the system to classify a more complex set of evidence types.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The dataset contains annotations for lung nodules collected by the Lung Imaging Data Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC) stored as standard DICOM objects. The annotations accompany a collection of computed tomography (CT) scans for over 1000 subjects annotated by multiple expert readers, and correspond to \u201cnodules \u2265 3 mm\u201d, defined as any lesion considered to be a nodule with greatest in\u2010plane dimension in the range 3\u201330 mm regardless of presumed histology. The present dataset aims to simplify reuse of the data with the readily available tools, and is targeted towards researchers interested in the analysis of lung CT images. Acquisition and validation methods Open source tools were utilized to parse the project\u2010specific XML representation of LIDC\u2010IDRI annotations and save the result as standard DICOM objects. Validation procedures focused on establishing compliance of the resulting objects with the standard, consistency of the data between the DICOM and project\u2010specific representation, and evaluating interoperability with the existing tools. Data format and usage notes The dataset utilizes DICOM Segmentation objects for storing annotations of the lung nodules, and DICOM Structured Reporting objects for communicating qualitative evaluations (nine attributes) and quantitative measurements (three attributes) associated with the nodules. The total of 875 subjects contain 6859 nodule annotations. Clustering of the neighboring annotations resulted in 2651 distinct nodules. The data are available in TCIA at https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.2018.h7umfurq. Potential applications The standardized dataset maintains the content of the original contribution of the LIDC\u2010IDRI consortium, and should be helpful in developing automated tools for characterization of lung lesions and image phenotyping. In addition to those properties, the representation of the present dataset makes it more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for the research community, and enables its integration with other standardized data collections.",

Knowledge of potential DDIs is important for clinicians in making safe medical treatment decisions. However, it is challenging for clinicians to keep abreast of new knowledge about DDIs because a large amount of new research about DDIs is published every year in a variety of formats, including journal articles and drug labels (Schneider et al. 2015).",

This work aims to facilitate the curation, sharing, discovery, and use, of information about how OBO and other biomedical ontologies are used by informatics researchers and other ontology users to transform biomedical instance data into realist semantic representations. By encouraging sharing of information about how ontologies are actually used with instance data this resource will reduce the total effort by ontology users to design and implement representations for use with their data. We believe this will ultimately result in more widespread use of higher-quality representations, and in improved semantic interoperability of data. Our repository proof of concept implementation is available as a web application built and organized using semantic web technologies.",
