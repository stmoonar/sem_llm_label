            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability.",

            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThis paper aims to design a novel feature descriptor to improve the performance of feature matching in challenge scenes, such as low texture and wide-baseline scenes. Common descriptors are not suitable for low texture scenes and other challenging scenes mainly owing to encoding only one kind of features. The proposed feature descriptor considers multiple features and their locations, which is more expressive.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA graph neural network\u2013based descriptors enhancement algorithm for feature matching is proposed. In this paper, point and line features are the primary concerns. In the graph, commonly used descriptors for points and lines constitute the nodes and the edges are determined by the geometric relationship between points and lines. After the graph convolution designed for incomplete join graph, enhanced descriptors are obtained.\n\n\nFindings\nExperiments are carried out in indoor, outdoor and low texture scenes. The experiments investigate the real-time performance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, viewpoint invariance and noise sensitivity of the descriptors in three types of scenes. The results show that the enhanced descriptors are robust to scene changes and can be used in wide-baseline matching.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nA graph structure is designed to represent multiple features in an image. In the process of building graph structure, the geometric relation between multiple features is used to establish the edges. Furthermore, a novel hybrid descriptor for points and lines is obtained using graph convolutional neural network. This enhanced descriptor has the advantages of both point features and line features in feature matching.\n",
