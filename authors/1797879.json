            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Due to the prevalence of GPS-equipped cameras (e.g., smartphones and surveillance cameras), massive amounts of geo-tagged images capturing urban streets are increasingly being collected. Consequently, many smart city applications have emerged, relying on efficient image search. Such searches include spatial-visual queries in which spatial and visual properties are used in tandem to retrieve similar images to a given query image within a given geographical region. Towards this end, new index structures that organize images based on both spatial and visual properties are needed to efficiently execute such queries. Based on our observation that street images are typically similar in the same spatial locality, index structures for spatial-visual queries can be effectively built on a spatial index (i.e., R*-tree). Therefore, we propose a class of R*-tree indexes, particularly, by associating each node with two separate minimum bounding rectangles (MBR), one for spatial and the other for (dimension-reduced) visual properties of their contained images, and adapting the R*-tree optimization criteria to both property types.",

That is, use computer technology in the middle of an activity that used to be done without computers. For example, people used to shoot pictures on film, but now most of the pictures are digital. People used to pay tolls with cash, and now it is digital. People used to drive cars with rack-and-pinion steering, now they are all drive-by-wire, fully digital rolling computers.",

In this paper, we present our experience with supporting one important class of spatial queries in these database systems: distance queries. For example, a traveler may want to find hotels within 500 meters of a nearby beach. In addition, this paper presents new techniques implemented in Oracle Spatial for some distance-related problems, such as the maximum distance between complex spatial objects, and the diameter, the convex hull and the minimum bounding circle of complex spatial objects. We conduct our experiments by utilizing real-world data sets and demonstrate that these distance and distance-related queries can be significantly improved.",

            "abstract": "Point cloud data are important sources for 3D geo-information. The point cloud data sets are growing in popularity and in size. Modern Big Data acquisition and processing technologies, such as laser scanning from airborne, mobile, or static platforms, dense image matching from photos, multi-beam echo-sounding, or from autotracking seismic data, have the potential to generate point clouds with millions or billions (or even trillions) of 3D points (with in many cases one or more attributes attached). This is especially true with the available and expected repeated scans of same area (the temporal dimension). These point clouds are too massive to be handled efficiently by common geo-ICT infrastructures. At the database level, initial implementations are available in both commercial and open source database products, illustrating the user need for point cloud support; e.g. Oracle spatial\u2019s SDO_PC data type and PostgreSQL/PostGIS PCPATCH data type. This new data type should be available in addition to the existing vector and raster data types. Further, a new and specific web-services protocol for point cloud data is investigated, supporting progressive transfer based on multi-resolution. The eScience project investigates solutions in order to better exploit the rich potential of point cloud data. The project partners are: Rijkswaterstaat (RWS), Fugro, Oracle, Netherlands eScience Centre and TU Delft. An inventory of the user requirements has been made using structured interviews with users from different background: government, industry and academia. Based on these requirements a benchmark has been developed to compare various point cloud data management solutions w.r.t. functionality and performance. The main test data set is the second national height map of the Netherlands, AHN2, with 6 to 10 samples for every square meter of the country, resulting in more than 600 billion points with 3 cm accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was held in November of 2014 in Dallas, Texas, US. Following the success of last two events, we organized the 3rd programming contest associated with the conference, called the SIGSPATIAL GIS 2014. The subject of the competition was constrained generalization, which aims to generalize geometric features in the context of topological constraints. We describe the contest details, and the results, as well as the lessons learned during the process.",
