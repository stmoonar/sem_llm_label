            "title": "Dependency-Aware Service Migration for Backhaul-Free Vehicular Edge Computing Networks",
            "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm to improve vehicular services through offloading complex computation tasks to the edge servers. However, the high mobility of vehicles requires frequent service migration among edge servers to guarantee uninterrupted services when vehicles traverse multiple cells. This brings great challenges. In this article, we design a dependency-aware backhaul-free migration scheme to enable service migration without relying on backhaul with constraints on task dependencies. Specifically, the vehicle proactively fetches the migrated results based on task dependencies from the original server and migrates the results to its dynamically connected servers along the traveling path. Considering the incurred intermittent communication and computation due to vehicle mobility, a joint offloading and migration optimization problem for determining the time to offload tasks and fetch results is formulated with a time-varying Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the total energy consumption. Time-varying transition probability functions are derived to characterize the dynamics during intermittent offloading and fetching. Based on the MDP framework, an efficient online value iteration algorithm is developed by exploiting temporal correlation to estimate the time-varying value functions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve superior energy-saving performance compared to the baseline online schemes.",

            "title": "Utilizing Attitude Information for Efficient Multi-User Millimeter-Wave Communications",
            "abstract": "Sensing has played an important role in the 5G wireless network. It is well recognized that the energy efficiency of mobile devices can be further improved with the assistance of sensing. As an important sensing resource, attitude information is highly related to the angle of arrivals (AoAs) information when user equipments (UEs) rotate. It provides great potential to improve transceiver designs for multi-user millimeter-wave (mmWave) green communications. In this paper, we propose an attitude information aided block diagonalization receiver design algorithm. We first adopt angle of departure aided block diagonalization (AoD-BD) to eliminate inter-user interference (IUI). Then we compensate the rotation for each UE by only updating the receiver with attitude information from motion sensors. Compared to the joint transceiver design performance, we have theoretically proved that the sum spectral efficiency performance penalty of keeping transmitter unchanged is generally negligible. Furthermore, we consider the effect of imperfect attitude information, and derive a robust receiver by modeling the measurement error as Gaussian. Finally, the simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design. It is noted that no feedback is required between the base station (BS) and UE during the rotation, which substantially reduces the system overhead.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT In recent years, the rapid progress of mobile internet technology has revolutionized how data is transmitted and shared wirelessly, making it possible to deliver information in real-time to users anywhere. This technological advancement has created new research opportunities, particularly in teaching quality evaluation in colleges and universities using mobile applications. Teaching quality is a crucial evaluation index at the university level, and accurately assessing it is a complex task due to numerous influencing factors. Therefore, there is a need to develop a model that can effectively evaluate the teaching quality to address this challenge. To this end, this paper proposes a teaching quality evaluation model based on data mining algorithms that consist of four parts: evaluation model, evaluation method, evaluation procedure, and practice optimization. This model aims to improve the accuracy of teaching quality evaluation in colleges and universities. Moreover, this study suggests that virtual simulation experiment systems can positively affect the effectiveness of teaching environmental courses.

            "abstract": "PurposeShort-form health science videos have become an important medium for disseminating health knowledge and improving public health literacy. However, the factors that determine viewer engagement are not well understood. This study aims to address this research gap by investigating the association between doctor image features and viewer engagement behavior, building on the personal branding theory and information signaling theory.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 1245 health science short-form videos was collected, and key video features related to doctor images were extracted through manual labeling. Multi-variable regression analysis and SPSS process model were employed to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe results show that doctor image features are significantly associated with viewer engagement behavior. Videos featuring doctors in medical uniforms receive more viewer likes, comments and shares. Highlighting the doctor's title can increase viewer collections. Videos shot in a home, white wall, or study room setting receive more like, comments and sharing. The doctor's appearance demonstrates a positive nonlinear relationship with viewer likes and comments. Young doctors with title information tend to attract more video collections than older doctors with title information. The positive effect of the doctor's appearance and showing title information, become more significant among male doctors.Originality/valueThis research provides novel insights into the factors that determine viewer engagement behavior in short-form health science videos. Specific doctor image features can enhance viewer engagement by signaling doctor professionalism. The results also suggest that there may be age and gender biases in viewers' perceptions.",

The large aperture of XL-arrays means that spherical rather than planar wavefronts must be considered, and a paradigm shift from far-field to near-field communications is necessary. Unlike existing works that have mainly considered far-field beam management, we study the new near-field beam management for XL-arrays. We first provide an overview of near-field communications and introduce various applications of XL-arrays in both outdoor and indoor scenarios. Then, three typical near-field beam management methods for XL-arrays are discussed: near-field beam training, beam tracking, and beam scheduling. We point out their main design issues and propose promising solutions to address them. Moreover, other important directions in near-field communications are also highlighted to motivate future research.",

            "abstract": "Recently, enhanced video compression frameworks compatible with traditional standard codecs have achieved competitive performance especially in low-bandwidth scenarios, among which the downsampling-based preprocessing networks and super-resolution based postprocessing networks are commonly applied. Surrogate networks are further employed as the replacement of non-differentiable standard codecs during training. However, the discard of minor information such as high frequency spatial textures in the process of downsampling restricts the reconstruction quality. Moreover, existing surrogate networks merely imitate the intra-frame coding structure of standard codecs without leveraging inter-frame relations. In this paper, we propose a rescaling-based enhanced video compression framework. The main video stream preserves critical spatial structures and complete temporal information, while another lightweight segment-specific enhancement stream transmitted to the decoder side is extracted and encoded from the key frame of a video segment. The high-frequency spatial information contained in the enhancement stream is further transferred to the whole segment with the guide of decoded LR frames via a Transformer-based Reconstruction Network (TRN), thus enhancing the reconstruction quality at the expense of a small bit cost. Besides, we employ a Virtual Codec Network (VCN) during training for gradients back-propagation, which is able to imitate both inter-frame and intra-frame coding characteristics of standard codecs. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with recent downsampling-based enhanced standard compatible frameworks.",

In this paper, we first establish a large-scale audio-visual quality assessment dataset for omnidirectional videos, which includes 375 distorted omnidirectional audio-visual (A/V) sequences generated from 15 high-quality pristine omnidirectional A/V contents, and the corresponding perceptual audio-visual quality scores. Then, we design three baseline methods for full-reference omnidirectional audio-visual quality assessment (OAVQA), which combine existing state-of-the-art single-mode audio and video QA models via multimodal fusion strategies. We validate the effectiveness of the A/V multimodal fusion method for OAVQA on our dataset, which provides a new benchmark for omnidirectional QoE evaluation.

Nevertheless, FL usually fails to train a high-quality model from the networks, where the edge nodes collect noisy labeled data. To tackle this challenge, this paper focuses on developing an innovative robust FL. We consider two kinds of networks with different data distribution. Firstly, we design a reweighted FL under a full-data network, where all edge nodes are equipped with both numerous noisy labeled dataset and small clean dataset. The key idea is that edge devices learn to assign the local weights of loss functions in noisy labeled dataset, and cooperate with central server to update global weights. Secondly, we consider a part-data network where some edge nodes exclude clean dataset, and can not compute the weights locally. The broadcasting of the global weights is added to help those edge nodes without clean dataset to reweight their noisy loss functions. Both designs have a convergence rate of $\\mathcal {O}(1/T^{2})$. Simulation results illustrate that the both proposed training processes improve the prediction accuracy due to the proper weights assignments of noisy loss function.",

Different from the existing works that mostly focus on the near-field communications, we consider in this letter a new and practical scenario, called mixed near- and far-field communications, where there exist both near- and far-field users in the network. For this scenario, we first obtain a closed-form expression for the inter-user interference at the near-field user caused by the far-field beam by using Fresnel functions, based on which the effects of the number of BS antennas, far-field user (FU) angle, near-field user (NU) angle and distance are analyzed. We show that the strong interference exists when the number of BS antennas and the NU distance are relatively small, and/or the NU and FU angle-difference is small. Then, we further obtain the achievable rate of the NU as well as its rate loss caused by the FU interference. Last, numerical results are provided to corroborate our analytical results.",

            "abstract": "Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) dual-func- tional radar communication (DFRC) provides a solution to the severe spectrum scarcity challenge. MIMO systems may be prone to the hardware impairments (HWI). Considering I/Q-imbalance (IQI), the most common type of HWI, we study the optimal transmit beamforming design for MIMO DFRC. Both radar-centric and communication-centric scenarios are investigated. For the radar-centric design, the radar beampattern and communciations user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with IQI are derived. Then, the radar beampattern is optimized by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method. For the communication-centric design, the achievable rate with IQI is derived. Then, the transmit beamforming is optimized with the constraint on the MIMO radar receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, the computational complexity is analyzed. Numerical results verify that IQI amplitude mismatch, IQI phase mismatch and the IQI mitigation error can significantly degrade the system's overall performance. Also, for the communication-centric scenario, IQI phase mismatch at the CUs is much more important than that at the BS.",
