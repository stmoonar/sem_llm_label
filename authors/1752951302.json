            "title": "The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems",
            "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.",

            "abstract": "Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have emerged as a highly efficient approach to recommendation systems. By leveraging sequential data, SRSs can identify temporal patterns in user behaviour, significantly improving recommendation accuracy and relevance.Ensuring the reproducibility of these models is paramount for advancing research and facilitating comparisons between them. Existing works exhibit shortcomings in reproducibility and replicability of results, leading to inconsistent statements across papers. Our work fills these gaps by standardising data pre-processing and model implementations, providing a comprehensive code resource, including a framework for developing SRSs and establishing a foundation for consistent and reproducible experimentation. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, comparing various SRSs implemented in our resource. We challenge prevailing performance benchmarks, offering new insights into the SR domain. For instance, SASRec does not consistently outperform GRU4Rec. On the contrary, when the number of model parameters becomes substantial, SASRec starts to clearly dominate all the other SRSs. This discrepancy underscores the significant impact that experimental configuration has on the outcomes and the importance of setting it up to ensure precise and comprehensive results. Failure to do so can lead to significantly flawed conclusions, highlighting the need for rigorous experimental design and analysis in SRS research.

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have facilitated their widespread adoption in various applications, including recommendation systems. GNNs have proven to be effective in addressing the challenges posed by recommendation systems by efficiently modeling graphs in which nodes represent users or items and edges denote preference relationships. However, current GNN techniques represent nodes by means of a single static vector, which may inadequately capture the intricate complexities of users and items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a solution integrating a cutting-edge model inspired by category theory: Sheaf4Rec. Unlike single vector representations, Sheaf Neural Networks and their corresponding Laplacians represent each node (and edge) using a vector space. Our approach takes advantage from this theory and results in a more comprehensive representation that can be effectively exploited during inference, providing a versatile method applicable to a wide range of graph-related tasks and demonstrating unparalleled performance. Our proposed model exhibits a noteworthy relative improvement of up to 8.53% on F1-Score@10 and an impressive increase of up to 11.29% on NDCG@10, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models such as Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF), KGTORe and other recently developed GNN-based models. In addition to its superior predictive capabilities, Sheaf4Rec shows remarkable improvements in terms of efficiency: we observe substantial runtime improvements ranging from 2.5% up to 37% when compared to other GNN-based competitor models, indicating a more efficient way of handling information while achieving better performance.

            "abstract": "In practical settings, classification datasets are obtained through a labelling process that is usually done by humans. Labels can be noisy as they are obtained by aggregating the different individual labels assigned to the same sample by multiple, and possibly disagreeing, annotators. The interrater agreement on these datasets can be measured while the underlying noise distribution to which the labels are subject is assumed to be unknown. In this work, we: (i) show how to leverage the inter-annotator statistics to estimate the noise distribution to which labels are subject; (ii) introduce methods that use the estimate of the noise distribution to learn from the noisy dataset; and (iii) establish generalization bounds in the empirical risk minimization framework that depend on the estimated quantities. We conclude the paper by providing experiments that illustrate our findings.",

            "abstract": "Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) are a popular type of recommender system that leverages user history to predict the next item of interest. However, the presence of noise in user interactions, stemming from account sharing, inconsistent preferences, or accidental clicks, can significantly impact the robustness and performance of SRSs, particularly when the entire item set to be predicted is noisy. This situation is more prevalent when only one item is used to train and evaluate the SRSs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that addresses the issue of noise in SRSs. First, we propose a sequential multi-relevant future items training objective, leveraging a loss function aware of item relevance, thereby enhancing their robustness against noise in the training data. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise at evaluation time, we propose multi-relevant future items evaluation (MRFI-evaluation), aiming to improve overall performance. Our relevance-aware models obtain an improvement of 1.58% of NDCG@10 and 0.96% in terms of HR@10 in the traditional evaluation protocol, the one which utilizes one relevant future item. In the MRFI-evaluation protocol, using multiple future items, the improvement is 2.82% of NDCG@10 and 0.64% of HR@10 w.r.t the best baseline model.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized machine learning and related fields, showcasing remarkable abilities in comprehending, generating, and manipulating human language. However, their conventional usage through API-based text prompt submissions imposes certain limitations in terms of context constraints and external source availability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Reinforced Retrieval Augmented Machine Learning (RRAML). RRAML integrates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with supporting information retrieved by a purpose-built retriever from a vast user-provided database. By leveraging recent advancements in reinforcement learning, our method effectively addresses several critical challenges. Firstly, it circumvents the need for accessing LLM gradients. Secondly, our method alleviates the burden of retraining LLMs for specific tasks, as it is often impractical or impossible due to restricted access to the model and the computational intensity involved. Additionally we seamlessly link the retriever's task with the reasoner, mitigating hallucinations and reducing irrelevant, and potentially damaging retrieved documents. We believe that the research agenda outlined in this paper has the potential to profoundly impact the field of AI, democratizing access to and utilization of LLMs for a wide range of entities.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of antiretroviral therapies for HIV-1 is a pressing clinical challenge, especially when the treatment regimen includes drugs for which limited effectiveness data is available. This scarcity of data can arise either due to the introduction of a new drug to the market or due to limited use in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel joint fusion model, which combines features from a Fully Connected (FC) Neural Network and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The FC network employs tabular data with a feature vector made up of viral mutations identified in the most recent genotypic resistance test, along with the drugs used in therapy. Conversely, the GNN leverages knowledge derived from Stanford drug-resistance mutation tables, which serve as benchmark references for deducing in-vivo treatment efficacy based on the viral genetic sequence, to build informative graphs. We evaluated these models' robustness against Out-of-Distribution drugs in the test set, with a specific focus on the GNN's role in handling such scenarios. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the proposed model consistently outperforms the FC model, especially when considering Out-of-Distribution drugs. These results underscore the advantage of integrating Stanford scores in the model, thereby enhancing its generalizability and robustness, but also extending its utility in real-world applications with limited data availability. This research highlights the potential of our approach to inform antiretroviral therapy outcome prediction and contribute to more informed clinical decisions.",

Therefore, we show how an attacker could potentially introduce poisoning data into the training data to manipulate the behavior of an online learning method. Our initial findings reveal varying susceptibility of logistic regression models based on complexity and attack type.",

            "abstract": "According to recent research, geometric deep learning allows to reach unprecedented accuracy for online misinformation detection. By fully leveraging the news social context, URL propagation paths in social networks are first represented as graphs and then classified using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Despite these remarkable efforts, researchers are still hampered by the scarcity of high-quality benchmark datasets, and as a result, the efficacy of state-of-the-art approaches could be overestimated. So far, in order to obtain a decent number of third-party fact-checked URLs, researchers have either sampled news from notoriously reliable and unreliable sources using distant supervision, or they have gathered pre-labeled URLs from third-party fact-checking websites. In the former case, resulting datasets can be quite large, but also noisy and biased since pieces of news are labeled as true or false according to their source label, and not individually fact-checked. In the latter case, assigned labels are more reliable, but the included news articles are usually in a single language and they may reflect unknown editorial decisions. As a result, datasets of the latter type are typically small, homogeneous, and thus unrealistically easy for automatic fake news detection models. In this work, we present FbMultiLingMisinfo, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, aimed at a more realistic evaluation of state-of-the-art misinformation detection models. URLs in our dataset come from the Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Data Set, which we augmented with their propagation paths on Twitter. Our experimental results show that, when GNN-based models are tested on FbMultiLingMisinfo, recent misinformation detection results are only partially confirmed. We further show that a sharp reduction in the training size significantly reduces the model accuracy on FbMultiLingMisinfo, but not on two other widely used benchmark datasets for fake news detection.",

            "abstract": "The opaque reasoning of Graph Neural Networks induces a lack of human trust. Existing graph network explainers attempt to address this issue by providing post-hoc explanations, however, they fail to make the model itself more interpretable. To fill this gap, we introduce the Concept Encoder Module, the first differentiable concept-discovery approach for graph networks. The proposed approach makes graph networks explainable by design by first discovering graph concepts and then using these to solve the task. Our results demonstrate that this approach allows graph networks to: (i) attain model accuracy comparable with their equivalent vanilla versions, (ii) discover meaningful concepts that achieve high concept completeness and purity scores, (iii) provide high-quality concept-based logic explanations for their prediction, and (iv) support effective interventions at test time: these can increase human trust as well as significantly improve model performance.",
