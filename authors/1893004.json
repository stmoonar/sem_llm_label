            "abstract": "A healthy and safe indoor environment is an important part of containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",

            "abstract": "The number of people with dementia (PwD) residing in nursing homes (NH) increases rapidly. Behavioural disturbances (BDs) such as wandering and aggressions are the main reasons to hospitalise these people. Social robots could help to resolve these BDs by performing simple interactions with the patients. This paper examines whether self-learning algorithms could be designed to select the robotic interactions, preferred by the patients, during an intervention. K-armed bandit algorithms were compared in simulated environments for single and multiple patients to \ufb01nd the bene\ufb01cial learning agents and action selection policies. The single patient tests show the advantages of selecting actions according to an Upper Con\ufb01dence Bound (UCB) policy, while the multi-patient tests analyse the bene\ufb01ts of using additional, contextual information. Afterwards, the learning application was provided with a framework to operate in more realistic situations. We expect that this framework can be used for personalised interactions in many different healthcare domains.",

            "abstract": "Summary Objectives: With the uprise of the Internet of Things, wearables and smartphones are moving to the foreground. Ambient Assisted Living solutions are, for example, created to facilitate ageing in place. One example of such systems are fall detection systems. Currently, there exists a wide variety of fall detection systems using different methodologies and technologies. However, these systems often do not take into account the fall handling process, which starts after a fall is identified or this process only consists of sending a notification. The FallRisk system delivers an accurate analysis of incidents occurring in the home of the older adults using several sensors and smart devices. Moreover, the input from these devices can be used to create a social-aware event handling process, which leads to assisting the older adult as soon as possible and in the best possible way. Methods: The FallRisk system consists of several components, located in different places. When an incident is identified by the FallRisk system, the event handling process will be followed to assess the fall incident and select the most appropriate caregiver, based on the input of the smartphones of the caregivers. In this process, availability and location are automatically taken into account. Results: The event handling process was evaluated during a decision tree workshop to verify if the current day practices reflect the requirements of all the stakeholders. Other knowledge, which is uncovered during this workshop can be taken into account to further improve the process. Conclusions: The FallRisk offers a way to detect fall incidents in an accurate way and uses context information to assign the incident to the most appropriate caregiver. This way, the consequences of the fall are minimized and help is at location as fast as possible. It could be concluded that the current guidelines on fall handling reflect the needs of the stakeholders. However, current technology evolutions, such as the uptake of wearables and smartphones, enables the improvement of these guidelines, such as the automatic ordering of the caregivers based on their location and availability.",

            "abstract": "To realize the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, tools are needed to ease the development and deployment of practical applications. Several standard bodies, companies, and ad-hoc consortia are proposing their own solution for inter-device communication. In this context, DYnamic, Adaptive MAnagement of Networks and Devices (DYAMAND) was presented in a previous publication to solve the interoperability issues introduced by the multitude of available technologies. In this paper a DYAMAND case study is presented: in cooperation with a large company, a monitoring application was developed for flexible office spaces in order to reliably reorganize an office environment and give real-time feedback on the usage of meeting rooms. Three wireless sensor technologies were investigated to be used in the pilot. The solution was deployed in a \"friendly user\" setting at a research institute (iMinds) prior to deployment at the large company's premises. Based on the findings of both installations, requirements for an application platform supporting development and management of smart (office) applications were listed. DYAMAND was used as the basis of the implementation. Although the local management of networked devices as provided by DYAMAND enables easier development of intelligent applications, a number of remote services discussed in this paper are needed to enable reliable and up-to-date support (of new technologies).",

            "abstract": "Consumer devices increasingly are \u201csmart\u201d and hence offer services that can interwork with and/or be controlled by others. However, the full exploitation of the inherent opportunities this offers, is hurdled by a number of potential limitations. First of all, the interface towards the device might be vendor and even device specific, implying that extra effort is needed to support a specific device. Standardization efforts try to avoid this problem, but within a certain standard ecosystem the level of interoperability can vary (i.e. devices carrying the same standard logo are not necessarily interoperable). Secondly, different application domains (e.g. multimedia vs. energy management) today have their own standards, thus limiting trans-sector innovation because of the additional effort required to integrate devices from traditionally different domains into novel applications. In this paper, we discuss the basic components of current so-called service discovery protocols (SDPs) and present our DYAMAND (DYnamic, Adaptive MAnagement of Networks and Devices) framework. We position this framework as a middleware layer between applications and discoverable/controllable devices, and hence aim to provide the necessary tool to overcome the (intra- and inter-domain) interoperability gaps previously sketched. Thus, we believe it can act as a catalyst enabling transsector innovation.",
