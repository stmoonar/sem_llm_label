            "abstract": "With advances in the field of Linked (Open) Data (LOD), language data on the LOD cloud has grown in number, size, and variety. With an increased volume and variety of language data, optimizations of methods for distributing, storing, and querying these data become more central. To this end, this position paper investigates use cases at the intersection of LLOD and Big Data, existing approaches to utilizing Big Data techniques within the context of linked data, and discusses the challenges and benefits of this union.",

Prior work has either focused on analysing lexical semantic relations in word embeddings or probing pretrained language models (PLMs), with some exceptions. Given the rarity of highly multilingual benchmarks, it is unclear to what extent PLMs capture relational knowledge and are able to transfer it across languages. To start addressing this question, we propose MultiLexBATS, a multilingual parallel dataset of lexical semantic relations adapted from BATS in 15 languages including low-resource languages, such as Bambara, Lithuanian, and Albanian. As experiment on cross-lingual transfer of relational knowledge, we test the PLMs\u2019 ability to (1) capture analogies across languages, and (2) predict translation targets. We find considerable differences across relation types and languages with a clear preference for hypernymy and antonymy as well as romance languages.",

            "abstract": "The healthcare environment is commonly referred to as\"information-rich\"but also\"knowledge poor\". Healthcare systems collect huge amounts of data from various sources: lab reports, medical letters, logs of medical tools or programs, medical prescriptions, etc. These massive sets of data can provide great knowledge and information that can improve the medical services, and overall the healthcare domain, such as disease prediction by analyzing the patient's symptoms or disease prevention, by facilitating the discovery of behavioral factors for diseases. Unfortunately, only a relatively small volume of the textual eHealth data is processed and interpreted, an important factor being the difficulty in efficiently performing Big Data operations. In the medical field, detecting domain-specific multi-word terms is a crucial task as they can define an entire concept with a few words. A term can be defined as a linguistic structure or a concept, and it is composed of one or more words with a specific meaning to a domain. All the terms of a domain create its terminology. This chapter offers a critical study of the current, most performant solutions for analyzing unstructured (image and textual) eHealth data. This study also provides a comparison of the current Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning techniques in the eHealth context. Finally, we examine and discuss some of the current issues, and we define a set of research directions in this area.",

            "abstract": "With the emergence of social networks, online platforms dedicated to different use cases, and sensor networks, the emergence of large-scale graph community detection has become a steady field of research with real-world applications. Community detection algorithms have numerous practical applications, particularly due to their scalability with data size. Nonetheless, a notable drawback of community detection algorithms is their computational intensity [2], resulting in decreasing performance as data size increases. For this purpose, new frameworks that employ distributed systems such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark which can seamlessly handle large-scale graphs must be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for community detection algorithms, i.e., K-Cliques, Louvain, and Fast Greedy, developed using Apache Spark GraphFrames. We test their performance and scalability on two real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the feasibility of developing graph mining algorithms using Apache Spark GraphFrames.",

We employ simple, yet effective, preprocessing modules that are connected to the state-of-the-art Transformer and we compare the performance of general-purpose, task-specific, and data source-specific flavors of English and multi-language models. This novel approach manages to obtain good results for all tasks, with the best performance in soft-label evaluations rather than hard-label evaluations. We propose 3 types of mixtures that performed best on training data and we notice that they behave well against unseen data. The proposed architecture is easily up-gradable, has low resource costs, and provides good overall results in the EXIST 2024 competition.",

            "abstract": "An important topic in medical research is the process of improving the images obtained from medical devices. As a consequence, there is also a need to improve medical image resolution and analysis. Another issue in this field is the large amount of stored medical data [16]. Human brain databases at medical institutes, for example, can accumulate tens of Terabytes of data per year. In this paper, we propose a novel medical image format representation based on multiple data structures that improve the information maintained in the medical images. The new representation keeps additional metadata information, such as the image class or tags for the objects found in the image. We defined our own ontology to help us classify the objects found in medical images using a multilayer neural network. As we generally deal with large data sets, we used the MapReduce paradigm in the Cloud environment to speed up the image processing. To optimize the transfer between Cloud nodes and to reduce the preprocessing time, we also propose a data compression method based on deduplication. We test our solution for image representation and efficient data transfer in a multisite cloud environment. Our proposed solution optimizes the data transfer with a time improvement of 27% on average.",

            "abstract": "Real-time social media data can provide useful information on evolving hazards. Alongside traditional methods of disaster detection, the integration of social media data can considerably enhance disaster management. In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting geolocation-content communities on Twitter and propose a novel distributed system that provides in near real-time information on hazard-related events and their evolution. We show that content-based community analysis can lead to better and faster dissemination of hazard-related reports than using only traditional methods, such as satellite or airborne sensing platforms. Our distributed disaster reporting system analyzes the social relationship among worldwide geolocated tweets and applies topic modeling to group tweets by topics. Considering for each tweet the following information: user, timestamp, geolocation, retweets, and replies, we create a publisher-subscriber distribution model for topics. We use content similarity and the proximity of nodes to create a new model for geolocation-content based communities. Users can subscribe to different topics in specific geographical areas or worldwide and receive real-time reports regarding these topics. As misinformation can lead to increased damage if propagated in hazards-related tweets, we propose a new deep learning model to detect fake news. The misinformed tweets are then removed from display. We also show empirically the scalability capabilities of the proposed system.",

            "abstract": "Automatic semantic change methods try to identify the changes that appear over time in the meaning of words by analyzing their usage in diachronic corpora. In this paper, we analyze different strategies to create static and contextual word embedding models, i.e., Word2Vec and ELMo, on realworld English and Romanian datasets. To test our pipeline and determine the performance of our models, we first evaluate both word embedding models on an English dataset (SEMEVAL-CCOHA). Afterward, we focus our experiments on a Romanian dataset, and we underline different aspects of semantic changes in this low-resource language, such as meaning acquisition and loss. The experimental results show that, depending on the corpus, the most important factors to consider are the choice of model and the distance to calculate a score for detecting semantic change.",

            "abstract": "As global digitization continues to grow, technology becomes more affordable and easier to use, and social media platforms thrive, becoming the new means of spreading information and news. Communities are built around sharing and discussing current events. Within these communities, users are enabled to share their opinions about each event. Using Sentiment Analysis to understand the polarity of each message belonging to an event, as well as the entire event, can help to better understand the general and individual feelings of significant trends and the dynamics on online social networks. In this context, we propose a new ensemble architecture, EDSA-Ensemble (Event Detection Sentiment Analysis Ensemble), that uses Event Detection and Sentiment Analysis to improve the detection of the polarity for current events from Social Media. For Event Detection, we use techniques based on Information Diffusion taking into account both the time span and the topics. To detect the polarity of each event, we preprocess the text and employ several Machine and Deep Learning models to create an ensemble model. The preprocessing step includes several word representation models, i.e., raw frequency, TFIDF, Word2Vec, and Transformers. The proposed EDSA-Ensemble architecture improves the event sentiment classification over the individual Machine and Deep Learning models.",
