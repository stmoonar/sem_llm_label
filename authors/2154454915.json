            "abstract": "The goal of directed network embedding is to represent the nodes in a given directed network as embeddings that preserve the asymmetric relationships between nodes. While a number of directed network embedding methods have been proposed, we empirically show that the existing methods lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities against degree-related distributional shifts. To mitigate this problem, we propose ODIN (Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding), a new directed NE method where we model multiple factors in the formation of directed edges. Then, for each node, ODIN learns multiple embeddings, each of which preserves its corresponding factor, by disentangling interest factors and biases related to in- and out-degrees of nodes. Our experiments on four real-world directed networks demonstrate that disentangling multiple factors enables ODIN to yield out-of-distribution generalized embeddings that are consistently effective under various degrees of shifts in degree distributions. Specifically, ODIN universally outperforms 9 state-of-the-art competitors in 2 LP tasks on 4 real-world datasets under both identical distribution (ID) and non-ID settings.

            "title": "Ensuring User-side Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "User-side group fairness is crucial for modern recommender systems, alleviating performance disparities among user groups defined by sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age. In the everevolving landscape of user-item interactions, continual adaptation to newly collected data is crucial for recommender systems to stay aligned with the latest user preferences. However, we observe that such continual adaptation often worsen performance disparities. This necessitates a thorough investigation into user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems. This problem is challenging due to distribution shifts, frequent model updates, and nondifferentiability of ranking metrics. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first principled study on ensuring user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems. We start with theoretical analyses on fine-tuning v.s. retraining, showing that the best practice is incremental fine-tuning with restart. Guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose FAir Dynamic rEcommender (FADE), an end-to-end fine-tuning framework to dynamically ensure user-side fairness over time. To overcome the non-differentiability of recommendation metrics in the fairness loss, we further introduce Differentiable Hit (DH) as an improvement over the recent NeuralNDCG method, not only alleviating its gradient vanishing issue but also achieving higher efficiency. Besides that, we also address the instability issue of the fairness loss by leveraging the competing nature between the recommendation loss and the fairness loss. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FADE effectively and efficiently reduces performance disparities with little sacrifice in the overall recommendation performance.",

            "abstract": "Class imbalance is prevalent in real-world node classification tasks and poses great challenges for graph learning models. Most existing studies are rooted in a class-rebalancing (CR) perspective and address class imbalance with class-wise reweighting or resampling. In this work, we approach the root cause of class-imbalance bias from an topological paradigm. Specifically, we theoretically reveal two fundamental phenomena in the graph topology that greatly exacerbate the predictive bias stemming from class imbalance. On this basis, we devise a lightweight topological augmentation framework BAT to mitigate the class-imbalance bias without class rebalancing. Being orthogonal to CR, BAT can function as an efficient plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly combined with and significantly boost existing CR techniques. Systematic experiments on real-world imbalanced graph learning tasks show that BAT can deliver up to 46.27% performance gain and up to 72.74% bias reduction over existing techniques.

            "abstract": "Class imbalance is prevalent in real-world node classification tasks and often biases graph learning models toward majority classes. Most existing studies root from a node-centric perspective and aim to address the class imbalance in training data by node/class-wise reweighting or resampling. In this paper, we approach the source of the class-imbalance bias from an under-explored topology-centric perspective. Our investigation reveals that beyond the inherently skewed training class distribution, the graph topology also plays an important role in the formation of predictive bias: we identify two fundamental challenges, namely ambivalent and distant message-passing , that can exacerbate the bias by aggravating majority-class over-generalization and minority-class misclassification. In light of these findings, we devise a lightweight topological augmentation method T O BA to dynamically rectify the nodes influenced by ambivalent/distant message-passing during graph learning, so as to mitigate the class-imbalance bias. We highlight that T O BA is a model-agnostic, efficient, and versatile solution that can be seamlessly combined with and further boost other imbalance-handling techniques. Systematic experiments validate the superior performance of T O BA in both promoting imbalanced node classification and mitigating the prediction bias between different classes.",

            "abstract": "The directed network embedding problem is to represent the nodes in a given directed network as embeddings (i.e., low-dimensional vectors) that preserve the asymmetric relationships between nodes. While a number of approaches have been developed for this problem, we point out that existing approaches commonly face difficulties in accurately preserving asymmetric proximities between nodes in a sparse network containing a large number of low out- and in-degree nodes. In this paper, we focus on addressing this intrinsic difficulty caused by the lack of information. We first introduce the concept of virtual negative edges (VNEs), which represent latent negative relationships between nodes. Based on the concept, we propose a novel DIrected NE approach with VIrtual Negative Edges, named as DIVINE. DIVINE carefully decides the number and locations of VNEs to be added to the input network. Once VNEs are added, DIVINE learns embeddings by exploiting both the signs and directions of edges. Our experiments on four real-world directed networks demonstrate that adding VNEs alleviates the lack of information about low-degree nodes, thereby enabling DIVINE to yield high-quality embeddings that accurately capture asymmetric proximities between nodes. Specifically, the embeddings obtained by DIVINE lead to up to 10.16% more accurate link prediction, compared to those obtained by state-of-the-art competitors.",
