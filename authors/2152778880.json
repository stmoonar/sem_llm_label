            "title": "Multi-UAV-Assisted Federated Learning for Energy-Aware Distributed Edge Training",
            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has largely extended the border and capacity of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) by providing a key element for enabling flexible distributed data inputs, computing capacity, and high mobility. To enhance data privacy for AIoT applications, federated learning (FL) is becoming a potential solution to perform training tasks locally on distributed IoT devices. However, with the limited onboard resources and battery capacity of each UAV node, optimization is required to achieve a large-scale and high-precision FL scheme. In this work, an optimized multi-UAV-assisted FL framework is designed, where regular IoT devices are in charge of performing training tasks, and multiple UAVs are leveraged to execute local and global aggregation tasks. An online resource allocation (ORA) algorithm is proposed to minimize the training latency by jointly deciding the selection decisions of clients and a global aggregation server. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization technique, virtual energy queues are studied to depict the energy deficit. With the help of the actor-critic learning framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is designed to improve per-round training performance. A deep neural network (DNN)-based actor module is designed to derive client selection decisions, and a critic module is proposed through a conventional optimization method to evaluate the obtained selection decisions. Moreover, a greedy scheme is developed to find the optimal global aggregation server. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ORA algorithm can achieve optimal training latency and energy consumption under various system settings.",

            "abstract": "The collaborative edge and cloud computing system has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the unprecedented high requirements of 5G application scenarios. Due to vendor variations, it is often difficult to manage hardware facilities in such a collaborative system. Moreover, the amount of data generated and tasks requested by end devices are increasing exponentially, which introduces storage and computation bottlenecks. To address these issues, a novel systematic framework called software-defined edge and cloud computing (SD-ECC) is designed to manage the underlying physical resources of edge and cloud layers via software. SD-ECC is combined with an erasure-coded storage system, for which a task scheduling problem is formulated by considering data access and task processing steps. Then, a joint data access and task processing (JDATP) algorithm is proposed to minimize the task response time including data access latency and task processing latency. A practical SD-ECC platform is developed on OpenStack, OpenDaylight, and Kubernetes to conduct experiments with real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed JDATP algorithm can reduce 20.87% of the task response time and increase 14.16% of the remaining storage space on average by comparing it with alternative schemes.",

            "abstract": "Existing surveys and reviews on Influential Node Ranking Methods (INRMs) have primarily focused on technical details, neglecting thorough research on verifying the actual influence of these nodes in a network. This oversight may result in erroneous rankings. In this survey, we address this gap by conducting an extensive analysis of 82 primary studies related to INRMs based on the epidemic model over the past 20 years. We statistically analyze and categorize benchmark networks into four types, and conclude that high-quality networks with complete information are insufficient and most INRMs only focus on undirected and unweighted networks, which encourages collaboration between industry and academia to provide optimized networks. Additionally, we categorize and discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and optimized crafts of seven categories of INRMs, helping engineers and researchers narrow down their choices when selecting appropriate INRMs for their specific needs. Furthermore, we define the Capability and Correctness metrics and utilize their usage frequency and functionality to assist engineers and researchers in prioritizing and selecting suitable metrics for different INRMs and networks. To our knowledge, this is the first survey that systematically summarizes the Capability and Correctness of INRMs, providing insights for the complex network community and aiding INRM selection and evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Network slicing is a promising approach supporting various Internet of Everything applications with diverse and differential requirements. To implement flexible and efficient network slices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) is deployed to leverage aerial and ground segments, which provides multi-dimensional resources involving various hardware devices and facilities (e.g., UAVs, edge servers, and network devices). Such a complex and hierarchical structure requires an efficient framework to orchestrate and control network slices while considering specific and unique characteristics of the UAVs deployed in the system. In this work, we propose a new systematic architecture named slicing-based software-defined MEC in the air, where virtual resource blocks provided by UAVs and edge devices are ubiquitously integrated into network slices to offer customized UAV-enabled MEC services by software-defined technologies. Then we identify three slicing patterns implemented by organized embeddings of UAVs, which are full slicing, partial slicing, and separated slicing patterns. Based on the proposed slicing-based software-defined scheme, two potential application scenarios and some open issues are discussed. In particular, we develop a Lyapunov optimization-based offloading algorithm for the efficient selection of resource slices. Finally, some simulation results are presented to depict the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

            "abstract": "The edge-cloud computing and network slicing have emerged as promising solutions to fulfill the diversity of IoT applications enabled by 5G and beyond. However, edge-cloud computing systems are composed of various hardware facilities, leading to difficulties in hardware control and management. With network slicing, underlying resource sharing among multiple slice users is allowed, leading to potential attacks to the slice formulation processes and malicious usage of network slices that may result in inefficient resource utilization of the system. To address the aforementioned network slice security issue, we first propose a new systematic framework, named software-defined edge-cloud computing (SD-ECC), which applies standard software to control the hardware infrastructure regardless of vendor variations. With SD-ECC, resource slices are formulated by including storage and computational resources provided by edge and cloud servers. Then, we study an optimal slicing-based resource orchestration problem by considering slice-initiated attacks as possible adversaries, which includes both interslice and intraslice resource orchestrations. A secure slicing-based resource orchestration (SS-RO) algorithm is designed by minimizing the delay and resource utilization simultaneously to mitigate the impacts of the slice-initiated attacks, where the Benders decomposition is employed to obtain the interslice orchestration outcome, and a quadratic transformation method is applied to derive the intraslice orchestration solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SS-RO algorithm outperforms baseline schemes in terms of the ratio of accepted attacking tasks, energy consumption, and system throughput.",

First, the response time and energy consumption are reduced for processing tasks locally on the vehicles. Then, the offloading overheads, including latency and energy consumption, are calculated by considering the available resource amount, wireless channel states and vehicle conditions.
