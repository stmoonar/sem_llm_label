            "title": "Guided SQL-Based Data Exploration with User Feedback",
            "abstract": "The exploration of large, real-world databases poses major challenges to users due to their volume and complexity. SQL is the preferred language for data exploration. However, the process of iteratively refining SQL queries is tedious and time consuming. We formulate the automation of personalized SQL-based data exploration as the problem of suggesting the most relevant query and accounting for user feedback at each step. We develop an end-to-end solution and a system to assist users in exploring different components of a complex database. We instantiate our solution using Multi-Armed Bandits, a category of algorithms that are suitable for interactive online learning by balancing exploration with exploitation. We design a lightweight algorithm to personalize stepwise SQL recommendations that efficiently discovers the current user preferences in coordination with that user's feedback and what other users prefer. We run extensive experiments that demonstrate the utility of our approach for large-scale data exploration.",

            "title": "Optimizing Neighborhoods for Fair Top-N Recommendation",
            "abstract": "We address demographic bias in neighborhood-learning models for collaborative filtering recommendations. Despite their superior ranking performance, these methods can learn neighborhoods that inadvertently foster discriminatory patterns. Little work exists in this area, highlighting an important research gap. A notable yet solitary effort, Balanced Neighborhood Sparse LInear Method (BNSLIM) aims at balancing neighborhood influence across different demographic groups. Yet, BNSLIM is hampered by computational inefficiency, and its rigid balancing approach often impacts accuracy. In that vein, we introduce two novel algorithms. The first, an enhancement of BNSLIM, incorporates the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize all similarities concurrently, greatly reducing training time. The second, Fairly Sparse Linear Regression (FSLR), induces controlled sparsity in neighborhoods to reveal correlations among different demographic groups, achieving comparable efficiency while being more accurate. Their performance is evaluated using standard exposure metrics alongside a new metric for user coverage disparities. Our experiments cover various applications, including a novel exploration of bias in course recommendations by teachers\u2019 country development status. Our results show the effectiveness of our algorithms in imposing fairness compared to BNSLIM and other well-known fairness approaches.",
