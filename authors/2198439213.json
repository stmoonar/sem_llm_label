            "abstract": "We present an overview of the BLP Sentiment Shared Task, organized as part of the inaugural BLP 2023 workshop, co-located with EMNLP 2023. The task is defined as the detection of sentiment in a given piece of social media text. This task attracted interest from 71 participants, among whom 29 and 30 teams submitted systems during the development and evaluation phases, respectively. In total, participants submitted 597 runs. However, only 15 teams submitted system description papers. The range of approaches in the submitted systems spans from classical machine learning models, fine-tuning pre-trained models, to leveraging Large Language Model (LLMs) in zero- and few-shot settings. In this paper, we provide a detailed account of the task setup, including dataset development and evaluation setup. Additionally, we provide a succinct overview of the systems submitted by the participants. All datasets and evaluation scripts from the shared task have been made publicly available for the research community, to foster further research in this domain.",

            "title": "Zero- and Few-Shot Prompting with LLMs: A Comparative Study with Fine-tuned Models for Bangla Sentiment Analysis",
            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the digital world has propelled sentiment analysis into a critical tool across diverse sectors such as marketing, politics, customer service, and healthcare. While there have been significant advancements in sentiment analysis for widely spoken languages, low-resource languages, such as Bangla, remain largely under-researched due to resource constraints. Furthermore, the recent unprecedented performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications highlights the need to evaluate them in the context of low-resource languages. In this study, we present a sizeable manually annotated dataset encompassing 33,606 Bangla news tweets and Facebook comments. We also investigate zero- and few-shot in-context learning with several language models, including Flan-T5, GPT-4, and Bloomz, offering a comparative analysis against fine-tuned models. Our findings suggest that monolingual transformer-based models consistently outperform other models, even in zero and few-shot scenarios. To foster continued exploration, we intend to make this dataset and our research tools publicly available to the broader research community.",

            "abstract": "Twenty-first century, there has been moderate forced migration where it articulates human civilization. This forced migration is the identity of various territories and demography. According to this issue, Bangladesh is now the largest populated country for being stateless refugees in the world. The Rohingya community is hopeless about placing their lives, therefore, stateless refugees possessions in the southeastern border region of Bangladesh. Due to the part of Bangladesh addressing that stateless refugees and Bangladeshi peoples and other countries people have a tremendous debate on this issue. Tropically, according to these stateless refugees the victim of hate speech. This study aims to detect the daily report of negativity predicting actual analysis among machine learning approaches using hate speech features. Employed 5 classifiers like SVM, DT, KNN, RF, and NB. Necessary cleaning steps accommodate the model using preprocessing. NB shows the results outcome accuracy of 79% which is more than all other models. The approach of predicting hate speech on stateless refugees took 310 comments data which can rule as a global application..",
