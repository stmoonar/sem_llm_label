We focus on inequalities arising from networks and network-based algorithms and how they affect minorities. In particular, we examine how homophily and mixing biases shape large and small social networks, in\ufb02uence perception of minorities, and affect collaboration patterns. We also discuss dynamical processes on and of networks and the formation of norms and health inequalities. Additionally, we argue that network modeling is paramount for unveiling the effect of ranking and social recommendation algorithms on the visibility of minorities. Finally, we highlight the key challenges and future opportunities in this emerging research topic.",

            "abstract": "Network-based people recommendation algorithms are widely employed on the Web to suggest new connections in social media or professional platforms. While such recommendations bring people together, the feedback loop between the algorithms and the changes in network structure may exacerbate social biases. These biases include rich-get-richer effects, filter bubbles, and polarization. However, social networks are diverse complex systems and recommendations may affect them differently, depending on their structural properties. In this work, we explore five people recommendation algorithms by systematically applying them over time to different synthetic networks. In particular, we measure to what extent these recommendations change the structure of bi-populated networks and show how these changes affect the minority group. Our systematic experimentation helps to better understand when link recommendation algorithms are beneficial or harmful to minority groups in social networks. In particular, our findings suggest that, while all algorithms tend to close triangles and increase cohesion, all algorithms except Node2Vec are prone to favor and suggest nodes with high in-degree. Furthermore, we found that, especially when both classes are heterophilic, recommendation algorithms can reduce the visibility of minorities.",

Here we show that the way social groups interact in face-toface situations can enable the emergence of degree inequality. We present a mechanism that integrates group mixing dynamics with individual preferences, which reproduces group degree inequality found in six empirical data sets of face-to-face interactions. We uncover the impact of group-size imbalance on degree inequality, revealing a critical minority group size that changes social gatherings qualitatively. If the minority group is larger than this \u2018critical mass\u2019 size, it can be a well-connected, cohesive group; if it is smaller, minority cohesion widens degree inequality. Finally, we expose the underrepresentation of social groups in degree rankings due to mixing dynamics and propose a way to reduce such biases.",

            "abstract": "Relational inference leverages relationships between entities and links in a network to infer information about the network from a small sample. This method is often used when global information about the network is not available or difficult to obtain. However, how reliable is inference from a small labeled sample How should the network be sampled, and what effect does it have on inference error How does the structure of the network impact the sampling strategy We address these questions by systematically examining how network sampling strategy and sample size affect accuracy of relational inference in networks. To this end, we generate a family of synthetic networks where nodes have a binary attribute and a tunable level of homophily. As expected, we find that in heterophilic networks, we can obtain good accuracy when only small samples of the network are initially labeled, regardless of the sampling strategy. Surprisingly, this is not the case for homophilic networks, and sampling strategies that work well in heterophilic networks lead to large inference errors. This finding suggests that the impact of network structure on relational classification is more complex than previously thought.",

            "title": "Decay of Relevance in Exponentially Growing Networks",
            "abstract": "We propose a new preferential attachment-based network growth model in order to explain two properties of growing networks: (1) the power-law growth of node degrees and (2) the decay of node relevance. In preferential attachment models, the ability of a node to acquire links is affected by its degree, its fitness, as well as its relevance which typically decays over time. After a review of existing models, we argue that they cannot explain the above-mentioned two properties (1) and (2) at the same time. We have found that apart from being empirically observed in many systems, the exponential growth of the network size over time is the key to sustain the power-law growth of node degrees when node relevance decays. We therefore make a clear distinction between the event time and the physical time in our model, and show that under the assumption that the relevance of a node decays with its age \u03c4, there exists an analytical solution of the decay function f_R with the form f_R(\u03c4) = ?^(\u03c41). Other properties of real networks such as power-law alike degree distributions can still be preserved, as supported by our experiments. This makes our model useful in explaining and analysing many real systems such as citation networks.",

            "abstract": "Emergent patterns of collective attention towards scientists and their research may function as a proxy for scientific impact which traditionally is assessed via committees that award prizes to scientists. Therefore it is crucial to understand the relationships between scientific impact and online demand and supply for information about scientists and their work. In this paper, we compare the temporal pattern of information supply (article creations) and information demand (article views) on Wikipedia for two groups of scientists: scientists who received one of the most prestigious awards in their field and influential scientists from the same field who did not receive an award. Our research highlights that awards function as external shocks which increase supply and demand for information about scientists, but hardly affect information supply and demand for their research topics. Further, we find interesting differences in the temporal ordering of information supply between the two groups: (i) award-winners have a higher probability that interest in them precedes interest in their work; (ii) for award winners interest in articles about them and their work is temporally more clustered than for non-awarded scientists.",

            "abstract": "Sampling from large networks represents a fundamental challenge for social network research. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of different sampling techniques (node sampling, edge sampling, random walk sampling, and snowball sampling) on social networks with attributes. We consider the special case of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male and female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is unequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes with the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e., homophilic or heterophilic behavior). We evaluate the different sampling techniques with respect to conserving the position of nodes and the visibility of groups in such networks. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic and empirical social networks. Our results provide evidence that different network sampling techniques are highly sensitive with regard to capturing the expected centrality of nodes, and that their accuracy depends on relative group size differences and on the level of homophily that can be observed in the network. We conclude that uninformed sampling from social networks with attributes thus can significantly impair the ability of researchers to draw valid conclusions about the centrality of nodes and the visibility or invisibility of groups in social networks.",
