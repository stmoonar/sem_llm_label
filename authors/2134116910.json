            "title": "Identification of Communities With Multi-Semantics via Bayesian Generative Model",
            "abstract": "Discovering communities is an essential step in the analysis of complex systems, and it has two purposes: to identify functional modules and to interpret semantics. However, most of the existing community detection methods only focused on identify communities, while learning the semantics interpretation of communities has not been fully studied. In this paper, we focused on the problem of identifying communities and learning the semantics interpretation of modules jointly in an end-to-end model. We designed a novel generative model which combines two closely related parts, one for community discovery and the other for content clustering and semantics interpretation. By extracting the potential correlation between these two parts, our new method is not only robust to discovering communities, but also able to provide a community with more than one semantic topic. As for model inference, we developed a variational algorithm from a Bayesian point of view. Experimental results on the artificial benchmark and real networks showed the superior performance of the proposed approach over existing methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We also analyzed semantic interpretability of community detection results through a case study over a large-scale music platform dataset.",

By analyzing of confidentiality and integrity, exampling of the star network intelligent substation as the model, using Modelsim and OPNET as simulation software for different lengths of GOOSE messages to carryout security line processing and communication delay, we obtain the total delay of the communication security model. Experiments show that the intelligent substation GOOSE message communication security processing program has both good security and real-time.",

The first application only provides the clients plain text communication service but the second one ensures everyone to connect others securely by encrypting messages. In the related scenario, we conduct the simulation to collect and analyze all global statistics of two versions of the communication application respectively. The results of the analysis on the simulation is used to evaluate the feasibility of different encrypting schemes and the conclusion helps to develop more useful communication applications.",
