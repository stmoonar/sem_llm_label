            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly transforming scientific research. Explainable AI methods, such as concept-based models (CMs), are promising for driving new scientific discoveries because they make predictions based on meaningful concepts and offer insights into the prediction process. In molecular science, however, explainable CMs are not as common compared to black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), primarily due to their requirement for predefined concepts and manual label for each instance, which demand domain knowledge and can be labor-intensive. This paper introduces a novel framework for Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) generation and labeling. AutoMolCo leverages the knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate predictive molecular concepts and label them for each molecule. Such procedures are repeated through iterative interactions with LLMs to refine concepts, enabling simple linear models on the refined concepts to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The whole AutoMolCo framework is automated without any human knowledge inputs in either concept generation, labeling, or refinement, thereby surpassing the limitations of extant CMs while maintaining their explainability and allowing easy intervention. Through systematic experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets, we demonstrate that the AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial and promising for molecular science research.",

            "abstract": "Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.",

            "title": "Hierarchical Compression of Text-Rich Graphs via Large Language Models",
            "abstract": "Text-rich graphs, prevalent in data mining contexts like e-commerce and academic graphs, consist of nodes with textual features linked by various relations. Traditional graph machine learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), excel in encoding the graph structural information, but have limited capability in handling rich text on graph nodes. Large Language Models (LLMs), noted for their superior text understanding abilities, offer a solution for processing the text in graphs but face integration challenges due to their limitation for encoding graph structures and their computational complexities when dealing with extensive text in large neighborhoods of interconnected nodes. This paper introduces ``Hierarchical Compression'' (HiCom), a novel method to align the capabilities of LLMs with the structure of text-rich graphs. HiCom processes text in a node's neighborhood in a structured manner by organizing the extensive textual information into a more manageable hierarchy and compressing node text step by step. Therefore, HiCom not only preserves the contextual richness of the text but also addresses the computational challenges of LLMs, which presents an advancement in integrating the text processing power of LLMs with the structural complexities of text-rich graphs. Empirical results show that HiCom can outperform both GNNs and LLM backbones for node classification on e-commerce and citation graphs. HiCom is especially effective for nodes from a dense region in a graph, where it achieves a 3.48% average performance improvement on five datasets while being more efficient than LLM backbones.",

            "abstract": "Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.",
