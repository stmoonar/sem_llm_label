            "abstract": "There is currently an increasing demand for cryptoasset analysis tools among cryptoasset service providers, the financial industry in general, as well as across academic fields. At the moment, one can choose between commercial services or low-level open-source tools providing programmatic access. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of another option: the GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics Platform, which can be used for interactive investigations of monetary flows and, more importantly, for executing advanced analytics tasks using a standard data science tool stack. By providing a growing set of open-source components, GraphSense could ultimately become an instrument for scientific investigations in academia and a possible response to emerging compliance and regulation challenges for businesses and organizations dealing with cryptoassets.",

            "abstract": "Proposed in 2016 and launched in 2018, the Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning Network (LN) can scale-up the capacity of the BTC blockchain network to process a significantly higher amount of transactions, in a faster, cheaper, and more privacy preserving manner. The number of LN nodes has been significantly increasing since 2018, and today there are more than twelve thousand nodes actively participating of so-called LN payment channels. The upcoming Taproot upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol would further boost the development and adoption of the LN. Taproot is the most significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network since the block size increase of 2017, and it will make LN transactions cheaper, more flexible, and more private. We focus on the characterization of the LN network topology, using network active measurements. By crawling the underlying P2P network supporting the Bitcoin LN over a span of 10-months, we unveil the LN in terms of size and location of its nodes as well as connectivity protocols, comparing it to the P2P IP network supporting the BTC blockchain. Among our findings, we show that IP addresses exposed by LN nodes correspond mainly to customer networks, even if most BTC nodes are actually deployed at major cloud providers, and that LN nodes significantly rely on anonymized networks and protocols such as Onion, with more than 40% of LN nodes connect through Tor.",

            "title": "All that Glitters is not Bitcoin \u2013 Unveiling the Centralized Nature of the BTC (IP) Network",
            "abstract": "Blockchains are typically managed by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks providing the support and substrate to the so-called distributed ledger (DLT), a replicated, shared, and syn-chronized data structure, geographically spread across multiple nodes. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain is by far the most well-known DLT, used to record transactions among peers, based on the BTC digital currency. In this paper we focus on the network side of the BTC P2P network, analyzing its nodes from a purely network measurements-based approach. We present a BTC crawler able to discover and track the BTC P2P network through active measurements, and use it to analyze its main properties. Through the combined analysis of multiple snapshots of the BTC network as well as by using other publicly available data sources on the BTC network and DLT, we unveil the BTC P2P network, locate its active nodes, study their performance, and track the evolution of the network over the past two years. Among other relevant findings, we show that (i) the size of the BTC network has remained almost constant during the last 12 months \u2013 since the major BTC price drop in early 2018, (ii) most of the BTC P2P network resides in US and EU countries, and (iii) despite this western network locality, most of the mining activity and corresponding revenue is controlled by major mining pools located in China. By additionally analyzing the distribution of BTC coins among independent BTC entities (i.e., single BTC addresses or groups of BTC addresses controlled by the same actor), we also conclude that (iv) BTC is very far from being the decentralized and uncontrolled system it is so much advertised to be, with only 4.5% of all the BTC entities holding about 85% of all circulating BTC coins.",

            "abstract": "Miners play a key role in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin: they invest substantial computational resources in processing transactions and minting new currency units. It is well known that an attacker controlling more than half of the network's mining power could manipulate the state of the system at will. While the influence of large mining pools appears evenly split, the actual distribution of mining power within these pools and their economic relationships with other actors remain undisclosed. To this end, we conduct the first in-depth analysis of mining reward distribution within three of the four largest Bitcoin mining pools and examine their cross-pool economic relationships. Our results suggest that individual miners are simultaneously operating across all three pools and that in each analyzed pool a small number of actors (<= 20) receives over 50% of all BTC payouts. While the extent of an operator's control over the resources of a mining pool remains an open debate, our findings are in line with previous research, pointing out centralization tendencies in large mining pools and cryptocurrencies in general.",

            "title": "Spams meet Cryptocurrencies: Sextortion in the Bitcoin Ecosystem",
            "abstract": "In the past year, a new spamming scheme has emerged: sexual extortion messages requiring payments in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, also known as sextortion. This scheme represents a first integration of the use of cryptocurrencies by members of the spamming industry. Using a dataset of 4,340,736 sextortion spams, this research aims at understanding such new amalgamation by uncovering spammers' operations. To do so, a simple, yet effective method for projecting Bitcoin addresses mentioned in sextortion spams onto transaction graph abstractions is computed over the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This allows us to track and investigate monetary flows between involved actors and gain insights into the financial structure of sextortion campaigns. We find that sextortion spammers are somewhat sophisticated, following pricing strategies and benefiting from cost reductions as their operations cut the upper-tail of the spamming supply chain. We discover that one single entity is likely controlling the financial backbone of the majority of the sextortion campaigns and that the 11-month operation studied yielded a lower-bound revenue between $1,300,620 and $1,352,266. We conclude that sextortion spamming is a lucrative business and spammers will likely continue to send bulk emails that try to extort money through cryptocurrencies.",
