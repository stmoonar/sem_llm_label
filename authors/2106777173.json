            "title": "Cooperative Route Planning Framework for Multiple Distributed Assets in Maritime Applications",
            "abstract": "This work formalizes the Route Planning Problem (RPP), wherein a set of distributed assets (e.g., ships, submarines, unmanned systems) simultaneously plan routes to optimize a team goal (e.g., find the location of an unknown threat or object in minimum time and/or fuel consumption) while ensuring that the planned routes satisfy certain constraints (e.g., avoiding collisions and obstacles). This problem becomes overwhelmingly complex for multiple distributed assets as the search space grows exponentially to design such plans. The RPP is formalized as a Team Discrete Markov Decision Process (TDMDP) and we propose a Multi-agent Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MaMoRL) framework for solving it. We investigate challenges in deploying the solution in real-world settings and study approximation opportunities. We experimentally demonstrate MaMoRL's effectiveness on multiple real-world and synthetic grids, as well as for transfer learning. MaMoRL is deployed for use by the Naval Research Laboratory - Marine Meteorology Division (NRL-MMD), Monterey, CA.",

            "title": "Guided Task Planning Under Complex Constraints",
            "abstract": "Creating a plan, i.e., composing a sequence of items to achieve a task is inherently complex if done manually. This requires not only finding a sequence of relevant items but also understanding user requirements and incorporating them as constraints. For instance, in course planning, items are core and elective courses, and degree requirements capture their complex dependencies as constraints. In trip planning, items are points of interest (POIs) and constraints represent time and monetary budget, two user-specified requirements. Most importantly, a plan must comply with the ideal interleaving of items to achieve a goal such as enhancing students' skills towards the broader learning goal of an education program, or in the travel scenario, improving the overall user experience. We study the Task Planning Problem (TPP) with the goal of generating a sequence of items that optimizes multiple objectives while satisfying complex constraints. TPP is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process, and we adapt weighted Reinforcement Learning to learn a policy that satisfies complex dependencies between items, user requirements, and satisfaction. We present a computational framework RL-Planner for TPP. RL-Planner requires minimal input from domain experts (academic advisors for courses, or travel agents for trips), yet produces personalized plans satisfying all constraints. We run extensive experiments on datasets from university programs and from travel agencies. We compare our solutions with plans drafted by human experts and with fully automated approaches. Our experiments corroborate that existing automated solutions are not suitable to solve TPP and that our plans are highly comparable to expensive handcrafted ones.",

            "title": "Multi-Session Diversity to Improve User Satisfaction in Web Applications",
            "abstract": "In various Web applications, users consume content in a series of sessions. That is prevalent in online music listening, where a session is a channel and channels are listened to in sequence, or in crowdsourcing, where a session is a set of tasks and task sets are completed in sequence. Content diversity can be defined in more than one way, e.g., based on artists or genres for music, or on requesters or rewards in crowdsourcing. A user may prefer to experience diversity within or across sessions. Naturally, intra-session diversity is set-based, whereas, inter-session diversity is sequence-based. This novel multi-session diversity gives rise to four bi-objective problems with the goal of minimizing or maximizing inter and intra diversities. Given the hardness of those problems, we propose to formulate a constrained optimization problem that optimizes inter diversity, subject to the constraint of intra diversity. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve our problem. Our experiments with human subjects on two real datasets, music and crowdsourcing, show our diversity formulations do serve different user needs, and yield high user satisfaction. Our large data experiments on real and synthetic data empirically demonstrate that our solution satisfy the theoretical bounds and is highly scalable, compared to baselines.",
