            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

It has originally been developed for x86_64. But with increasing popularity of ARM64 based HPC clusters, the DAOS community has also started to validate DAOS on ARM64.

In this paper, we evaluated the seven HPC applications and benchmarks on the A64FX. In a performance comparison with Marvell (Cavium) ThunderX2 processor and Intel Xeon Skylake processor, the A64FX achieved higher performance in a memory bandwidth-intensive application thanks to its high memory bandwidth. However, we confirmed that the performance of the A64FX decreased from a lack of out-of-order resources. To mitigate this problem, the \u201cloop fission\u201d function of the Fujitsu compiler was used to improve the performance.",

            "abstract": "At RIKEN, we are developing supercomputer Fugaku (formerly called as Post-K), which is the successor of K Computer, and aiming for official operation around 2021. It is expected to consume more power than K Computer, and because of the power saving functions of modern microprocessors the variation in the power consumption between the idle and peak states will be significantly larger and occur within a very short duration. However, an ordinary liquid cooling system cannot accommodate such large and rapid variations. Therefore, we are planning to employ software-based countermeasures to achieve stable operation of the cooling system. Such countermeasures will function in job management software such as schedulers, and predict the future behaviors of the water temperature with respect to scheduling information and affect the scheduling to confine the behaviors of the cooling system. Since these behaviors are sufficiently complicated that a simple estimation is unsatisfactory, we decided to employ simulations, and we model the cooling system using the popular modeling language Modelica. In this paper, we report some preliminary simulation and validation results using data from the existing cooling system of K Computer. We also discuss some of the issues of using Modelica simulations as a prediction tool.",

Pyne provides a programming environment in which programmers select data structures, define the sequence of operations for the data, and implement some sequential functions to describe the detailed calculation rules for the operations. Pyne automatically creates parallel data structures and performs parallel executions. This paper discusses the programming interface and runtime optimization algorithms that enable the parallel programming model. We evaluated Pyne by implementing a fluid dynamics simulation with both Pyne and a state-of-the-art parallel library. The results show that Pyne succeeds at reducing the code size by 70%, while maintaining performance and scalability.",

            "abstract": "Leading-edge supercomputer systems have been designed to achieve the highest computational performance possible for running a wide variety of large-scale simulations, and the pre- and post-processing are usually not considered in the main design feature. Although supercomputer systems may have peculiar CPU architecture, the auxiliary computational systems tend to use commodity based hardware and software in the form of servers and clusters. In the case of the K computer operational environment, at RIKEN R-CCS, the supercomputer itself is based on SPARC64 fx CPU architecture, and pre- and post-processing servers are based on traditional x86 CPU architecture. In this poster we present a large data visualization environment developed for this peculiar HPC operational environment, presenting some of the efforts made to meet the large data visualization needs. It is publicly known that the next-generation leading-edge Japanese supercomputer will abandon this CPU architecture in favor of another architecture, but we expect that some of the knowledge obtained in this development will also be useful for this future coming supercomputer system.",

            "abstract": "Scientific applications consist of many tasks and each task has different requirements for the degree of parallelism and data access pattern. To satisfy these requirements, a task scheduling has to assign required number of processes to each task and task's input has to be decomposed and arranged to these processes by considering data access pattern to exploit data locality. However, hand-writing these code is a troublesome and error-prone work. We propose a multi-view data model where users can specify rules of data decomposition for multi-dimensional data to change data layout on top of processes and define unit of parallel processing by simple directives. Our framework conducts data arrangement and affinity-aware task scheduling transparently from users by following the specified rules. Through a case study of a lattice QCD simulation program, we confirmed that our proposal reduced programming efforts against hand-written MPI code with performance penalties up to 17%.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present a study on the available open-source software (OSS) for large-scale data visualization on the SPARC64fx based HPC systems, such as the K computer and also the Fujitsu PRIMEHPC FX family of supercomputers (FX10 and FX100), which are commonly available throughout Japan. It is widely known that these HPC systems have been generating a vast amount of simulation results in a wide range of science and engineering fields. However, there was no much information regarding the large-scale data visualization software and approaches in such HPC infrastructure. In this work, we focused on the visualization approaches where the HPC hardware resources are directly used for the visualization processing, which can be helpful to minimize the large data transfer issue for the visualization and analysis purposes. This study includes both OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and non-OpenGL based visualization approaches, and also the availability of the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) handling functionalities. Although it is a short survey focusing only on the post-processing issue, we expect that this study can be useful and helpful for the current and future potential users of the SPARC64fx CPU based HPC systems, which are still in active use throughout Japan.",

            "abstract": "HPC operational environments usually have supporting computational systems for assisting pre-and post-processing activities such as the visualization and analysis of simulation results. A wide variety of hardware systems can be found at different HPC sites, and in our case, we have a CPU-only (x86) large memory server, and there is a plan to replace this with a modern OpenStack-based CPU/GPU Cluster. HPC systems themselves can also be used for executing visualization related processing when applying the in-situ approach, and in our case this will be a SPARC64 fx CPU based HPC system (K computer). It is publicly announced that the current system will be replaced with an ARM based HPC system in a near future. Therefore heterogeneity and scalability are needed to be tackled in order to efficiently use these heterogeneous computational resources for large-scale data visualization on both post-hoc and in-situ contexts. In this poster we present HIVE (Heterogeneously Integrated Visual-analytics Environment), a cross-platform and modular ecosystem for providing visualization service building blocks in such heterogeneous computational environments. Lightweight Lua scripting language is used to glue necessary visualization pipeline related modules, and this loosely coupled modular approach facilitates the long-term development and maintenance.",

            "abstract": "Tapas is a C++ programming framework for developing hierarchical N-body algorithms such as Barnes-Hut and Fast Multipole Method, designed to experiment new implementations including even variations of tree traversals. A pairwise interaction calculation in N-body simulations, or an all-pairs operation, is an important part of Tapas for performance, which enables accelerations with GPUs. However, there is no commonly agreed all-pairs interface appropriate as a primitive, and moreover, it is not supported in existing data-parallel libraries for GPUs such as NVIDIA's Thrust. Thus, we designed an interface for an all-pairs operation that can be easily adopted in libraries and applications. Tapas's all-pairs has an extra function argument for flexibility, which corresponds to a consumer function of the result of an all-pairs that is missing in existing designs. This addition is not an ad hoc one, but it is guided by the consideration of algorithmic skeletons, which indicates the effect of the added argument cannot be substituted by the other arguments in general. The change is just adding an argument, but it gives flexibility to process the result, and the resulting implementation can attain almost the same performance as the tuned N-body implementation in the CUDA examples.",
