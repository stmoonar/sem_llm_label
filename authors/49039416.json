            "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently enjoyed great success as an efficient self-supervised representation learning approach. However, the existing methods have focused on designing of contrastive modes and used data augmentation with a rigid and inefficient one-to-one sampling strategy. We adopted node neighborhoods to extend positive samplings and made avoided resorting to data augmentation to create different views. We also considered the homophily problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between the inter-class node pairs. The key novelty of our method hinged upon analyzing this GNNs problem and integrating the GCL sampling strategy with homophily discrimination, where we solved these two significant problems using one approach. We introduced a new parameterized neighbor sampling component to replace the conventional sub-optimal samplings. By keeping and updating the neighbor sets, both the positive sampling of GCL and the message passing of GNNs can be optimized. Moreover, we theoretically proved that the new method provided a lower bound of mutual information for unsupervised semantic learning, and it can also keep the lower bound with downstream tasks. In essence, our method is a new self-supervised approach, which we refer to as group discrimination, and it can make the downstream fine-tuning efficient. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the new method can significantly outperform the existing GCL methods because the former can solve the homophily problem in a self-supervised",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are potent models of complex systems. In practice, many nodes in an HIN have their attributes unspecified, resulting in significant performance degradation for supervised and unsupervised representation learning. We developed an unsupervised heterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach for analyzing HINs with missing attributes (HGCA). HGCA adopts a contrastive learning strategy to unify attribute completion and representation learning in an unsupervised heterogeneous framework. To deal with a large number of missing attributes and the absence of labels in unsupervised scenarios, we proposed an augmented network to capture the semantic relations between nodes and attributes to achieve a fine-grained attribute completion. Extensive experiments on three large real-world HINs demonstrated the superiority of HGCA over several state-of-the-art methods. The results also showed that the complemented attributes by HGCA can improve the performance of existing HIN models.",

            "abstract": "Abnormal expressions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with various human diseases. Identifying disease-related lncRNAs can help clarify complex disease pathogeneses. The latest methods for lncRNA-disease association prediction rely on diverse data about lncRNAs and diseases. These methods, however, cannot adequately integrate the neighbour topological information of lncRNA and disease nodes. Moreover, more intrinsic features of lncRNA-disease node pairs can be explored to better predict their latent associations. We developed a novel method, named GTAN, to predict the association propensities between lncRNAs and diseases. GTAN integrates various information about lncRNAs and diseases, and exploits neighbour topology and attribute representations of a pair of lncRNA-disease nodes. We adopted in GTAN a graph neural network architecture with three attention mechanisms and multi-layer convolutional neural networks. First, a neighbour-level self-attention mechanism is constructed to learn the importance of each neighbour for an interested lncRNA or disease node. Second, topology-level attention is proposed to enhance contextual dependencies among multiple local topology representations. An attention-enhanced graph neural network framework is then established to learn a topology representation of top-ranked neighbours. GTAN also has attribute-level attention to distinguish various contributions of attributes of the lncRNA-disease pair. Finally, attribute representation is learned by multi-layer CNN to integrate detailed features and representative features of the pair. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that GTAN outperformed state-of-the-art methods. The ablation studies confirmed the important contributions of three attention mechanisms. Case studies on three cancers further showed GTAN\u2019s ability in discovering potential lncRNA candidates related to diseases.",

            "abstract": "Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research.",

            "abstract": "Community detection has been extensively studied for various applications. Recent research has started to explore node contents to identify semantically meaningful communities. However, links in real networks typically have semantic descriptions and communities of links can better characterize community behaviors than communities of nodes. The second issue in community finding is that the most existing methods assume network topologies and descriptive contents carry the same or compatible information of node group membership, restricting them to one topic per community, which is generally violated in real networks. The third issue is that the existing methods use top ranked words or phrases to label topics when interpreting communities, which is often inadequate for comprehension. To address these issues altogether, we propose a new Bayesian probabilistic approach for modeling real networks and developing an efficient variational algorithm for model inference. Our new method explores the intrinsic correlation between communities and topics to discover link communities and extract semantically meaningful community summaries at the same time. If desired, it is able to derive more than one topical summary per community to provide rich explanations. We present experimental results to show the effectiveness of our new approach and evaluate the method by a case study.",

            "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation can help users stay on top of the current affairs without being overwhelmed by the endless torrents of online news. However, the freshness or timeliness of news has been largely ignored by current news recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach dubbed HyperNews which explicitly models the effect of timeliness on news recommendation. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task of predicting the so-called \"active-time\" that users spend on each news article. Our key finding is that it is beneficial to address the problem of news recommendation together with the related problem of active-time prediction in a multi-task learning framework. Specifically, we train a double-task deep neural network (with a built-in timeliness module) to carry out news recommendation and active-time prediction simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such a \"kill-two-birds-with-one-stone\" solution has seldom been tried in the field of news recommendation before. Our extensive experiments on real-life news datasets have not only confirmed the mutual reinforcement of news recommendation and active-time prediction but also demonstrated significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art news recommendation techniques.",

            "abstract": "Identification of disease-associated microRNAs (disease miRNAs) is an essential step towards discovering causal miRNAs and understanding disease pathogenesis. Two sources of information can be exploited for predicting disease miRNAs: one includes the connections between miRNAs, between diseases, and between miRNAs and diseases, and the other has the attributes of miRNA nodes. The former contains information of miRNA similarities, disease similarities, and miRNA-disease associations. The latter includes the information of the families and clusters that miRNAs belong to. Similar diseases are usually associated with miRNAs that have similar functions and common attributes. However, most of the existing methods for disease miRNA prediction focus only on the connections of miRNAs and diseases. It remains challenging to adequately integrate the connections and miRNA node attributes to identify more reliable candidate disease miRNAs. We propose a non-negative matrix factorization based method, FamCluRank, for predicting disease miRNAs in heterogeneous networks with node attributes. One of the novelties of FamCluRank is to fully utilize these two oversighted characteristics of miRNAs and focuses particularly on a deep integration of miRNA families and cluster attributes. In particular, the integration was achieved by three different means. We first constructed a miRNA-disease heterogeneous network with node attributes where the miRNA nodes have their family and cluster attributes. Second, miRNAs sharing more common families and clusters are more likely to be associated with the diseases that are also related to these families and clusters. On the basis of the biological premise, we constructed a novel prediction model of FamCluRank to deeply integrate the family and cluster attributes of miRNAs. Third, two similar diseases tend to be associated with more common miRNA families and clusters, and vice versa. Hence, FamCluRank's prediction model is constructed by concerning not only the possible associations between miRNAs and diseases but also the possible disease-family and disease-cluster associations. Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods showed FamCluRank's superior performance not only on the well-characterized diseases but also on the new ones. Case studies on colorectal neoplasms, pancreatic neoplasms, lung neoplasms, and 32 new diseases demonstrated its ability for discovering potential disease miRNAs. FamCluRank is a potent prioritization tool for screening the reliable candidates for subsequent studies concerning their involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases. The web service of FamCluRank, the candidate disease miRNAs for 329 diseases, and the dataset used to develop FamCluRank are available at http://www.famclurank.top.",

            "title": "Early and Efficient Identification of Useless Constraint Propagation for Alldifferent Constraints",
            "abstract": "Constraints propagation and backtracking are two basic techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). During the search for a solution, the variable and value pairs that do not belong to any solution can be discarded by constraint propagation to ensure generalized arc consistency so as to avoid the fruitless search. However, constraint propagation is frequently invoked often with little effect on many CSPs. Much effort has been devoted to predicting when to invoke constraint propagation for solving a CSP; however, no effective approach has been developed for the alldifferent constraint. Here we present a novel theorem for identifying the edges in a value graph of alldifferent constraint whose removal can significantly reduce useless constraint propagation. We prove that if an alternating cycle exists for a prospectively removable edge that represents a variable-value assignment, the edge (and the assignment) can be discarded without constraint propagation. Based on this theorem, we developed a novel optimizing technique for early detection of useless constraint propagation which can be incorporated in any existing algorithm for alldifferent constraint. Our implementation of the new method achieved speedup by a factor of 1-5 over the state-of-art approaches on 93 benchmark problem instances in 8 domains. Furthermore, the new algorithm is scalable well and runs increasingly faster than the existing methods on larger problems.",

            "title": "Modeling with Node Popularities for Autonomous Overlapping Community Detection",
            "abstract": "Overlapping community detection has triggered recent research in network analysis. One of the promising techniques for finding overlapping communities is the popular stochastic models, which, unfortunately, have some common drawbacks. They do not support an important observation that highly connected nodes are more likely to reside in the overlapping regions of communities in the network. These methods are in essence not truly unsupervised, since they require a threshold on probabilistic memberships to derive overlapping structures and need the number of communities to be specified a priori. We develop a new method to address these issues for overlapping community detection. We first present a stochastic model to accommodate the relative importance and the expected degree of every node in each community. We then infer every overlapping community by ranking the nodes according to their importance. Second, we determine the number of communities under the Bayesian framework. We evaluate our method and compare it with five state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. We also apply this new method to two applications, showing its superb performance on practical problems.",

            "abstract": "Network embedding (NE) maps a network into a low-dimensional space while preserving intrinsic features of the network. Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) has been actively studied for NE. These VAE-based methods typically utilize both network topologies and node semantics and treat these two types of data in the same way. However, the information of network topology and information of node semantics are orthogonal and are often from different sources; the former quantifies coupling relationships among nodes, whereas the latter represents node specific properties. Ignoring this difference affects NE. To address this issue, we develop a network-specific VAE for NE, named as NetVAE. In the encoding phase of our new approach, compression of network structures and compression of node attributes share the same encoder in order to perform co-training to achieve transfer learning and information integration. In the decoding phase, a dual decoder is introduced to reconstruct network topologies and node attributes separately. Specifically, as a part of the dual decoder, we develop a novel method based on a Gaussian mixture model and the block model to reconstruct network structures. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks demonstrate a superior performance of the new approach over the state-of-the-art methods.",
