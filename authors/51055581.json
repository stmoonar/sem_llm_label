            "title": "Diverse Counterfactual Explanations for Anomaly Detection in Time Series",
            "abstract": "Data-driven methods that detect anomalies in times series data are ubiquitous in practice, but they are in general unable to provide helpful explanations for the predictions they make. In this work we propose a model-agnostic algorithm that generates counterfactual ensemble explanations for time series anomaly detection models. Our method generates a set of diverse counterfactual examples, i.e, multiple perturbed versions of the original time series that are not considered anomalous by the detection model. Since the magnitude of the perturbations is limited, these counterfactuals represent an ensemble of inputs similar to the original time series that the model would deem normal. Our algorithm is applicable to any differentiable anomaly detection model. We investigate the value of our method on univariate and multivariate real-world datasets and two deep-learning-based anomaly detection models, under several explainability criteria previously proposed in other data domains such as Validity, Plausibility, Closeness and Diversity. We show that our algorithm can produce ensembles of counterfactual examples that satisfy these criteria and thanks to a novel type of visualisation, can convey a richer interpretation of a model's internal mechanism than existing methods. Moreover, we design a sparse variant of our method to improve the interpretability of counterfactual explanations for high-dimensional time series anomalies. In this setting, our explanation is localised on only a few dimensions and can therefore be communicated more efficiently to the model's user.",

The core assumption behind these models is that there is a latent graph between the time series (nodes) that governs the evolution of the multivariate time series. By parameterizing a graph in a differentiable way, the models aim to improve forecasting quality. We compare four recent models of this class on the forecasting task. Further, we perform ablations to study their behavior under changing conditions, e.g., when disabling the graph-learning modules and providing the ground-truth relations instead.

            "abstract": "Time series data are often corrupted by outliers or other kinds of anomalies. Identifying the anomalous points can be a goal on its own (anomaly detection), or a means to improving performance of other time series tasks (e.g. forecasting). Recent deep-learning-based approaches to anomaly detection and forecasting commonly assume that the proportion of anomalies in the training data is small enough to ignore, and treat the unlabeled data as coming from the nominal data distribution. We present a simple yet effective technique for augmenting existing time series models so that they explicitly account for anomalies in the training data. By augmenting the training data with a latent anomaly indicator variable whose distribution is inferred while training the underlying model using Monte Carlo EM, our method simultaneously infers anomalous points while improving model performance on nominal data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by combining it with a simple feed-forward forecasting model. We investigate how anomalies in the train set affect the training of forecasting models, which are commonly used for time series anomaly detection, and show that our method improves the training of the model.",

The interaction of the IoT with the physical environment creates strong security, privacy, and safety implications. It makes providing adequate security for IoT $\\mu$ Ss essential. However, the complexity of IoT services makes detecting anomalous behavior difficult.We present a machine-learning based approach for modeling IoT service behavior by only observing inter-service communication. Our algorithm continuously learns $\\mu$S models on distributed IoT nodes within an IoT site. Combining the learned models within and in-between IoT sites converges our $\\mu$S models within short time. Sharing the resulting stable models among compute nodes enables good anomaly detection.As one application, firewalling IoT $\\mu$ Ss becomes possible. Combining our autonomous $\\mu$S modeling with firewalling enables retrofitting security to existing IoT installations. We enable retrofitting access control to existing non-secure IoT installations.Our proposed approach is resource efficient, matching the requirements of the IoT. To evaluate the quality of our proposed algorithm, we show its behavior for a set of common IoT attacks. We evaluate how domain knowledge enables us to decorrelate events on a node, and how adding context features improves the detection rate.",

Recently, a novel theory for the encoding of transitions between two places has been developed. This theory uses scale-space to speed up computational performance. To apply this encoding of the transitions, a scale-space representation of the environment is needed. To answer this need, a biologically inspired localization system is presented in this work. To encode each position in the environment a descriptor is built using spatial sensors. The design of the descriptors is inspired by boundary vector cells to thereby test a new theory about their function in the brain. The descriptors are then compared with each other on multiple scales of approximation to estimate the distance between them without using global coordinates. The comparison algorithm is inspired by the scale-space theory from computer vision.",
