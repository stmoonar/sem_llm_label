            "abstract": "Deep learning-based epileptic seizure recognition via electroencephalogram signals has shown considerable potential for clinical practice. Although deep learning algorithms can enhance epilepsy identification accuracy compared with classical machine learning techniques, classifying epileptic activities based on the association between multichannel signals in electroencephalogram recordings is still challenging in automated seizure classification from electroencephalogram signals. Furthermore, the performance of generalization is hardly maintained by the fact that existing deep learning models were constructed using just one architecture. This study focuses on addressing this challenge using a hybrid framework. Alternatively put, a hybrid deep learning model, which is based on the ground-breaking graph neural network and transformer architectures, was proposed. The proposed deep architecture consists of a graph model to discover the inner relationship between multichannel signals and a transformer to reveal the heterogeneous associations between the channels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the comparison experiments were conducted on a publicly available dataset between the state-of-the-art algorithms and ours. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is a potentially valuable instrument for epoch-based epileptic EEG classification.",

            "abstract": "Central neuropathic pain (CNP) after spinal cord injury (SCI) is related to the plasticity of cerebral cortex. The plasticity of cortex recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG) signal can be used as a biomarker of CNP. To analyze changes in the brain network mechanism under the combined effect of injury and pain or under the effect of pain, this paper mainly studies the changes of brain network functional connectivity in patients with neuropathic pain and without neuropathic pain after SCI. This paper has recorded the EEG with the CNP group after SCI, without the CNP group after SCI, and a healthy control group. Phase-locking value has been used to construct brain network topological connectivity maps. By comparing the brain networks of the two groups of SCI with the healthy group, it has been found that in the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] frequency bands, the injury increases the functional connectivity between the frontal lobe and occipital lobes, temporal, and parietal of the patients. Furthermore, the comparison of brain networks between the group with CNP and the group without CNP after SCI has found that pain has a greater effect on the increased connectivity within the patients' frontal lobes. Motor imagery (MI) data of CNP patients have been used to extract one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP) and common spatial pattern (CSP) features, the left and right hand movements of the patients' MI have been classified. The proposed LBP-CSP feature method has achieved the highest accuracy of 98.6% and the average accuracy of 91.5%. The results of this study have great clinical significance for the neural rehabilitation and brain-computer interface of CNP patients.",

            "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) based on deep learning has been significantly improved. However, existing works have not adequately excavate the spatial-temporal information between EEG channels. Besides, most works mainly focus on patient-specific scenarios while cross-patient seizure detection is more challenging and meaningful. Regarding the above problems, we propose a hybrid attention network (HAN) for automatic seizure detection. Specifically, the graph attention network (GAT) extracts spatial features at the front end, and Transformer gets time features as the back end. HAN leverages the attention mechanism and fully extracts the spatial-temporal correlation of EEG signals. The focal loss function is introduced to HAN to deal with the imbalance of the dataset accompanied by seizure detection based on EEG. Both patient-specific and patient-independent experiments are carried out on the public CHB-MIT database. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HAN in both experimental settings.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder caused by brain dysfunction, which could cause uncontrolled behavior, loss of consciousness and other hazards. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an indispensable auxiliary tool for clinical diagnosis. Great progress has been made by current seizure identification methods. However, the performance of the methods on different patients varies a lot. In order to deal with this problem, we propose an automatic seizure identification method based on brain connectivity learning. The connectivity of different brain regions is modeled by a graph. Different from the manually defined graph structure, our method can extract the optimal graph structure and EEG features in an end-to-end manner. Combined with the popular graph attention neural network (GAT), this method achieves high performance and stability on different patients from the CHB-MIT dataset. The average values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and AUC of the proposed model are 98.90[Formula: see text], 98.33[Formula: see text], 98.48[Formula: see text], 97.72% and 98.54%, respectively. The standard deviations of the above five indicators are 0.0049, 0.0125, 0.0116 and 0.0094, respectively. Compared with the existing seizure identification methods, the stability of the proposed model is improved by 78-95%.",

As a type of multichannel signal, the association between all of the channels in EEG samples can be further utilized. To implement the classification of epileptic seizures from the nonseizures in EEG samples, one graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)-based framework is proposed for capturing the spatial enhanced pattern of multichannel signals to characterize the behavior of EEG activity, which is capable of visualizing the salient regions in each sequence of EEG samples. Meanwhile, the presented GCNN could be exploited to discriminate normal, ictal and interictal EEGs as a novel classifier. To evaluate the proposed approach, comparison experiments were conducted between state-of-the-art techniques and ours.

The deep learning algorithms in the MI-BCI system require lots of training samples, but the electroencephalogram (EEG) data of stroke patients is quite scarce. Therefore, the expansion of EEG data has become an important part of stroke clinical rehabilitation research. In this paper, a deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) model is proposed to generate artificial EEG data and further expand the scale of the stroke dataset. First, multichannel one-dimensional EEG data is converted into a two-dimensional EEG spectrogram using EEG2Image based on the modified S-transform. Then, DCGAN is used to artificially generate EEG data based on MI. Finally, the validity of the generated artificial EEG data is proved. This paper preliminarily indicates that generating artificial stroke data is a promising strategy, which contributes to the further development of stroke clinical rehabilitation.",

            "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a vital role in accelerating epilepsy diagnosis. Previous researches on seizure detection mainly focused on extracting time-domain and frequency-domain features from single electrodes, while paying little attention to the positional correlations between different EEG channels of the same subject. Moreover, data imbalance is common in seizure detection scenarios where the duration of nonseizure periods is much longer than the duration of seizures. To cope with the two challenges, a novel seizure detection method based on graph attention network (GAT) is presented. The approach acts on graph-structured data and takes the raw EEG data as input. The positional relationship between different EEG signals is exploited by GAT. The loss function of the GAT model is redefined using the focal loss to tackle data imbalance problem. Experiments are conducted on the CHB-MIT dataset.

            "abstract": "Robotic arms are powerful assistants in many industrial production environments, and they run periodically in accordance with preset actions to complete specified operations. However, they may act abnormally when encountering unexpected situation and then lead to unnecessary loss. Recognizing the abnormal actions of robotic arms through surveillance video can automatically help us to understand their operating status and discover possible abnormalities in time. We designed a deep learning architecture based on 3D convolution for abnormal action recognition. The 3D convolutional layer can extract the spatial and temporal features of the robotic arm movements from the video frame difference sequence. The features are compressed and streamlined by the maximum pooling layer to obtain concise and effective robotic arm action features. Finally, the fully connected layer is used to classify the features to recognize the abnormal robotic arm tasks. Support vector data description (SVDD) model is employed to detect abnormal actions of the robotic arm, and the well-trained SVDD model can distinguish the normal actions from the three kinds of abnormal actions with the Area Under Curve (AUC) 99.17% .",

            "abstract": "This study describes a method for classifying electrocorticograms (ECoGs) based on motor imagery (MI) on the brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) system. This method is different from the traditional feature extraction and classification method. In this paper, the proposed method employs the deep learning algorithm for extracting features and the traditional algorithm for classification. Specifically, we mainly use the convolution neural network (CNN) to extract the features from the training data and then classify those features by combing with the gradient boosting (GB) algorithm. The comprehensive study with CNN and GB algorithms will profoundly help us to obtain more feature information from brain activities, enabling us to obtain the classification results from human body actions. The performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated on the dataset I of BCI Competition III. Furthermore, the combination of deep learning and traditional algorithms provides some ideas for future research with the BCI systems.",

            "title": "Decoding spectro-temporal representation for motor imagery recognition using ECoG-based brain-computer interfaces.",
            "abstract": "One of the challenges in brain-computer interface systems is obtaining motor imagery recognition from brain activities. Brain-signal decoding robustness and system performance improvement during the motor imagery process are two of the essential issues in brain-computer interface research. In conventional approaches, ineffective decoding of features and high complexity of algorithms often lead to unsatisfactory performance. A novel method for the recognition of motor imagery tasks is developed based on employing a modified S-transforms for spectro-temporal representation to characterize the behavior of electrocorticogram activities. A classifier is trained by using a support vector machine, and an optimized wrapper approach is applied to guide selection to implement the representation selection obtained. A channel selection algorithm optimizes the wrapper approach by adding a cross-validation step, which effectively improves the classification performance. The modified S-transform can accurately capture event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization phenomena and can effectively locate sensorimotor rhythm information. The optimized wrapper approach used in this scheme can effectively reduce the feature dimension and improve algorithm efficiency. The method is evaluated on a public electrocorticogram dataset with a recognition accuracy of 98% and an information transfer rate of 0.8586 bit/trial. To verify the effect of the channel selection, both electrocorticogram and electroencephalogram data are experimentally analyzed. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of this scheme demonstrates its potential for online brain-computer interface systems in future cognitive tasks.",
