            "abstract": "The annual Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) is a premier venue for the scientific workflow community to present the latest advances in research and development on the many facets of scientific workflows throughout their life-cycle. The Lightning Talks at WORKS focus on describing a novel tool, scientific workflow, or concept, which are work-in-progress and address emerging technologies and frameworks to foster discussion in the community. This paper summarizes the lightning talks at the 2023 edition of WORKS, covering five topics: leveraging large language models to build and execute workflows; developing a common workflow scheduler interface; scaling uncertainty workflow applications on exascale computing systems; evaluating a transcriptomics workflow for cloud vs. HPC systems; and best practices in migrating legacy workflows to workflow management systems.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.

            "abstract": "Today's scientific applications are increasingly relying on a variety of data sources, storage facilities, and computing infrastructures, and there is a growing demand for data analysis and visualization for these applications. In this context, exploiting Big Data frameworks for scientific computing is an opportunity to incorporate high-level libraries, platforms, and algorithms for machine learning, graph processing, and streaming; inherit their data awareness and fault-tolerance; and increase productivity. Nevertheless, limitations exist when Big Data platforms are integrated with an HPC environment, namely poor scalability, severe memory overhead, and huge development effort. This paper focuses on a popular Big Data framework -Apache Spark- and proposes an architecture to support the integration of highly scalable MPI block-based data models and communication patterns with a map-reduce-based programming model. The resulting platform preserves the data abstraction and programming interface of Spark, without conducting any changes in the framework, but allows the user to delegate operations to the MPI layer. The evaluation of our prototype shows that our approach integrates Spark and MPI efficiently at scale, so end users can take advantage of the productivity facilitated by the rich ecosystem of high-level Big Data tools and libraries based on Spark, without compromising efficiency and scalability.",

            "abstract": "Large scale computing infrastructures have been widely developed with the core objective of providing a suitable platform for high-performance and high-throughput computing. These systems are designed to support resource-intensive and complex applications, which can be found in many scientific and industrial areas. Currently, large scale data-intensive applications are hindered by the high latencies that result from the access to vastly distributed data. Recent works have suggested that improving data locality is key to move towards exascale infrastructures efficiently, as solutions to this problem aim to reduce the bandwidth consumed in data transfers, and the overheads that arise from them. There are several techniques that attempt to move computations closer to the data. In this survey we analyse the different mechanisms that have been proposed to provide data locality for large scale high-performance and high-throughput systems. This survey intends to assist scientific computing community in understanding the various technical aspects and strategies that have been reported in recent literature regarding data locality. As a result, we present an overview of locality-oriented techniques, which are grouped in four main categories: application development, task scheduling, in-memory computing and storage platforms. Finally, the authors include a discussion on future research lines and synergies among the former techniques. Keywords\u2014 Co-scheduling, data-centric, data-intensive, data locality, in-memory storage, large scale.",

Our goal was to assess and discuss the suitability of such data-intensive-oriented mechanisms for production-ready work-\ufb02ows, especially in terms of scalability, focusing on a key element in the Big Data ecosystem: the data-centric programming model. Hence, we reproduced the functionality of a MPI-based iterative work\ufb02ow from the hydrology domain, EnKF-HGS, using the Spark data analysis framework.

            "title": "A Multi-Objective Simulator for Optimal Power Dimensioning on Electric Railways using Cloud Computing",
            "abstract": "Power dimensioning and energy saving have been traditionally two main issues regarding the deployment of \n \nelectric grids. Electric railways are also concerned about these issues, and simulators have been traditionally \n \nused to test such infrastructure deployments. The main goal of this paper is to present the Railway electric \n \nPower Consumption Simulator, a simulation model and tool for the railway energy provisioning problem. This \n \nsimulator aims to propose electric railway infrastructure deployments, optimizing the quality of the electric \n \nflow supplied to train, as well as saving as much energy as possible. The paper describes the simulator \n \nstructure, as well as the ontology used to translate railway infrastructure elements into an electric circuit. \n \nBecause these two objectives are conflicting, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved. \n \nFinally, a standard railway scenario is used to illustrate the capabilities of the tool, trying to find the best \n \nelectric substation placements in order to optimize such objectives. The evaluation shows how the tool can \n \nhandle hundreds of simulated scenarios using Cloud Computing techniques.",
