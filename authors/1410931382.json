            "title": "Online Detection of Topic Change in Social Posts",
            "abstract": "Gaining deep insights of the social Web content is a challenging Big Data analytics problem, especially when dealing with social posts of high volume and arrival rate consisting of high variable topics. Detecting and tracking the topics that the users discuss in popular microblogging applications like Twitter and studying the evolution of each topic reveals crowd interests and intelligence. The evolution summarizes the changes that are occurring on the topics over a given time horizon inside the evolving data stream. For instance, some topics may disappear at some point in time due to lack of users' interest, while others are retained over time adopting either a stable or an evolving behaviour. The analysis and storage of such dynamic and massive content with spatio-thematic properties poses new challenges for research.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes an extension of the classification trees to time series input variables. A new split criterion based on time series proximities is introduced. First, it relies on an adaptive (i.e., parametrized) time series metric to cover both behavior and values proximities. The metric's parameters may change from one internal node to another to best bisect the set of time series. Second, it involves the automatic extraction of the most discriminating sub-sequences. The proposed time series classification tree is applied to a wide range of datasets: public and new, real and synthetic, univariate and multivariate data. We show, through the carried out experiments, that the proposed tree outperforms temporal trees using standard time series distances, and leads to good performances compared to other competitive time series classifiers.",
