            "abstract": "We present Travel Bird, a novel personalized destination recommendation and exploration interface which allows its users to find their next tourist destination by describing their specific preferences in a narrative form. Unlike other solutions, Travel Bird is based on TourBERT, a novel NLP model we developed, specifically tailored to the tourism domain. Travel Bird creates a two-dimensional personalized destination exploration space from TourBERT embeddings of social media content and the users' textual description of the experience they are looking for. In this demo, we will showcase several use cases for Travel Bird, which are beneficial for consumers and destination management organizations.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly important for extracting new insights from unstructured text data, and pre-trained language models now have the ability to perform state-of-the-art tasks like topic modeling, text classification, or sentiment analysis. Currently, BERT is the most widespread and widely used model, but it has been shown that a potential to optimize BERT can be applied to domain-specific contexts. While a number of BERT models that improve downstream tasks\u2019 performance for other domains already exist, an optimized BERT model for tourism has yet to be revealed. This study thus aimed to develop and evaluate TourBERT, a pre-trained BERT model for the tourism industry. It was trained from scratch and outperforms BERT-Base in all tourism-specific evaluations. Therefore, this study makes an essential contribution to the growing importance of NLP in tourism by providing an open-source BERT model adapted to tourism requirements and particularities.",

The results of LDA appear homogeneous and overlapping, whereas the extracted topics of NMF are not specific enough to gain deep insights.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study assesses different topic modelling algorithms for knowledge extraction in the highly heterogeneous tourism industry. The findings unfold the complexity of analysing short-text social media data and strengthen the use of CorEx in analysing Instagram content.\n",

            "abstract": "Abstract \nThe concept of touristic space is continually evolving, due to the advent of new technologies. Today, physical space and virtual space are interwoven, creating a phenomenon that can be described using the term \u2018phygital\u2019. The perception of touristic space as well as the interaction with it has been altered by phygital appearances and changing travel behaviour. While interaction with the touristic space previously only occupied a physical dimension, virtual information now enriches all stages of the customer journey (CJ). Hence, this chapter deals with new technologies, analysing their impact on the perception of touristic space for the traveller throughout the whole CJ. Thereby Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are cited as examples of state-of-the-art technologies, which wield a direct perceptional impact, as they have the power to blend together one\u2019s perception of real and virtual space.",

            "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology with a broad range of use. The tourism industry, more specifically destinations, may benefit from its potential in the near future. By using VR in its marketing strategy, destinations have a substantial influence on the information search process and the decision-making process of potential tourists. Tourists can experience the destination, its atmosphere and possible emotions beforehand. Thus, they can create a more detailed destination image and realistic expectations of their visit. This transfers them into a better position to decide whether or not to visit a destination. This experimental study takes a closer look into a destination\u2019s promotional material by analysing and comparing a self-designed brochure with an existing VR video of the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. A total of 101 experiments were conducted at Fachhochschule Salzburg and UniparkNonntal. The research shows that VR transforms the information search experience into a faster, more interactive, and more detailed process compared to traditional promotional material. The results can be beneficial for destinations to understand how relevant using VR for tourism promotion is. The Gaze: Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Vol.9 2018 p.53-68",

            "abstract": "The term Web 2.0 is currently on everyone\u2019s lips; even the tourism industry is awash with decision makers who are frantically searching for standardized, practicable guidelines on how not to sleep through yet again what has been touted as the new era of the Internet Version 2.0\u2014especially now that we are finally getting a handle on Version 1.0. As to be expected, the checklists and manuals we have long searched for that offer us instruction on how to encounter this phenomenon are for the most part lacking. This is not surprising when you consider confronting the challenges of an extraordinarily vague formulation. In workshops, symposiums, and congresses, people throw catchwords and technical terms about in an effort to describe what Web 2.0 stands for and determine its apparent meaning for tourism. Profound issues and attempts at explanations are rare indeed, and empirically verified statements are almost wholly lacking. Therefore, the aim of this article is to deliver a selection of sociological explanatory approaches, thereby creating the theoretical starting blocks for further research efforts. Consequently, the objective here cannot be to explain the theories in their entirety and discuss in detail their individual contributions to the various Web 2.0 phenomena. Instead, the goal is to bring to light starting points for a theoretically founded debate on the subject. The overview in the form of a table at the end of the contribution describes selected sociological approaches and puts them into the context of Web 2.0 and tourism by way of examples.",
