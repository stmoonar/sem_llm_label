            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Wikibase -- which is the software underlying Wikidata -- is a powerful platform for knowledge graph creation and management. However, it has been developed with a crowd-sourced knowledge graph creation scenario in mind, which in particular means that it has not been designed for use case scenarios in which a tightly controlled high-quality schema, in the form of an ontology, is to be imposed, and indeed, independently developed ontologies do not necessarily map seamlessly to the Wikibase approach. In this paper, we provide the key ingredients needed in order to combine traditional ontology modeling with use of the Wikibase platform, namely a set of \\emph{axiom} patterns that bridge the paradigm gap, together with usage instructions and a worked example for historical data.",

            "abstract": ". The notion of Linked Open Science rests on the assump-tion that Linked Data principles contribute to science and scienti\ufb01c data management in several distinct ways (e.g., by adding rich semantics to improve retrieval and reuse of data). This begs the question of the right level of granularity for such semantic enrichment. On the one extreme of the spectrum, one may provide semantic annotations on the level of entire datasets to improve retrieval while leaving the actual data un-touched. On the other end, one may semantically describe every single datum, such as a particular observation leading to data that supports reasoning, automated con\ufb02ation, and so on, while, at the same time, dra-matically increasing the size of data, including redundancy. This paper reports on our experience in modeling heterogeneous environmental data using a semantically-enabled observation framework, namely the SOSA ontology and its extensions to handle observation collections. We discuss di\ufb00erent means of using these observation collections and compare their pros and cons in terms of data size and ease of querying.",

            "abstract": "The integration of data along a common spatial component remains an obstacle in many problem spaces. One promising method for integrating data in such a way is through the use of a common, underlying spatial reference system, such as a Discrete Global Grid (e.g., the S2 Grid System), and pre-computing spatial relations between features and the constituent components at a spatial resolution appropriate for the data and use case. That is, by emphasizing the notion of the cell, we can examine what is in a cell, predict contents of its parent and child cells, and quickly get an overview of spatially co-located features and regions of interest without having to directly compute spatial interactions. This paper provides an ontology design pattern, to be used as a structural template, for modeling how features or regions map onto a hierarchical grid system and addresses how the attributes of these features may be inherited upwards or downwards through the hierarchy. We furthermore provide a motivating example and implementation.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth of the Linked Data on the Web has greatly facilitated collecting data from remote sensors, from air quality sensors spread out across a city, to seismograph stations spread across the entire world. Integrating these heterogeneous data can be quite challenging; however one can achieve this through the use of available W3C standards to create a knowledge graph. For this use case, the W3C also provides a standard, the Sensor, Observation, Sample, Actuator (SOSA) Ontology, that allows for the semantic encoding of sensors and their observations. However, even with the guidance of this standard, it may be difficult to produce a correct graph with high fidelity from heterogeneous sources. In this paper we present a set of (data) shape constraints, called SOSA-SHACL, for the SOSA ontology using a data validation language, namely the W3C standard SHACL (Shape Constraint Language). These constraints enable us to evaluate whether the modeled observations in our Knowledge Graph comply with the SOSA recommendations. Furthermore, we show through several case studies how the closed world assumption plays a role in the process of designing such shape constraints, especially as SOSA is based on the open world assumption.",

This ontology alignment system focuses on producing simple and complex alignment between ontologies that are populated with instance data. This is the second participation of AROA in the OAEI campaign, and it produces the best performance in terms of relaxed F-measure on two benchmarks in complex track, which are populated GeoLink and populated Enslaved.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The development of semi-automated and automated ontology alignment techniques is an important part of realizing the potential of the Semantic Web. Until very recently, most existing work in this area was focused on finding simple (1:1) equivalence correspondences between two ontologies. However, many real-world ontology pairs involve correspondences that contain multiple entities from each ontology. These \u2018complex\u2019 alignments pose a challenge for existing evaluation approaches, which hinders the development of new systems capable of finding such correspondences. This position paper surveys and analyzes the requirements for effective evaluation of complex ontology alignments and assesses the degree to which these requirements are met by existing approaches. It also provides a roadmap for future work on this topic taking into consideration emerging community initiatives and major challenges that need to be addressed.",
