            "title": "Prediction Model for Information Dissemination in Social Network Media Based on Triangle Ring Attractor",
            "abstract": "In order to solve the information transfer of social network media, a new information transfer prediction method is presented by a triangle ring attractor. At first, the description method of social media information is given in this model, and the evaluation indexes such as information recall rate, matching degree, and recall rate are emphatically expounded. At the same time, the characteristics of media information are analyzed with a triangular ring attractor, and an information transfer prediction model is established. Finally, through the simulation experiment, the key factors influencing the method are deeply analyzed. Experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, this method has good adaptability in the degree of information attenuation and information checking rate.",
