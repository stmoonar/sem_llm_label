            "title": "Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows",
            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

            "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nInferring a gene regulatory network exclusively from microarray expression profiles is a difficult but important task. The aim of this work is to compare the predictive power of some of the most popular algorithms in different conditions (like data taken at equilibrium or time courses) and on both synthetic and real microarray data. We are in particular interested in comparing similarity measures both of linear type (like correlations and partial correlations) and of non-linear type (mutual information and conditional mutual information), and in investigating the underdetermined case (less samples than genes).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn our simulations we see that all network inference algorithms obtain better performances from data produced with 'structural' perturbations, like gene knockouts at steady state, than with any dynamical perturbation. The predictive power of all algorithms is confirmed on a reverse engineering problem from Escherichia coli gene profiling data: the edges of the 'physical' network of transcription factor-binding sites are significantly overrepresented among the highest weighting edges of the graph that we infer directly from the data without any structure supervision. Comparing synthetic and in vivo data on the same network graph allows us to give an indication of how much more complex a real transcriptional regulation program is with respect to an artificial model.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nSoftware is freely available at the URL http://people.sissa.it/~altafini/papers/SoBiAl07/.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
