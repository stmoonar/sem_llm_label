            "title": "FeReD: Federated Reinforcement Learning in the DBMS",
            "abstract": "Federated learning enables clients to enrich their locally trained models via updates performed by a coordination server based on aggregates of local models. There are multiple advances in methods and applications of federated learning, in particular in cross-device federation, where clients having limited data and computational resources collaborate in a joint learning problem. Given the constraint of limited resources in cross-device federation, we study the potential benefits of embedded in-DBMS learning, illustrated in a federated reinforcement learning problem. We demonstrate FeReD, a system that contrasts the performance of cross-device federation using Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm. FeReD offers step-by-step guidance for in-DBMS SQLite implementation challenges for both horizontal and vertical data partitioning. FeReD also allows to contrast the Q-learning implementations in SQLite vs a standard Python implementation, by highlighting their learning performance, computational efficiency, succinctness and expressiveness. A video of FeReD is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kRIu_C5RZA and its open source code at https://github.com/sotostzam/FeReD.",
