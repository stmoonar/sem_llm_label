            "abstract": "Data integration, data analytics and decision support methods can help increase agriculture challenges such as climate change adaptation or food security. In this context, smart data acquisition systems, interoperable information systems and frameworks for data structuring are required. In this chapter we describe methods for data identification and provide some recommendations. We also describe how to enrich data with semantics and a way to tag data with the relevant ontology. We illustrate the proposed approach in a case of high-throughput plant phenotyping.",

            "abstract": "The EPPN2020 is a research project funded by Horizon 2020 Programme of the EU that will provide European public and private scientific sectors with access to a wide range of state-of-the-art plant phenotyping installations, techniques and methods. Specifically, EPPN2020 includes access to 31 plant phenotyping installations, and joint research activities to develop: novel technologies and methods for environmental and plant measurements.\nHere we present the results of the discussions of the 2019 annual project meeting to adopt community-approved architectural choices. It focuses on persistent identification of data and real objects, the naming of variables and the priorities for increasing interoperability among phenotyping installations. We describe the main elements to prioritize (the good) in order to enhance Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) quality for each data management system with a pragmatic concern for all partners. \nThe plant phenotyping community gathers different actors with various means and practices. Among all the recommendations (including the bad: avoiding bad practices), the community requests identification methods (including the use of ontologies) compatible with the \u2018local\u2019 pre-existing ones. \nThe identification scheme being adopted is based on Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) with independant left and right parts for each identifier. It focuses on the associated objects and variables common to all EPPN2020 members, namely the experimental units (which can be a plant in a pot or a plot), sensors and variables. A common architecture for identifiers and variable names is presented in order to enable a first level of interoperation between information systems.\n\nIn conclusion, we present some of the next challenges (the ugly) that need to be addressed by the EPPN2020 community related with i) the partial reuse of pre-existing ontologies, ii) the persistence of long-term access to data iii) interoperation between all potential users of the phenotyping data.",

            "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) in a field context presents a number of methodological problems. For this reason, as a part of three French research projects focused on this type of evaluation, Matriochkas, Micromegas and Roulepur, a working group on methodological harmonisation was established in order to facilitate the inter-comparison of results between the projects and propose a methodological guideline for practitioners carrying out such evaluations. The guideline proposes an approach where performance is evaluated with respect to a service function that the SuDS aims to achieve, itself identified from local issues. Its first section presents the various service functions which may be assigned to these devices. Next, performance indicators are defined for a selection of the identified service functions, common within the French context and studied as a part of the three projects. Three categories of indicators are identified: hydrologic indicators (relative to water flows), pollutant indicators and socio-technical indicators. Examples of instrumentation and of the application of the proposed indicators drawn from the experience of the three projects are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Modern genomic breeding methods rely heavily on very large amounts of phenotyping and genotyping data, presenting new challenges in effective data management and integration. Recently, the size and complexity of datasets have increased significantly, with the result that data are often stored on multiple systems. As analyses of interest increasingly require aggregation of datasets from diverse sources, data exchange between disparate systems becomes a challenge. Results To facilitate interoperability among breeding applications, we present the public plant Breeding Application Programming Interface (BrAPI). BrAPI is a standardized web service API specification. The development of BrAPI is a collaborative, community-based initiative involving a growing global community of over a hundred participants representing several dozen institutions and companies. Development of such a standard is recognized as critical to a number of important large breeding system initiatives as a foundational technology. The focus of the first version of the API is on providing services for connecting systems and retrieving basic breeding data including germplasm, study, observation, and marker data. A number of BrAPI-enabled applications, termed BrAPPs, have been written, that take advantage of the emerging support of BrAPI by many databases. Availability and implementation More information on BrAPI, including links to the specification, test suites, BrAPPs, and sample implementations is available at https://brapi.org/. The BrAPI specification and the developer tools are provided as free and open source.",

            "abstract": "Summary Phenomic datasets need to be accessible to the scientific community. Their reanalysis requires tracing relevant information on thousands of plants, sensors and events. The open\u2010source Phenotyping Hybrid Information System (PHIS) is proposed for plant phenotyping experiments in various categories of installations (field, glasshouse). It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that apply to both field and controlled conditions. For instance, the genotype is declared for a plant or plot and is associated with all objects related to it. Events such as successive plant positions, anomalies and annotations are associated with objects so they can be easily retrieved. Its ontology\u2010driven architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It interoperates with external resources via web services, thereby allowing data integration into other systems; for example, modelling platforms or external databases. It has the potential for rapid diffusion because of its ability to integrate, manage and visualize multi\u2010source and multi\u2010scale data, but also because it is based on 10 yr of trial and error in our groups.",

Research in bioinformatics field does not outside this trend. This paper presents some approaches aiming to solve the Big Data problem by combining the increase in semantic search capacity on existing data in the plant research laboratories. This helps us to strengthen user experiments on the data obtained in this research by infering new knowledge. To achieve this, there exist several approaches having different characteristics and using different platforms. Nevertheless, we can summarize it in two main directions: the query re-writing and data transformation to RDF graphs. In reality, we can solve the problem from origin of increasing capacity on semantic data with triplets. Thus, data transformation to RDF graphs direction was chosen to work on the practical part. However, the synchronization data in the same format is required before processing the triplets because our current data are heterogeneous. The data obtained for triplets are larger that regular triplestores could manage. So we evaluate some of them thus we can compare the benefits and drawbacks of each and choose the best system for our problem.",

We believe our work is the first to investigate profile diversity to address the problem of returning highly popular but too-focused documents. We show how to adapt Fagin's threshold-based algorithms to return the most relevant and most popular documents that satisfy content and profile diversities and run preliminary experiments on two benchmarks to validate our scoring function.",

Classical data management solutions, which have proved effective in many application domains, are not efficient at dealing with scientific data in life science. We describe a management software of data from wine fermentations and associated knowledge. The information dealt with in this framework relates to the knowledge of real-time events occurring during fermentations. The data have been entered into a database and we propose an organisation of this knowledge to improve efficiency, based on the use of methods and tools from the Semantic Web. A specific ontology of events (faults or enological operations) is used to automatically identify wrong on-line measurements which clearly improved data quality and understanding.",

            "abstract": "In order to select the best predictive neural-network architecture in a set of several candidate networks, we propose a general Bayesian nonlinear regression model comparison procedure, based on the maximization of an expected utility criterion. This criterion selects the model under which the training set achieves the highest level of internal consistency, through the predictive probability distribution of each model. The density of this distribution is computed as the model posterior predictive density and is asymptotically approximated from the assumed Gaussian likelihood of the data set and the related conjugate prior density of the parameters. The use of such a conjugate prior allows the analytic calculation of the parameter posterior and predictive posterior densities, in an empirical-Bayes-like approach. This Bayesian selection procedure allows us to compare general nonlinear regression models and in particular feedforward neural networks, in addition to embedded models as usual with asymptotic comparison tests.",
