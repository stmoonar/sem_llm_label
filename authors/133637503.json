            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for clustering multivariate time-series data. However, real-world time-series data often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we present a S elf-supervised L earning-based A pproach to C lustering multivariate T ime-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding challenge surrounding deep learning algorithms is unpacking and understanding how they make their decisions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) offers methods to provide explanations of internal functions of algorithms and reasons behind their decisions in ways that are interpretable and understandable to human users. . Numerous XAI approaches have been developed thus far, and a comparative analysis of these strategies seems necessary to discern their relevance to clinical prediction models. To this end, we first implemented two prediction models for short- and long-term outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) utilizing structured tabular as well as time-series physiologic data, respectively. Six different interpretation techniques were used to describe both prediction models at the local and global levels. We then performed a critical analysis of merits and drawbacks of each strategy, highlighting the implications for researchers who are interested in applying these methodologies. The implemented methods were compared to one another in terms of several XAI characteristics such as understandability, fidelity, and stability. Our findings show that SHAP is the most stable with the highest fidelity but falls short of understandability. Anchors, on the other hand, is the most understandable approach, but it is only applicable to tabular data and not time series data.",

            "title": "WindowSHAP: An Efficient Framework for Explaining Time-series Classifiers based on Shapley Values",
            "abstract": "Unpacking and comprehending how black-box machine learning algorithms (such as deep learning models) make decisions has been a persistent challenge for researchers and end-users. Explaining time-series predictive models is useful for clinical applications with high stakes to understand the behavior of prediction models, e.g., to determine how different variables and time points influence the clinical outcome. However, existing approaches to explain such models are frequently unique to architectures and data where the features do not have a time-varying component. In this paper, we introduce WindowSHAP, a model-agnostic framework for explaining time-series classifiers using Shapley values. We intend for WindowSHAP to mitigate the computational complexity of calculating Shapley values for long time-series data as well as improve the quality of explanations. WindowSHAP is based on partitioning a sequence into time windows. Under this framework, we present three distinct algorithms of Stationary, Sliding and Dynamic WindowSHAP, each evaluated against baseline approaches, KernelSHAP and TimeSHAP, using perturbation and sequence analyses metrics. We applied our framework to clinical time-series data from both a specialized clinical domain (Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI) as well as a broad clinical domain (critical care medicine). The experimental results demonstrate that, based on the two quantitative metrics, our framework is superior at explaining clinical time-series classifiers, while also reducing the complexity of computations. We show that for time-series data with 120 time steps (hours), merging 10 adjacent time points can reduce the CPU time of WindowSHAP by 80% compared to KernelSHAP. We also show that our Dynamic WindowSHAP algorithm focuses more on the most important time steps and provides more understandable explanations. As a result, WindowSHAP not only accelerates the calculation of Shapley values for time-series data, but also delivers more understandable explanations with higher quality.",

            "abstract": "We developed a prognostic model for longer-term outcome prediction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) using an attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN). The model was trained on admission and time series data obtained from a multi-site, longitudinal, observational study of TBI patients. We included 110 clinical variables as model input and Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOSE) at six months after injury as the outcome variable. Designed to handle missing values in time series data, the RNN model was compared to an existing TBI prognostic model using 10-fold cross validation. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the RNN model is 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) for binary outcomes, whereas the AUC of the comparison model is 0.69 (95% CI 0.67-0.71). We demonstrated that including time series data into prognostic models for TBI can boost the discriminative ability of prediction models with either binary or ordinal outcomes.",

We prove that the error in the Gaussian process model is bounded tightly when going from the original high-dimensional search domain to the lowdimensional embedding. This implies that the optimization process in the low-dimensional embedding proceeds essentially as if it were run directly on an unknown active subspace of low dimensionality. The argument applies to a large class of algorithms and GP models, including non-stationary kernels. Moreover, we provide an efficient implementation based on hashing and demonstrate empirically that this subspace embedding achieves considerably better results than the previously proposed methods for highdimensional BO based on Gaussian matrix projections and structure-learning.",
