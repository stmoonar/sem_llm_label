            "title": "Breaking Symmetries Leads to Diverse Quadrupedal Gaits",
            "abstract": "Symmetry manifests itself in legged locomotion in a variety of ways: A legged system can maintain consistent gaits from any spatial starting point, exhibiting the same leg movements on either side of the torso in phase, and some even demonstrate forward and backward movements so similar they seem to reverse time. This work aims to generalize these phenomena and proposes formal definitions of symmetries in legged locomotion using terminology from group theory. In this research, we uncovered an intrinsic connection among a broad spectrum of quadrupedal gaits, which can be systematically identified via numerical continuations and distinguished by elements within a symmetry group. These gaits, within the hybrid dynamical system, are not merely isolated movements but part of a continuum, seamlessly transitioning from one to another at precise parameter bifurcation points. Altering specific symmetries at these junctures leads to the emergence of distinct gaits with unique footfall patterns, a phenomenon we've generalized through dimensional analysis in this study. Consequently, each gait manifests distinct preferred speed ranges and specific transition speeds. This work offers a comprehensive method to solve the gait generation problem for a quadruped, including pronking, two types of bounding, four variations of half-bounding, and two forms of galloping, and it also elucidates the mechanical rationale behind the necessity of gait transitions, providing high-level insight into the diversity and underlying mechanics of quadrupedal locomotion.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) facilitate a wide variety of applications due to their ability to store relational knowledge applicable to many areas. Despite great efforts invested in creation and maintenance, even the largest KGs are far from complete. Hence, KG completion (KGC) has become one of the most crucial tasks for KG research. Recently, considerable literature in this space has centered around the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn powerful embeddings which leverage topological structures in the KGs. Specifically, dedicated efforts have been made to extend GNNs, which are com-monly designed for simple homogeneous and uni-relational graphs, to the KG context which has diverse and multi-relational connec-tions between entities, by designing more complex aggregation schemes over neighboring nodes (crucial to GNN performance) to appropriately leverage multi-relational information. The success of these methods is naturally attributed to the use of GNNs over simpler multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, owing to their additional aggregation functionality. In this work, we find that surprisingly, simple MLP models are able to achieve comparable performance to GNNs, suggesting that aggregation may not be as crucial as previ-ously believed. With further exploration, we show careful scoring function and loss function design has a much stronger influence on KGC model performance, and aggregation is not practically required. This suggests a conflation of scoring function design, loss function design, and aggregation in prior",

            "abstract": "As powerful tools for representation learning on graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated various applications from drug discovery to recommender systems. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of GNNs is immensely challenged by issues related to data quality, such as distribution shift, abnormal features and adversarial attacks. Recent efforts have been made on tackling these issues from a modeling perspective which requires additional cost of changing model architectures or re-training model parameters. In this work, we provide a data-centric view to tackle these issues and propose a graph transformation framework named GTrans which adapts and refines graph data at test time to achieve better performance. We provide theoretical analysis on the design of the framework and discuss why adapting graph data works better than adapting the model. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of GTrans on three distinct scenarios for eight benchmark datasets where suboptimal data is presented. Remarkably, GTrans performs the best in most cases with improvements up to 2.8%, 8.2% and 3.8% over the best baselines on three experimental settings. Code is released at https://github.com/ChandlerBang/GTrans.",

            "title": "Reasoning Chain Based Adversarial Attack for Multi-hop Question Answering",
            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed impressive advances in challenging multi-hop QA tasks. However, these QA models may fail when faced with some disturbance in the input text and their interpretability for conducting multi-hop reasoning remains uncertain. Previous adversarial attack works usually edit the whole question sentence, which has limited effect on testing the entity-based multi-hop inference ability. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop reasoning chain based adversarial attack method. We formulate the multi-hop reasoning chains starting from the query entity to the answer entity in the constructed graph, which allows us to align the question to each reasoning hop and thus attack any hop. We categorize the questions into different reasoning types and adversarially modify part of the question corresponding to the selected reasoning hop to generate the distracting sentence. We test our adversarial scheme on three QA models on HotpotQA dataset. The results demonstrate significant performance reduction on both answer and supporting facts prediction, verifying the effectiveness of our reasoning chain based attack method for multi-hop reasoning models and the vulnerability of them. Our adversarial re-training further improves the performance and robustness of these models.",

            "abstract": "Text feature representation is an important and fundamental problem widely studied in many text analysis tasks such as text classification. However, most of the existing methods on text feature extraction focus on text itself, for example, bagof-words (BOW). In this work, we propose to make use of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enrich text representation in a novel HIN perspective. There are two main challenges due to the complexity of KGs. First, how to address the ambiguity when mapping the entities in a text to a KG. Second, how to incorporate the relations of entities in the same document, which indicate the intra-document semantics. To solve these problems, we present a novel Meta-Path Based Text Feature Enrichment (MeTEN) method. The MeTEN can effectively map nouns or noun phrases in a text to entities in a KG, and effectively discover their relations represented by meta paths in the KG through a novel bi-directional meta path generation algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MeTEN can effectively enrich text feature and thus improve text classification.",
