            "abstract": "Existing unsupervised deep product quantization methods primarily aim for the increased similarity between different views of the identical image, whereas the delicate multi-level semantic similarities preserved between images are overlooked. Moreover, these methods predominantly focus on the Euclidean space for computational convenience, compromising their ability to map the multi-level semantic relationships between images effectively. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose a novel unsupervised product quantization method dubbed Hierarchical Hyperbolic Product Quantization (HiHPQ), which learns quantized representations by incorporating hierarchical semantic similarity within hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, we propose a hyperbolic product quantizer, where the hyperbolic codebook attention mechanism and the quantized contrastive learning on the hyperbolic product manifold are introduced to expedite quantization. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical semantics learning module, designed to enhance the distinction between similar and non-matching images for a query by utilizing the extracted hierarchical semantics as an additional training supervision. Experiments on benchmark image datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "The classic problem of node importance estimation has been conventionally studied with homogeneous network topology analysis. To deal with practical network heterogeneity, a few recent methods employ graph neural models to automatically learn diverse sources of information. However, the major concern revolves around that their fully adaptive learning process may lead to insufficient information exploration, thereby formulating the problem as the isolated node value prediction with underperformance and less interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel learning framework namely SKES. Different from previous automatic learning designs, SKES exploits heterogeneous structural knowledge to enrich the informativeness of node representations. Then based on a sufficiently uninformative reference, SKES estimates the importance value for any input node, by quantifying its informativeness disparity against the reference. This establishes an interpretable node importance computation paradigm. Furthermore, SKES dives deep into the understanding that \"nodes with similar characteristics are prone to have similar importance values\" whilst guaranteeing that such informativeness disparity between any different nodes is orderly reflected by the embedding distance of their associated latent features. Extensive experiments on three widely-evaluated benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of SKES over several recent competing methods.",

Our findings indicate the learning effectiveness of incorporating hashing techniques within the exploration of bipartite graph reception fields, as opposed to simply treating hashing as post-processing to output embeddings. To further enhance the model performance, we advance upon these findings and propose Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing (BGCH+). BGCH+ introduces a novel dual augmentation approach to both intermediate information and hash code outputs in the latent feature spaces, thereby producing more expressive and robust hash codes within a dual self-supervised learning paradigm. Comprehensive empirical analyses on six real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our dual feature contrastive learning in boosting the performance of BGCH+ compared to existing approaches.",

            "abstract": "Personalized recommender systems have found widespread applications for effective information filtering. Conventional models engage in knowledge mining within the static setting to reconstruct singular historical data. Nonetheless, the dynamics of real-world environments are in a constant state of flux, rendering acquired model knowledge inadequate for accommodating emergent trends and thus leading to notable recommendation performance decline. Given the typically prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining, it has emerged to study incremental learning for recommender systems with ever-growing data. In this paper, we propose an effective model-agnostic framework, namely INFluential Exemplar Replay (INFER). INFER facilitates recommender models in retaining the earlier assimilated knowledge, e.g., users' enduring preferences, while concurrently accommodating evolving trends manifested in users' new interaction behaviors. We commence with a vanilla implementation that centers on identifying the most representative data samples for effective consolidation of early knowledge. Subsequently, we propose an advanced solution, namely INFERONCE, to optimize the computational overhead associated with the vanilla implementation. Extensive experiments on four prototypical backbone models, two classic recommendation tasks, and four widely used benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as well as its compatibility for extending to several incremental recommender models.",

Despite the superior performance for item recommendations, these methods however implicitly deprioritize the modeling of user-wise similarity in the embedding space; consequently, identifying similar users is underperforming, and additional processing schemes are usually required otherwise. To avoid thorough model re-training, we propose WSFE, a model-agnostic and training-free representation encoder, to be flexibly employed on the fly for effective user segmentation. Underpinned by the optimal transport theory, the encoded representations from WSFE present a matched user-wise similarity/distance measurement between the realistic and embedding space. We incorporate WSFE into six state-of-the-art recommender models and conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets. The empirical analyses well demonstrate the superiority and generality of WSFE to fuel multiple downstream tasks with diverse underlying targets in recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Graph representation learning via Contrastive Learning (GCL) has drawn considerable attention recently. Efforts are mainly focused on gathering more global information via contrasting on a single high-level graph view, which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To incorporate these properties of a complex graph, we propose Cross-Scale Contrastive Graph Knowledge Synergy (CGKS), a generic feature learning framework, to advance graph contrastive learning with enhanced generalization ability and the awareness of latent anatomies. Specifically, to maintain the hierarchical information, we create a so-call graph pyramid (GP) consisting of coarse-grained graph views. Each graph view is obtained via the careful design topology-aware graph coarsening layer that extends the Laplacian Eigenmaps with negative sampling. To promote cross-scale information sharing and knowledge interactions among GP, we propose a novel joint optimization formula that contains a pairwise contrastive loss between any two coarse-grained graph views. This synergy loss not only promotes knowledge sharing that yields informative representations, but also stabilizes the training process. Experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the substantial improvements of the proposed method over its counterparts.",

Most existing works focus on undirected graphs which overlooks the rich information carried by the edge directions. Recently, the problem of community search over directed graphs (or CSD problem) has been studied; it finds a connected subgraph containing q, where the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex within the subgraph are at least k and l, respectively. However, existing solutions are inefficient, especially on large graphs. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel index called D-Forest, which allows a CSD query to be completed within the optimal time cost. We further propose efficient index construction methods. Extensive experiments on six real large graphs show that our index-based query algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions.",

Current endeavors in hyperbolic representation largely presuppose that the underlying hierarchies can be automatically inferred and preserved through the adaptive optimization process. This assumption, however, is questionable and requires further validation. In this work, we first introduce a position-tracking mechanism to scrutinize existing prevalent \\hlms, revealing that the learned representations are sub-optimal and unsatisfactory. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, hyperbolic informed embedding (HIE), by incorporating cost-free hierarchical information deduced from the hyperbolic distance of the node to origin (i.e., induced hyperbolic norm) to advance existing \\hlms. The proposed method HIE is both task-agnostic and model-agnostic, enabling its seamless integration with a broad spectrum of models and tasks. Extensive experiments across various models and different tasks demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of up to 21.4\\% compared to the competing baselines.",

            "title": "An Effective Post-training Embedding Binarization Approach for Fast Online Top-K Passage Matching",
            "abstract": "With the rapid development of Natural Language Understanding for information retrieval, fine-tuned deep language models, e.g., BERT-based, perform remarkably effective in passage searching tasks. To lower the architecture complexity, the recent state-of-the-art model ColBERT employs Contextualized Late Interaction paradigm to independently learn fine-grained query-passage representations. Apart from the architecture simplification, embedding binarization, as another promising branch in model compression, further specializes in the reduction of memory and computation overheads. In this concise paper, we propose an effective post-training embedding binarization approach over ColBERT, achieving both architecture-level and embedding-level optimization for online inference. The empirical results demonstrate the efficaciousness of our proposed approach, empowering it to perform online query-passage matching acceleration.",
