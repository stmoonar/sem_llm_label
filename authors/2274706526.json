            "title": "SUVR: A Search-Based Approach to Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning",
            "abstract": "Unsupervised learning has grown in popularity because of the difficulty of collecting annotated data and the development of modern frameworks that allow us to learn from unlabeled data. Existing studies, however, either disregard variations at different levels of similarity or only consider negative samples from one batch. We argue that image pairs should have varying degrees of similarity, and the negative samples should be allowed to be drawn from the entire dataset. In this work, we propose Search-based Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning (SUVR) to learn better image representations in an unsupervised manner. We first construct a graph from the image dataset by the similarity between images, and adopt the concept of graph traversal to explore positive samples. In the meantime, we make sure that negative samples can be drawn from the full dataset. Quantitative experiments on five benchmark image classification datasets demonstrate that SUVR can significantly outperform strong competing methods on unsupervised embedding learning. Qualitative experiments also show that SUVR can produce better representations in which similar images are clustered closer together than unrelated images in the latent space.",

            "abstract": "Self-supervised representation learning aims to generate effective representations for data instances without the need for manual labels, also known as unsupervised embedding learning, which has been a critical challenge in many existing semi-supervised and supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes a new self-supervised learning approach, called Super-AND, which extends the memory-based pretraining method AND model [13]. Super-AND has its unique set of losses that combines data augmentation in neighborhood discovery for more accurate anchor selection in embedding learning and further presents an adversarial training manner to learn more confident embeddings under the unsupervised setting. Experimental results exhibit that Super-AND outperforms all existing state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning approaches and achieves an accuracy of 89.2% on the image classification task for CIFAR-10.",
