            "abstract": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify anomalous objects that deviate from surrounding backgrounds in an unlabeled hyperspectral image (HSI). Most available neural networks that make use of the reconstruction error to perform HAD tend to fit both backgrounds and anomalies, resulting in small reconstruction errors for both and not being effective in separating targets from background. To address this issue, we develop Dual-window-inspired reconstruction Network (DirectNet), a new background reconstruction network for HAD that seamlessly integrates a sliding dual-window model into a blind-block architecture. Concretely, DirectNet establishes an inner window within the network\u2019s receptive field by erasing the center block information so that the content of the inner window remains invisible during the reconstruction of the central pixel. In addition, the depth of our reconstruction network is adaptive to the size of the input image patch, ensuring that the network\u2019s receptive field aligns with the dimensions of the input patch. The receptive field outside the inner window is considered an outer window. This weakens the impact of anomalies on the reconstruction process, causing the reconstructed pixels to converge toward the background distribution in the outer window region. Consequently, the reconstructed HSI can be regarded as a pure background HSI, leading to further amplification of reconstruction errors for anomalous targets. This enhancement improves the discriminatory ability of DirectNet. Specifically, DirectNet solely utilizes the outer window information to predict/reconstruct the central pixel. As a result, when reconstructing pixels inside anomalous targets of different sizes, the targets primarily fall within the inner window. Comprehensive experiments (conducted on four datasets) demonstrate that DirectNet achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art detectors.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection provides a powerful tool for continuous, reliable, and objective observation of the Earth, supporting a wide range of applications that require regular monitoring and assessment of changes in the natural and built environment. In this paper, we introduce a novel SAR image change detection method based on principal component analysis and two-level clustering. First, two difference images of the log-ratio and mean-ratio operators are computed, then the principal component analysis fusion model is used to fuse the two difference images, and a new difference image is generated. To incorporate contextual information during the feature extraction phase, Gabor wavelets are used to obtain the representation of the difference image across multiple scales and orientations. The maximum magnitude across all orientations at each scale is then concatenated to form the Gabor feature vector. Following this, a cascading clustering algorithm is developed within this discriminative feature space by merging the first-level fuzzy c-means clustering with the second-level neighbor rule. Ultimately, the two-level combination of the changed and unchanged results produces the final change map. Five SAR datasets are used for the experiment, and the results show that our algorithm has significant advantages in SAR change detection.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) is a crucial aspect of remote sensing applications, aiming to identify targets in hyperspectral images (HSIs) based on their known prior spectral signatures. However, the spectral variability resulting from various imaging conditions in multi-temporal hyperspectral images poses a challenge to both classical and deep learning (DL) methods. To overcome the limitations imposed by spectral variability, an implicit contrastive learning-based target detector (ICLTD) is proposed to exploit in-scene spectra in an unsupervised way. First, only prior spectra are utilized for explicit supervision, while an implicit contrastive learning module (ICLM) is designed to normalize the feature distributions of prior and in-scene spectra. This paper theoretically demonstrates that the ICLM can transfer the gradients from prior spectral features to those of in-scene spectra based on their feature similarities and differences. Because of transferred gradient signals, the ICLTD is regularized to extract similar representations for the prior and in-scene target spectra, while augmenting feature differences between the target and background spectra. Additionally, a local spectral similarity constraint (LSSC) is proposed to enhance the capability of scene adaptation by leveraging the spectral similarities among in-scene targets. To validate the performance of the ICLTD under spectral variability, multi-temporal HSIs captured under various imaging conditions are collected to generate prior spectra and in-scene spectra. Comparative evaluations against several DL detectors and classical methods reveal the superior performance of the ICLTD in achieving a balance between target detectability and background suppressibility under spectral variability.",

            "abstract": "Geothermal resources are efficient, clean, and renewable energy sources. Using high-resolution images captured by remote sensing satellites for temperature retrieval and searching for geothermal anomaly areas is an efficient method. However, obtaining land surface temperature retrieval images requires multiple steps of calculation, which can result in a great loss of image information and resolution. Therefore, the super-resolution reconstruction of LST retrieval images is currently a challenge in geothermal resource exploration. Although the current super-resolution methods for LST retrieval images can appropriately restore image quality, the overall restoration of the surface temperature information in the region is still not ideal. We propose a cross-scale reference image super-resolution model based on a diffusion model using deep learning technology. First, we propose the Pre-Super-Resolution Network (PreNet), which can improve both indices and the visual effect of images. Second, to reduce the white noise in the super-resolution images, we propose the Cross-Scale Reference Image Attention Mechanism (CSRIAM). The introduction of this mechanism greatly reduces noise in the images and improves the overall image quality. Compared to previous methods, we improved both experimental indices such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), etc., and vision quality, and optimized the recovery of geothermal anomalies. Through our experimental results, we found that the CS-Diffusion model has a very strong ability to restore the image quality of the LST retrieval. After restoring its image quality, we can make a positive contribution to subsequent geothermal resource exploration.",

            "abstract": "The detection of camouflaged targets in the complex background is a hot topic of current research. The existing hyperspectral target detection algorithms do not take advantage of spatial information and rarely use temporal information. It is difficult to obtain the required targets, and the detection performance in hyperspectral sequences with complex background will be low. Therefore, a hyperspectral time-series target detection method based on spectral perception and spatial\u2013temporal tensor (SPSTT) decomposition is proposed. First, a sparse target perception strategy based on spectral matching is proposed. To initially acquire the sparse targets, the matching results are adjusted by using the correlation mean of the prior spectrum, the pixel to be measured, and the four-neighborhood pixel spectra. The separation of target and background is enhanced by making full use of local spatial structure information through local topology graph representation of the pixel to be measured. Second, in order to obtain a more accurate rank and make full use of temporal continuity and spatial correlation, a spatial\u2013temporal tensor (STT) model based on the gamma norm and $L_{2,1}$ norm is constructed. Furthermore, an excellent alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve this model. Finally, spectral matching is fused with STT decomposition in order to reduce false alarms and retain more right targets. A 176-band Beijing Institute of Technology hyperspectral image sequence - I (BIT-HSIS-I) dataset is collected for the hyperspectral target detection task. It is found by testing on the collected dataset that the proposed SPSTT has superior performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Traditional target detectors consider the background spectrum to obey a Gaussian distribution. However, this distribution may not meet the requirements in real hyperspectral images. In addition, the background and spatial information of most existing target detection algorithms are rarely fully utilized. Therefore, a new weighted Cauchy distance Graph and local adaptive Collaborative Representation Detection (CGCRD) is proposed. First, a weighted Cauchy distance graph similarity measure is designed. In order to adjust the effect of target pixels on the graph model, a weighted Cauchy distance Laplace matrix is constructed, and then the matrix is applied to the matched filter detector. Secondly, local adaptive collaborative representation strategy is developed. The penalty coefficient is weighted by the local spatial Euclidean distance combined with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and then the detection result is obtained based on the residual. Finally, aforementioned two strategies are fused to fully utilize the spatial and spectral information. A 176-band hyperspectral image (BIT-HSI-I) dataset is collected for the target detection task.

            "abstract": "In recent years, with the development of compressed sensing theory, sparse representation methods have been concerned by many researchers. Sparse representation can approximate the original image information with less space storage. Sparse representation has been investigated for hyperspectral imagery (HSI) detection, where approximation of testing pixel can be obtained by solving l1-norm minimization. However, l1-norm minimization does not always yield a sufficiently sparse solution when a dictionary is not large enough or atoms present a certain level of coherence. Comparatively, non-convex minimization problems, such as the lp penalties, need much weaker incoherence constraint conditions and may achieve more accurate approximation. Hence, we propose a novel detection algorithm utilizing sparse representation with lp-norm and propose adaptive iterated shrinkage thresholding method (AISTM) for lp-norm non-convex sparse coding. Target detection is implemented by representation of the all pixels employing homogeneous target dictionary (HTD), and the output is generated according to the representation residual. Experimental results for four real hyperspectral datasets show that the detection performance of the proposed method is improved by about 10% to 30% than methods mentioned in the paper, such as matched filter (MF), sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition (SLMD), adaptive cosine estimation (ACE), constrained energy minimization (CEM), one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), the original sparse representation detector with l1-norm, and combined sparse and collaborative representation (CSCR).",
