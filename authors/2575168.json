            "abstract": "Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are widely deployed today and often use wireless communication. Establishing a secure communication channel to these devices is vital, however, also challenging in practice. To address this issue, numerous researchers have proposed IMD key exchange protocols, in particular ones that leverage an Out-Of-Band (OOB) channel such as audio, vibration and physiological signals. These solutions have advantages over traditional key exchange, e.g., their plug-and-play nature. However, such protocols are often constructed in an ad-hoc manner and lack stringent evaluation of their security, usability and deployability properties. In this paper, we systematize this area and derive a solid theoretical footing to compare different OOB-based approaches. We review related work in that light and show the shortcomings of previous approaches. We then make the core observation that security imperfections in OOB channels can be mitigated by incorporating password-authenticated key agreement. Accordingly, we propose a new construction for OOB key exchange and formalize the security level. We then derive three protocols from it that only require an inertial sensor in the IMD, which is already available in advanced devices. We analyze those protocols with the proposed formalism to highlight shortcomings and advantages depending on specific practical scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive biases have been shown to play a critical role in creating echo chambers and spreading misinformation. They undermine our ability to evaluate information and can influence our behaviour without our awareness. To allow the study of occurrences and effects of biases on information consumption behaviour, we explore indicators for cognitive biases in physiological and interaction data. Therefore, we conducted two experiments investigating how people experience statements that are congruent or divergent from their own ideological stance. We collected interaction data, eye tracking data, hemodynamic responses, and electrodermal activity while participants were exposed to ideologically tainted statements. Our results indicate that people spend more time processing statements that are incongruent with their own opinion. We detected differences in blood oxygenation levels between congruent and divergent opinions, a first step towards building systems to detect and quantify cognitive biases.",

            "abstract": "Algorithms increasingly curate the information we see online, prioritizing attention and engagement. By catering to personal preferences, they confirm existing opinions and reinforce cognitive biases. When it comes to polarizing topics such as climate change or abortion rights, the combination of algorithmic information curation and cognitive biases can easily skew our perception and, thus, undermine our critical thinking abilities while creating a thriving ground for misinformation. To curb the spread of misinformation, a research agenda is needed around the interplay between cognitive biases, computing systems, and online platform design. In this article, we synthesize insights from a workshop series, propose a research agenda, and sketch out a blueprint for technologies to support critical thinking through the lens of human\u2013computer interaction and design. We discuss the affordances of online media and how they could prioritize teaching users how to spot misinformation better and conduct themselves in online environments.",

We analysed and critically assessed the different approaches used in the three stages (perception, learning, inference) of a typical mobile emotion sensing framework, following a structured paper selection process. The contribution of this survey is three-fold; first, we document all the latest relevant literature on mobile emotion sensing research; second, we describe how mobile and wearable devices use their sensing and computing capabilities to monitor human emotions; third, we discuss challenges and opportunities of mobile emotion sensing to demonstrate the potential of this thriving field of research.",

It can serve to expand individuals\u2019 perceptual capabilities and assist neurodivergent individuals.

To date, the subjective individual association between vibrotactile properties and emotional states remains unclear. Previous approaches relied on analogies or arbitrary variations, limiting generalization. To address this, we conducted a study with 40 participants, analyzing associations between attributes of self-generated vibrotactile patterns (amplitude, frequency, spatial location of stimulation) and four emotional states (Anger, Happiness, Neutral, Sadness). We fin a preference for symmetrically arranged patterns, as well as distinct amplitude and frequency profiles for different emotions.",

However, aging communities tend to build \u201cpoverty traps\u201d that act as barriers for new users.

Our results raise important questions about the accessibility of knowledge-based peer-production communities. We consider the analysis results in the context of changing information needs and the relevance of Q&A in the future.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nHand hygiene has long been promoted as the most effective way to prevent the transmission of infection. However, due to the low compliance and quality of hand hygiene reported in previous studies, constant monitoring of healthcare workers' hand hygiene compliance and quality is crucial. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using a thermal camera together with an RGB camera to detect hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation, thereby monitoring handrub quality.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 32 participants for this study. Participants were required to perform four types of handrubs to produce different hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation. After each task, participants' hands were photographed under a thermal camera and an RGB camera, while an ultraviolet (UV) test was used to provide the ground truth of hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation. Then, a U-Net was used to segment areas covered with alcohol-based formulations from thermal images, and the system performance was evaluated by comparing coverage differences between thermal images and UV images regarding accuracy and Dice coefficient.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe system yields promising results in terms of accuracy (93.5%) and Dice coefficient (87.1%) when observations take place 10 seconds after performing handrub. In addition, we also examine the system performance change over a 60-second observation period, and the accuracy and Dice coefficient still remain at about 92.4% and 85.7% when observation happens at the 60-second time point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGiven these encouraging results, thermal imaging shows its potential feasibility in providing accurate, constant, and systematic hand hygiene quality monitoring.",

However, while some researchers call for making better use of available sensing technologies to research human emotions, others have raised concerns regarding the potential shortcomings and risks of these approaches.

Current systems typically dictate that interaction between user input and AI output unfolds in discrete steps, as is the case with, for example, conversational agents. Novel scenarios require AI systems to adapt and respond to continuous user input, e.g., image-guided surgery and AI-supported text entry. In and across these applications, AI systems need to support more varied and dynamic interactions in which users and AI interact continuously and in parallel. Current methods and guidelines are often inadequate and sometimes even detrimental to user needs when considering continuous usage scenarios.

            "abstract": "Implicit tendencies and cognitive biases play an important role in how information is perceived and processed, a fact that can be both utilised and exploited by computing systems. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) has been widely used to assess people\u2019s associations of target concepts with qualitative attributes, such as the likelihood of being hired or convicted depending on race, gender, or age. The condensed version\u2013the Brief IAT\u2013aims to implicit biases by measuring the reaction time to concept classifications. To use this measure in HCI research, however, we need a way to construct and validate target concepts, which tend to quickly evolve and depend on geographical and cultural interpretations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new method to appropriate the BIAT using crowdsourcing to measure people\u2019s leanings on polarising topics. We present a web-based tool to test participants\u2019 bias on custom themes, where self-assessments often fail. We validated our approach with 14 domain experts and assessed the fit of crowdsourced test construction. Our method allows researchers of different domains to create and validate bias tests that can be geographically tailored and updated over time. We discuss how our method can be applied to surface implicit user biases and run studies where cognitive biases may impede reliable results.",
