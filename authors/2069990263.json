            "title": "Indicative Image Retrieval: Turning Blackbox Learning into Grey",
            "abstract": "Deep learning became the game changer for image retrieval soon after it was introduced. It promotes the feature extraction (by representation learning) as the core of image retrieval, with the relevance/matching evaluation being degenerated into simple similarity metrics. In many applications, we need the matching evidence to be indicated rather than just have the ranked list (e.g., the locations of the target proteins/cells/lesions in medical images). It is like the matched words need to be highlighted in search engines. However, this is not easy to implement without explicit relevance/matching modeling. The deep representation learning models are not feasible because of their blackbox nature. In this paper, we revisit the importance of relevance/matching modeling in deep learning era with an indicative retrieval setting. The study shows that it is possible to skip the representation learning and model the matching evidence directly. By removing the dependency on the pre-trained models, it has avoided a lot of related issues (e.g., the domain gap between classification and retrieval, the detail-diffusion caused by convolution, and so on). More importantly, the study demonstrates that the matching can be explicitly modeled and backtracked later for generating the matching evidence indications. It can improve the explainability of deep inference. Our method obtains a best performance in literature on both Oxford-5k and Paris-6k, and sets a new record of 97.77% on Oxford-5k (97.81% on Paris-6k) without extracting any deep features.",

However, existing knowledge graph completion methods ignored the characteristics of triple's relation and introduced redundant entity description information. In order to improve the above problems, this paper proposed an ALBERT-KGC model. The key contexts were extracted from redundant entity descriptions by the extraction summarization technology. Then ALBERT was used as an encoder to reduce the number of model parameters, and the multi-task learning method was applied to fine-tune the model, effectively integrating entity and relation features. The results of linking prediction experiments on data sets WN18RR and FB15k-237 showed that the proposed method can improve the MeanRank (MR) index by 31 and 2, and the top 10 hit ratio (Hit@10) index by 1.2% and 5.8% compared with the traditional methods, verifying the validity of the model.",

            "abstract": "Network representation learning has played a critical role in studying networks. One way to study a graph is to focus on its spectrum, i.e., the eigenvalue distribution of its associated matrices. Recent advancements in spectral graph theory show that spectral moments of a network can be used to capture the network structure and various graph properties. However, sometimes networks with different structures or sizes can have the same or similar spectral moments, not to mention the existence of the cospectral graphs. To address such problems, we propose a 3D network representation that relies on the spectral information of subgraphs: the Spectral Path, a path connecting the spectral moments of the network and those of its subgraphs of different sizes. We show that the spectral path is interpretable and can capture relationship between a network and its subgraphs, for which we present a theoretical foundation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the spectral path in applications such as network visualization and network identification.",

            "abstract": "With the demand to model the relationships among three or more entities, higher-order networks are now more widespread across various domains. Relationships such as multiauthor collaborations, co-appearance of keywords, and copurchases can be naturally modeled as higher-order networks. However, due to (1) computational complexity and (2) insufficient higher-order data, exploring higher-order networks is often limited to order-3 motifs (or triangles). To address these problems, we explore and quantify similarites among various network orders. Our goal is to build relationships between different network orders and to solve higher-order problems using lower-order information. Similarities between different orders are not comparable directly. Hence, we introduce a set of general cross-order similarities, and a measure: subedge rate. Our experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that most higher-order networks have considerable consistency as we move from higher-orders to lower-orders. Utilizing this discovery, we develop a new cross-order framework for higher-order link prediction method. These methods can predict higher-order links from lower-order edges, which cannot be attained by current higher-order methods that rely on data from a single order.",

            "abstract": "Graph kernels are conventional methods for computing graph similarities. However, the existing R-convolution graph kernels cannot resolve both of the two challenges: 1) comparing graphs at multiple different scales; and 2) considering the distributions of substructures when computing the kernel matrix. These two challenges limit their performances. To mitigate both of the two challenges, we propose a novel graph kernel called the multiscale Wasserstein shortest-path graph kernel (MWSP), at the heart of which is the multiscale shortest-path node feature map, of which each element denotes the number of occurrences of the shortest path around a node. The shortest path is represented by the concatenation of all the labels of nodes in it. Since the shortest-path node feature map can only compare graphs at local scales, we incorporate into it the multiple different scales of the graph structure, which are captured by the truncated BFS trees of different depths rooted at each node in a graph. We use the Wasserstein distance to compute the similarity between the multiscale shortest-path node feature maps of two graphs, considering the distributions of shortest paths. We empirically validate MWSP on various benchmark graph datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on most datasets.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion is an important technology for supplementing knowledge graphs and improving data quality. However, the existing knowledge graph completion methods ignore the features of triple relations, and the introduced entity description texts are long and redundant. To address these problems, this study proposes a multi-task learning and improved TextRank for knowledge graph completion (MIT-KGC) model. The key contexts are first extracted from redundant entity descriptions using the improved TextRank algorithm. Then, a lite bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (ALBERT) is used as the text encoder to reduce the parameters of the model. Subsequently, the multi-task learning method is utilized to fine-tune the model by effectively integrating the entity and relation features.

Here, we address this problem by proposing general link prediction methods that can capture network-specific patterns. Most link prediction methods rely on computing similarities between between nodes. By learning a \u03b3-decaying model, the proposed methods can measure the pairwise similarities between nodes more accurately, even when only using common neighbor information, which is often used by current techniques.",
