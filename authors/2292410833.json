            "title": "Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Graph Generation",
            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in many fields, and recent works have studied exploring LLMs for graph discriminative tasks such as node classification. However, the abilities of LLMs for graph generation remain unexplored in the literature. Graph generation requires the LLM to generate graphs with given properties, which has valuable real-world applications such as drug discovery, while tends to be more challenging. In this paper, we propose LLM4GraphGen to explore the ability of LLMs for graph generation with systematical task designs and extensive experiments. Specifically, we propose several tasks tailored with comprehensive experiments to address key questions regarding LLMs' understanding of different graph structure rules, their ability to capture structural type distributions, and their utilization of domain knowledge for property-based graph generation. Our evaluations demonstrate that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit preliminary abilities in graph generation tasks, including rule-based and distribution-based generation. We also observe that popular prompting methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, do not consistently enhance performance. Besides, LLMs show potential in generating molecules with specific properties. These findings may serve as foundations for designing good LLMs based models for graph generation and provide valuable insights and further research.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved great success in designing architectures for graph data processing.However, distribution shifts pose great challenges for graph NAS, since the optimal searched architectures for the training graph data may fail to generalize to the unseen test graph data. The sole prior work tackles this problem by customizing architectures for each graph instance through learning graph structural information, but failed to consider data augmentation during training, which has been proven by existing works to be able to improve generalization.In this paper, we propose Data-augmented Curriculum Graph Neural Architecture Search (DCGAS), which learns an architecture customizer with good generalizability to data under distribution shifts. Specifically, we design an embedding-guided data generator, which can generate sufficient graphs for training to help the model better capture graph structural information. In addition, we design a two-factor uncertainty-based curriculum weighting strategy, which can evaluate the importance of data in enabling the model to learn key information in real-world distribution and reweight them during training. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real datasets with distribution shifts demonstrate that our proposed method learns generalizable mappings and outperforms existing methods.",

            "abstract": "Cross-device scenarios have become increasingly common, where non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data is generated and stored in different devices. However, the existing cross-device NAS methods only search for a fixed architecture for different devices, neglecting that different devices have varying hardware characteristics and data distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS framework that can customize the most suitable architecture for each device and its associated dataset. Specifically, we propose a decoupled data feature extractor and a device feature extractor to characterize the complex distributions of the different datasets and diverse hardware features. Then, we propose a prototype matcher to customize the operators and shape selection parameters of architectures. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show that our method can discover more efficient and effective architectures in cross-device scenarios than the existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration on customized cross-device NAS problem.",
