            "abstract": "Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and some extensions based on it are popularly used to balance imbalanced data. In this study, we concentrate on solving overfitting of the classification model caused by choosing instances to oversample that increase the occurrence of overlaps with the majority class. Our method called Clustering-based Improved Adaptive Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (CI-ASMOTE1) decomposes minority instances into sub-clusters according to their connectivity in the feature space and then selects minority sub-clusters which are relatively close to the decision boundary as the candidate regions to oversample. After application of CI-ASMOTE1, new minority instances are only synthesized within each connected region of the selected sub-clusters. Considering the diversity of the synthetic instances in each selected sub-cluster, CI-ASMOTE2 is put forward to extend CI-ASMOTE1 by keeping all features of those instances in the feature space as different as possible. The experimental evaluation shows that CI-ASMOTE1 and CI-ASMOTE2 improve SMOTE and its extensions, especially in the occurrence of overlaps between the minority instances and the majority instances.",

            "title": "Tensor Decomposition-Inspired Convolutional Autoencoders for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection from hyperspectral images (HSI) is an important task in the remote sensing domain. Considering the three-order characteristics of HSI, many tensor decomposition based hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) models have been proposed and drawn much attention during the past decades. However, as most tensor decomposition based detectors are directly performed on the original HSI, the detection accuracy is usually limited due to the high-dimension and noise corruption of the HSI. Benefiting from the good capacity of autoencoders (AE) for feature extraction, in this article, an enhanced tensor decomposition-inspired convolutional AE for HAD is proposed to address those problems, named TDNet. Within the proposed TDNet, the traditional canonical-polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition model is innovatively alternated by a deep neural network (DNN), and the DNN tensor decomposition model performs more stably and robustly for noise. Specifically, a potential abnormal pixels remove strategy is first built to obtain the background training sets. Then, a DNN tensor decomposition-inspired convolutional AE is used to recover the original background information, which consists of an encoder, a low-rank tensor decomposition network, and a decoder. Finally, the residual errors between input HSI and recovered background are used for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the TDNet in terms of both AUC values and ROC curves.",

            "title": "Self-Adaption AAE-GAN for Aluminum Electrolytic Cell Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, the anomaly detection of aluminum electrolysis cell is a big problem in the aluminum electrolysis industry. The problem of unbalanced time series samples is common in industrial applications. The number of samples under normal conditions is much larger than that under abnormal conditions. In the electrolytic aluminum industry, this problem is even more serious, it is very difficult to find abnormal samples in industrial production because experts do not have a clear criterion to judge abnormalities. In traditional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), it is difficult to obtain high classification accuracy on the problem of class imbalance, and these methods tend to be more biased towards positive samples. In recent years, generative adversarial network (GAN) has become more and more popular in the field of anomaly detection. However, these methods need to find the best mapping from the actual space to the latent space in the anomaly detection stage, and the optimization process may bring new errors and take a long time. In this article, we use the ability of GAN to model complex high-dimensional image distribution, and propose a self-adaption AAE-GAN network based on adaptive changes of input samples. This time series anomaly detection method converts multi-dimensional time series data into a two-dimensional matrix, and only normal samples are needed in the training process, which effectively solves the above problems. The method we proposed is to use encoder and decoder to constitute a generator and a discriminator. During the training process, the generator and the discriminator are trained jointly and confrontationally, so that the mapping ability of the encoder can be fully reflected. In the anomaly detection stage, we determine whether the sample is abnormal according to the size of the reconstruction difference. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy and speed of this method are very high.",
