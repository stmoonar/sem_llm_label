            "title": "xMTrans: Temporal Attentive Cross-Modality Fusion Transformer for Long-Term Traffic Prediction",
            "abstract": "Traffic predictions play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. The rapid development of IoT devices allows us to collect different kinds of data with high correlations to traffic predictions, fostering the development of efficient multi-modal traffic prediction models. Until now, there are few studies focusing on utilizing advantages of multi-modal data for traffic predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal attentive cross-modality transformer model for long-term traffic predictions, namely xMTrans, with capability of exploring the temporal correlations between the data of two modalities: one target modality (for prediction, e.g., traffic congestion) and one support modality (e.g., people flow). We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model on traffic congestion and taxi demand predictions using real-world datasets. The results showed the superiority of xMTrans against recent state-of-the-art methods on long-term traffic predictions. In addition, we also conducted a comprehensive ablation study to further analyze the effectiveness of each module in xMTrans.",

            "title": "Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders",
            "abstract": "Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real world time series, i.e., large-scale irregular or sparse and intermittent time series, raise significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.",

            "abstract": "Robust predictions of traffic congestion play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, multimodal data have been applied to improve the performance of traffic congestion prediction models, such as rainfall, social network posts, incident reports, etc. In this paper, we attempt to use both dynamic people-flow and rainfall data, along with a transformer-based prediction model for traffic congestion prediction. We experiment an early fusion method for combining the multimodal data. Our experiments are conducted using two private datasets containing congestion and people-flow data, alongside a corresponding public dataset that provides rainfall data. The results indicate that incorporating the people-flow data into our prediction model enhances its performance.",
