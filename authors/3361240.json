            "abstract": "Knowledge discovery from unstructured data, including business documents, web content, and news articles, has been a key AI challenge for the financial services industry. Comprehending these corpora and discovering knowledge from them, which could be textual, tabular, or graphic, are the cornerstone of supporting business decisions in the financial services domain, where information retrieval and content analysis techniques are of fundamental importance. We propose a workshop on knowledge discovery from unstructured data in financial services at SIGIR 2023 to highlight the current and emerging opportunities, invite original research, and prompt success sharing between researchers.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a new task, MultiMedia Event Extraction, which aims to extract events and their arguments from multimedia documents. We develop the first benchmark and collect a dataset of 245 multimedia news articles with extensively annotated events and arguments. We propose a novel method, Weakly Aligned Structured Embedding (WASE), that encodes structured representations of semantic information from textual and visual data into a common embedding space. The structures are aligned across modalities by employing a weakly supervised training strategy, which enables exploiting available resources without explicit cross-media annotation. Compared to uni-modal state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves 4.0% and 9.8% absolute F-score gains on text event argument role labeling and visual event extraction. Compared to state-of-the-art multimedia unstructured representations, we achieve 8.3% and 5.0% absolute F-score gains on multimedia event extraction and argument role labeling, respectively. By utilizing images, we extract 21.4% more event mentions than traditional text-only methods.",

We propose a new Event Graph Schema, where two event types are connected through multiple paths involving entities that fill important roles in a coherent story. We then introduce Path Language Model, an auto-regressive language model trained on event-event paths, and select salient and coherent paths to probabilistically construct these graph schemas. We design two evaluation metrics, instance coverage and instance coherence, to evaluate the quality of graph schema induction, by checking when coherent event instances are covered by the schema graph. Intrinsic evaluations show that our approach is highly effective at inducing salient and coherent schemas. Extrinsic evaluations show the induced schema repository provides significant improvement to downstream end-to-end Information Extraction over a state-of-the-art joint neural extraction model, when used as additional global features to unfold instance graphs.",

            "abstract": "Transcripts of natural, multi-person meetings differ significantly from documents like news articles, which can make Natural Language Generation models for generating summaries unfocused. We develop an abstractive meeting summarizer from both videos and audios of meeting recordings. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal hierarchical attention across three levels: segment, utterance and word. To narrow down the focus into topically-relevant segments, we jointly model topic segmentation and summarization. In addition to traditional text features, we introduce new multi-modal features derived from visual focus of attention, based on the assumption that the utterance is more important if the speaker receives more attention. Experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art with both BLEU and ROUGE measures.",

            "abstract": "Studying group dynamics requires fine-grained spatial and temporal understanding of human behavior. Social psychologists studying human interaction patterns in face-to-face group meetings often find themselves struggling with huge volumes of data that require many hours of tedious manual coding. There are only a few publicly available multi-modal datasets of face-to-face group meetings that enable the development of automated methods to study verbal and non-verbal human behavior. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available multi-modal dataset for group dynamics study that differs from previous datasets in its use of ceiling-mounted, unobtrusive depth sensors. These can be used for fine-grained analysis of head and body pose and gestures, without any concerns about participants' privacy or inhibited behavior. The dataset is complemented by synchronized and time-stamped meeting transcripts that allow analysis of spoken content. The dataset comprises 22 group meetings in which participants perform a standard collaborative group task designed to measure leadership and productivity. Participants' post-task questionnaires, including demographic information, are also provided as part of the dataset. We show the utility of the dataset in analyzing perceived leadership, contribution, and performance, by presenting results of multi-modal analysis using our sensor-fusion algorithms designed to automatically understand audio-visual interactions.",

For our system to further support users\u2019 analyses of causal sequences of events in complex situations, we also integrate a wide range of human moral value measures, independently derived from region-based survey, into the event heatmap.
