            "abstract": "with rapid development of deep learning technology, face recognition based on deep convolutional neural network becomes one of the main research methods. In order to solve the problems of information loss and equal treatment of each element in the input feature graph in the traditional pooling method of convolutional neural network, a face recognition algorithm based on convolutional neural network is proposed in this paper. First, MTCNN algorithm is used to detect the faces and do gray processing, and then a local weighted average pooling method based on local concern strategy is designed and a convolutional neural network based on VGG16 to recognize faces is constructed which is finally compared with common convolutional neural network. The experimental results show that this method has good face recognition accuracy in common face databases.",

Based on the study on the state-of-the-art high-utility pattern mining algorithms, this paper proposes an improved strategy that removes noncandidate items from the global header table and local header table as early as possible, thus reducing search space and improving efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed strategy is applied to the algorithm EFIM (EFficient high-utility Itemset Mining). Experimental verification was carried out on nine typical datasets (including two large datasets); results show that our strategy can effectively improve temporal efficiency for mining high-utility patterns.",

            "abstract": "Encryption mechanisms improve the security of transmitting data. Nevertheless, attackers might silently eavesdrop packets to crack sensitive information or launch cyberattacks to damage the network performance of victims. In this paper, we propose a learning based adaptive network immune mechanism (LANIM) to prevent the eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, LANIM is equipped with three defense lines and one constraint. The first defense line focuses on making decisions about abnormal network conditions by the minimum risk machine learning algorithms. The second defense line is the encryption strategy which focuses on the intent and application. The programmable devices implement novel policies such as multipath transmission and packet encapsulation. LANIM inherits the existing countermeasures based on computational complexity, which is the third defense line. Besides, the policy dynamically updates with random seeds is the constraint of the cyberattack. The attackers have to conquer these three immune lines before the new policy update otherwise the offensive is shattered. We implement LANIM with the P4 language and the Smart Identifier Network (SINET) framework, evaluate the ability to resist the hazards of eavesdropping attacks and explore the trade-offs between security and performance.",

Sequential matches of system operations are performed for various parts of the system through five synchronization modules in order to achieve input data compensation. This effectively corrects the carrier frequency deviations of the system and subsequently improves the anti-interference capability of the system.
