            "title": "Cross Lingual Cross Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition",
            "abstract": "The majority of existing speech emotion recognition models are trained and evaluated on a single corpus and a single language setting. These systems do not perform as well when applied in a cross-corpus and cross-language scenario. This paper presents results for speech emotion recognition for 4 languages in both single corpus and cross corpus setting. Additionally, since multi-task learning (MTL) with gender, naturalness and arousal as auxiliary tasks has shown to enhance the generalisation capabilities of the emotion models, this paper introduces language ID as another auxiliary task in MTL framework to explore the role of spoken language on emotion recognition which has not been studied yet.",

            "abstract": "The paper presents Columbia team\u2019s participation in the SemEval 2019 Shared Task 7: RumourEval 2019. Detecting rumour on social networks has been a focus of research in recent years. Previous work suffered from data sparsity, which potentially limited the application of more sophisticated neural architecture to this task. We mitigate this problem by proposing a multi-task learning approach together with language model fine-tuning. Our attention-based model allows different tasks to leverage different level of information. Our system ranked 6th overall with an F1-score of 36.25 on stance classification and F1 of 22.44 on rumour verification.",

            "abstract": "Facial expressions are one of the best and the most intuitive way to determine a persons emotions. They most naturally express how a person is feeling currently. The aim of the proposed framework is to generate music corresponding to the emotion of the person predicted by our model. The proposed framework is divided into two models, the Image Classification Model and the Music Generation Model. The music would be generated by the latter model which is essentially a Doubly Stacked LSTM architecture. This is to be done after classification and identification of the facial expression into one of the seven major sentiment categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral, which would be done by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using the emotional Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a popular evaluation metric for audio-visual data.",
