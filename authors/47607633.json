            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Using controlled mobile elements is a promising approach to collect data from sensor nodes. It is very important to calculate a number of near-optimal routes for the fusion nodes that incrementally collect the data. Based on the multi-tier mobile network model, a new moving control strategy is proposed. This method first divides the monitoring field into several sub-regions so that fusion nodes can collect data in their own parts respectively. Then fusion nodes use constraints-based mobile localization (CML) algorithm to calculate the location information of each sensor node. Finally a new Maximum Likelihood Nearest Neighbor (MLNN) algorithm is proposed to design optimal routes for fusion nodes. Simulation results show that the moving control strategy suits extremely in the large-scale wireless sensor network and provides a good solution of the problem on tiered mobile network of instable communication and high-fraction of event loss.",

            "abstract": "Hierarchical routing protocols are critical for the wireless sensor networks (WSN) to maximize its lifetime, but the existing protocols are prone to lead nodes in clusters to die early due to ignoring the state of neighbors in the cluster head decision. In this paper, a new cluster-based optimization algorithm is set up which optimizes clustering process, to effectively avoid the low-energy and long-distance nodes as the cluster head. Considering sink node, The object cluster head routing protocol is proposed, it ensure that only the object cluster head send overall data to sink node, which can balance energy depletion among the cluster heads in WSN. The simulation results show that the optimization strategy significantly prolongs survival time of the network, the object cluster head routing protocol reduces the unbalance of cluster heads energy dissipation caused by different distance from Sink node and maximizes the network lifetime.",
