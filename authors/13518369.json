            "title": "Open-Domain Hierarchical Event Schema Induction by Incremental Prompting and Verification",
            "abstract": "Event schemas are a form of world knowledge about the typical progression of events. Recent methods for event schema induction use information extraction systems to construct a large number of event graph instances from documents, and then learn to generalize the schema from such instances. In contrast, we propose to treat event schemas as a form of commonsense knowledge that can be derived from large language models (LLMs). This new paradigm greatly simplifies the schema induction process and allows us to handle both hierarchical relations and temporal relations between events in a straightforward way. Since event schemas have complex graph structures, we design an incremental prompting and verification method IncPrompt to break down the construction of a complex event graph into three stages: event skeleton construction, event expansion, and event-event relation verification. Compared to directly using LLMs to generate a linearized graph, IncSchema can generate large and complex schemas with 7.2% F1 improvement in temporal relations and 31.0% F1 improvement in hierarchical relations. In addition, compared to the previous state-of-the-art closed-domain schema induction model, human assessors were able to cover ~10% more events when translating the schemas into coherent stories and rated our schemas 1.3 points higher (on a 5-point scale) in terms of readability.",

            "title": "Knowledge Graph Comparative Reasoning for Fact Checking: Problem Definition and Algorithms",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are ubiquitous data structure which have been used in many applications. Knowledge graph reasoning aims to discover or infer knowledge based on existing information in the knowledge graph. However, most of the existing works belong to point-wise approaches, which perform reasoning w.r.t. a single piece of clue. Comparative reasoning over knowledge graph focuses on inferring common-ality and inconsistency with respect to multiple pieces of clues which is a new research direction and can be applied to many applications. In this paper, we formally give the definition of comparative reasoning and propose several different methods to tackle comparative reasoning in both pairwise and collective cases. The idea of the proposed methods is that we find a knowledge segment from the knowledge graph to best represent the semantic meaning of the given claim, and reasons according to it. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on real-world datasets to demonstrate that the proposed methods have good performances.",
