            "title": "Purity-Preserving Kernel Tensor Low-Rank Learning for Robust Subspace Clustering",
            "abstract": "In recent years, multi-kernel learning (MKL) methods have been widely used in performing nonlinear data subspace clustering tasks, benefiting from the fact that they do not require the selection and tuning of predefined kernels. However, the effect of raw noise on the data structure in the feature space has been neglected in most MKL studies so far. In this paper, we propose a robust subspace clustering method called purity kernel tensor low-rank learning (KTLL), which effectively isolates noise transfer from the original data space to the high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, we construct the kernel pool obtained by MKL as a primitive third-order kernel tensor, separate the corrupted information in the feature space, and use the separated pure kernel tensor to learn the optimal affinity matrix. The tensor learning of the kernel pool can effectively mine the higher-order correlations among different kernel matrices, thus improving the clustering performance of KTLL.We have conducted extensive experiments to compare KTLL with state-of-the-art MKL and deep subspace clustering algorithms, and our results demonstrate the superiority of KTLL.",

            "abstract": "Existing natural image segmentation tasks often face some troubles in getting accurate contours or causing over-segmentation of local areas during segmentation, and the multi-feature information mining of images is insufficient. To address these problems, learnable tensor graph fusion framework for natural image segmentation (LTGF-NIS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we pre-process the original images by adaptive morphological reconstruction watershed transform, and the multi-feature data is extracted, the multi-feature data matrix contains information about the image. Then we design an adaptive weighted tensor affinity graph fusion method (AWTAGF), which learns the higher-order correlation of the multi-feature information by two coupling tensor, while achieving consistent representation of the multi-feature information by using adaptive weighted graph fusion. Finally, the obtained affinity graph is clustered and segmented using spectral clustering to realize the segmentation of natural images. We test affinity graph learning ability and natural image segmentation effect of the proposed algorithm on several datasets, the experimental data indicates that the segmentation effect of our framework is superior to some existing advanced methods.",
