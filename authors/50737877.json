            "title": "A Dynamics and Task Decoupled Reinforcement Learning Architecture for High-Efficiency Dynamic Target Intercept",
            "abstract": "Due to the flexibility and ease of control, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly used in various scenarios and applications in recent years. Training UAVs with reinforcement learning (RL) for a specific task is often expensive in terms of time and computation. However, it is known that the main effort of the learning process is made to fit the low-level physical dynamics systems instead of the high-level task itself. In this paper, we study to apply UAVs in the dynamic target intercept (DTI) task, where the dynamics systems equipped by different UAV models are correspondingly distinct. To this end, we propose a dynamics and task decoupled RL architecture to address the inefficient learning procedure, where the RL module focuses on modeling the DTI task without involving physical dynamics, and the design of states, actions, and rewards are completely task-oriented while the dynamics control module can adaptively convert actions from the RL module to dynamics signals to control different UAVs without retraining the RL module. We show the efficiency and efficacy of our results in comparison and ablation experiments against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Skeleton-based human action recognition and analysis have become increasingly attainable in many areas, such as security surveillance and anomaly detection. Given the prevalence of skeleton-based applications, tampering attacks on human skeletal features have emerged very recently. In particular, checking the temporal inconsistency and/or incoherence (TII) in the skeletal sequence of human action is a principle of forgery detection. To this end, we propose an approach to self-supervised learning of the temporal causality behind human action, which can effectively check TII in skeletal sequences. Especially, we design a multilevel skeleton-based forgery detection framework to recognize the forgery on frame level, clip level, and action level in terms of learning the corresponding temporal-causal skeleton representations for each level. Specifically, a hierarchical graph convolution network architecture is designed to learn low-level skeleton representations based on physical skeleton connections and high-level action representations based on temporal-causal dependencies for specific actions. Extensive experiments consistently show state-of-the-art results on multilevel forgery detection tasks and superior performance of our framework compared to current competing methods.",

            "abstract": "Fashion recommendation (FR) has received increasing attention in the research of new types of recommender systems. Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric.",

            "abstract": "Matrix factorization (MF) is a popular method for collaborative filtering. Recently, more and more MF methods have been proposed to incorporate side information. However, most of them are vulnerable to changes in data or sub-models. Moreover, data often follows a Pareto distribution and such an imbalance of data leads to a biased global mean, affecting the prediction accuracy. To overcome these defects, we designed a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model-based MF method (HGLMMF) which can leverage both the original and processed side information. More specifically, HGLMMF utilizes one portion of the side information to construct covariates for fixed effects and the other portion to model the cluster-specific effects to adjust the global-bias problem. In fact, a number of state-of-the-art MF models can be viewed as special cases of HGLMMF. The obtained prediction results from experiments prove that HGLMMF is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Quantum algorithm design lies in the hallmark of applications of quantum computation and quantum simulation. Here we put forward a deep reinforcement learning (RL) architecture for automated algorithm design in the framework of quantum adiabatic algorithm, where the optimal Hamiltonian path to reach a quantum ground state that encodes a compution problem is obtained by RL techniques. We benchmark our approach in Grover search and 3-SAT problems, and find that the adiabatic algorithm obtained by our RL approach leads to significant improvement in the success probability and computing speedups for both moderate and large number of qubits compared to conventional algorithms. The RL-designed algorithm is found to be qualitatively distinct from the linear algorithm in the resultant distribution of success probability. Considering the established complexity-equivalence of circuit and adiabatic quantum algorithms, we expect the RL-designed adiabatic algorithm to inspire novel circuit algorithms as well. Our approach offers a recipe to design quantum algorithms for generic problems through a machinery RL process, which paves a novel way to automated quantum algorithm design using artificial intelligence, potentially applicable to different quantum simulation and computation platforms from trapped ions and optical lattices to superconducting-qubit devices.",
