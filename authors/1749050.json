            "abstract": "This letter proposes a distributed strategy to achieve both persistent monitoring and target detection in a rectangular and obstacle-free environment. Each robot has to repeatedly follow a smooth trajectory and avoid collisions with other robots. To achieve this goal, we rely on the time-inverted Kuramoto dynamics and the use of Lissajous curves. We analyze the resiliency of the system to perturbations or temporary failures, and we validate our approach through both simulations and experiments on real robotic platforms. In the letter, we adopt Model Predictive Contouring Control as a low level controller to minimize the tracking error while accounting for the robots' dynamical constraints and the control inputs saturation. The results obtained in the experiments are in accordance with the simulations.",

In this paper, we will explore how to create a robust, efficient, and reliable decision-making mechanism to decide, at every point in time, the trajectories that a vehicle should take to overtake its opponents and win the race. The proposed framework combines a graph-based path planner with a game-theoretic model to generate powerful racing strategies.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we analyse the problem of simultaneous trilateration, i.e. when three ranging sensors retrieve their distance from a target, and we found that is ill-posed from an algebraic view-point. Then, we explain this fact using the concept of \u201cdelayed\u201d trilateration, i.e. we consider three ranging sensors that measure their distance from the agent at three distinct time steps, while the agent has moved through the environment. We prove with a counterexample that, in a general case, there are multiple trajectories that are compliant with the motion of the target and with the ranging measurements collected by the anchor of known position. Therefore, we claim here that three measurements are not sufficient to localise a moving target in a given environment even in ideal conditions. In particular, we claim that the classic trilateration problem assumes an additional implicit information besides the three ranging measurements, that is that the three measurements are taken with respect to the same point in space or, in the most general and most probable case of a moving target, simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "We consider a complex control problem: making a monopod accurately reach a target with a single jump. The monopod can jump in any direction at different elevations of the terrain. This is a paradigm for a much larger class of problems, which are extremely challenging and computationally expensive to solve using standard optimization-based techniques. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an interesting alternative, but an end-to-end approach in which the controller must learn everything from scratch can be non-trivial with a sparse-reward task like jumping. Our solution is to guide the learning process within an RL framework leveraging nature-inspired heuristic knowledge. This expedient brings widespread benefits, such as a drastic reduction of learning time, and the ability to learn and compensate for possible errors in the low-level execution of the motion. Our simulation results reveal a clear advantage of our solution against both optimization-based and end-to-end RL approaches.",

            "abstract": "In the context of telehealth, robotic approaches have proven a valuable solution to in-person visits in remote areas, with decreased costs for patients and infection risks. In particular, in ultrasonography, robots have the potential to reproduce the skills required to acquire high-quality images while reducing the sonographer\u2019s physical efforts. In this paper, we address the control of the interaction of the probe with the patient\u2019s body, a critical aspect of ensuring safe and effective ultrasonography. We introduce a novel approach based on variable impedance control, allowing the real-time optimisation of compliant controller parameters during ultrasound procedures. This optimisation is formulated as a quadratic programming problem and incorporates physical constraints derived from viscoelastic parameter estimations. Safety and passivity constraints, including an energy tank, are also integrated to minimise potential risks during human-robot interaction. The proposed method\u2019s efficacy is demonstrated through experiments on a patient\u2019s dummy torso, highlighting its potential for achieving safe behaviour and accurate force control during ultrasound procedures, even in cases of contact loss.",

            "abstract": "We propose a global constructibility analysis for a vehicle moving on a planar surface. Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.",

            "abstract": "Rescue missions in mountain environments are hardly achievable by standard legged robots\u2014because of the high slopes\u2014or by flying robots\u2014because of limited payload capacity. We present a concept for a rope-aided climbing robot which can negotiate up-to-vertical slopes and carry heavy payloads. The robot is attached to the mountain through a rope, and it is equipped with a leg to push against the mountain and initiate jumping maneuvers. Between jumps, a hoist is used to wind/unwind the rope to move vertically and affect the lateral motion. This simple (yet effective) two-fold actuation allows the system to achieve high safety and energy efficiency. Indeed, the rope prevents the robot from falling while compensating for most of its weight, drastically reducing the effort required by the leg actuator. We also present an optimal control strategy to generate point-to-point trajectories overcoming an obstacle. We achieve fast computation time (<1 s) thanks to the use of a custom simplified robot model. We validated the generated optimal movements in Gazebo simulations with a complete robot model with a < 5% error on a $16\\ m$ long jump, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and confirming the interest of our concept. Finally, we performed a reachability analysis showing that the region of achievable targets is strongly affected by the friction properties of the foot-wall contact.",

These models are typically analyzed quantitatively and are not often subject to validation using formal verification approaches, nor leverage policy syntheses and analysis techniques developed in formal verification. In this paper, we take a Markovian stochastic model for the spread of a SARSCoV-2-like infection. A state of this model represents the number of subjects in different health conditions. The considered model considers the different parameters that may have an impact on the spread of the disease and exposes the various decision variables that can be used to control it. We show that the modeling of the problem within state-of-the-art model checkers is feasible and it opens several opportunities. However, there are severe limitations due to i) the espressivity of the existing stochastic model checkers on one side, and ii) the size of the resulting Markovian model even for small population sizes.",

Specifically, we propose a novel methodology for optimally and flexibly managing task offloading in the context of heterogeneous computing and communication services required by real-time robotic applications. Differing from many related work, the proposed approach takes the number of admitted service migrations and the QoS upper and lower bounds as binding constraints. We model the QoS evolution based on the agent positions, the MEC servers serving the agents, the QoS requirements, the communication capabilities in the edge network, and the computing capabilities of the servers. The model is formalized as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to obtain an optimal schedule for the service migrations and communication and computation bandwidth allocation. Experimental results show that the approach outperforms baseline approaches and can scale to large deployments.",

Then, an optimisation algorithm merges RFID and odometry data to reconstruct the entire robot trajectory. The proposed method does not require precise placement of the landmarks and it is therefore fast and easy to deploy. Both numerical and experimental analysis are presented.",

            "abstract": "The accurate localization of robots in indoor environments is a well-known measurement problem, which becomes particularly critical in crowded scenarios, where collision with obstacles, objects, and human operators is very high. In this article, the problem is solved through an optimal path planning strategy that keeps into account the ranging measurement uncertainty from a given set of wireless anchors (e.g., ultra wideband (UWB) transceivers) that are used to track the position of the robot in a known reference frame through multilateration. In particular, assuming to use an observability-based filter (ObF), namely, a position tracking estimator conceived to ensure the global observability of the robot state (namely, its planar position and orientation) with quantifiable uncertainty, a potential-based path planning strategy is applied to drive the robot toward the goals while minimizing localization uncertainty. Several simulation results using two alternative artificial potential functions confirm the correctness and optimal performances of the proposed approach, which is entirely driven by observability and measurement uncertainty concerns and, as such, it is quite different and novel in the context of robots\u2019 path planning techniques.",

We consider a sparse deployment in which anchors are in a small number, and have finite and non-overlapping sensing ranges. Under the most extreme conditions (i.e., the robot being in sight of two anchors at different times), we provide a sufficient condition on the manoeuvres that the robot is required to execute within the range of each of the anchors in order to achieve global constructibility. When the robot travels along straight lines, these conditions are not met, but we can still have \u201clocal\u201d constructibility to a degree quantifiable through the smallest eigenvalue of the Constructibility Gramian (CG). Our second contribution is to show how this metric changes according to the geometric parameters of the linear trajectory with respect to the position of the anchors and their sensing range.",

In this paper, we propose to delegate this activity to a human operator that walks in front of the robot marking with her/his footsteps the path to be followed. The implementation of this approach requires a high degree of robustness in locating the specific person to be followed (the leader). We propose a three phase approach to fulfil this goal: 1. identification and tracking of the person in the image space, 2. sensor fusion between camera data and laser sensors, 3. point interpolation with continuous curvature curves. The approach is described in the paper and extensively validated with experimental results.",

The specific notion of connectivity adopted here is that the different agents have to mutually remain in line-of-sight, and this condition is guaranteed in presence of obstacles. In the computation of the graph topology, based on Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), each agent takes into account the surrounding environment, its own task and the tasks of its neighbours. Our solution permits the execution of heterogeneous tasks and the task dynamic reallocation between the robots when required by the situation. The approach relies on a sound theoretical framework, which is discussed in this letter, while its practical feasibility is shown through simulations and experimental data using real robotic platforms.",

Thus, effective and affordable localisation methods for indoor vehicles are attracting interest to implement real-time applications. This paper presents an Extended Kalman Smoother design to both localise a mobile agent and reconstruct its entire trajectory through a sensor-fusion employing the UHF-RFID passive technology. Extensive simulations are carried out by considering the smoother optimal-window length and the effect of missing measurements from reference tags. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted for different vehicle trajectories and for different linear and angular velocities to evaluate the method accuracy. Then, an experimental analysis with a unicycle wheeled robot is performed in real indoor scenario, showing a position and orientation root mean square errors of 15 cm, and 0.2 rad, respectively.",

By using a discrete-time formulation of the system\u2019s kinematics, we identify the geometric conditions that make the system globally observable and cast the state estimation problem into the framework of least-squares optimization. The observability filter thus obtained is remarkably different from classic Bayesian filters, such as the Kalman Filter, since it does not need a priori stochastic models of process and measurement uncertainty contributions and thus proves to have better performance than the Kalman filters if such contributions are partly unknown or differ from the expected values. The second important outcome of this work is the analytical study of uncertainty propagation. The effectiveness of the designed filter, the validity of the theoretical analysis of estimation uncertainties, and the comparisons with a state-of-the-art extended Kalman filter (EKF) are corroborated by extensive simulations and validated experimentally.",

The two main components are the activity and the motion planner. The activity planner composes a sequence of abstract activities, chosen from a given set, to synthesize a plan. Each activity is associated with a point of interest in the environment and with probabilistic parameters that depend on the plan, which are characterized by simulations in realistic scenarios. The low-level action to pass from an activity to the next is handled by the motion planner, which secures the physical feasibility of the chosen actions and their compatibility with the constraints posed by the user and the environment. Indeed, the final plan must respect the user constraints and optimise his/her satisfaction from the activity. We show a possible model for the problem as a chance constrained optimization along with an efficient technique to find high-quality solutions.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a parallel computing implementation of the Iterative Dynamic Programming (IDP) solution to the multipoint Markov-Dubins problem using GPUs. The multi-point Markov-Dubins problem requires the computation of the shortest path with bounded curvature that connects a sequence of planar points (waypoints). As well as being interesting in its own right, an efficient solution to this problem is key to finding optimal or suboptimal solutions of other problems such as the Dubins Travelling Salesman and the Dubins Orienteering problem. The constraint on the curvature makes the problem highly non-linear and complicates its solution. Classic methods are optimisation-based and cast the problem into the Nonlinear Programming (NLP) or Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) frameworks, for which existing solutions cannot be significantly parallelised. On the contrary, the IDP solution proposed here is well suited for parallel execution. In the paper, we show that the parallel implementation of the IDP outperforms both the NLP/MINLP methods and the iterative version of the IDP methods in terms of accuracy, computation time and power consumption. Computation time and power consumption will be the main focus of the paper, because they are closely related to the implementation on an embedded platform.",

The solution based on weighted least square (WLS) is popular, but its accuracy depends from a number of factors only partially known. In this article, we explore the dependency of the uncertainty from the geometric configuration of the anchors. We show a refinement technique for the estimate produced by the WLS that compensates for the effects of geometry on the WLS and reduces the target uncertainty to a value very close to the Cramer\u2013Rao Lower Bound. The resulting algorithm is called geometric WLS (G-WLS) and its application is particularly important in the most critical conditions for WLS (i.e., when the target is far apart from the anchors). The effectiveness of the G-WLS is proven theoretically and is demonstrated on a large number of experiments and simulations.",

Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a mobile robot travels across an area infrastructured with a small number of UWB anchors. The presence of obstacles in the environment introduces an offset in the measurements of the distance between the robot and the UWB anchors causing a degradation in the localisation performance. By using a discrete\u2013time formulation of the system dynamics, we show that, under mild condition, the trajectories can be observed and the offset can be estimated in a finite number of steps.

This problem is relevant for the path planning of a non-holonomic robot, such as a wheeled vehicle.

            "abstract": "A combined minimum time - minimum jerk traffic management system for the vehicle coordination in an automated warehouse is presented. The algorithm is organised in two steps: in the first, a simple minimum time optimisation problem is solved, in the second step, this time-optimal solution is refined into a smooth minimum jerk plan for the autonomous forklifts in order to avoid impulsive forces that may unbalance the vehicle. For the first step, we propose a novel approach based on Linear Programming, which guarantees convergence to the optimal solution starting from a feasible point, and a low computational overhead, which makes it suitable for real-time applications. The output of this step is a piecewise constant velocity profile for all the moving robots that ensures collision avoidance. The second step takes such speed profile and generates its smoothed version, which minimises the jerk while respecting the same levels of safety of the solution generated by the first step. We discuss the different solutions with simulation and experimental data.",

Furthermore, the specific algebraic form taken by the system\u2019s evolution allows us to cast the state reconstruction problem into a typical least-squares optimisation framework in order to carry out a thorough uncertainty propagation analysis. The resulting position estimation technique does not require any prior knowledge on the distribution of the noise.

In this work we deal with the problem of detecting and explaining exceptional behaving values in categorical datasets by perceiving an attribute value as anomalous if its frequency occurrence is exceptionally typical or un-typical within the distribution of frequencies occurrences of any other attribute value. The notion of frequency occurrence is provided by specialising the Kernel Density Estimation method to the domain of frequency values and an outlierness measure is de\ufb01ned by leveraging the cdf of such a density. This measure is able to simultaneously identify two kinds of anomalies called lower outliers and upper outliers , namely exceptionally low or high frequent values. Moreover, data values labeled as outliers come with an interpretable explanations for their abnormality, which is a desirable feature of any knowledge discovery technique.",

Since C++ is one of the de facto languages to program real-time systems, recently Tice has been proposed as a real-time language that is embedded in C++ by means of TMP (template metaprogramming) so that the experience of programming in Tice is the experience of using an ordinary C++ library, and as such, Tice programs are compilable and processable using off-the-shelf C++ compilers and tools. The proposal, however, only described Tice syntax, semantics, and the compile-time model analyses performed by the language implementation without addressing practical compilation times, which could prevent wide-spread adoption. Considering its novelty, potential industrial impact, and the implementation's repository being public, we analyzed its time complexity and validated our analyses empirically by using GCC and Clang, the widely available industrial off-the-shelf compilers. Furthermore, during analysis we learned the engineering techniques that likely shorten compilation times and make the complex language implementation possible. This paper presents our analyses, their empirical validations, and the engineering techniques learned.",

For most MBD approaches, the source code is just an intermediate artifact that can be generated automatically from the models. This assumption clashes with an undeniable fact: a large share of the commercial embedded software exploits existing libraries or is developed using C/C++ natively. A way to reconcile the ambitions of MBD with the use of a programming language is by offering new language constructs and an innovative compilation tool\u2010chain that prevents model error and timing problems \u201cby construction.\u201d However, the persistent popularity of C/C++ among embedded programmers and the limited availability of tools have severely limited the uptake of alternative programming languages for embedded software. Therefore, we propose an original route. Our language proposal, named Tice, has been shaped as a C++ active library. Tice retains full compatibility with existing C++ code, which can be integrated easily into new Tice\u2010based projects. The enforcement of Tice syntax and semantics can be made by a standard C++ compiler, forgoing the need for new tools. In this article, we describe Tice's syntax, semantics, and model of computation and communication. We demonstrate Tice's practical applicability on an industrial scale use\u2010case and give ample evidence for Tice's efficient compilation using off\u2010the\u2010shelf C++ compilers.

Our approach to predict human motion is based on a neural network of a peculiar kind. Contrary to conventional deep neural networks, our network embeds in its structure the popular Social Force Model, a dynamic equation describing the motion in physical terms. This choice allows us to concentrate the learning phase in the aspects which are really unknown (i.e., the model\u2019s parameters) and to keep the structure of the network simple and manageable. As a result, we are able to obtain a good prediction accuracy even by using a small and synthetically generated training set. Importantly, the prediction accuracy remains acceptable even when the network is applied in scenarios radically different from those for which it was trained. Finally, the choices of the network are \u201cexplainable\u201d, as they can be interpreted in physical terms. Comparative and experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "The phase of the signals backscattered by the ultrahigh frequency radio-frequency identification (UHF-RFID) tags is generally more insensitive to multipath propagation than the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). However, signal phase measurements are inherently ambiguous and could be further affected by the unknown phase offsets added by the transponders. As a result, the localization of an agent by using only signal phase measurements looks infeasible. In this article, it is shown instead that the design of a dynamic position estimator (e.g., a Kalman filter) based only on the signal phase measurement is actually possible. To this end, the necessary conditions to ensure the theoretical local nonlinear observability are first demonstrated. However, a system that is locally observable guarantees the convergence of the localization algorithm only if the actual initial agent position is approximately known a priori. Therefore, the second part of the analysis covers the global observability, which ensures convergence starting from any initial condition in the state space. It is important to emphasize that complete observability holds only in theory. In fact, measurement uncertainty may greatly affect position estimation convergence. The validity of the analysis and the practicality of this localization approach are further confirmed by numerical simulations based on an unscented Kalman filter (UKF).",

            "abstract": "We present an algorithm for collision free and socially-aware navigation of multiple robots in an environment shared with human beings, other robots and with the presence of static obstacles. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem, where the cost function is chosen in order for the robotic agents to exhibit bio-inspired behaviors, such as cooperation inside the group and cohesive motion. Some of the constraints are required to avoid collision between the agents and with other obstacles and emanate from the application of Velocity Obstacle approach. The nonholonomic dynamics of the vehicles, is managed through the application of the feedback linearization technique to map the velocities in the control values. In this paper we propose both centralized solution and a completely decentralized solution. The overall strategies are extensively tested in simulations.",

            "abstract": "The problem addressed in this paper is the optimal allocation of a CPU to a number of software control tasks. Each task is used to implement a feedback controller for a linear and time invariant system and is activated with a fixed period. On every periodic activation, the task executes a job, which collects the output of the system, and produces the control values after executing for a random computation time. If a job's duration exceeds a deadline, then the job is cancelled and the control values are not updated. The systems to be controlled are affected by process noise. Therefore the performance of each control loop can be evaluated through the steady-state covariance of the system's state, which depends on the probability with which the task implementing the controller drops its jobs. We show that by making a proper choice for the scheduling algorithm, this probability can be straightforwardly computed as a function of the scheduling parameters. This observation enables the construction of a very efficient procedure for finding the scheduling parameters that attain the optimal tradeoff between the performance of the different control loops.",

            "abstract": "Robotic walkers are a promising solution for physical and cognitive support to older adults. This paper proposes a low cost path following strategy combining the advantages of a simple mechanical braking guidance, such as safety, passivity, and a low cost, and the ones of a vibrotactile haptic guidance, such as comfort and portability. The user is guided by providing indications on the directions of motion using the haptic interface so that he/she can autonomously and comfortably follow the planned path. However, whenever the user significantly departs from the path (for instance, s/he gets too close to obstacles), the braking system kicks in to safely steer the user back along the proper direction. The formal correctnesses of the hybrid strategy ruling the combination of the two guidance systems is proved theoretically. Moreover, a comprehensive experimental study with users aged 64 to 100, including also psychological evaluations, has been performed. The hybrid combination of the braking and the haptic guidance systems is shown to outperform the two individual approaches in isolation. The combination of the two retains the same level of the users\u2019 perceived comfort typical of the haptic-only guidance while ensuring the adequate path following performance typical of the braking-only guidance. In particular, the combined approach produces a mean path following error equal to 41% of the mean path following error ensured by the haptic-only approach. Conversely, thanks to the haptic feedback, the combined approach halves the activation time and the number of interventions needed in the braking-only approach.",

            "abstract": "A well-known, crucial problem for indoor positioning of mobile agents (e.g., robots) equipped with exteroceptive sensors is related to the need to deploy reference landmarks in a given environment. Normally, anytime a landmark is detected, an agent estimates its own location and attitude with respect to landmark position and/or orientation in the chosen reference frame. When instead no landmark is recognized, other sensors (e.g., odometers in the case of wheeled robots) can be used to track the agent position and orientation from the last detected landmark. At the moment, landmark placement is usually based just on common-sense criteria, which are not formalized properly. As a result, positioning uncertainty tends to grow unpredictably. On the contrary, the purpose of this paper is to minimize the number of landmarks, while ensuring that localization uncertainty is kept within wanted boundaries. The developed approach relies on the following key features: a dynamic model describing agents\u2019 motion, a model predicting the agents\u2019 paths within a given environment and, finally, a conjunctive normal form formalization of the optimization problem, which can be efficiently (although approximately) solved by a greedy algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed landmark placement technique is first demonstrated through simulations in a variety of conditions and then it is validated through experiments on the field, by using non-Bayesian and Bayesian position tracking algorithms.",

In contrast, real-time programming languages address not only the functional aspect but also the nonfunctional real-time aspect to automatically ensure the consistency of both aspects in the resulting code. Despite many real-time programming languages proposed in the literature, embedded and real-time programs for economical reasons have continued to be written in C/C++ with their real-time aspect being dealt separately using modeling tools (e.g., MATLAB/Simulink) and the consistency of both aspects being checked manually. As embedded and real-time systems permeate through people's lives, it becomes increasingly imperative that both aspects be kept consistent automatically to improve the reliability of the systems. To that end, we propose a real-time programming language called Tice with three novel features: (1) Tice programs are written as modern standard C++ programs. (2) Tice programs can be compiled using any modern off-the-shelf standard C++ compiler. (3) Tice programs compose with other C/C++ programs as C++ libraries. These novel features make Tice significantly more economical than other real-time programming languages proposed in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Among the manifold wireless technologies recently adopted for indoor localization and tracking, radars based on phased-array transceivers at 60 GHz are gaining momentum. The main advantages of this technology are: high accuracy, good ability to track multiple target with a low computation burden and preservation of privacy. Despite the growing commercial success of low-cost radar platforms, accurate studies to evaluate their tracking performance are not frequent in the literature, the main reasons being the commercial policies that prevent a direct access to the processed data and the difficult calibration of indoor positioning systems under dynamic conditions. This paper aims to fill this gap providing an extensive and scientifically sound performance analysis of one of these sensors (i.e., the System-onChip (SOC) TI IWR6843) and exposing benefits and limitations of 60-GHz mm-wave sensors for people localization and tracking. Multiple experimental results show that the average standard positioning uncertainty is about 30 cm under dynamic conditions. Our study also reveals the critical impact of three parameters, which are not properly documented by the manufacturer. Localization accuracy and robustness are also significantly affected by the risk of delayed and spurious detections. In the paper, a possible mitigation strategy of these anomalies is presented.",

Our formulation is agnostic w.r.t. the source of uncertainty and enables an intuitive specification of user navigation requirements along with stochastic guarantees on the system operation. Experimental results in simulation and with a real platform show that our approach i) meets these guarantees in practice ii) achieves the same accuracy of a fixed periodic sampling but with significantly higher scalability and lower energy consumption iii) is resilient to errors in UWB estimates, enabling the use of low-accuracy ranging schemes which further improve these two performance metrics.",

The predictions are generated by a linear model, whose parameters are identified on-line using a Constrained Kalman Filter. The strategy is successfully validated via extensive experiments with real drones performing altitude stabilisation and trajectory tracking tasks.

            "abstract": "Indoor localisation is currently regarded as one of the most useful services offered to human beings and robotics agents, as it can support a variety of applications. Among all the possible sensing solutions developed to address this problem (which is usually made challenging by the complex, heterogeneous and crowded nature of indoor environments), RFID systems based on passive tags are very promising due to their relatively low cost and the ease of deployment. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the localisation problem using Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID tags for mobile robots is considered. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by analysing the local nonlinear observability of the system at hand, despite the inherent ambiguity of the phase of backscattered RF signals, which can be measured by a system installed on the moving agent. The validity of the analysis and the practicality of this localisation approach is further confirmed by using a position tracking estimator based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of guiding a senior user along a path using a robotic walking assistant. This is a particular type of path following problem, for which most of the solutions available in the literature require an exact localisation of the robot in the environment. An accurate localisation is obtained either with a heavy infrastructure (e.g., an active sensing system deployed in the environment or deploying landmarks in known positions) or using SLAM approaches with a massive data collection. Our key observation is that the intervention of the system (and a good level of accuracy) is only required in proximity of difficult decision points, while we can rely on the user in an environment where the only possibility is just to maintain a course (e.g., a corridor). The direct implication is that we can instrument the environment with a heavy infrastructure only in certain areas. This design strategy has to be complemented by an adequate control law that shifts the authority (i.e., the control of the actuators) between the robot and the user according to the accuracy of the information available to the robot. Such a control law is exactly the contribution of this paper.",

We show that the centre of the orbit eventually converges to the target position using theoretical arguments and extensive simulation data. By using the same approach, we can solve the rendezvous problem: the team first scans an area in search of a target; as soon as one of the UAVs spots, the other components converge on the target position.",

The result is obtained leaving the user in control (without any actuation) when she/he follows straight lines, while the motors kick in when the user has to make a turn.

The vehicle moves in a crowded environment and can detect other pedestrians in the surroundings. We propose a reactive planner that modifies the path in order to avoid pedestrians in the surroundings. The algorithm relies on a very accurate model to predict the motion of each pedestrian, i.e., the headed social force model. The possible trajectories for both the vehicle and the pedestrians are modeled as clothoid curves, which are efficient to manage from the numeric point of view and are very comfortable to follow for the user. Probabilistic techniques are used to account for the variability of the motion of each pedestrian. The path is efficient to generate, is collision free (up to a certain probability), and is comfortable to follow. Simulations and comparisons with a state-of-the-art planner using real data as well as experiments are reported to prove the effectiveness of the method.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of the reactive re-planning of an optimal trajectory for autonomous vehicles subject to geometric and dynamic constraints. Reactive replanning is used when a vehicle following a planned trajectory encounters an unforeseen obstacle. In such a case, a new local trajectory that avoids the obstacle has to be generated, without violating any constraint and preserving optimality. The solution presented in the paper guarantees that the new trajectory rejoins the previously planned one shortly after the obstacle. Moreover, the transition between old and new trajectory is smooth up to second derivative (curvature), which makes it easy to track an emergency manoeuvre. Finally, our solution is efficient and can be implemented in real-time on lean hardware. In order to validate the approach, we show how the re-planning can be executed in a few milliseconds (on a standard machine) for the realistic example of a racing car.",

The strong push towards these approaches is mainly dictated by the need of fully exploit the available computation time or to scale down power consumption according to the operating conditions. Different models of computation have been proposed that, in combination with a predictable scheduling mechanism, produce closed loop systems with guaranteed levels of performance despite of the stochastic nature of the delay that affects the executions. One of the key issue is if output samples from the plant should be buffered during a delayed execution or simply dropped to retain the freshest. This paper explores this tradeoff for three different models of computation applied to a classic Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller.",

A crucial problem of this kind of techniques is landmark deployment, which should keep into account not only the limited detection range of the adopted sensors and the non-null probability of missing a landmark, even if it actually lies within the sensor detection area (SDA). This paper focuses on minimum landmark placement taking into account possible environment contextual information. This solution relies on a greedy placement algorithm that optimally solves the problem while keeping positioning uncertainty below a given limit. The correctness of the proposed approach is verified through multiple simulations in the context of the EU project ACANTO, which requires to localise one or more smart robotic walkers in large, public and potentially crowded environments such as shopping malls or airports.",

            "abstract": "Assistive passive robotic walkers are naturally modelled as rear-driven bicycle with control on the front steering wheels. Standard path following algorithms used for unicycle-like robots can then be readily available, e.g. using backstepping techniques, to control the walker on desired paths. However, such an approach is usually singular in the very common situation of zero velocity, e.g. whenever the vehicle starts its motion or the user stops for any reason. The paper proposes a non-singular passive path following algorithm for an assistive robotic walker equipped with front steering wheels. The control law avoids the singularities, since it is velocity-independent, and allows the designer to specify saturation limits on the steering angles. The converging properties of the non-singular velocity-independent controller in the presence of saturation constraints are firstly formally proved and tested in simulations. Then extensive experiments performed on 14 testers are presented. These tests underline the promising performance of the proposed controller and the importance of singularities-avoidance in real-world scenarios to increase human comfort along the planned trajectory.",

            "abstract": "Robotic walkers are a particular class of devices used to assist users with physical or cognitive impairments in their navigation of large public spaces. In this context, a guidance mechanism is a controller that steers the user towards the desired path when he/she deviates. Passive guidance mechanisms do not directly propel the vehicle and leave the user in control of his/her walk. The inherent safety of passive guidance and the intuitive behaviour of the device make this class of solutions preferable to any other for robot assisted walking. The possible ways to obtain a passive behaviour in robotic walkers either require complex and expensive sensors or generate potentially rough (bang-bang) manoeuvres that are detrimental to the user's comfort. The contribution of this work is a path following controller that simulates passivity using a pair of active motors operating on the rear wheels of the walker. The system estimates and tracks the velocity desired by the user and the motors generate a rotational torque only when a turn toward the path is required. The proposed solution delivers high levels of comfort, does not rely on expensive hardware and preserves all the important properties of a passive mechanism.",

            "abstract": "In plant mitochondria an essential mechanism for gene expression is RNA editing, often influencing the synthesis of functional proteins. RNA editing alters the linearity of genetic information transfer, intro- ducing differences between RNAs and their coding DNA sequences that hind both experimental and computational research of genes. Thus common software tools for gene search, successfully exploited to find canonic genes, often can fail in discovering genes encrypted in the genome of plants. In this work we propose a novel strategy useful to intercept candidate coding sequences resulting from some possible editing substitutions on the start and stop codons of a given input organism DNA. Our method is based on the simulation of the RNA editing mechanism, in order to generate candidate Open Reading Frame (ORF) sequences that could code for some, yet unknown, proteins. Results obtained on the mtDNA of Oryza sativa are promising, since we identified ORF sequences trascripted in Oriza, that do not cor- respond to already known proteins in this organism. Part of the corresponding amino acid sequences present high homologies with proteins already discovered in other organisms, the remaining ones could represent novel proteins not yet discovered in Oryza.",

The ultimate goal of the estimation algorithm is to retrieve the thrust, i.e. torque and force, that the older adult user of the robotic walker applies to the platform. These quantities are of paramount importance in order to adopt intelligent and comfortable walker guidance algorithms. The novelty of this approach is the avoidance of additional costly sensors that are usually used to solve such a problem.

In such cases, probabilistic methods, in which the probability of a deadline miss can be guaranteed and related to the scheduling design choices, can be an important tool for system design. Several techniques for probabilistic guarantees exist for the resource reservation scheduler and are based on the assumption that the process describing the application is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In this paper, we consider a particular class of robotic application for which this assumption is not verified. For such applications, we have verified that the computation time is more faithfully described by a Markov model. We propose techniques based on the theory of hidden Markov models to extract the structure of the model from the observation of a number of execution traces of the application. As a second contribution, we show how to adapt probabilistic guarantees to a Markovian computation time. Our experimental results reveal a very good match between the theoretical findings and the experiments.",

In the absence of a GPS signal, an increasingly popular solution is based on fusing information from a dead reckoning system that utilises on-board sensors with absolute position data extracted from the environment. In the application considered in this paper, the information on absolute position is given by visual landmarks deployed on the floor of the environment considered. This solution is inexpensive and provably reliable as long as the landmarks are sufficiently dense. On the other hand, a massive presence of landmark has high deployment and maintenance costs. In this paper, we build on the knowledge of a large number of trajectories (collected from environment observation) and seek the optimal placement that guarantees a localisation accuracy better than a specified value with a minimal number of landmarks. After formulating the problem, we analyse its complexity and describe an efficient greedy placement algorithm. Finally, the proposed approach is validated in realistic use cases.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a control algorithm that steers a robotic walking assistant along a planned path using electromechanical brakes. The device is modeled as a Dubins' car, i.e., a wheeled vehicle that moves only forward in the plane and has a limited turning radius. In order to reduce the cost of the hardware, no force sensor is employed. This feature hampers the application of control algorithms based on a modulated braking action. A viable solution is based on the application of on/off braking action, thus forcing the vehicle to turn with a fixed turning radius. In order to avoid the annoying chattering behaviour, which is the inevitable companion of all bang-bang solutions, we propose a hybrid controller based on three discrete states that rule the application of the braking action. The resulting feedback controller secures a gentle convergence of the user toward the planned path and his/her steady progress towards the destination. This is obtained by using two independent hystereses thresholds, the first one associated with the approaching phase and the second with the following phases. The system convergence toward the path is formally proved. Simulations and experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the good level of comfort for the user.",

            "abstract": "Motion planning for service robots used for human assistance in complex environments is a challenging task with multifaceted requirements. On the one hand, the generated path has to avoid obstacles and satisfy the user requirements. On the other, the generated path has to be perceived as comfortable by the user. An efficient solution to this difficult problem is based on a separation of concerns between two subproblems: 1. generating a sequence of waypoints that connects the source to the destination, 2. generating a path that joins the waypoints and complies with the dynamic constraints. In this paper, we concentrate on the second problem with an explicit focus on how to account for users' comfort. The result is accomplished by solving an optimal control problem that inherently generates the smooth trajectories required by the user. The cost functions used in the optimisation problem allows to take different dimensions of the user's comfort into consideration. Our technique lends itself to an efficient numeric solution and can be easily applied to different algorithms for waypoint generation.",

Assuming a bufferless communication simplifies the computation of the probability distribution of the end--to--end delay, since when an item is correctly processed by the pipeline its accumulated delay is simply the sum of the delays incurred in each stage. However, data can be dropped at any stage if the pipeline, and this requires a precedure to compute the probability of such an event. This computation is the main problem addressed in the paper, where we also show the practical applicability of the approach through a set of experiments.",

The other ones are based on tactile or acoustic stimuli, and suggest a direction of motion that the user is supposed to take on her own will. We describe the technological basis for the hardware components implementing the different solutions, and show specialized path following algorithms for each of them. The paper reports an extensive user validation activity with a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the different solutions. In this work, we test our system just with young participants to establish a safer methodology that will be used in future studies with older adults.",

Yet, it turns out that this task is formidable even when very simple theories are considered. It is, therefore, crucial to be able to break this task into several subtasks that can be solved separately and in parallel. We show that minimal models of positive propositional theories can be decomposed based on the structure of the dependency graph of the theories. This observation can be useful for many applications involving computation with minimal models. As an example of such benefits, we introduce new algorithms for minimal model finding and checking that are based on model decomposition. The algorithms\u2019 temporal worst-case complexity is exponential in the size s of the largest connected component of the dependency graph, but their actual cost depends on the size of the largest source actually encountered, which can be far smaller than s, and on the class of theories to which sources belong. Indeed, if all sources reduce to an HCF or HEF theory, the algorithms are polynomial in the size of the theory.",

We propose a modelling technique for the system that reduces the computation of such a probability to that of the steady state probability of an infinite state Discrete Time Markov Chain with a periodic structure. This structure is exploited to develop an efficient numeric solution where different accuracy/computation time trade-offs can be obtained by operating on the granularity of the model. More importantly we offer a closed form conservative bound for the probability of a deadline miss. Our experiments reveal that the bound remains reasonably close to the experimental probability in one real-time application of practical interest. When this bound is used for the optimisation of the overall Quality of Service for a set of tasks sharing the CPU, it produces a good sub-optimal solution in a small amount of time.",

Many of them are centralized so that they have to face problems related to efficiency and scalability. A few of them are distributed, but in this case, the complexity of the e\u2010Commerce process implies computation overhead on the client side, which is often unsuitable if mobile devices are used by customers. In this paper, we study how the software distribution in recommender systems affects their performances, depending on the characteristics of the e\u2010Commerce population. To this end, we present a distributed testbed architecture for e\u2010Commerce recommender systems using a multi\u2010tiered agent\u2010based approach to generate effective recommendations without requiring such an onerous amount of computation per single client. We use such a testbed to study the main advantages and limitations associated with the problem of distributing the computation of recommendations. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

RNA editing alters the linearity of genetic information transfer. Indeed it causes \n \ndifferences between RNAs and their coding DNA sequences that hinder both experimental and computational \n \nresearch of genes. Therefore common software tools for gene search, successfully applied to find canonical \n \ngenes, often fail in discovering genes encrypted in the genome of plants. \n \nHere we propose a novel strategy useful to identify candidate coding sequences resulting from possible editing \n \nsubstitutions. In particular, we consider c!u substitutions leading to the creation of new start and stop codons \n \nin the mitochondrial DNA of a given input organism. We try to mimic the natural RNA editing mechanism, \n \nin order to generate candidate Open Reading Frame sequences that could code for novel, uncharacterized \n \nproteins. Results obtained analyzing the mtDNA of Oryza sativa are supportive of this approach, since we \n \nidentified thirteen Open Reading Frame sequences transcribed in Oryza, that do not correspond to already \n \nknown proteins. Five of the corresponding amino acid sequences present high homologies with proteins already \n \ndiscovered in other organisms, whereas, for the remaining ones, no such homology was detected.",

The robot moves in a known environment following typical trajectories, which can be characterised in statistical terms. One of the main drivers of this paper is its application to assistive robots guiding senior or impaired users in shopping centres or in other public spaces. To localise itself the robot uses onboard sensors such as encoders and inertial platforms. The level of noise in these sensors and the lack of absolute measurements determines a steady growth of the uncertainty on its position. To alleviate the problem, we assume the presence of a number of visual markers deployed in the environment. Whenever the robot comes across one of these sensors, the uncertainty on its position is reset. In the paper, we show a methodology to minimise the number of these sensors and to select their position so that the uncertainty is never worse than a given target threshold with an assigned probability.",

            "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of localizing a group of robots. Each robot is equipped with an autonomous self-localization system based on both high-rate odometers and a front camera detecting sporadically simple visual landmarks placed on the floor at known positions and with a known attitude within a given 2D reference frame. In addition, the robots can share their own states to improve localization accuracy. In this paper, after reviewing the general problem of collaborative localization, two potential strategies based on a distributed Interlaced Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) are compared. In the first one, localization is refined through high-rate mutual measurements of Euclidean distance between pairs of robots. The distance values are obtained using an omni-directional wireless ranging system of limited accuracy. In the second one, an on-board Kinect-like front RGB-D vision system is assumed to measure the agent's relative position with respect to other robots in view at a lower rate, but with higher accuracy. To the best of authors' knowledge, this performance comparison is new, since most of previous studies on collaborative localization are overoptimistic as implicitly assume that mutual agent measurements are not intermittent and are available at all sampling times.",

The device has been modelled as a Dubins' car, a wheeled vehicle that moves only forward in the plane and constrained by a lower bounded turning radius. In order to reduce the hardware requirements as much as possible, so as to reduce the costs, we work with limited sensory information, so the classic modulated braking guidance cannot be implemented. As a consequence, the vehicle has a very limited set fixed turning radius manoeuvres ruled by a hybrid controller based on three discrete states: go straight, turn right and turn left. Despite of these limitations and in order to ensure a gentle and natural convergence of the user to the planned path, the robot approaches the path with an orientation that depends on its position and that guarantees a continuous curvature of the tracked path. Results are validated using extensive simulations.",

While the problem of indoor localization is still open and already quite complex per se, in large public places, additional issues of cost, accuracy, and scalability arise. In this paper, the position estimation and tracking technique developed within the project devices for assisted living (DALi) is described, analyzed through simulations, and finally validated by means of a variety of experiments on the field. The goal of the DALi project is to design a robotic wheeled walker guiding people with psychomotor problems. Indeed, people with motor or cognitive impairments are often afraid of moving in large and crowded environments (e.g., because they could lose the sense of direction). In order to mitigate this problem, the position tracking approach described in this paper is based on multisensor data fusion and it is conceived to assure a good tradeoff between target accuracy, level of confidence, and deployment costs. Quite interestingly, the same approach could be used for indoor automated guided vehicles and robotics.",

However, the frontier between these two classes is thinner than one may think, and many systems that were considered as hard real-time in the past should now be reconsidered under a different light. In this paper we shall first recall the fundamental notion of time-predictability and criticality, in order to understand where the real-time deadlines that we use in our theoretical models come from. We shall then introduce the model of a soft real-time system and present one popular method for scheduling hard and soft real-time tasks, the resource reservation framework. Finally, we shall show how resource reservation techniques can be successfully applied to the design of classical control systems, thus adding robustness to the system and increasing resource utilisation and performance.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of optimal allocation of computation resources to a set of control tasks sharing a CPU. Each task is used to control a linear and time invariant plant affected by noise and is supposed to have a computation time with known distribution. The metric we use to express the Quality of Control (QoC) is a function of the steady state covariance of the state. We show how the combination of a Resource Reservation scheduler with an unconventional model of computation known as Continuous Stream produces a system that is easy to analyse. In particular, it is possible to compute the QoC of each control loop as a function of the fraction of CPU (bandwidth) that the task receives, and formalise an optimisation problem where a global QoC metric is defined that consolidates the QoC of each task. We show an efficient solution to this optimisation problem and validate its efficacy on a set of numeric examples.",

            "abstract": "The nucleolus is a well-known solution concept for coalitional games to fairly distribute the total available worth among the players. The nucleolus is known to be NP-hard to compute over compact coalitional games, that is, over games whose functions specifying the worth associated with each coalition are encoded in terms of polynomially computable functions over combinatorial structures. In particular, hardness results have been exhibited over minimum spanning tree games, threshold games, and flow games. However, due to its intricate definition involving reasoning over exponentially many coalitions, a nontrivial upper bound on its complexity was missing in the literature and looked for.\n This article faces this question and precisely characterizes the complexity of the nucleolus, by exhibiting an upper bound that holds on any class of compact games, and by showing that this bound is tight even on the (structurally simple) class of graph games. The upper bound is established by proposing a variant of the standard linear-programming based algorithm for nucleolus computation and by studying a framework for reasoning about succinctly specified linear programs, which are contributions of interest in their own. The hardness result is based on an elaborate combinatorial reduction, which is conceptually relevant for it provides a \u201cmeasure\u201d of the computational cost to be paid for guaranteeing voluntary participation to the distribution process. In fact, the pre-nucleolus is known to be efficiently computable over graph games, with this solution concept being defined as the nucleolus but without guaranteeing that each player is granted with it at least the worth she can get alone, that is, without collaborating with the other players.\n Finally, this article identifies relevant tractable classes of coalitional games, based on the notion of type of a player. Indeed, in most applications where many players are involved, it is often the case that such players do belong in fact to a limited number of classes, which is known in advance and may be exploited for computing the nucleolus in a fast way.",

            "abstract": "Many applications in mobile robotics require the localization of the robot with respect to the boundary of a path (e.g., a lane marker) and the reconstruction of the path in front of the robot. The former can be used as a basis for a reactive control scheme that drives the robot along the specified path and the latter is used to plan its future motion. Our solution to these problems relies on a camera mounted on the chassis and pointing headway. The relevant elements of the image grabbed from the camera (i.e., the lines delimiting the path) are robustly extracted and projected into the field-of-view of a virtual camera looking over the scene from above. This way, we obtain a top plan view that allows us to reconstruct position and bearing of the vehicle irrespective of mechanical vibrations or imperfect plane of motion. What is more, by pushing forward the virtual camera, we are able to reconstruct the path in front of the robot for some distance ahead. In this paper, we describe the main ideas underlying the approach and its implementation. The accuracy of the technique and the computational workload is evaluated through a large set of experiments.",

People with motion or cognitive impairments could perceive large crowded environments as intimidating. In such situations, a smart wheeled walker able to estimate its own position autonomously could be used to guide users safely towards a wanted destination. Two strong requirements for this kind of applications are: low deployment costs and the capability to work in large and crowded environments.

            "abstract": "Indoor localization and tracking of moving human targets is a task of recognized importance and difficulty. In this paper, we describe a position measurement technique based on the fusion of various sensor data collected using a wearable embedded platform. Since the accumulated measurement uncertainty affecting inertial data (especially due to the on-board accelerometer) usually makes the measured position values drift away quickly, a heuristic approach is used to keep velocity estimation uncertainty in the order of a few percent. As a result, unlike other solutions proposed in the literature, localization accuracy is good when the wearable platform is worn at the waist. Unbounded uncertainty growth is prevented by injecting the position values collected at a very low rate from the nodes of an external fixed infrastructure (e.g., based on cameras) into an extended Kalman filter. If the adjustment rate is in the order of several seconds and if such corrections are performed only when the user is detected to be in movement, the infrastructure remains idle most of time with evident benefits in terms of scalability. In fact, multiple platforms could work simultaneously in the same environment without saturating the communication channels.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a position tracking technique based on multisensor data fusion for rollators helping elderly people to move safely in large indoor spaces such as public buildings, shopping malls or airports. The proposed technique has been developed within the FP7 project DALi, and relies on an extended Kalman filter processing data from dead-reckoning sensors (i.e. encoders and gyroscopes), a short-range radio frequency identification (RFID) system and a front Kinect camera. As known, position tracking based on dead-reckoning sensors only is intrinsically affected by growing uncertainty. In order to keep such uncertainty within wanted boundaries, the position values are occasionally updated using a coarse-grained grid of low-cost passive RFID tags with known coordinates in a given map-based reference frame. Unfortunately, RFID tag detection does not provide any information about the orientation of the rollator. Therefore, a front camera detecting some markers on the walls is used to adjust direction. Of course, the data rate from both the RFID reader and the camera is not constant, as it depends on the actual user's trajectory and on the distance between pairs of RFID tags and pairs of markers. Therefore, the average distance between tags and markers should be properly set to achieve a good trade-off between overall deployment costs and accuracy. In the paper, the results of a simulation-based performance analysis are reported in view of implementing the proposed localization and tracking technique in a real environment.",

The model incorporates the objectives of the user, pre-existing knowledge of the environment and real time sensor data. The algorithm is thus able to suggest a course of action to achieve the user's changing goals, while minimising the probability of problems for the user and others in the environment.

            "abstract": "This paper presents a new Model of Computation (MoC) for real-time tasks used in control systems. This new model, named continuous stream task model, relaxes some of the constraints imposed by the traditional hard and soft real-time task models. A key advantage of the model is the possibility to easily analyse the probabilistic evolution of the delays. This leads to an easy formalisation of necessary and sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability of the closed loop system producing considerable savings in the amount of CPU bandwidth required to stabilise the system. This fact is confirmed by an extensive set of simulations.",

            "abstract": "Models are used in control domains for early validation of system properties, using simulation or formal verification, and for the automatic generation of a software implementation. We propose an approach in which a functional model of the controls is matched to a model of the execution platform through an intermediate mapping model, that represents the software tasks and communication messages. The functional model is (partly) developed in Simulink and code is generated for each subsystem. Next, an abstract view of the functional model is imported in SysML. Using SysML, a model of the execution platform is created, and an implementation of the subsystems as a set of tasks and messages is defined and evaluated. The M2T Acceleo tool processes the mapping model and generates the Orocos-compliant task code executing the C/C++ functions generated from Simulink, and the inter-task communication. This paper outlines the proposed flow and provides the description of a robotic car testbench used to show the application of the methodology. The testbench has enough functional complexity and a distributed implementation to justify the creation of architecture models, while requiring a moderate cost and effort for its construction by the interested researchers.",

To this aim, we introduce the notion of exceptional property and define the concept of exceptionality score, which measures the significance of a property. In particular, in order to single out exceptional properties, we resort to a form of minimum distance estimation for evaluating the badness of fit of the values assumed by the outliers compared to the probability distribution associated with the values assumed by the inliers. Suitable exceptionality scores are introduced for both numeric and categorical attributes. These scores are, both from the analytical and the empirical point of view, designed to be effective for small samples, as it is the case for outliers. We present an algorithm, called EXPREX, for efficiently discovering exceptional properties. The algorithm is able to reduce the needed computational effort by not exploring many irrelevant numerical intervals and by exploiting suitable pruning rules. The experimental results confirm that our technique is able to provide knowledge characterizing outliers in a natural manner.",

The Social Force Model (SFM) is such a model, having parameters that control both deterministic and stochastic elements. We have constructed an efficient motion planning algorithm by embedding the SFM in a control loop that determines higher level objectives and reacts to environmental changes. Low level predictive modelling is provided by the SFM fed by sensors; high level logic is provided by statistical model checking. To parametrise and improve our motion planning algorithm, we have conducted experiments to consider typical human interactions in crowded environments. We have identified a number of behavioural patterns which may be explicitly incorporated in the SFM to enhance its predictive power. In this paper we describe the results of these experiments and how we parametrise the SFM.",

In this paper, we address the problem of how to guide the user with a minimal impact on her/his freedom of motion. We propose a solution based on the use of an active braking system which can be easily accommodated on commercial walkers.

A competitive autonomous car must acquire environmental and opponent information to compute, in real time, the minimum time collision free path and the low level control to track the chosen path. To cope with those requirements, we first solve the problem for a car running in isolation considering the optimal sequence of manoeuvres to approach bends and straight stretches of track. We then propose a discrete abstraction to derive a problem of graph optimisation that has a very efficient, albeit suboptimal, solution. In this context, an overtake manoeuvre against a slower car will be obtained excluding from the path the arcs that could potentially generate a collision. Finally, a control algorithm is used to ensure that the car always remains close to the planned path.",

            "abstract": "Coalitional games model scenarios where rational agents can form coalitions so as to obtain higher worths than by acting in isolation. Once a coalition forms and obtains its worth, the problem of how this worth can be fairly distributed has to be faced. Desirable worth distributions are usually referred to as solution concepts. Recent research pointed out that, while reasoning problems involving such solution concepts are hard in general for games specified in compact form (e.g., graph games), some of them, in particular the core, become tractable when agents come partitioned into a fixed number k of types, i.e., of classes of strategically equivalent players. The paper continues along this line of research, by firstly showing that two other relevant solution concepts, the kernel and the nucleolus, are tractable in this setting and independently of the specific game encoding, provided worth functions are given as a polynomial-time computable oracles. Then, it analyzes a different setting where games are still k-typed but the actual player partitioning is not a-priori known. Within this latter setting, the paper addresses the question about how efficiently strategic equivalence between pairs of players can be recognized, and reconsiders the computational complexity of the core, the kernel, and the nucleolus. All such problems and notions emerged to be intractable, thereby evidencing that the knowledge of player types marks the boundary of tractability for reasoning about k-typed coalitional games.",

To prove the validity of this idea we propose a concrete case study: driving a car-like vehicle at a high speed with a cost of the hardware below 500 Euros.",

The sensor consists of an inertial platform, which provides attitude and acceleration data with a high rate. Data is fused by an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) to reconstruct the attitude and the accelerations experienced by the wearable sensors. The information is then integrated to reconstruct the position of the target. The presence of noise determines a gradual degradation of the localization accuracy. For this reason, a second EKF is used to reduce the uncertainty of the position by fusing the current estimation with measurements returned by the cameras.",

In this paper, we show how security can be dealt with as one of different Qual- ity of Service dimensions and traded for control performance in an adaptive QoS management scheme. The system is able to respond to increased resource require- ments or to changes in the risk level by reconfiguring the application modes and the security modes.

            "abstract": "Indoor position tracking systems are essential to support new types of applications for domotics and elderly care services. Unfortunately, while locating moving objects (e.g., people in a room) typically requires accuracy in the order of a few tens of cm, the intrinsically crowded nature of indoor environments (e.g., due to the presence of obstacles and/or multiple targets) as well as manifold sources of uncertainty may considerably degrade measurement results. In this paper, we present a local positioning system (LPS) provided with wireless connectivity. The proposed solution relies on two cascaded extended Kalman filters. The first one estimates the attitude of the platform within a global reference frame. The second one relies on the estimated attitude to return the planar position of the moving object in a room. The proposed approach is much more scalable than centralized location tracking techniques (e.g. based on external cameras only) because it does not require collecting and processing large data sets in real-time. Also, just low-rate position corrections are needed to keep uncertainty within given boundaries. Such position calibration values, measured with any type of external positioning infrastructure, can be sent to the LPS through a low-cost radio link like in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), at no risk of saturating the communication channel even when multiple objects are present in the room.",

            "abstract": "Comparing and querying the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of different organisms is important to infer knowledge about conservation across species. Known methods that perform these tasks operate symmetrically, i.e., they do not assign a distinct role to the input PPI networks. However, in most cases, the input networks are indeed distinguishable on the basis of how the corresponding organism is biologically well characterized. In this paper a new idea is developed, that is, to exploit differences in the characterization of organisms at hand in order to devise methods for comparing their PPI networks. We use the PPI network (called Master) of the best characterized organism as a fingerprint to guide the alignment process to the second input network (called Slave), so that generated results preferably retain the structural characteristics of the Master network. Technically, this is obtained by generating from the Master a finite automaton, called alignment model, which is then fed with (a linearization of) the Slave for the purpose of extracting, via the Viterbi algorithm, matching subgraphs. We propose an approach able to perform global alignment and network querying, and we apply it on PPI networks. We tested our method showing that the results it returns are biologically relevant.",

This paper introduces the notion of strong outliers and studies the complexity problems related to outlier recognition in the fragment of acyclic normal unary theories and the related one of mixed unary theories. We show that recognizing strong outliers in acyclic normal unary theories can be done in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that this result is sharp, since switching to either general outliers, cyclic theories or acyclic mixed unary theories makes the problem intractable. This is the only fragment of default theories known so far for which the general outlier recognition problem is tractable. Based on these results, we have designed a polynomial time algorithm for enumerating all strong outliers of bounded size in an acyclic normal unary default theory. These tractability results rely on the Incremental Lemma, an interesting result on its own, that provides conditions under which a mixed unary default theory displays a monotonic reasoning behavior.",

Within this setting, a complete picture of the complexity issues arising with the core, as well as with the related stability concepts of least core and cost of stability, is depicted.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a cost function for wireless sensor networks of this kind under energy consumption constraints. We focus, in particular, on the problem of coverage optimization through scheduling. Following existing approaches, we use a mixed integer linear program formulation. We show how to use partitioning techniques to decompose the problem into separate subproblems, solved individually, overcoming the exponential complexity typical of integer linear programming, while minimizing the loss in optimality. In addition, we evaluate the achieved degree of optimality by computing relatively tight bounds with respect to the optimal solution. Finally, we employ simple but effective heuristics to further improve our solution. The results show that our procedure is very efficient and scalable, and is able to find solutions that are very close to optimal. These characteristics make our approach a perfect fit for large and fixed deployments of wireless sensors, typical in factory automation and industrial applications. To show the generality of the approach, we apply our methodology to three different models of varying complexity.",

In previous papers, we have defined outliers in default logics and investigated their formal properties. Specifically, we have looked into the computational complexity of outlier detection problems and proved that while they are generally intractable, interesting tractable cases can be singled out. Following those results, we study here the tractability frontier in outlier detection problems, by analyzing it with respect to (i) the considered outlier detection problem, (ii) the reference default logic fragment, and (iii) the adopted notion of outlier. As for point (i), we shall consider three problems of increasing complexity, called Outlier-Witness Recognition, Outlier Recognition and Outlier Existence, respectively. As for point (ii), as we look for conditions under which outlier detection can be done efficiently, attention will be limited to subsets of Disjunction-free propositional default theories. As for point (iii), we shall refer to both the notion of outlier of [ABP08] and a new and more restrictive one, called strong outlier. After complexity results, we present a polynomial time algorithm for enumerating all strong outliers of bounded size in an quasi-acyclic normal unary default theory. Some of our tractability results rely on the Incremental Lemma that provides conditions for a deafult logic fragment to have a monotonic behavior. Finally, in order to show that the simple fragments of DL we deal with are still rich enough to solve interesting problems and, therefore, the tractability results that we prove are interesting not only on the mere theoretical side, insights into the expressive capabilities of these fragments are provided, by showing that normal unary theories express all NL queries, hereby indirectly answering a question raised by Kautz and Selman.",

            "abstract": "Research in systems biology has made available large amounts of data about interactions among cell building blocks (e.g., proteins, genes). To properly look up these data and mine useful information, the design and development of automatic tools has become crucial. These tools leverage Biological Networks as a formal model to encode molecular interactions. Biological networks can be fed as input to graph-based techniques useful to infer new information about cellular activity and evolutive processes of the species. In this context, a rather interesting family of techniques is that of network querying. Network querying tools search a whole biological network to identify conserved occurrences of a given query module for transferring biological knowledge. Indeed, inasmuch as the query network generally encodes a well-characterized functional module, its occurrences in the queried network suggest that the latter (and, as such, the corresponding organism) features the function encoded by the former. The aim of this paper is that of analyzing and comparing tools devised to query biological networks. This analysis is intended to help in understanding problems and research issues, state of the art and opportunities for researchers working in this area.",

The use of a resource reservation scheduler enables the construction of a dynamic model describing the evolution of the computing delays, which can be incorporated in the system closed loop dynamics. The two approaches differ for the assumptions on the sequence of computation time. In the first approach, we have only an aggregate information (best case and worst case computation time) and design an adaptive scheduler that maintains the delay within the maximum bound compatible with the asymptotic stability of the system. In the second case, we assume a deeper knowledge on the distribution of the computation time and design an adaptive scheduler that ensures second moment stability of the system. The two approaches are evaluated on a case study exposing the different trade-offs between bandwidth and performance.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years a large amount of protein interaction data has been collected and stored in public databases. The automatic analysis and management of such data can provide valuable information on the evolution of different organisms. To this aim, interaction data can be modelled as graphs where nodes represent cellular components and edges are associated to interactions. Such graphs are called protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. A number of methods have been proposed to perform PPI-network alignment. Such methods operate symmetrically, that is to say, they do not assign a distinct role to the input PPI networks. However, in most cases, the input networks are indeed distinguishable on the basis of how well the corresponding organism is biologically well-characterized. We propose a method for global alignment of PPI networks that exploits differences in the characterization of organisms at hand. We assume that the PPI network (called Master) of the best characterized is used as a fingerprint to guide the alignment process to the second input network (called Slave), so that generated results preferably retain the structural characteristics of the Master (and using the Slave) network. We tested our method showing that the results it returns are biologically relevant.",

The applications are assumed to be periodically triggered and the different tasks communicate by unidirectional buffers. The problem we cope with is how to effectively share the resources so that some specified Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met. The QoS considered here is tightly related to the end-to-end temporal behavior of the application. To compensate for time-varying resource requirements, we advocate a distributed control approach whereby the scheduling parameters of each task are tuned depending on the temporal behavior of the application measured by appropriate sensors. The use of real-time scheduling strategies enables a mathematically safe control design in which the QoS requirements are translated into control goals, and formal proofs are provided on the ability of the controller to fulfil these goals. We also offer extensive simulations that validate the approach for multimedia applications.",

Each application can execute in different modes, each one associated with a level of Quality-of-Service (QoS). Resources, in their turn, have different modes, each one with a speed and a power consumption, and are managed by a Reservation-Based scheduler enabling a dynamic allocation of the fraction of resources (bandwidth) assigned to each application. To cope with dynamic changes of the application, we advocate an adaptive resource allocation policy organized in two nested feedback loops. The internal loop operates on the scheduling parameter to obtain a resource allocation that meets the temporal constraints of the applications. The external loop operates on the QoS level of the applications and on the power level of the resources to strike a good tradeoff between the global QoS and the energy consumption. This loop comes into play whenever the workload of the application exceeds the bounds that permit the internal loop to operate correctly, or whenever it decreases below a level that permit more aggressive choices for the QoS or substantial energy saving.",

A control law is split into a sequence of subroutine calls, each one fulfilling a control goal and refining the result produced by the previous one. We propose a design methodology to define a feedback controller structured in accordance with this paradigm and show how a switching policy of selecting the controller subroutines can be designed that provides stability guarantees for the closed-loop system. The cornerstone of this construction is a stochastic model describing the probability of executing, in each activation of the controller, the different subroutines. We show how this model can be constructed for realistic real-time task sets and provide an experimental validation of the approach.",

In this paper, we advocate the use of formal verification of parametric timed automata as a means to combine the best of the two approaches.

In the classical Transferable Utility (TU) setting, coalition worths can be freely distributed amongst agents. However, in several application scenarios, this is not the case and the Non-Transferable Utility setting (NTU) must be considered, where additional application-oriented constraints are imposed on the possible worth distributions. \n \nIn this paper, an approach to define NTU games is proposed which is based on describing allowed distributions via a set of mixed-integer linear constraints applied to an underlying TU game. It is shown that such games allow non-transferable conditions on worth distributions to be specified in a natural and succinct way. The properties and the relationships among the most prominent solution concepts for NTU games that hold when they are applied on (mixed-integer) constrained games are investigated. Finally, a thorough analysis is carried out to assess the impact of issuing constraints on the computational complexity of some of these solution concepts.",

The DTMC is used to predict the future evolution for the system, for a fixed horizon, pinpointing the states that, at each step, can be marked as dangerous. This way, the system estimates the probability of an accident and stops the robot when the result is greater than a threshold.",

In order to avoid mining a potentially huge number of (not necessarily interesting) rule, we define a preference relationship among rules and exploit a suitable graph encoding in order to single out the most interesting ones, which we call outstanding rules .

In addition, the platform provides resources with power-scaling capabilities and may be subject to power constraints. We present a QoS control architecture achieving optimum trade-offs between overall QoS and power consumption of the system, based on two nested control loops. The external one decides dynamically the optimum configuration for the system, in terms of application QoS modes and resource power modes, while the internal one modulates the resource allocations on a job by job basis, so as to respect timing constraints.

We investigate techniques that guarantee a good compromise between conflicting requirements: 1) a good coverage of the area, 2) a long lifetime, 3) a good temporal accuracy in classifying the events. Our solution is based on the combination of two complementary techniques. The first one, the wakeup scattering algorithm, iteratively identifies a periodic schedule that keeps the node awake for a limited time, so saving power. In this paper, we consider the global convergence of this algorithm. The second technique is a small overhead distributed algorithm for the synchronization of the nodes, which takes into account the communication delays.",

            "abstract": "Resource reservations are an effective technique to support hard and soft real-time applications in open systems. However, they generally focus on providing guarantees to real-time applications, without paying too much attention to the performance of non-real-time activities. In this paper, the main limitations encountered when using a conventional reservation-based scheduler for serving non-real-time tasks are described and formally analyzed. Then, a novel algorithm that overcomes these problems (called HGRUB) is proposed, and both theoretical and experimental evidence of its effectiveness is provided.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an architecture for quality of service (QoS) control of time\u2010sensitive applications in multi\u2010programmed embedded systems. In such systems, tasks must receive appropriate timeliness guarantees from the operating system independently from one another; otherwise, the QoS experienced by the users may decrease. Moreover, fluctuations in time of the workloads make a static partitioning of the central processing unit (CPU) that is neither appropriate nor convenient, whereas an adaptive allocation based on an on\u2010line monitoring of the application behaviour leads to an optimum design. By combining a resource reservation scheduler and a feedback\u2010based mechanism, we allow applications to meet their QoS requirements with the minimum possible impact on CPU occupation. We implemented the framework in AQuoSA (Adaptive Quality of Service Architecture (AQuoSA). http://aquosa.sourceforge.net), a software architecture that runs on top of the Linux kernel. We provide extensive experimental validation of our results and offer an evaluation of the introduced overhead, which is perfectly sustainable in the class of addressed applications.

            "abstract": "Mobile robots are increasingly utilised in automated plants to the purpose of moving wares and material between the different production lines and logistic areas. In this context, the presence of human operators in the facility is frequently allowed to carry out or supervise some phases of the production. The problem arises of how to make the coexistence possible with controlled risks for the operator and without affecting the productivity with frequent interruptions. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem based on a probabilistic technique. A system of visual sensor (mounted on the mobile robots) detects the presence of a human operator and a discrete abstraction (essentially a discrete-time Markov chain) is used to predict his/her motion and hence find the probability of an accidental injury. For the computation of the latter, we combine the probability of having a collision with a given speed with the probability of receiving an injury out of the collision (taken from physiological models suggested by the automotive literature).",

            "abstract": "Multimedia applications are often characterised by implicit temporal constraints but, in many cases, they are not programmed using any specialised real-time API. These \u201cLegacy applications\u201d have no way to communicate their temporal constraints to the OS kernel, and their quality of service (QoS), being necessarily linked to the temporal behaviour, fails to satisfy acceptable standards. In this paper we propose an innovative way for dealing with these applications, based on the combination of an on-line identification mechanism (which extracts from high-level observations such important parameters as the execution rate) and an adaptive scheduler (specialised for legacy applications) that identifies the correct amount of CPU needed by each application. Preliminary experimental results are reported, proving the effectiveness of the proposed idea in providing a widely used multimedia player on Linux with appropriate QoS guarantees, through an appropriate choice of the scheduling parameters. Finally, a detailed road-map is presented with the possible extensions to the approach.",

Unfortunately, most of such techniques can be used only if real-time applications use a specialized API, and if some important information (such as the worst-case execution-time) are known a priori. In this paper, we present a novel technique, the legacy feedback scheduler (LFS), for a class of legacy applications that need the support of a real-time scheduler but are not written using a specialized API and have unknown or varying execution requirements. The approach is based on the combination of a resource reservation scheduler and a feedback-based adaptation mechanism for identifying the correct scheduling parameters.",

The goal of such techniques is that of transferring biological knowledge. Indeed, the query subnetwork generally encodes a well-characterized functional module, and its occurrences in the queried network probably denote that this function is featured by the associated organism. The proposed analysis is intended to be useful to understand problems and research issues, state of the art and opportunities for researchers working in this research area.",

            "abstract": "Assume you are given a data population characterized by a certain number of attributes. Assume, moreover, you are provided with the information that one of the individuals in this data population is abnormal, but no reason whatsoever is given to you as to why this particular individual is to be considered abnormal. In several cases, you will be indeed interested in discovering such reasons. This article is precisely concerned with this problem of discovering sets of attributes that account for the (a priori stated) abnormality of an individual within a given dataset. A criterion is presented to measure the abnormality of combinations of attribute values featured by the given abnormal individual with respect to the reference population. In this respect, each subset of attributes is intended to somehow represent a \u201cproperty\u201d of individuals. We distinguish between global and local properties. Global properties are subsets of attributes explaining the given abnormality with respect to the entire data population. With local ones, instead, two subsets of attributes are singled out, where the former one justifies the abnormality within the data subpopulation selected using the values taken by the exceptional individual on those attributes included in the latter one. The problem of individuating abnormal properties with associated explanations is formally stated and analyzed. Such a formal characterization is then exploited in order to devise efficient algorithms for detecting both global and local forms of most abnormal properties. The experimental evidence, which is accounted for in the article, shows that the algorithms are both able to mine meaningful information and to accomplish the computational task by examining a negligible fraction of the search space.",

            "abstract": "A remarkable research activity has been carried out in the past few years to support real-time applications by means of appropriate scheduling solutions. For scarcely known or highly dynamic applications, feedback scheduling has emerged as an effective technique to tune the scheduling parameters, based on a run-time monitoring of the timing performance of the application. This technique requires a specialised API for the application and is therefore unfit for legacy applications, for which the source code is not accessible. In this paper, we present an alternative technique, called legacy feedback scheduling (LFS), for feedback based adaptation of the scheduling parameters. LFS does not make any assumption on the programming model of the application and is applicable to legacy applications. Throughout the paper, we carry out a comparison between a well settled technique (called adaptive reservations), which leverages a particular structure for the application, and LFS. The conclusion is that the greater generality and flexibility of the LFS has to be paid in terms of timing performance. However, LFS successfully identifies the ldquoaveragerdquo scheduling parameters needed to sustain a given execution rate.",

In this paper, we show by analytical results and by extensive simulations that the two techniques can be safely and usefully combined.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present a software architecture to support soft real-time applications, such as multimedia streaming and telecommunication systems, in open embedded systems. Examples of such systems are consumer electronic devices (as cellular phones, PDAs, etc.), as well as multimedia servers (video servers, VoIP servers, etc.) and telecommunication infrastructure devices. For such applications, it is important to keep under control the resource utilization of every task, otherwise the Quality of Service experienced by the users may be degraded. Our proposal is to combine a resource reservation scheduler (that allows us to partition the CPU time in a reliable way) and a feedback based mechanism for dynamically adjusting the CPU fraction (bandwidth) allocated to a tasks. In particular, our controller enables specified Quality of Service (QoS) levels for the application while keeping the allocated bandwidth close to its actual needs. The adaptation mechanism consists of the combination of a prediction and of a feedback correction that operates locally on each task. The consistency of the system is preserved by a supervisor component that manages overload conditions and enacts security policies. We implemented the framework in AQuOSA, a software architecture that runs on top of the Linux kernel. We provide extensive experimental validation of our results and offer evaluation of the introduced overhead, which is remarkably lower than the one introduced by other different solutions.",

            "title": "Adding Timing Analysis to Functional Design to Predict Implementation Errors",
            "abstract": "The classical V-cycle methodology for the design of embedded automotive systems is typically implemented by a sequence of steps, from a functional specification down to the implementation at the programming level with the support of an RTOS. The validation of the design is a complex task that consists of analyzing and verifying by testing both functional and non-functional requirements. An important subset of non-functional requirements consists of timing constraints. Implementation must be checked against any violation of the latency and schedulability constraints; otherwise the functionality of the entire system could be severely compromised. Unfortunately, even in state-of-the-art processes, this step is not supported by adequate methods and tools. Subsequently, the process is errorprone and subject to implementation errors, and it is very difficult to generate derivative designs. In this paper, we propose the use of real-time scheduling theory as a formal underpinning for a design process in which the timing behavior is considered from the earliest phases of the development. To support the designer in this phase, we have built the RT-Druid design environment, which extends the scope of traditional (and existing) schedulability and timing analysis tools in many directions. First, RT-Druid captures the mapping of the functional components of the system to the concurrent threads implementing them, and to the hardware/software platform, allowing one to precisely trace such design decisions as the allocation of functions to a thread, and to identify potential problems in thread scheduling, communication and synchronization. Second, RT-Druid provides schedulability analysis together with sensitivity analysis, showing how variations of the thread parameters affect the response times and the schedulability of the system. Finally, RT-Druid provides support for application modes to analyze systems with dynamic workloads. The RT-Druid design environment is integrated into the Eclipse open development framework and allows easy integration with third party tools. It supports the OSEK/VDX standard with import/export of OIL specifications and the generation of configuration code for Evidence\u2019s ERIKA Enterprise RTOS.",

We consider two different scheduling techniques, one based on an extremely simple positional controller and one based on the optimal solution of the linearized control problem based on a fluid approximation. Simulation results are presented discussing pros and cons of the two solutions both in terms of performances (resource exploitation and traffic differentiation properties) and in terms of implementation complexity and fairness.",

There are different proposals for representing coalitional games in a compact way, where the worths of coalitions may be computed in polynomial time. In all those frameworks, it was shown that core non-emptiness is a co-NP-hard problem. However, for the most general of them, it was left as an open problem whether it belongs to co-NP or it actually is an harder problem. We solve this open problem in a positive way; indeed, we are able to show that, for the case of transferable payoffs, the problem belongs to co-NP for any compact representation of the game where the worths of coalitions may be computed in polynomial time (also, non-deterministic polynomial time), encompassing all previous proposals of this kind. This is proved by showing that games with empty cores have small infeasibility certificates. The picture is completed by looking at coalitional games with non-transferable payoffs. We propose a compact representation based on marginal contribution nets. Also in this case, we are able to settle the precise complexity of core non-emptiness, which turns out to be \u03a32p-complete.",

MASEL performs the following tasks: (i) supports Chief Learning Officers in defining roles, associated competencies and required knowledge level; (ii) manages the skill map of the organization; (iii) evaluates human resources competence gaps; (iv) supports employees in filling the competence gaps related to their roles; (v) creates personalized learning paths according to feedbacks that users provide to optimize the acquisition of required competencies; (vi) assists Chief Learning Officers in selecting the most appropriate employee for a given role; (vii) assists a Project Manager in building teamwork. A prototype tool implementing MASEL using JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) was developed. The reasoning capability of MASEL agents involved in the learning paths building process and in the team building process is implemented using DLV, a disjunctive logic programming system.",

From the supplier's viewpoint, it is needed to propose products in a suitable way to customers, taking into account the typology of each customer, her/his preferences, habits, etc.In this context, generally denoted as Business-to-Customer (B2C) e-commerce, the use of software agents as mediators in e-commerce activities seems to be particularly promising.In this paper, we describe and analyze the various roles agents have assumed in B2C e-commerce applications. Furthermore, we propose a Consumer Buying Behaviour model, called E2-CBB, that considers new emergent issues, as the capability to solve semantic heterogeneity, and the adaptive presentations of Web stores. By using such a model, we classify and compare a number of agent-based approaches for managing B2C e-commerce, proposed in the literature in the last ten years.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins is a difficult task. In the last few years several approaches have been proposed for performing this task taking into account different protein chemical and physical properties. As a result, a growing number of protein structure prediction tools is becoming available, some of them specialized to work on either some aspects of the predictions or on some categories of proteins; however, they are still not sufficiently accurate and reliable for predicting all kinds of proteins. In this context, it is useful to jointly apply different prediction tools and combine their results in order to improve the quality of the predictions. However, several problems have to be solved in order to make this a viable possibility. In this paper a framework and a tool is proposed which allows: (i) definition of a common reference applicative domain for different prediction tools; (ii) characterization of prediction tools through evaluating some quality parameters; (iii) characterization of the performances of a team of predictors jointly applied over a prediction problem; (iv) the singling out of the best team for a prediction problem; and (v) the integration of predictor results in the team in order to obtain a unique prediction. A system implementing the various steps of the proposed framework (CooPPS) has been developed and several experiments for testing the effectiveness of the proposed approach have been carried out.",

Each system is affected by process noise and can be controlled by actuators with values in a fixed finite set. The control objective is to bound the evolution of the systems in specified sets (controlled invariance). Our goal is to find an optimal allocation of the shared communication resource to the different control activities and to identify correct choices for the design parameters. The paper provides fundamental conceptual tools to attack the design problem in the formal framework of an optimization problem. Namely, we give a feasibility criterion to decide whether a set of design parameters conforms with a control specification (i.e., with the controlled invariance of a specified set for each system). Moreover, we offer the explicit computation of the minimum bit rate necessary for the controlled invariance of a set, which is of utmost importance for solving the optimization problem.",

            "abstract": "The development of effective knowledge discovery techniques has become a very active research area in recent years due to the important impact it has had in several relevant application domains. One interesting task therein is that of singling out anomalous individuals from a given population, for example, to detect rare events in time-series analysis settings, or to identify objects whose behavior is deviant w.r.t. a codified standard set of rules. Such exceptional individuals are usually referred to as outliers in the literature.\n In this article, the concept of outlier is formally stated in the context of knowledge-based systems, by generalizing that originally proposed in Angiulli et al. [2003] in the context of default theories. The chosen formal framework here is that of logic programming, wherein potential applications of techniques for outlier detection are thoroughly discussed. The proposed formalization is a novel one and helps to shed light on the nature of outliers occurring in logic bases. Also the exploitation of minimality criteria in outlier detection is illustrated.\n The computational complexity of outlier detection problems arising in this novel setting is also thoroughly investigated and accounted for in the paper. Finally, rewriting algorithms are proposed that transform any outlier detection problem into an equivalent inference problem under stable model semantics, thereby making outlier computation effective and realizable on top of any stable model solver.",

The discussion addresses the issue of dynamically adjusting the bandwidth for a set of periodic tasks, when a reservation-based (RB) CPU scheduling policy is used. RB techniques are particularly suitable for this kind of applications since they allow an accurate mathematical modelling of the dynamic evolution of the QoS experienced by tasks. Based on this model, a control policy guaranteeing specified QoS levels for different tasks is illustrated, along with necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence. Moreover, the problem of steering a task QoS back into its nominal level is tackled, in response to deviations due to temporary overload conditions. Simulation results are reported, for the purpose of validating the approach.",

We suggest to exploit the framework of default logic for detecting outliers -- individuals who behave in an unexpected way or feature abnormal properties. The ability to locate outliers can help to maintain knowledge-base integrity and to single out irregular individuals. We first formally define the notion of an outlier and an outlier witness. We then show that finding outliers is quite complex. Indeed, we show that several versions of the outlier detection problem lie over the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. For example, the question of establishing if at least one outlier can be detected in a given propositional default theory is \u03a33P-complete. Although outlier detection involves heavy computation, the queries involved can frequently be executed offline, thus somewhat alleviating the difficulty of the problem. In addition, we show that outlier detection can be done in polynomial time for both the class of acyclic normal unary defaults and the class of acyclic dual normal unary defaults.",

            "abstract": "Pridicting the three dimensional structure of proteins is a difficult task. In the last years several approaches have been proposed for performing this task taking into account different protein chemical and physical properties. As a result, a growing number of protein structure prediction tools is becoming available, some of them being specialized to work on either some aspects of the predictions or on some categories of proteins. In this context, it becomes useful to jointly apply different prediction techniques and combine their results in order to improve the quality of the predictions. However, several problems have to be solved in order to make this a viable possibility. In this paper we propose a framework allowing to (i) define a common reference applicative domain for different prediction techniques, (ii) characterize predictors through evaluating some quality parameters, (iii) characterize the performances of a team of predictors jointly applied over a prediction problem and (iv) obtain a unique prediction from the team. Finally, we highlight the application of this framework to the definition of a multi-agent system performing the team selection task, the integration of multiple, possibly heterogeneous, predictions and the translation of predictors inputs and outputs into a uniform data format.",

We develop a formulation based on the generalized linear complementarity problem, which enables the application of efficient numerical solutions. Finally, we give some preliminary result on the parametric dependence of the problem's solution from the system's state.",

Web providers and applications using XML for representing and exchanging their data make their information available in such a way that interoperability can be easily reached. However in order to guarantee both the exchange of XML documents and the interoperability between information providers, it is often needed to single out semantic similarity properties relating concepts of different XML documents. This paper gives a contribution to this framework by proposing a technique for extracting synonymies and homonymies. The derivation technique is based on a rich conceptual model (called SDR-Network) which is used to represent concepts expressed in XML documents as well as the semantic relationships holding among them.",

Cooperation can be implemented in many ways, depending on how local knowledge of agents is represented and consists in general in providing to the user an integrated view of individual knowledge bases. But the main difficulty is determining which agents are promising candidates for a fruitful cooperation among the (possibly large) universe of agents operating in the net. This paper gives a contribution in this context, by proposing a system for supporting cooperation in multi-agents networks. Semantic properties are here represented by coefficients and adaptive algorithms permit the computation of a set of suggested agents for cooperation. Actual choices of the users modify internal parameters in such a way that the next suggestions are closer to users expectancy.",

After this, the user profile is exploited for determining the subset of those data sources which best conforms to user interests. In order to semantically compare the content of a data source with a user profile, a formal inference framework, provided by a specialized probabilistic variant of Description Logics, is exploited.",

This tool has already been successfully applied to several real-world applications, but only preliminary results about the complexity of metaquerying can be found in the literature. In this article, we define several variants of metaquerying that encompass, as far as we know, all the variants that have been defined in the literature. We study both the combined complexity and the data complexity of these variants. We show that under the combined complexity measure metaquerying is generally intractable (unless P = NP), lying sometimes quite high in the complexity hierarchies (as high as NPPP), depending on the characteristics of the plausibility index. Nevertheless, we are able to single out some tractable and interesting metaquerying cases, whose combined complexity is LOGCFL-complete. As for the data complexity of metaquerying, we prove that, in general, it is within TC0, but lies within AC0 in some simpler cases. Finally, we discuss the implementation of metaqueries by providing algorithms that answer them.",

Some of the approaches proposed so far in the literature guarantee temporal isolation, but they make a static assignment of resources to each task, which, once again, is based on an a priori knowledge. The authors propose a closed loop method for online adapting of the fraction of assigned resource to the task requirements. The approach is based on adaptive control techniques and has resulted in being effective in a significant set of real life experiments.",

            "abstract": "Metaquerying is a datamining technology by which hidden dependencies among several database relations can be discovered. This tool has already been successfully applied to several real-world applications. Recent papers provide only very preliminary results about the complexity of metaquerying. In this paper we define several variants of metaquerying that encompass, as far as we know, all variants defined in the literature. We study both the combined complexity and the data complexity of these variants. We show that, under the combined complexity measure, metaquerying is generally intractable (unless P=NP), but we are able to single out some tractable interesting metaquerying cases (whose combined complexity is LOGCFL-complete). As for the data complexity of metaquerying, we prove that, in general, this is in P, but lies within AC0 in some interesting cases. Finally, we discuss the issue of equivalence between metaqueries, which is useful for optimization purposes.",

            "abstract": "A typical approach for realizing digital controllers is to synthesize the control law in the continuous-time domain and then to implement it as a set of periodic threads complying with tight temporal constraints. The strict respect of all deadlines can often be obtained only by selecting low activation rates which determine a remarkable performance degradation. On the other hand, many control systems are known to tolerate a certain amount of deadline misses. We realized a software tool which allows to numerically evaluate the quality of the control resulting from the scheduling. The tool has been applied to a robotic case study. Considering a meaningful set of trajectories, we have drawn experimental evidence that the use of soft real-time constraints on the threads leads to significant improvements in the system performance. The performance improvement is more evident if scheduling approaches like resource reservation schemes, able to separate the thread importance from its activation rate, are used.",

Complex properties have a fuzzy nature and are represented and manipulated using a fuzzy variant of Description Logics.

Deriving semantics from existing data sources exploits properties of objects belonging to different input schemes (interscheme properties), such as synonymies, homonymies, type conflicts, and subscheme similarities. The paper gives a contribution in this context by proposing a collection of graph based techniques for a uniform derivation of all interscheme properties. All techniques are characterized by a common core consisting of the computation of a maximum weight matching on suitable bipartite graphs. The computation of the maximum weight matching is based on a suitable metrics which is used to measure object semantic similarities. A running example is provided to illustrate the approach.",

Due to the differences in the real-time operating systems, the source code produced using this approach cannot easily be ported to other platforms. Moreover since the concurrent structure and the real-time constraints of the application are dispersed among the parameters of the system calls, program maintenance and upgrades end up being complex and costly activities. We propose a small set of extensions for the C language arising from our experience in programming real-time applications. Constructs for expressing tasks, shared resources, communication channels, interrupt handling, and real-time constraints are provided. The primary goal of the proposed language extensions is to enhance the programs concurrent and real-time structure and increase the number of static checks on source code, while retaining most of the C language flexibility.",

In addition, the paper also deals with another crucial step in the construction of a dictionary: schema integration. The approach proposed for this step exploits inter-schema properties discovered in the previous step to achieve schema integration. This approach is also concerned with producing suitable abstractions in order to structure the description of the global dictionary into a hierarchy of concepts in order to yield a more flexible, uniform view of the attached databases. The above two steps are interleaved with other steps (mainly devoted to interfacing with database administrators and to validating the discovered properties) and have been experimented with for the construction of a global dictionary for a large number of public administration database systems.",

Actually, it is widely recognized that both kinds of rules enhance the capabilities of database systems since they provide very natural mechanisms for the management of various important activities (e.g., knowledge representation, complex data manipulation, integrity constraint enforcement, view maintenance). However, in spite of their strong relationship, little work has been done on the unification of these powerful paradigms. They present a rule-based language with an event-driven semantics that allows programmers to express both active and deductive computations. The language is based on a new notion of production rules whose effect is both a change of state and an answer to a query. By using several examples, they show that this simple language schema allows one to uniformly define different computations on data, including complex data manipulations, deductive evaluations, and active rule processing. They define the semantics of the language and then describe the architecture of a preliminary implementation of the language. Finally, they report on the application and experience of using the language.",

Selective generation is also supported, whereby preferences on the structure of generated prime implicants can be specified. Based on this approach, an algorithm for selective enumeration of prime implicants is presented and its properties discussed.

The prototype realizes the operational semantics of GPR using a unique rule-evaluation engine.

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the possibility of exploiting formal analysis tools developed in the database field for the purpose of studying the expressive power of description logics augmented with rule-based query languages. We report a preliminary analysis on the expressive power of such hybrid languages. Two specific languages coupling a terminological component with Horn rules are considered. It is shown that: (1) the former language defines all database collections expressed by skolemized universally quantified second order formulae where quantified predicates are monadic, and (2) the latter language defines all database collections expressed by skolemized universally quantified second order formulae where quantified predicates are dyadic or monadic.",

            "abstract": "In this paper the problem of extending the logic data-base language Datalog with primitives to support array definitions and manipulations is addressed. The syntax and the semantics of this language, called Datulo$, are given by showing that model theoretic properties of ordinary Datalog extend to DatalogA. DatalogA fixpoint semantics and its efficient implementation are also studied and presented. Sufficient conditions assuring program evaluation convergence when manipulating real-valued arrays are finally discussed.",

The language has a quite general data model that allows the definition of both flat and structured data. Language syntax and semantics are formally defined. An interpreter then illustrated. By using several examples, the authors show that this language allows various forms of data manipulations to be expressed as well as quite general triggering computations.<<ETX>>",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of updating knowledge encoded in the form of a logic program. Our approach is based upon the idea of executing a basic update by directly modifying the truth valuation of the (intensionally or extensionally defined) atom which is the object of an update. The modifications propagate, in a recursive fashion, to the truth valuations of atoms depending on the updated one. An update language is defined around this central idea. The language is built upon two basic update operators, respectively denoting insertion and deletion of a positive literal (atom). Several structures are defined for combining basic updates into complex ones and controlling the execution flow.",

            "abstract": "In recent years many research efforts have been devoted to the integration of technologies of logic programming and databases . In particular a number of techniques for efficient quer y answering have been developed [4, 6], where a query is a goal to be answered using a numbe r of clauses (logic program) . Nevertheless, before deciding how a query can be answere d efficiently, one has to decide whether or not it is safe, i .e ., the query can be answered within a finite amount of time, since a Horn query may have an infinite number of answers . Therefor e safety of queries is a crucial issue for query answering systems . In [5] Shmueli proved th e undecidability of safety for queries whose logic program is composed by Horn clauses (Horn query) . His proof works in two steps . In the first step Horn query satisfiability is proved to be undecidable by means of a reduction from the modified Post correspondence problem (a Hor n query is satisfiable if it has at least one answer) . In the second step, Horn query satisfiability i s reduced to the problem of deciding safety . In this paper we present a new and simpler proo f for undecidability of Horn query safety . The proof is based on a method that constructs a Horn logic program simulating a given Turing machine M. This logic program includes rule s for deciding whether M halts on an input x . In this framework it is proved that the haltin g problem for a Turing machine corresponds to deciding the safety of a particular goal on the above logic program s .",
