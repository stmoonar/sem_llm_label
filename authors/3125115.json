            "abstract": "Voice Conversion (VC) is a technique that aims to transform the non-linguistic information of a source utterance to change the perceived identity of the speaker. While there is a rich literature on VC, most proposed methods are trained and evaluated on clean speech recordings. However, many acoustic environments are noisy and reverberant, severely restricting the applicability of popular VC methods to such scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose Voicy, a new VC framework particularly tailored for noisy speech. Our method, which is inspired by the de-noising auto-encoders framework, is comprised of four encoders (speaker, content, phonetic and acoustic-ASR) and one decoder. Importantly, Voicy is capable of performing non-parallel zero-shot VC, an important requirement for any VC system that needs to work on speakers not seen during training. We have validated our approach using a noisy reverberant version of the LibriSpeech dataset. Experimental results show that Voicy outperforms other tested VC techniques in terms of naturalness and target speaker similarity in noisy reverberant environments.",

            "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is the task of inferring the semantics of spoken utterances. Traditionally, this has been achieved with a cascading combination of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules that are optimized separately, which can lead to a suboptimal overall performance. More recently, End-to-End SLU (E2E SLU) was proposed to perform SLU directly from speech through a joint optimization of the modules, addressing some of the traditional SLU shortcomings. A key challenge of this approach is how to best integrate the feature learning of the ASR and NLU sub-tasks to maximize their performance. While it is known that in general, ASR models focus on low-level features, and NLU models need higher-level contextual information, ASR models can nonetheless also leverage top-down syntactic and semantic information to improve their recognition. Based on this insight, we propose Top-Down SLU (TD-SLU), a new transformer-based E2E SLU model that uses top-down attention and an attention gate to fuse high-level NLU features with low-level ASR features, which leads to a better optimization of both tasks. We have validated our model using the public FluentSpeech set, and a large custom dataset. Results show TD-SLU is able to outperform selected baselines both in terms of ASR and NLU quality metrics, and suggest that the added syntactic and semantic high-level information can improve the model\u2019s performance.",

In this paper we describe methods used to improve the joke skill of a VVA through personalization. The first method, based on traditional NLP techniques, is robust and scalable. The others combine self-attentional network and multi-task learning to obtain better results, at the cost of added complexity. A significant challenge facing these systems is the lack of explicit user feedback needed to provide labels for the models. Instead, we explore the use of two implicit feedback-based labelling strategies. All models were evaluated on real production data. Online results show that models trained on any of the considered labels outperform a heuristic method, presenting a positive real-world impact on user satisfaction. Offline results suggest that the deep-learning approaches can improve the joke experience with respect to the other considered methods.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems aim at suggesting relevant items to users to support them in various decision-making processes, on the basis of available information on items or users. In the latter, the customer\u2019s interests and tastes can be learnt and expressed using historical browsing data, purchase histories, and even other nontraditional data sources such as social networks. Despite its proven success in the on-line retailing industry, in electronic commerce and, even tourism, recommender systems have been less popular in flight itinerary selection processes. This could be partially explained by the fact that customers\u2019 interests are only expressed as a flight search request. As a result, this problem has been historically tackled using classical Discrete Choice Modelling techniques and, more recently, through the use of data-driven approaches such as Machine and Deep Learning techniques. At Amadeus, we are interested in the use of choice models with recommender systems for the problem of airline itinerary selection. This work presents a benchmark on three family of methods to identify which is the most suitable for the problem we tackle.",

It is usual for airlines and other actors in the industry to inter-exchange and access each other's PNR, creating the challenge of using them without infringing data ownership laws. To address this difficulty, we propose a method to generate realistic synthetic PNRs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike other GAN applications, PNRs consist of categorical and numerical features with missing/NaN values, which makes the use of GANs challenging. We propose a solution based on Cramer GANs, categorical feature embedding and a Cross-Net architecture. The method was tested on a real PNR dataset, and evaluated in terms of distribution matching, memorization, and performance of predictive models for two real business problems: client segmentation and passenger nationality prediction. Results show that the generated data matches well with the real PNRs without memorizing them, and that it can be used to train models for real business applications.",

            "abstract": "Travel providers such as airlines and on-line travel agents are becoming more and more interested in understanding how passengers choose among alternative itineraries when searching for flights. This knowledge helps them better display and adapt their offer, taking into account market conditions and customer needs. Some common applications are not only filtering and sorting alternatives, but also changing certain attributes in real-time (e.g., changing the price). In this paper, we concentrate with the problem of modeling air passenger choices of flight itineraries. This problem has historically been tackled using classical Discrete Choice Modelling techniques. Traditional statistical approaches, in particular the Multinomial Logit model (MNL), is widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity and general good performance. However, MNL models present several shortcomings and assumptions that might not hold in real applications. To overcome these difficulties, we present a new choice model based on Pointer Networks. Given an input sequence, this type of deep neural architecture combines Recurrent Neural Networks with the Attention Mechanism to learn the conditional probability of an output whose values correspond to positions in an input sequence. Therefore, given a sequence of different alternatives presented to a customer, the model can learn to point to the one most likely to be chosen by the customer. The proposed method was evaluated on a real dataset that combines on-line user search logs and airline flight bookings. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional MNL model on several metrics.",

            "abstract": "In the airline industry, a Passenger Name Record (PNR) stores the travel itinerary of an individual or group of passengers travelling together. A PNR always contains all the flight information regarding each segment of a journey, and may contain additional important information such as nationality, gender and age of the passengers. From a commercial point of view, these passenger attributes are of particular interest to all actors in the travel industry (e.g., airlines and airports). However, on average, only ten percent of PNR records have this information. Therefore, their prediction is of great interest. In this study we propose a methodology to predict the nationality of passengers based on PNR data. To avoid having to solve a classification problem with 195 classes, most of which will not be well represented in the data, we take advantage of a peculiarity of this data. In most cases, the nationality of a passenger will match the value of one or more of the other PNR attributes. Therefore, we can encode the target variable by transforming the nationality country code into the index of the feature it matches (e.g., country of origin or destination of the trip). The relative encoding of the target variable allows us to simplify the original problem significantly, while obtaining better classification accuracy. Since the new classes are non-exclusive, the problem falls in the multi-label classification paradigm. The proposed methodology was tested on PNR data of passengers passing through an important European airport, which handles more than twenty million passengers per year. The model performance was evaluated using three indicators. Results show that we are able to predict the nationalities with good accuracy, and outperform both a classical multi-class methodology and a ad-hoc rule-based algorithm used in the industry.",

Some methods for the comparison of axonal trees only take into account topological information (such as TED), while others also include geometrical information (such as Path2Path).

In this paper, we extend this method by computing the mean shape of a population. Moreover, we propose to evaluate and compare these 3 approaches (TED, Path2Path and ESA) with a classification scheme based on feature computation and K-means. We evaluate these approaches on a database of 44 real 3D confocal microscopy images of two populations of neurons. Results show that the proposed method distinguishes better between the two populations.",

            "title": "Discrete stochastic model for the generation of axonal trees",
            "abstract": "In this work we propose a 2D discrete stochastic model for the simulation of axonal biogenesis. The model is defined by a third order Markov Chain. The model considers two main processes: the growth process that models the elongation and shape of the neurites and the bifurcation process that models the generation of branches. The growth process depends, among other variables, on the external attraction field generated by a chemoattractant molecule secreted by the target area. We propose an estimation scheme of the involved parameters from real fluorescent confocal microscopy images of single neurons within intact adult Drosophila fly brains. Both normal neurons and neurons in which certain genes were inactivated have been considered (two mutations). In total, 53 images (18 normal, 21 type 1 mutant and 14 type 2 mutant) were used. The model parameters allow us to describe pathological characteristics of the mutated populations.",
