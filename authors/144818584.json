            "title": "Robust Lane Change Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles: An Observation Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach",
            "abstract": "Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.",

Although a number of surveys have reviewed research achievements in this field, they are still limited in specific tasks, lack of systematic summary and research directions in the future. Here we propose a Survey of Surveys (SoS) for total technologies of AD and IVs that reviews the history, summarizes the milestones, and provides the perspectives, ethics, and future research directions. To our knowledge, this article is the first SoS with milestones in AD and IVs, which constitutes our complete research work together with two other technical surveys.

            "abstract": "Driver anomaly quantification is a fundamental capability to support human-centric driving systems of intelligent vehicles. Existing studies usually treat it as a classification task and obtain discrete levels for abnormalities. Meanwhile, the existing data-driven approaches depend on the quality of dataset and provide limited recognition capability for unknown activities. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a contrastive learning approach with the aim of building a model that can quantify driver anomalies with a continuous variable. In addition, a novel clustering supervised contrastive loss is proposed to optimize the distribution of the extracted representation vectors to improve the model performance. Compared with the typical contrastive loss, the proposed loss can better cluster normal representations while separating abnormal ones. The abnormality of driver activity can be quantified by calculating the distance to a set of representations of normal activities rather than being produced as the direct output of the model. The experiment results with datasets under different modes demonstrate that the proposed approach is more accurate and robust than existing ones in terms of recognition and quantification of unknown abnormal activities.",

            "abstract": "Trajectory tracking which is performed by multiple chassis actuators remains a significant-yet-challenging issue in automated vehicles. The high nonlinearity of chassis dynamics and multi-actuator integrated control underlying this task is intractable, and this paper aims to address this crucial issue. We propose a chassis domain method of trajectory tracking based on the game-theoretical paradigm for automated vehicles. Unlike most prevailing studies which mainly focused on lateral control for path tracking, the proposed approach develops a unified control architecture to provide optimal tracking commands to longitudinal and lateral dynamic motions. Global chassis execution with fully adjustable chassis actuators called chassis domain control in this paper has dramatic potential to handle complex mobility situations in an efficient and flexible manner. This work develops a game-theoretical chassis domain approach to track both longitudinal and lateral trajectory profiles. The approach defines all chassis actuators as a set of players with associated objectives. Then it formulates a game-theoretical optimal problem to optimize multiple objectives including longitudinal tracking, lateral tracking, and vehicle handling dynamics. Various experimental tests are carried out, and the results suggest the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed chassis domain approach.",

            "abstract": "High-performance path tracking is a key technology for autonomous vehicles. Feedforward-feedback control architectures are suitable for accurate path tracking with adequate margins of stability. For system modelling in the feedforward component, the learning-based method has been proven to be a promising approach owing to its model-free framework. However, the offline-learned data model trained with collection data is confined by its feature space, resulting in insufficient generalization. As a solution, in this study, we introduce an online learning network \u2013 the recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) \u2013 to characterize vehicle behaviors. The RHONN is used to feature vehicle behaviors in a timely manner with a high fidelity and flexible form. The equilibrium at the preview point on the desired path is found based on the online-identified RHONN model, and its induced steering angle is taken as the feedforward command. For the feedback steering controller, the preview point position-based control law incorporating the steady vehicle sideslip angle is adopted to enhance the stability performance. Finally, in the CarSim/Simulink environment, the performance of the designed RHONN-informed feedforward and feedback controller is validated in two typical scenarios \u2013 double-lane change and single-turn. The validation results reveal that the proposed approach offers better tracking accuracy in linear and nonlinear regions than other techniques. More notably, the average execution time (3.55 ms) is less than the sampling frequency of the controller (50 ms), which further confirms the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.",

In the human-like lane-change decision-making algorithm, the cost function is designed comprehensively considering driving safety and travel efficiency. Based on the cost function with multi-constraint, a dynamic game algorithm is developed to model the interactions and decision making between AV and human-driven vehicles. Additionally, to guarantee the safety during lane-change of AVs, an artificial potential field model is built for collision risk assessment. Further, a human-like driving model is designed, which integrates the brain emotional learning circuit model (BELCM) with a two-point preview model. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated through human-in-the-loop experiments, and the results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, electrified mobility (e-mobility), especially connected and autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs), has been gaining momentum along with the rapid development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things. The social benefits of CAEVs are manifested in the form of safer transportation, lower energy consumption, and reduced congestion and emissions. Nevertheless, it is highly difficult to design driving policies that ensure road safety, travel efficiency, and energy conservation for all CAEVs in traffic flows, particularly in a mixed-autonomy scenario where both CAEVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) are on the road and interact with each other. Here we present a novel deep multiagent reinforcement learning (DMARL)-enabled energy-aware cooperative driving solution, facilitating CAEVs to learn vehicular platoon management policies for guaranteeing overall traffic flow performance. Specifically, with the aid of information communication technology (ICT), CAEVs can share their vehicle state and learned knowledge, such as their state of charge (SoC), speed, and driving policies. Additionally, a cooperative multiagent actor\u2013critic (CMAAC) technique is developed to optimize vehicular platoon management policies that map perceptual information directly to the group decision-making behaviors for the CAEV platoon. The proposed approach is evaluated in highway on-ramp merging scenarios with two different mixed-autonomy traffic flows. The results demonstrate the benefits of our scheme. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential research directions for the proposed energy-aware cooperative driving solution.",

            "abstract": "The specific restrictions are breached in the case of vehicle platoon faults and result in unacceptable system performance degradation. This paper proposed a novel prescribed time performance recovery fault tolerant control method to ensure nominal platoon performance under multiple faults, including actuator faults with deferred backup actuator switching and leader-follower link faults in consideration. A novel barrier function based prescribed time sliding mode controller is devised to assure platoon consensus errors and convergence time within prescribed constraints under normal conditions at first. Under multiple faults conditions, to tackle with leader-follower link faults problem, a novel distributed recursive estimator is proposed to estimate the leader\u2019s states and recover the previous leader-follower platooning control protocol in a prescribed time. Besides, in the presence of actuator failures, the nominal constraints violated problem under faults is put into consideration. Owing to the unavoidable deferred actuator replacement time, the previous platoon consensus error constraints are violated and cause platoon performance degradation. Under such circumstances, by exploiting one novel barrier function-based sliding mode controller with an error shifting function, the unfavorable exceeding platoon consensus errors can be recovered into the nominal constraints domains within a prescribed time. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our performance recovery fault tolerant control algorithms.",
