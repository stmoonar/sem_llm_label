            "title": "Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows",
            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

            "abstract": "PalMod-II was a multi-institutional research project in Germany focusing on enabling and performing global numerical climate simulations with state-of-theart coupled Earth System Models spanning a full glacial cycle from 130 000 years in the past to the present and beyond. The main project goal was the dataset resulting from these simulations and making it available for reuse by the climate science community in-line with the FAIR data principles. In this paper, we present the research data management (RDM) approach developed and employed in PalMod-II to progress towards that project goal. The RDM approach was implemented by RDM professionals specifically funded by PalMod-II, which made it possible to provide RDM services tailored specifically to the project needs. The compilation and maintenance of a project-wide data management plan (DMP) has proven essential for keeping the project on track and serving as a central focal point of any data-related aspects. These include the specification of data responsible scientists, allocation of storage and computaional resources on a high-performance computing system, documentation of simulation output requirements, definition of data standardisation",

            "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we present the derivation of Canonical Workflow Modules from current workflows in simulation-based climate science in support of the elaboration of a corresponding framework for simulation-based research. We first identified the different users and user groups in simulation-based climate science based on their reasons for using the resources provided at the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ). What is special about this is that the DKRZ provides the climate science community with resources like high performance computing (HPC), data storage and specialised services, and hosts the World Data Center for Climate (WDCC). Therefore, users can perform their entire research workflows up to the publication of the data on the same infrastructure. Our analysis shows, that the resources are used by two primary user types: those who require the HPC-system to perform resource intensive simulations to subsequently analyse them and those who reuse, build-on and analyse existing data. We then further subdivided these top-level user categories based on their specific goals and analysed their typical, idealised workflows applied to achieve the respective project goals. We find that due to the subdivision and further granulation of the user groups, the workflows show apparent differences. Nevertheless, similar \u201cCanonical Workflow Modules\u201d can be clearly made out. These modules are \u201cData and Software (Re)use\u201d, \u201cCompute\u201d, \u201cData and Software Storing\u201d, \u201cData and Software Publication\u201d, \u201cGenerating Knowledge\u201d and in their entirety form the basis for a Canonical Workflow Framework for Research (CWFR). It is desirable that parts of the workflows in a CWFR act as FDOs, but we view this aspect critically. Also, we reflect on the question whether the derivation of Canonical Workflow modules from the analysis of current user behaviour still holds for future systems and work processes.",
