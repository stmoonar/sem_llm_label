            "title": "Modeling with Node Popularities for Autonomous Overlapping Community Detection",
            "abstract": "Overlapping community detection has triggered recent research in network analysis. One of the promising techniques for finding overlapping communities is the popular stochastic models, which, unfortunately, have some common drawbacks. They do not support an important observation that highly connected nodes are more likely to reside in the overlapping regions of communities in the network. These methods are in essence not truly unsupervised, since they require a threshold on probabilistic memberships to derive overlapping structures and need the number of communities to be specified a priori. We develop a new method to address these issues for overlapping community detection. We first present a stochastic model to accommodate the relative importance and the expected degree of every node in each community. We then infer every overlapping community by ranking the nodes according to their importance. Second, we determine the number of communities under the Bayesian framework. We evaluate our method and compare it with five state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. We also apply this new method to two applications, showing its superb performance on practical problems.",

            "title": "NF-VGA: Incorporating Normalizing Flows into Graph Variational Autoencoder for Embedding Attribute Networks",
            "abstract": "Network embedding (NE), aiming to embed a network into a low dimensional latent representation while preserving the inherent structural properties of the network, has attracted considerable attention recently. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been widely studied for NE. Existing VAE based methods let the network follow a unimodal distribution, that is, they typically use some fixed distribution as the prior, e.g. Gaussian distribution. However, in reality networks often contain many complicated structural properties [5], [6] (such as the first/second order proximity, the motif or community structures, power-law, etc). The latent representation from unimodal and fixed distribution is not capable of describing such multi-modal characteristic of networks. To address this issue, we develop a new VAE method for NE, named Normalizing Flow Variational Graph Autoencoder (NF-VGA). We design a prior-generative module based on normalizing flows to generate flexible, multi-modal distribution as the prior of the latent representation. To make the generated prior better describe the coupling relationship between nodes, we further utilize network local structures to guide the prior generation. Extensive experiments on some real-world networks show a superior performance of the new approach over some state-of-the-art methods on some popular network embedding tasks.",

            "abstract": "Network embedding (NE) maps a network into a low-dimensional space while preserving intrinsic features of the network. Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) has been actively studied for NE. These VAE-based methods typically utilize both network topologies and node semantics and treat these two types of data in the same way. However, the information of network topology and information of node semantics are orthogonal and are often from different sources; the former quantifies coupling relationships among nodes, whereas the latter represents node specific properties. Ignoring this difference affects NE. To address this issue, we develop a network-specific VAE for NE, named as NetVAE. In the encoding phase of our new approach, compression of network structures and compression of node attributes share the same encoder in order to perform co-training to achieve transfer learning and information integration. In the decoding phase, a dual decoder is introduced to reconstruct network topologies and node attributes separately. Specifically, as a part of the dual decoder, we develop a novel method based on a Gaussian mixture model and the block model to reconstruct network structures. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks demonstrate a superior performance of the new approach over the state-of-the-art methods.",
