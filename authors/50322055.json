            "abstract": "Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and some extensions based on it are popularly used to balance imbalanced data. In this study, we concentrate on solving overfitting of the classification model caused by choosing instances to oversample that increase the occurrence of overlaps with the majority class. Our method called Clustering-based Improved Adaptive Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (CI-ASMOTE1) decomposes minority instances into sub-clusters according to their connectivity in the feature space and then selects minority sub-clusters which are relatively close to the decision boundary as the candidate regions to oversample. After application of CI-ASMOTE1, new minority instances are only synthesized within each connected region of the selected sub-clusters. Considering the diversity of the synthetic instances in each selected sub-cluster, CI-ASMOTE2 is put forward to extend CI-ASMOTE1 by keeping all features of those instances in the feature space as different as possible. The experimental evaluation shows that CI-ASMOTE1 and CI-ASMOTE2 improve SMOTE and its extensions, especially in the occurrence of overlaps between the minority instances and the majority instances.",

            "abstract": "Many ancient wall paintings are confronted with the threat of irreversible damages and in urgent requirement of restoration. This work provides the superpixel segmentation method and pigment identification method for the visible spectral image of ancient wall paintings to guide the scientific restoration of the paintings. The superpixel segmentation method for the visible spectral image is an extension of SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) for the RGB image by redefining the feature of the visible spectral image. It can extract the outline of wall paintings and limit the pigment filling area in restoration of wall paintings. 44 kinds of commonly used pigments with size variations are selected to construct a visible spectral reference database for pigment identification. The pigment used in each superpixel is identified by searching the database in a specifically constructed feature space to find the nearest reference sample. This can provide guidance to pigment selection in restoration of wall paintings. At last, the methods are validated using the visible spectral image captured from Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang by using a multispectral imaging system.",

The presented dataset exhibited a particularly wide colour gamut and was partitioned into 12 subsets according to dominant wavelength and excitation purity. In each subset, the non-linearity between colorimetric values under source and target illuminant\u2013observer combinations was simulated by a backpropagation neural network. The colorimetric transform accuracy of this approach was compared with several existing methods. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the transform precision for colorimetric values, especially for the colours located in highly saturated regions.",

            "abstract": "The study presented here optimizes several steps in the spectral printer modeling workflow based on a cellular Yule-Nielsen spectral Neugebauer (CYNSN) model. First, a printer subdividing method was developed that reduces the number of sub-models while maintaining the maximum device gamut. Second, the forward spectral prediction accuracy of the CYNSN model for each subspace of the printer was improved using back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) estimated n values. Third, a sequential gamut judging method, which clearly reduced the complexity of the optimal sub-model and cell searching process during printer backward modeling, was proposed. After that, we further modified the use of the modeling color metric and comprehensively improved the spectral and perceptual accuracy of the spectral printer model. The experimental results show that the proposed optimization approaches provide obvious improvements in aspects of the modeling accuracy or efficiency for each of the corresponding steps, and an overall improvement of the optimized spectral printer modeling workflow was also demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "Digital halftoning algorithm is a operation, converting the captured con-tone images to the corresponding binary images supported by most output devices, which makes the tow kinds of images similar as possible. In order to evaluate the halftoning algorithms and the corresponding halftones, a criterion must be needed. In the literature, MSE (the Mean Square Error), SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) and WSNR(Weight Signal to Noise Ratio) were often used to evaluate the common con-tone images and the halftones. But these methods do not suit to evaluating the quality of the halftones because of the special properties of the halftones by different halftoning algorithms and limitation of assumption of these methods themselves according to many researches. So a series of halftonig algorithm-based methods are proposed, which adapt to the special properties of halftoning algorithms. All of those methods were not adaptive. In the last part of this paper, an adaptive method was propose to evaluate the halftoning algorithms and the corresponding halftones, which is based on the statistical features of the residual image between the original image and the corresponding halftone on the retinal of human eye.",
