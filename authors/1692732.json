            "title": "PyFroid: Scaling Data Analysis on a Commodity Workstation",
            "abstract": "Almost every organization today is promoting data-driven decision making leveraging advances in data science. According to various surveys, data scientists spend up to 80% of their time cleaning and transforming data. Although data management systems have been carefully optimized for such tasks over several decades, they are seldom leveraged by data scientists who prefer to use libraries such as Pandas, sacrificing performance and scalability in favor of familiarity and ease of use. As a result, data scientists are not able to fully leverage the hardware capabilities of commodity workstations and either end up working on a small sample of their data locally or migrate to more heavyweight frameworks in a cluster environment. In this paper, we present PyFroid, a framework that leverages lightweight relational databases to improve the performance and scalability of Pandas, allowing data scientists to operate on much larger datasets on a commodity workstation. PyFroid has zero learning curve as it maintains all the Pandas APIs and is fully compatible with the tools that data scientists use (e.g., Python notebooks). We experimentally demonstrate that, compared to Pandas, PyFroid is able to analyze up to 20X more data on the same machine, provide comparable or better performance for small datasets as well as near-memory data sizes, and consume much less resources.",

            "title": "XTable in Action: Seamless Interoperability in Data Lakes",
            "abstract": "Contemporary approaches to data management are increasingly relying on unified analytics and AI platforms to foster collaboration, interoperability, seamless access to reliable data, and high performance. Data Lakes featuring open standard table formats such as Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg are central components of these data architectures. Choosing the right format for managing a table is crucial for achieving the objectives mentioned above. The challenge lies in selecting the best format, a task that is onerous and can yield temporary results, as the ideal choice may shift over time with data growth, evolving workloads, and the competitive development of table formats and processing engines. Moreover, restricting data access to a single format can hinder data sharing resulting in diminished business value over the long term. The ability to seamlessly interoperate between formats and with negligible overhead can effectively address these challenges. Our solution in this direction is an innovative omni-directional translator, XTable, that facilitates writing data in one format and reading it in any format, thus achieving the desired format interoperability. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of XTable through application scenarios inspired by real-world use cases.",

Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Data processing engines increasingly leverage distributed file systems for scalable, cost-effective storage. While the Apache Parquet columnar format has become a popular choice for data storage and retrieval, the immutability of Parquet files renders it impractical to meet the demands of frequent updates in contemporary analytical workloads. Log-Structured Tables (LSTs), such as Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi, offer an alternative for scenarios requiring data mutability, providing a balance between efficient updates and the benefits of columnar storage. They provide features like transactions, time-travel, and schema evolution, enhancing usability and enabling access from multiple engines. Moreover, engines like Apache Spark and Trino can be configured to leverage the optimizations and controls offered by LSTs to meet specific business needs. Conventional benchmarks and tools are inadequate for evaluating the transformative changes in the storage layer resulting from these advancements, as they do not allow us to measure the impact of design and optimization choices in this new setting. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmarking approach and metrics that build upon existing benchmarks, aiming to systematically assess LSTs. We develop a framework, LST-Bench, which facilitates effective exploration and evaluation of the collaborative functioning of LSTs and data processing engines through tailored benchmark packages. A package is a mix of use patterns reflecting a target workload; LST-Bench makes it easy to define a wide range of use patterns and combine them into a package, and we include a baseline package for completeness. Our assessment demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework and benchmark packages in extracting valuable insights across diverse environments. The code for LST-Bench is open source and is available at https://github.com/microsoft/lst-bench/.",

            "abstract": "The advent of Foundation Models is transforming machine learning across many modalities (e.g., language, images, videos) with prompt engineering replacing training in many settings. Recent work on tabular data (e.g., TabPFN) hints at a similar opportunity to build Foundation Models for classification for numerical data. In this paper, we go one step further and propose a hypernetwork architecture that we call MotherNet, trained on millions of classification tasks, that, once prompted with a never-seen-before training set generates the weights of a trained ``child'' neural-network. Like other Foundation Models, MotherNet replaces training on specific datasets with in-context learning through a single forward pass. In contrast to existing hypernetworks that were either task-specific or trained for relatively constraint multi-task settings, MotherNet is trained to generate networks to perform multiclass classification on arbitrary tabular datasets without any dataset specific gradient descent. The child network generated by MotherNet using in-context learning outperforms neural networks trained using gradient descent on small datasets, and is competitive with predictions by TabPFN and standard ML methods like Gradient Boosting. Unlike a direct application of transformer models like TabPFN, MotherNet generated networks are highly efficient at inference time. This methodology opens up a new approach to building predictive models on tabular data that is both efficient and robust, without any dataset-specific training.",

            "abstract": "Modern cloud has turned data services into easily accessible commodities. With just a few clicks, users are now able to access a catalog of data processing systems for a wide range of tasks. How- ever, the cloud brings in both complexity and opportunity. While cloud users can quickly start an application by using various data services, it can be difficult to configure and optimize these services to gain the most value from them. For cloud providers, managing every aspect of an ever-increasing set of data services, while meeting customer SLAs and minimizing operational cost is becoming more challenging. Cloud technology enables the collection of significant amounts of workload traces and system telemetry. With the progress in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML), it is feasible and desirable to utilize a data-driven, ML-based approach to automate various aspects of data services, resulting in the creation of autonomous data services. This paper presents our perspectives and insights on creating autonomous data services on Azure. It also covers the future endeavors we plan to undertake and unresolved issues that still need attention.",

            "abstract": "Database engines have historically absorbed many of the innovations in data processing, adding features to process graph data, XML, object oriented, and text among many others. In this paper, we make the case that it is time to do the same for AI -- but with a twist! While existing approaches have tried to achieve this by integrating databases with external ML tools, in this paper we claim that achieving a truly AI-centric database requires moving the DBMS engine, at its core, from a relational to a tensor abstraction. This allows us to: (1) support multi-modal data processing such as images, videos, audio, text as well as relational; (2) leverage the wellspring of innovation in HW and runtimes for tensor computation; and (3) exploit automatic differentiation to enable a novel class of\"trainable\"queries that can learn to perform a task. To support the above scenarios, we introduce TDP: a system that builds upon our prior work mapping relational queries to tensors. Thanks to a tighter integration with the tensor runtime, TDP is able to provide a broader coverage of new emerging scenarios requiring access to multi-modal data and automatic differentiation.",

            "abstract": "The huge demand for computation in artificial intelligence (AI) is driving unparalleled investments in hardware and software systems for AI. This leads to an explosion in the number of specialized hardware devices, which are now offered by major cloud vendors. By hiding the low-level complexity through a tensor-based interface, tensor computation runtimes (TCRs) such as PyTorch allow data scientists to efficiently exploit the exciting capabilities offered by the new hardware. In this paper, we explore how database management systems can ride the wave of innovation happening in the AI space.\n We design, build, and evaluate Tensor Query Processor (TQP): TQP transforms SQL queries into tensor programs and executes them on TCRs. TQP is able to run the full TPC-H benchmark by implementing novel algorithms for relational operators on the tensor routines. At the same time, TQP can support various hardware while only requiring a fraction of the usual development effort. Experiments show that TQP can improve query execution time by up to 10X over specialized CPU- and GPU-only systems. Finally, TQP can accelerate queries mixing ML predictions and SQL end-to-end, and deliver up to 9X speedup over CPU baselines.",

            "abstract": "Provenance encodes information that connects datasets, their generation workflows, and associated metadata (e.g., who or when executed a query). As such, it is instrumental for a wide range of critical applications, including governance, observability, and auditing. Unfortunately, in the context of database systems, extracting meaningful coarse-grained provenance is a long-standing problem due to the complexity and sheer volume of database workflows. Provenance extraction from query event logs has been recently proposed as favorable because, in principle, can result in meaningful provenance graphs for provenance applications. Current approaches, however, (a) add substantial overhead to the database and provenance extraction workflows and (b) extract provenance that is noisy, omits query execution dependencies, and is not rich enough to support upstream applications. To address these problems, we introduce O NE P ROVENANCE : an engine for efficient extraction of meaningful coarse-grained provenance from query event logs. O NE P ROVE - NANCE addresses the unique challenges of log-based extraction by (a) identifying query execution dependencies through efficient log analysis, (b) extracting provenance through novel event transformations that account for query dependencies, and (c) introducing effective filtering and compression optimizations. Our thorough experimental analysis shows that O NE P ROVENANCE can improve",

            "abstract": "\n Tuning a database system to achieve optimal performance on a given workload is a long-standing problem in the database community. A number of recent works have leveraged ML-based approaches to guide the sampling of large parameter spaces (hundreds of tuning knobs) in search for high performance configurations. Looking at Microsoft production services operating millions of databases,\n sample efficiency emerged as a crucial requirement\n to use tuners on diverse workloads.\n \n This motivates our investigation in LlamaTune, a tuner design that leverages domain knowledge to improve the sample efficiency of existing optimizers. LlamaTune employs an automated dimensionality reduction technique based on randomized projections, a biased-sampling approach to handle special values for certain knobs, and knob values bucketization, to reduce the size of the search space. LlamaTune compares favorably with the state-of-the-art optimizers across a diverse set of workloads. It identifies the best performing configurations with up to 11X fewer workload runs, and reaching up to 21% higher throughput. We also show that benefits from LlamaTune generalize across both BO-based and RL-based optimizers, as well as different DBMS versions.\n While the journey to perform database tuning at cloud-scale remains long, LlamaTune goes a long way in making automatic DBMS tuning practical at scale.",
