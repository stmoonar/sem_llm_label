            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Privacy and security challenges due to the outsourcing of data storage and processing to third-party cloud providers are well known. With regard to data privacy, Oblivious RAM (ORAM) schemes provide strong privacy guarantees by not only hiding the contents of the data (by encryption) but also obfuscating the access patterns of the outsourced data. But most existing ORAM datastores are not fault tolerant in that if the external storage server (which stores encrypted data) or the trusted proxy (which stores the encryption key and other metadata) crashes, an application loses all of its data. To achieve fault-tolerance, we propose QuORAM , the \ufb01rst ORAM datastore to replicate data using a quorum-based replication protocol. QuORAM\u2019s contributions are three-fold: (i) it obfuscates access patterns to provide obliviousness guarantees, (ii) it replicates data using a novel lock-free and decentralized replication protocol to achieve fault-tolerance, and (iii) it guarantees linearizable semantics. Experimentally evaluating QuORAM highlights counter-intuitive results: QuO-RAM performs 46% better in terms of peak throughput than its non-replicated baseline; QuORAM performs 7.6x better than an ORAM datastore that relies on CockroachDB, an open-source geo-replicated database, for fault tolerance; and the cost of obliviousness is negligible in QuORAM when compared to an insecure fault-tolerant replicated system.",

            "abstract": "Distributed caches are widely deployed to serve social networks and web applications at billion-user scales. This paper presents Cache-on-Track (CoT), a decentralized, elastic, and predictive caching framework for cloud environments. CoT proposes a new cache replacement policy specifically tailored for small front-end caches that serve skewed workloads with small update percentage. Small front-end caches are mainly used to mitigate the load-imbalance across servers in the distributed caching layer. Front-end servers use a heavy hitter tracking algorithm to continuously track the top-k hot keys. CoT dynamically caches the top-C hot keys out of the tracked keys. CoT\u2019s main advantage over other replacement policies is its ability to dynamically adapt its tracker and cache sizes in response to workload distribution changes. Our experiments show that CoT\u2019s replacement policy consistently outperforms the hit-rates of LRU, LFU, and ARC for the same cache size on different skewed workloads. Also, CoT slightly outperforms the hit-rate of LRU-2 when both policies are configured with the same tracking (history) size. CoT achieves server size load-balance with 50% to 93.75% less front-end cache in comparison to other replacement policies. Finally, experiments show that CoT\u2019s resizing algorithm successfully auto-configures the tracker and cache sizes to achieve back-end load-balance in the presence of workload distribution changes.",

            "title": "Multifaceted Privacy: Express Your Online Persona without Revealing Your Sensitive Attribute",
            "abstract": "Recent works in social network stream analysis have shown that a user's online persona attributes (e.g., location, gender, ethnicity, political interest, etc.) can be accurately inferred from the topics the user writes about or engages with. Revealing a user's sensitive attributes could represent a privacy threat to some individuals. Microtargeting (e.g., the Cambridge Analytica scandal), surveillance, and discriminating ads are examples of threats to user privacy caused by sensitive attribute inference. In this paper, we propose Multifaceted privacy, a novel privacy model that aims to obfuscate a user's sensitive attributes while publicly preserving the user's public persona. To achieve multifaceted privacy, we build Aegis, a prototype client-centric social network stream processing system that helps preserve multifaceted privacy, and thus allowing social network users to freely express their online personas without revealing their sensitive attributes of choice. Aegis continuously suggests topics and hashtags to social network users to write about in order to obfuscate their sensitive attributes and hence confuse content-based sensitive attribute inferences. Our experiments show that adding as few as 0 to 4 obfuscation posts (depending on how revealing the original post is) successfully hides a user sensitive attributes without changing the user's public persona attributes.",

            "title": "Multifaceted Privacy: How to Express Your Online Persona without Revealing Your Sensitive Attributes",
            "abstract": "Recent works in social network stream analysis show that a user's online persona attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, political interest, location, etc.) can be accurately inferred from the topics the user writes about or engages with. Attribute and preference inferences have been widely used to serve personalized recommendations, directed ads, and to enhance the user experience in social networks. However, revealing a user's sensitive attributes could represent a privacy threat to some individuals. Microtargeting (e.g.,Cambridge Analytica scandal), surveillance, and discriminating ads are examples of threats to user privacy caused by sensitive attribute inference. In this paper, we propose Multifaceted privacy, a novel privacy model that aims to obfuscate a user's sensitive attributes while publicly preserving the user's public persona. To achieve multifaceted privacy, we build Aegis, a prototype client-centric social network stream processing system that helps preserve multifaceted privacy, and thus allowing social network users to freely express their online personas without revealing their sensitive attributes of choice. Aegis allows social network users to control which persona attributes should be publicly revealed and which ones should be kept private. For this, Aegis continuously suggests topics and hashtags to social network users to post in order to obfuscate their sensitive attributes and hence confuse content-based sensitive attribute inferences. The suggested topics are carefully chosen to preserve the user's publicly revealed persona attributes while hiding their private sensitive persona attributes. Our experiments show that adding as few as 0 to 4 obfuscation posts (depending on how revealing the original post is) successfully hides the user specified sensitive attributes without changing the user's public persona attributes.",

            "title": "Atomic commitment across blockchains",
            "abstract": "The recent adoption of blockchain technologies and open permissionless networks suggest the importance of peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain transaction protocols. Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets without depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to ensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock could lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest participant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash failure, denial of service attacks or even network delays might end up losing assets. Although a crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current proposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous environments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this paper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic cross-chain commitment protocol. The redeem and refund events of the smart contracts that exchange assets are modeled as conflicting events. An open permissionless network of witnesses is used to guarantee that conflicting events could never simultaneously occur and either all smart contracts in an atomic cross-chain transaction are redeemed or all of them are refunded.",

The main underlying data structure is blockchain, a scalable fully replicated structure that is shared among all participants and guarantees a consistent view of all user transactions by all participants in the system. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic protocols used in blockchain, and elaborate on its main advantages and limitations. To overcome these limitations, we provide the necessary distributed systems background in managing large scale fully replicated ledgers, using Byzantine Agreement protocols to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we expound on some of the most recent proposals to design scalable and efficient blockchains in both permissionless and permissioned settings. The focus of the tutorial is on the distributed systems and database aspects of the recent innovations in blockchains.",

            "title": "Towards Global Asset Management in Blockchain Systems",
            "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) have shown a wide success in implementing global scale peer-to-peer cryptocurrency systems. In such blockchains, new currency units are generated through the mining process and are used in addition to transaction fees to incentivize miners to maintain the blockchain. Although it is clear how currency units are generated and transacted on, it is unclear how to use the infrastructure of permissionless blockchains to manage other assets than the blockchain's currency units (e.g., cars, houses, etc). In this paper, we propose a global asset management system by unifying permissioned and permissionless blockchains. A governmental permissioned blockchain authenticates the registration of end-user assets through smart contract deployments on a permissionless blockchain. Afterwards, end-users can transact on their assets through smart contract function calls (e.g., sell a car, rent a room in a house, etc). In return, end-users get paid in currency units of the same blockchain or other blockchains through atomic cross-chain transactions and governmental offices receive taxes on these transactions in cryptocurrency units.",
