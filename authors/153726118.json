            "abstract": "A computational workflow, also known as workflow, consists of tasks that are executed in a certain order to attain a specific computational campaign. Computational workflows are commonly employed in science domains, such as physics, chemistry, genomics, to complete large-scale experiments in distributed and heterogeneous computing environments. However, running computations at such a large scale makes the workflow applications prone to failures and performance degradation, which can slowdown, stall, and ultimately lead to workflow failure. Learning how these workflows behave under normal and anomalous conditions can help us identify the causes of degraded performance and subsequently trigger appropriate actions to resolve them. However, learning in such circumstances is a challenging task because of the large volume of high-quality historical data needed to train accurate and reliable models. Generating such datasets not only takes a lot of time and effort but it also requires a lot of resources to be devoted to data generation for training purposes. Active learning is a promising approach to this problem. It is an approach where the data is generated as required by the machine learning model and thus it can potentially reduce the training data needed to derive accurate models. In this work, we present an active learning approach that is supported by an experimental framework, Poseidon-X, that utilizes a modern workflow management system and two cloud testbeds. We evaluate our approach using three computational workflows. For one workflow we run an end-to-end live active learning experiment, for the other two we evaluate our active learning algorithms using pre-captured data traces provided by the Flow-Bench benchmark. Our findings indicate that active learning not only saves resources, but it also improves the accuracy of the detection of anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in computational workflows is critical for ensuring system reliability and security. However, traditional rule-based methods struggle to detect novel anomalies. This paper leverages large language models (LLMs) for workflow anomaly detection by exploiting their ability to learn complex data patterns. Two approaches are investigated: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on labeled data for sentence classification to identify anomalies, and 2) in-context learning (ICL) where prompts containing task descriptions and examples guide LLMs in few-shot anomaly detection without fine-tuning. The paper evaluates the performance, efficiency, generalization of SFT models, and explores zero-shot and few-shot ICL prompts and interpretability enhancement via chain-of-thought prompting. Experiments across multiple workflow datasets demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs for effective anomaly detection in complex executions.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection is the task of identifying abnormal behavior of a system. Anomaly detection in computational workflows is of special interest because of its wide implications in various domains such as cybersecurity, finance, and social networks. However, anomaly detection in computational workflows~(often modeled as graphs) is a relatively unexplored problem and poses distinct challenges. For instance, when anomaly detection is performed on graph data, the complex interdependency of nodes and edges, the heterogeneity of node attributes, and edge types must be accounted for. Although the use of graph neural networks can help capture complex inter-dependencies, the scarcity of labeled anomalous examples from workflow executions is still a significant challenge. To address this problem, we introduce an autoencoder-driven self-supervised learning~(SSL) approach that learns a summary statistic from unlabeled workflow data and estimates the normal behavior of the computational workflow in the latent space. In this approach, we combine generative and contrastive learning objectives to detect outliers in the summary statistics. We demonstrate that by estimating the distribution of normal behavior in the latent space, we can outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on our benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "A computational workflow, also known as workflow, consists of tasks that must be executed in a specific order to attain a specific goal. Often, in fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, and data science, among others, these workflows are complex and are executed in large-scale, distributed, and heterogeneous computing environments prone to failures and performance degradation. Therefore, anomaly detection for workflows is an important paradigm that aims to identify unexpected behavior or errors in workflow execution. This crucial task to improve the reliability of workflow executions can be further assisted by machine learning-based techniques. However, such application is limited, in large part, due to the lack of open datasets and benchmarking. To address this gap, we make the following contributions in this paper: (1) we systematically inject anomalies and collect raw execution logs from workflows executing on distributed infrastructures; (2) we summarize the statistics of new datasets, and provide insightful analyses; (3) we convert workflows into tabular, graph and text data, and benchmark with supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection techniques correspondingly. The presented dataset and benchmarks allow examining the effectiveness and efficiency of scientific computational workflows and identifying potential research opportunities for improvement and generalization.

            "abstract": "Continual learning~(CL) is a field concerned with learning a series of inter-related task with the tasks typically defined in the sense of either regression or classification. In recent years, CL has been studied extensively when these tasks are defined using Euclidean data-- data, such as images, that can be described by a set of vectors in an n-dimensional real space. However, the literature is quite sparse, when the data corresponding to a CL task is nonEuclidean-- data , such as graphs, point clouds or manifold, where the notion of similarity in the sense of Euclidean metric does not hold. For instance, a graph is described by a tuple of vertices and edges and similarities between two graphs is not well defined through a Euclidean metric. Due to this fundamental nature of the data, developing CL for nonEuclidean data presents several theoretical and methodological challenges. In particular, CL for graphs requires explicit modelling of nonstationary behavior of vertices and edges and their effects on the learning problem. Therefore, in this work, we develop a adaptive dynamic programming viewpoint for CL with graphs. In this work, we formulate a two-player sequential game between the act of learning new tasks~(generalization) and remembering previously learned tasks~(forgetting). We prove mathematically the existence of a solution to the game and demonstrate convergence to the solution of the game. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a number of graph benchmarks with a comprehensive ablation study while establishing state-of-the-art performance.",

On the other hand, when using na\u00efve uniform random sampling to generate designs cheaply, design points tend to concentrate in a small region of the design space. Although, it is preferable in many cases to utilize quasi-random techniques such as Sobol sequences and Latin hypercube designs over uniform random sampling, these methods have their own caveats especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose a technique that addresses the fundamental issue of measure concentration by updating high-dimensional distribution functions to produce better space-filling designs. Then, we show that our technique can outperform Latin hypercube sampling and Sobol sequences by the discrepancy metric while generating moderately-sized space-filling samples for high-dimensional problems.",

We investigate workflow-specific GNN models that are trained on a particular workflow and workflow-agnostic GNN models that are trained across the workflows. Our GNN models, which incorporate both individual job features and topological information from the workflow, show improved accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional learning methods for detecting anomalies. While joint trained with multiple scientific workflows, our GNN models reached an accuracy more than 80% for workflow level and 75% for job level anomalies. In addition, we illustrate the importance of hyperparameter tuning method in our study that can significantly improve the metric(s) measure of evaluating the GNN models. Finally, we integrate explainable GNN methods to provide insights on job features in the workflow that cause an anomaly.",

            "abstract": "Classical problems in computational physics such as data-driven forecasting and signal reconstruction from sparse sensors have recently seen an explosion in deep neural network (DNN) based algorithmic approaches. However, most DNN models do not provide uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for establishing the trustworthiness of these techniques in downstream decision making tasks and scenarios. In recent years, ensemble-based methods have achieved significant success for the uncertainty quantification in DNNs on a number of benchmark problems. However, their performance on real-world applications remains under-explored. In this work, we present an automated approach to DNN discovery and demonstrate how this may also be utilized for ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we propose the use of a scalable neural and hyperparameter architecture search for discovering an ensemble of DNN models for complex dynamical systems. We highlight how the proposed method not only discovers high-performing neural network ensembles for our tasks, but also quantifies uncertainty seamlessly. This is achieved by using genetic algorithms and Bayesian optimization for sampling the search space of neural network architectures and hyperparameters. Subsequently, a model selection approach is used to identify candidate models for an ensemble set construction. Afterwards, a variance decomposition approach is used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions from the ensemble. We demonstrate the feasibility of this framework for two tasks - forecasting from historical data and flow reconstruction from sparse sensors for the sea-surface temperature. We demonstrate superior performance from the ensemble in contrast with individual high-performing models and other benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "X-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) is widely used for materials characterization. However, obtaining X-ray diffraction data is difficult and computationally intensive. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to identify crystalline line defects in samples from the raw coherent diffraction data. To automate this process, we compose a workflow coupling coherent diffraction data generation with training and inference of deep neural network defect classifiers. In particular, we adopt a continual learning approach, where we generate training and inference data as needed based on the accuracy of the defect classifier instead of all training data generated a priori. The results show that our approach improves the accuracy of defect classifiers while using much fewer samples of data.",

            "title": "Workflow Anomaly Detection with Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Reliable execution of scientific workflows is a fundamental concern in computational campaigns. Therefore, detecting and diagnosing anomalies are both important and challenging for workflow executions that span complex, distributed computing infrastructures. In this paper we model the scientific workflow as a directed acyclic graph and apply graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify the anomalies at both the workflow and individual job levels. In addition, we generalize our GNN model to take into account a set of workflows together for the anomaly detection task rather than a specific workflow. By taking advantage of learning the hidden representation, not only from the job features, but also from the topological information of the workflow, our GNN models demonstrate higher accuracy and better runtime efficiency when compared with conventional machine learning models and other convolutional neural network approaches.",
