            "title": "A3S: A General Active Clustering Method with Pairwise Constraints",
            "abstract": "Active clustering aims to boost the clustering performance by integrating human-annotated pairwise constraints through strategic querying. Conventional approaches with semi-supervised clustering schemes encounter high query costs when applied to large datasets with numerous classes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Adaptive Active Aggregation and Splitting (A3S) framework, falling within the cluster-adjustment scheme in active clustering. A3S features strategic active clustering adjustment on the initial cluster result, which is obtained by an adaptive clustering algorithm. In particular, our cluster adjustment is inspired by the quantitative analysis of Normalized mutual information gain under the information theory framework and can provably improve the clustering quality. The proposed A3S framework significantly elevates the performance and scalability of active clustering. In extensive experiments across diverse real-world datasets, A3S achieves desired results with significantly fewer human queries compared with existing methods.",

            "title": "Learning to Double-Check Model Prediction From a Causal Perspective",
            "abstract": "The present machine learning schema typically uses a one-pass model inference (e.g., forward propagation) to make predictions in the testing phase. It is inherently different from human students who double-check the answer during examinations especially when the confidence is low. To bridge this gap, we propose a learning to double-check (L2D) framework, which formulates double check as a learnable procedure with two core operations: recognizing unreliable predictions and revising predictions. To judge the correctness of a prediction, we resort to counterfactual faithfulness in causal theory and design a contrastive faithfulness measure. In particular, L2D generates counterfactual features by imagining: \u201cwhat would the sample features be if its label was the predicted class\u201d and judges the prediction by the faithfulness of the counterfactual features. Furthermore, we design a simple and effective revision module to revise the original model prediction according to the faithfulness. We apply the L2D framework to three classification models and conduct experiments on two public datasets for image classification, validating the effectiveness of L2D in prediction correctness judgment and revision.",

            "abstract": "We study the out-of-distribution generalization of active learning that adaptively selects samples for annotation in learning the decision boundary of classification. Our empirical study finds that increasingly annotating seen samples may hardly benefit the generalization. To address the problem, we propose Counterfactual Active Learning (CounterAL) that empowers active learning with counterfactual thinking to bridge the seen samples with unseen cases. In addition to annotating factual samples, CounterAL requires annotators to answer counterfactual questions to construct counterfactual samples for training. To achieve CounterAL, we design a new acquisition strategy that selects the informative factual-counterfactual pairs for annotation; and a new training strategy that pushes the model update to focus on the discrepancy between factual and counterfactual samples. We evaluate CounterAL on multiple public datasets of sentiment analysis and natural language inference. The experiment results show that CounterAL requires fewer acquisition rounds and outperforms existing active learning methods by a large margin in OOD tests with comparable IID performance.",
