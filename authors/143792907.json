            "abstract": "Novel benchmarks for multiobjective neural archi-tecture search are emerging consistently. It stimulates the need of knowledge transfer techniques to facilitate the repetitive and cumbersome search process. One-shot surrogate is hereby proposed to transfer knowledge from source problems. Specif-ically, a Pareto-aware super-surrogate construction technique is proposed aiming at efficient exploitation of knowledge from benchmarks to make transfer easier. Then, during the surrogate prediction process, appropriate sub-surrogates are sampled from the super-surrogate to jointly guide the evaluation decision. The multiobjective surrogate is also redesigned as objective-wise, decision-making, and combinative ones, so that it can make transfer flexible, as well as evade from the scalarization issue in performance measurement. This knowledge transfer scheme assists the convergence of the search process using previously constructed surrogates from multiple source problems, balancing exploration and exploitation.",

            "abstract": "The powerful deep learning models in remote sensing are inseparable from the support of massive data. However, the privacy and sensitivity of remote sensing data (RSD) restrict the possibility of each party to collaboratively train and share a large general model. Although multiparty learning (MPL) is a feasible solution, it is difficult for the existing MPL methods to uniformly process different remote sensing tasks (RSTs), and the data held by each party is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID), heterogeneous, and multisources. Therefore, it is urgent to explore a solution for the personalized processing of different RSTs. In this article, we formulate a novel multiparty personalized collaborative learning (MPCL) framework in terms of models and tasks. Specifically, in each iteration of the communication round, we aim to decouple personalized model optimization from global model learning. Different participants are allowed to explore their personalized local models at a certain distance from the global aggregation models according to the characteristics of their local data. In terms of task personalization, MPCL provides different personalized global models to handle the corresponding RSTs. For participants with different RSTs, it can be implemented in the multitask collaborative training strategy to explore the connection between different tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility of MPCL, we take remote sensing image (RSI) classification as a case study and provide a detailed feasibility scheme. We constructed four benchmark datasets compliant with MPL and personalized MPL, including single-source and multisource about SAR, hyperspectral, and optical RSD. The experimental results demonstrate that our MPCL is superior in these four RSDs, which ranked first in the competition with the classic or state-of-the-art (SOTA) MPL and personalized MPL algorithms. In addition, the scalability of MPCL is also verified on image segmentation RSTs of building and road extraction.",

            "title": "A Multi-Modal Vertical Federated Learning Framework Based on Homomorphic Encryption",
            "abstract": "Federated learning has gained prominence as an effective solution for addressing data silos, enabling collaboration among multiple parties without sharing their data. However, existing federated learning algorithms often neglect the challenge posed by multi-modal data distribution. Moreover, previous pioneering work face limitations in encrypting the exponential and logarithmic operations of the objective function with multiple independent variables, and they rely on a third-party cooperator for encryption. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a universal multi-modal vertical federated learning framework. To tackle the data distribution challenge, we propose a two-step multi-modal transformer model that captures cross-domain semantic features effectively. For encryption, where traditional additively homomorphic encryption algorithms fall short by supporting only addition and multiplication, we employ bivariate Taylor series expansion to transform the objective function. Integrating these components, we present a comprehensive training and transmission protocol that eliminates the need for a third-party cooperator during the encryption process. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse video-text and image-text datasets validate the superior performance of our framework compared to state-of-the-art approaches, affirming its effectiveness in multi-modal vertical federated learning settings.",

            "abstract": "Multiparty learning provides solutions for training joint models with decentralized data under legal and practical constraints. However, traditional multiparty learning approaches are confronted with obstacles, such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and incentive design. Determining how to deal with these challenges and further improve the efficiency and performance of multiparty learning has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this article, we propose a novel contrastive multiparty learning framework for knowledge refinement and sharing with an accountable incentive mechanism. Since the existing parameter averaging method is contradictory to the learning paradigm of neural networks, we simulate the process of human cognition and communication and analogize multiparty learning as a many-to-one knowledge-sharing problem. The approach is capable of integrating the acquired explicit knowledge of each client in a transparent manner without privacy disclosure, and it reduces the dependence on data distribution and communication environments. The proposed scheme achieves significant improvement in model performance in a variety of scenarios, as we demonstrated through experiments on several real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Multi-party learning is a specific framework of distributed learning which is widely exploited in the medical system and mobile data analysis. By installing a central server, individual devices update the model parameters instead of sharing sensitive data. This method can protect data privacy with the highest measures. But during the communication round, it is difficult to balance the model performance and the computational costs. In this article, we propose a novel framework for multiparty learning, named Multi-objective Multi-Party Learning via Diverse Steps (MMPL). We regard multi-party learning as a multi-objective problem and employ evolutionary optimization for analysis. Within the design of our framework, we try to use the neural network as a bridge to connect evolutionary optimization with multi-party learning. During the study, we propose a novel space-searching strategy for complex encoding problems. An individual wised value is installed on each private device for a differentiated treatment. Experimental results between our method and the comparative algorithms show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance while partly ameliorating the time-consuming problem.",

            "title": "Alleviating Structural Distribution Shift in Graph Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a challenging binary classification problem due to its different structural distribution between anomalies and normal nodes --- abnormal nodes are a minority, therefore holding high heterophily and low homophily compared to normal nodes. Furthermore, due to various time factors and the annotation preferences of human experts, the heterophily and homophily can change across training and testing data, which is called structural distribution shift (SDS) in this paper. The mainstream methods are built on graph neural networks (GNNs), benefiting the classification of normals from aggregating homophilous neighbors, yet ignoring the SDS issue for anomalies and suffering from poor generalization. This work solves the problem from a feature view. We observe that the degree of SDS varies between anomalies and normal nodes. Hence to address the issue, the key lies in resisting high heterophily for anomalies meanwhile benefiting the learning of normals from homophily. Since different labels correspond to the difference of critical anomaly features which make great contributions to the GAD, we tease out the anomaly features on which we constrain to mitigate the effect of heterophilous neighbors and make them invariant. However, the prior distribution of anomaly features is dynamic and hard to estimate, we thus devise a prototype vector to infer and update this distribution during training. For normal nodes, we constrain the remaining features to preserve the connectivity of nodes and reinforce the influence of the homophilous neighborhood. We term our proposed framework asGraph Decomposition Network (GDN). Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and the proposed framework achieves a remarkable performance boost in GAD, especially in an SDS environment where anomalies have largely different structural distribution across training and testing environments. Codes are open-sourced in https://github.com/blacksingular/wsdm_GDN.",

This study used Sentinel-2 images, taking urban functional areas as the dividing scale, and combined spatial analysis, statistics, and other relevant methods to explore the factors influencing remote sensing ecological quality in Puxi, Shanghai, China. Landsat-8 and high-resolution Sentinel-2 data fusion achieved more refined remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) distribution data, which is of great significance for ecological quality exploration in small areas; the degree of influence of the selected research factors on the RSEI was spectral index > building > social perception > terrain. The R-value of the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was 0.970, and it exerted the strongest influence. The R-value of the average building height was 0.103, indicating that it had the weakest influence. The interactions among the selected factors were mainly two-factor and nonlinear enhancements. Most factor combinations exhibited two-factor enhancement. There were six groups of factor combinations for nonlinear enhancement, of which five were related to the average building height. The results of the present study provide a reference for multi-path ecological quality control in small-area regions.",

            "title": "Addressing Heterophily in Graph Anomaly Detection: A Perspective of Graph Spectrum",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) suffers from heterophily \u2014 abnormal nodes are sparse so that they are connected to vast normal nodes. The current solutions upon Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) blindly smooth the representation of neiboring nodes, thus undermining the discriminative information of the anomalies. To alleviate the issue, recent studies identify and discard inter-class edges through estimating and comparing the node-level representation similarity. However, the representation of a single node can be misleading when the prediction error is high, thus hindering the performance of the edge indicator. In graph signal processing, the smoothness index is a widely adopted metric which plays the role of frequency in classical spectral analysis. Considering the ground truth Y to be a signal on graph, the smoothness index is equivalent to the value of the heterophily ratio. From this perspective, we aim to address the heterophily problem in the spectral domain. First, we point out that heterophily is positively associated with the frequency of a graph. Towards this end, we could prune inter-class edges by simply emphasizing and delineating the high-frequency components of the graph. Recall that graph Laplacian is a high-pass filter, we adopt it to measure the extent of 1-hop label changing of the center node and indicate high-frequency components. As GAD can be formulated as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, only part of the nodes are labeled. As an alternative, we use the prediction of the nodes to estimate it. Through our analysis, we show that prediction errors are less likely to affect the identification process. Extensive empirical evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the indicator over popular homophilic, heterophilic, and tailored fraud detection methods. Our proposed indicator can effectively reduce the heterophily degree of the graph, thus boosting the overall GAD performance. Codes are open-sourced in https://github.com/blacksingular/GHRN.",

            "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a fundamental task vexing real-world applications, has attracted growing attention in the NLP community. Recently fine-tuning based methods have made promising progress. However, it could be costly to store fine-tuned models for each scenario. In this paper, we depart from the classic fine-tuning based OOD detection toward a parameter-efficient alternative, and propose an unsupervised prefix-tuning based OOD detection framework termed PTO. Additionally, to take advantage of optional training data labels and targeted OOD data, two practical extensions of PTO are further proposed. Overall, PTO and its extensions offer several key advantages of being lightweight, easy-to-reproduce, and theoretically justified. Experimental results show that our methods perform comparably to, even better than, existing fine-tuning based OOD detection approaches under a wide range of metrics, detection settings, and OOD types.",

            "abstract": "Multi-party learning provides an effective approach for training a machine learning model, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), over decentralized data by leveraging multiple decentralized computing devices, subjected to legal and practical constraints. Different parties, so-called local participants, usually provide heterogenous data in a decentralized mode, leading to non-IID data distributions across different local participants which pose a notorious challenge for multi-party learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel heterogeneous differentiable sampling (HDS) framework. Inspired by the dropout strategy in DNNs, a data-driven network sampling strategy is devised in the HDS framework, with differentiable sampling rates which allow each local participant to extract from a common global model the optimal local model that best adapts to its own data properties so that the size of the local model can be significantly reduced to enable more efficient inference. Meanwhile, co-adaptation of the global model via learning such local models allows for achieving better learning performance under non-IID data distributions and speeds up the convergence of the global model. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over several popular multi-party learning techniques in the multi-party settings with non-IID data distributions.",
