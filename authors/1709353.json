            "abstract": "Database queries traditionally operate under the closed-world assumption, providing no answers to questions that require information beyond the data stored in the database. Hybrid querying using SQL offers an alternative by integrating relational databases with large language models (LLMs) to answer beyond-database questions. In this paper, we present the first cross-domain benchmark, SWAN, containing 120 beyond-database questions over four real-world databases. To leverage state-of-the-art language models in addressing these complex questions in SWAN, we present, HQDL, a preliminary solution for hybrid querying, and also discuss potential future directions. Our evaluation demonstrates that HQDL using GPT-4 Turbo with few-shot prompts, achieves 40.0\\% in execution accuracy and 48.2\\% in data factuality. These results highlights both the potential and challenges for hybrid querying. We believe that our work will inspire further research in creating more efficient and accurate data systems that seamlessly integrate relational databases and large language models to address beyond-database questions.",

            "title": "QUICKeR: Quicker Updates Involving Continuous Key Rotation",
            "abstract": "Since the advent of cloud computing, storing large quantities of sensitive data on remote services have demanded secure encryption practices to maintain data privacy. Merely encrypting data at-rest leaves ciphertexts vulnerable to inevitable key leakage from mismanaged keys, side-channel attacks, and security bugs. To combat this, we propose QUICKeR, a system to facilitate continuous key rotation and ciphertext updates. Unfortunately, continuous ciphertext updates from key rotation interferes with routine access operations by introducing race conditions and performance bottlenecks that preclude prior works from practical use. QUICKeR addresses these concerns through protocols that eliminate race conditions and even achieve the stronger linearizability correctness criterion. In addition, QUICKeR proposes three approaches to implement frequent ciphertext updates. We show how these different update schemes perform under different database bottlenecks. Finally, we demonstrate that QUICKeR is practical through end-to-end experiments showing that routine access operations are not significantly impacted by ciphertext update operations.",

            "title": "ORTOA: A Family of One Round Trip Protocols For Operation-Type Obliviousness",
            "abstract": "Many applications relying on cloud storage services typically encrypt their data to ensure data privacy. However, serving client requests by reading or writing the encrypted data reveals the type of client operation to a potentially untrusted cloud. An adversary can exploit this information leak to compromise a user\u2019s privacy by tracking read/write access patterns. Existing approaches such as Oblivious RAM (ORAM) schemes hide the type of client access by always reading and then writing the data sequentially for both reads and writes, rendering one of these rounds redundant with respect to a client request. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose ORTOA-a family of protocols enabling single-round data access on remote storage without revealing the operation type . Specifically, we propose three protocols, two using existing cryptographic primitives of fully homomorphic encryption and trusted execution environments (TEEs), and a new primitive inspired by garbled circuits. Each of these protocols has different trust assumptions, allowing an application to choose the option best suited for its needs. To our knowledge, ORTOA is the first to propose generalized protocols to obfuscate the type of access in a single round, reducing communication overhead by half. The proposed techniques can pave the way for novel ORAM schemes that hide both the type of access and the access pattern in a single round. Our experimental results show ORTOA achieving throughput gains of 1.7x-3.2x compared to a baseline requiring two rounds for access type hiding, with the baseline incurring latency 1.5-1.9x that of ORTOA for 160B-sized objects.",

Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Edge computing while bringing computation and data closer to users in order to improve response time, distributes edge servers in wide area networks resulting in increased communication latency between the servers. Synchronizing globally distributed edge servers, especially in the presence of Byzantine servers, becomes costly due to the high communication complexity of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols. In this paper, we present Ziziphus, a geo-distributed system that partitions edge servers into fault-tolerant zones where each zone processes transactions initiated by nearby clients locally. Global synchronization among zones is required only in special situations, e.g., migration of clients from one zone to another. On the one hand, the two-level architecture of Ziziphus confines the malicious behavior of nodes within zones requiring a much cheaper protocol at the top level for global synchronization. On the other hand, Ziziphus processes local transactions within zones by edge servers closer to clients resulting in enhanced performance. Ziziphus further introduces zone clusters to enhance scalability where instead of running global synchronization among all zones, only zones of a single cluster are synchronized.",

Our key idea is to leverage the skewness inherent to most feature streams in the real world. We leverage this skewness by disentangling the feature stream into hot, warm, and cold items based on their feature values. We then use different data structures for tracking objects in each category. Panakos provides solid theoretical guarantees and achieves high performance for various tasks. We have implemented Panakos on both software and hardware and compared Panakos to other state-of-the-art sketches using synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that Panakos often achieves one order of magnitude better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solutions for a given memory budget.",

            "abstract": "The Log Structured Merge Trees (LSM-tree) based key-value stores are widely used in many storage systems to support a variety of operations such as updates, point reads, and range reads. Traditionally, LSM-tree's merge policy organizes data into multiple levels of exponentially increasing capacity to support high-speed writes. However, we contend that the traditional merge policies are not optimized for reads. In this work, we present Autumn, a scalable and read optimized LSM-tree based key-value stores with minimal point and range read cost. The key idea in improving the read performance is to dynamically adjust the capacity ratio between two adjacent levels as more data are stored. As a result, smaller levels gradually increase their capacities and merge more often. In particular, the point and range read cost improves from the previous best known $O(logN)$ complexity to $O(\\sqrt{logN})$ in Autumn by applying the novel Garnering merge policy. While Garnering merge policy optimizes for both point reads and range reads, it maintains high performance for updates. Moreover, to further improve the update costs, Autumn uses a small amount of bounded space of DRAM to pin/keep the first level of LSM-tree. We implemented Autumn on top of LevelDB and experimentally showcases the gain in performance for real world workloads.",

            "abstract": "Voice conversion (VC) models have demonstrated impressive few-shot conversion quality on the clean, native speech populations they're trained on. However, when source or target speech accents, background noise conditions, or microphone characteristics differ from training, quality voice conversion is not guaranteed. These problems are often left unexamined in VC research, giving rise to frustration in users trying to use pretrained VC models on their own data. We are interested in accent-preserving voice conversion for name pronunciation from self-recorded examples, a domain in which all three of the aforementioned conditions are present, and posit that demonstrating higher performance in this domain correlates with creating VC models that are more usable by otherwise frustrated users. We demonstrate that existing SOTA encoder-decoder VC models can be made robust to these variations and endowed with natural denoising capabilities using more diverse data and simple data augmentation techniques in pretraining.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present an advanced analysis of near optimal algorithms that use limited space to solve the frequency estimation, heavy hitters, frequent items, and top-k approximation in the bounded deletion model. We define the family of SpaceSaving$\\pm$ algorithms and explain why the original SpaceSaving$\\pm$ algorithm only works when insertions and deletions are not interleaved. Next, we propose the new Double SpaceSaving$\\pm$, Unbiased Double SpaceSaving$\\pm$, and Integrated SpaceSaving$\\pm$ and prove their correctness. The three proposed algorithms represent different trade-offs, in which Double SpaceSaving$\\pm$ can be extended to provide unbiased estimations while Integrated SpaceSaving$\\pm$ uses less space. Since data streams are often skewed, we present an improved analysis of these algorithms and show that errors do not depend on the hot items. We also demonstrate how to achieve relative error guarantees under mild assumptions. Moreover, we establish that the important mergeability property is satisfied by all three algorithms, which is essential for running the algorithms in distributed settings.",
