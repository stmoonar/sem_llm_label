            "abstract": "Providing human-understandable explanations for the matching predictions is still challenging for current legal case matching methods. One difficulty is that legal cases are semi-structured text documents with complicated case-case and case-law article correlations. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel graph optimal transport (GOT)-based legal case matching model that is able to provide not only the matching predictions but also plausible and faithful explanations for the prediction. The model, called GEIOT-Match, first constructs a heterogeneous graph to explicitly represent the semi-structured nature of legal cases and their associations with the law articles. Therefore, matching two legal cases amounts to identifying the rationales from the paired legal case sub-graphs in the heterogeneous graph and then aligning between them. An inverse optimal transport (IOT) model on graphs is learned to extract rationales from paired legal cases. The extracted rationales and the heterogeneous graph demonstrate the key legal characteristics of legal cases, which can be further used to conduct matching and generate explanations for the matching. Experimental results showed that GEIOT-Match outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in terms of matching prediction, rationale extraction, and natural language explanation generation.",

            "abstract": "Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, vanilla MLP networks are inefficient in learning multiplicative feature interactions, making feature interaction learning an essential topic for CTR prediction. Existing feature interaction networks are effective in complementing the learning of MLPs, but they often fall short of the performance of MLPs when applied alone. Thus, their integration with MLP networks is necessary to achieve improved performance. This situation motivates us to explore a better alternative to the MLP backbone that could potentially replace MLPs. Inspired by factorization machines, in this paper, we propose FINAL, a factorized interaction layer that extends the widely-used linear layer and is capable of learning 2nd-order feature interactions. Similar to MLPs, multiple FINAL layers can be stacked into a FINAL block, yielding feature interactions with an exponential degree growth. We unify feature interactions and MLPs into a single FINAL block and empirically show its effectiveness as a replacement for the MLP block. Furthermore, we explore the ensemble of two FINAL blocks as an enhanced two-stream CTR model, setting a new state-of-the-art on open benchmark datasets. FINAL can be easily adopted as a building block and has achieved business metric gains in multiple applications at Huawei. Our source code will be made available at MindSpore/models and FuxiCTR/model_zoo.",

            "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems face the challenge of operating in non-stationary environments, where data distribution shifts arise from evolving user behaviors over time. To tackle this challenge, a common approach is to periodically re-train or incrementally update deployed deep models with newly observed data, resulting in a continual learning process. However, the conventional learning paradigm of neural networks relies on iterative gradient-based updates with a small learning rate, making it slow for large recommendation models to adapt. In this paper, we introduce ReLoop2, a self-correcting learning loop that facilitates fast model adaptation in online recommender systems through responsive error compensation. Inspired by the slow-fast complementary learning system observed in human brains, we propose an error memory module that directly stores error samples from incoming data streams. These stored samples are subsequently leveraged to compensate for model prediction errors during testing, particularly under distribution shifts. The error memory module is designed with fast access capabilities and undergoes continual refreshing with newly observed data samples during the model serving phase to support fast model adaptation. We evaluate the effectiveness of ReLoop2 on three open benchmark datasets as well as a real-world production dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of ReLoop2 in enhancing the responsiveness and adaptiveness of recommender systems operating in non-stationary environments.",

            "abstract": "In the field of music information retrieval (MIR), cover song identification (CSI) is a challenging task that aims to identify cover versions of a query song from a massive collection. Existing works still suffer from high intra-song variances and inter-song correlations, due to the entangled nature of version-specific and version-invariant factors in their modeling. In this work, we set the goal of disentangling version-specific and version-invariant factors, which could make it easier for the model to learn invariant music representations for unseen query songs. We analyze the CSI task in a disentanglement view with the causal graph technique, and identify the intra-version and inter-version effects biasing the invariant learning. To block these effects, we propose the disentangled music representation learning framework (DisCover) for CSI. DisCover consists of two critical components: (1) Knowledge-guided Disentanglement Module (KDM) and (2) Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement Module (GADM), which block intra-version and inter-version biased effects, respectively. KDM minimizes the mutual information between the learned representations and version-variant factors that are identified with prior domain knowledge. GADM identifies version-variant factors by simulating the representation transitions between intra-song versions, and exploits adversarial distillation for effect blocking. Extensive comparisons with best-performing methods and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of DisCover and the and necessity of disentanglement for CSI.",

            "abstract": "Two-tower models are a prevalent matching framework for recommendation, which have been widely deployed in industrial applications. The success of two-tower matching attributes to its efficiency in retrieval among a large number of items, since the item tower can be precomputed and used for fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. However, it suffers two main challenges, including limited feature interaction capability and reduced accuracy in online serving. Existing approaches attempt to design novel late interactions instead of dot products, but they still fail to support complex feature interactions or lose retrieval efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a new matching paradigm named SparCode, which supports not only sophisticated feature interactions but also efficient retrieval. Specifically, SparCode introduces an all-to-all interaction module to model fine-grained query-item interactions. Besides, we design a discrete code-based sparse inverted index jointly trained with the model to achieve effective and efficient model inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted on open benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our framework. The results show that SparCode significantly improves the accuracy of candidate item matching while retaining the same level of retrieval efficiency with two-tower models.",

However, these estimators often assume that confounders are precisely observable, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Adversarial Training-based IPS (AT-IPS), which uses adversarial training to handle noisy confounders. The proposed method defines a feasible region for the confounders, obtains the worst-case noise (adversarial noise) within the region, and jointly trains the propensity model and the prediction model against such noise to improve their robustness. We provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy-robustness tradeoff of AT-IPS and demonstrate its superior performance compared to other popular estimators on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets.",

            "title": "FANS: Fast Non-Autoregressive Sequence Generation for Item List Continuation",
            "abstract": "User-curated item lists, such as video-based playlists on Youtube and book-based lists on Goodreads, have become prevalent for content sharing on online platforms. Item list continuation is proposed to model the overall trend of a list and predict subsequent items. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown promise in comprehending contextual information and capturing item relationships in a list. However, deploying them in real-time industrial applications is challenging, mainly because the autoregressive generation mechanism used in them is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel fast non-autoregressive sequence generation model, namely FANS, to enhance inference efficiency and quality for item list continuation. First, we use a non-autoregressive generation mechanism to decode next K items simultaneously instead of one by one in existing models. Then, we design a two-stage classifier to replace the vanilla classifier used in current transformer-based models to further reduce the decoding time. Moreover, to improve the quality of non-autoregressive generation, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to optimize training. Experimental results on four real-world item list continuation datasets including Zhihu, Spotify, AotM, and Goodreads show that our FANS model can significantly improve inference efficiency (up to 8.7x) while achieving competitive or better generation quality for item list continuation compared with the state-of-the-art autoregressive models. We also validate the efficiency of FANS in an industrial setting. Our source code and data will be available at MindSpore/models1 and Github2.",

            "title": "Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In the video recommendation, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of user interest. However, watch time is not only influenced by the matching of users\u2019 interests but also by other factors, such as duration bias and noisy watching. Duration bias refers to the tendency for users to spend more time on videos with longer durations, regardless of their actual interest level. Noisy watching, on the other hand, describes users taking time to determine whether they like a video or not, which can result in users spending time watching videos they do not like. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for indicating user interest. Furthermore, current methods primarily address duration bias and ignore the impact of noisy watching, which may limit their effectiveness in uncovering user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users\u2019 watch time from a unified causal viewpoint. Specifically, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user\u2019s actual interest level, the duration-biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D2Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "title": "FinalMLP: An Enhanced Two-Stream MLP Model for CTR Prediction",
            "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in online advertising and recommendation. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep CTR prediction models, but it has been widely shown that applying a vanilla MLP network alone is ineffective in learning complex feature interactions. As such, many two-stream models (e.g., Wide&Deep, DeepFM, and DCN) have recently been proposed, aiming to integrate two parallel sub-networks to learn feature interactions from two different views for enhanced CTR prediction. In addition to one MLP stream that learns feature interactions implicitly, most of the existing research focuses on designing another stream to complement the MLP stream with explicitly enhanced feature interactions. Instead, this paper presents a simple two-stream feature interaction model, namely FinalMLP, which employs only MLPs in both streams yet achieves surprisingly strong performance. In contrast to sophisticated network design in each stream, our work enhances CTR modeling through a feature selection module, which produces differentiated feature inputs to two streams, and a group-wise bilinear fusion module, which effectively captures stream-level interactions across two streams. We show that FinalMLP achieves competitive or even better performance against many existing two-stream CTR models on four open benchmark datasets and also brings significant CTR improvements during an online A/B test in our industrial news recommender system. We envision that the simple yet effective FinalMLP model could serve as a new strong baseline for future development of two-stream CTR models.
