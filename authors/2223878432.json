            "abstract": "As the demand for more personalized recommendation grows and a dramatic boom in commercial scenarios arises, the study on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted much attention, which uses the data from all scenarios to simultaneously improve their recommendation performance. However, existing methods tend to integrate insufficient scenario knowledge and neglect learning personalized cross-scenario preferences, thus leading to suboptimal performance and inadequate interpretability. Meanwhile, though large language model (LLM) has shown great capability of reasoning and capturing semantic information, the high inference latency and high computation cost of tuning hinder its implementation in industrial recommender systems. To fill these gaps, we propose an effective efficient interpretable LLM-enhanced paradigm LLM4MSR in this work. Specifically, we first leverage LLM to uncover multi-level knowledge including scenario correlations and users' cross-scenario interests from the designed scenario- and user-level prompt without fine-tuning the LLM, then adopt hierarchical meta networks to generate multi-level meta layers to explicitly improves the scenario-aware and personalized recommendation capability. Our experiments on KuaiSAR-small, KuaiSAR, and Amazon datasets validate two significant advantages of LLM4MSR: (i) the effectiveness and compatibility with different multi-scenario backbone models (achieving 1.5%, 1%, and 40% AUC improvement on three datasets), (ii) high efficiency and deployability on industrial recommender systems, and (iii) improved interpretability. The implemented code and data is available to ease reproduction.",

            "abstract": "Worldwide geolocalization aims to locate the precise location at the coordinate level of photos taken anywhere on the Earth. It is very challenging due to 1) the difficulty of capturing subtle location-aware visual semantics, and 2) the heterogeneous geographical distribution of image data. As a result, existing studies have clear limitations when scaled to a worldwide context. They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot adapt to various locations worldwide with different amounts of relevant data. To resolve these limitations, we propose G3, a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In particular, G3 consists of three steps, i.e., Geo-alignment, Geo-diversification, and Geo-verification to optimize both retrieval and generation phases of worldwide geolocalization. During Geo-alignment, our solution jointly learns expressive multi-modal representations for images, GPS and textual descriptions, which allows us to capture location-aware semantics for retrieving nearby images for a given query. During Geo-diversification, we leverage a prompt ensembling method that is robust to inconsistent retrieval performance for different image queries. Finally, we combine both retrieved and generated GPS candidates in Geo-verification for location prediction. Experiments on two well-established datasets IM2GPS3k and YFCC4k verify the superiority of G3 compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to predict user interest based on historical behavioral data. They are mainly designed in sequential pipelines, requiring lots of data to train different sub-systems, and are hard to scale to new domains. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalized capabilities, enabling a singular model to tackle diverse recommendation tasks across various scenarios. Nonetheless, existing LLM-based recommendation systems utilize LLM purely for a single task of the recommendation pipeline. Besides, these systems face challenges in presenting large-scale item sets to LLMs in natural language format, due to the constraint of input length. To address these challenges, we introduce an LLM-based end-to-end recommendation framework: UniLLMRec. Specifically, UniLLMRec integrates multi-stage tasks (e.g. recall, ranking, re-ranking) via chain-of-recommendations. To deal with large-scale items, we propose a novel strategy to structure all items into an item tree, which can be dynamically updated and effectively retrieved. UniLLMRec shows promising zero-shot results in comparison with conventional supervised models. Additionally, it boasts high efficiency, reducing the input token need by 86% compared to existing LLM-based models. Such efficiency not only accelerates task completion but also optimizes resource utilization. To facilitate model understanding and to ensure reproducibility, we have made our code publicly available.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of various commercial scenarios, there is an increasing number of studies on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) which trains the recommender system with the data from multiple scenarios, aiming to improve the recommendation performance on all these scenarios synchronously. However, due to the large discrepancy in the number of interactions among domains, multi-scenario recommendation models usually suffer from insufficient learning and negative transfer especially on the cold-start scenarios, thus exacerbating the data sparsity issue. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a novel diffusion model enhanced paradigm tailored for the cold-start problem in multi-scenario recommendation in a data-driven generative manner. Specifically, based on all-domain data, we leverage the diffusion model with our newly designed variance schedule and the proposed classifier, which explicitly boosts the recommendation performance on the cold-start scenarios by exploiting the generated high-quality and informative embedding, leveraging the abundance of rich scenarios. Our experiments on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate two strengths of the proposed paradigm: (i) its effectiveness with a significant increase of 8.5% and 1% in accuracy on the two datasets, and (ii) its compatibility with various multi-scenario backbone models.

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of commercial applications of recommender systems, multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted considerable attention, which utilizes data from multiple domains to improve their recommendation performance simultaneously. However, training a unified deep recommender system (DRS) may not explicitly comprehend the commonality and difference among domains, whereas training an individual model for each domain neglects the global information and incurs high computation costs. Likewise, fine-tuning on each domain is inefficient, and recent advances that apply the prompt tuning technique to improve fine-tuning efficiency rely solely on large-sized transformers. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-enhanced paradigm for multi-scenario recommendation. Specifically, a unified DRS backbone model is first pre-trained using data from all the domains in order to capture the commonality across domains. Then, we conduct prompt tuning with two novel prompt modules, capturing the distinctions among various domains and users. Our experiments on Douban, Amazon, and Ali-CCP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm with two noticeable strengths: (i) its great compatibility with various DRS backbone models, and (ii) its high computation and storage efficiency with only 6% trainable parameters in prompt tuning phase.

            "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental technique in recommendation and advertising systems. Recent studies have shown that implementing multi-scenario recommendations contributes to strengthening information sharing and improving overall performance. However, existing multi-scenario models only consider coarse-grained explicit scenario modeling that depends on pre-defined scenario identification from manual prior rules, which is biased and sub-optimal. To address these limitations, we propose a Scenario-Aware Hierarchical Dynamic Network for Multi-Scenario Recommendations (HierRec), which perceives implicit patterns adaptively and conducts explicit and implicit scenario modeling jointly. In particular, HierRec designs a basic scenario-oriented module based on the dynamic weight to capture scenario-specific information. Then the hierarchical explicit and implicit scenario-aware modules are proposed to model hybrid-grained scenario information. The multi-head implicit modeling design contributes to perceiving distinctive patterns from different perspectives. Our experiments on two public datasets and real-world industrial applications on a mainstream online advertising platform demonstrate that our HierRec outperforms existing models significantly.",

            "abstract": "Deep recommender systems typically involve numerous feature fields for users and items, with a large number of low-frequency features. These low-frequency features would reduce the prediction accuracy with large storage space due to their vast quantity and inadequate training. Some pioneering studies have explored embedding compression techniques to address this issue of the trade-off between storage space and model predictability. However, these methods have difficulty compacting the embedding of low-frequency features in various feature fields due to the high demand for human experience and computing resources during hyper-parameter searching. In this paper, we propose the AutoDPQ framework, which automatically compacts low-frequency feature embeddings for each feature field to an adaptive magnitude. Experimental results indicate that AutoDPQ can significantly reduce the parameter space while improving recommendation accuracy. Moreover, AutoDPQ is compatible with various deep CTR models by improving their performance significantly with high efficiency.",
