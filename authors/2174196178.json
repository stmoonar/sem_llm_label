            "abstract": "Timely and accurately seizure detection is of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy patients. Existing seizure detection models are often complex and time-consuming, highlighting the urgent need for lightweight seizure detection. Additionally, existing methods often neglect the key characteristic channels and spatial regions of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To solve these issues, we propose a lightweight EEG-based seizure detection model named lightweight inverted residual attention network (LRAN). Specifically, we employ a four-stage inverted residual mobile block (iRMB) to effectively extract the hierarchical features from EEG. The convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is introduced to make the model focus on important feature channels and spatial information, thereby enhancing the discrimination of the learned features. Finally, convolution operations are used to capture local information and spatial relationships between features. We conduct intra-subject and inter-subject experiments on a publicly available dataset. Intra-subject experiments obtain 99.25% accuracy in segment-based detection and 0.36/h false detection rate (FDR) in event-based detection, respectively. Inter-subject experiments obtain 84.32% accuracy. Both sets of experiments maintain high classification accuracy with a low number of parameters, where the multiply accumulate operations (MACs) are 25.86[Formula: see text]M and the number of parameters is 0.57[Formula: see text]M.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is one kind of neurological disease characterized by recurring seizures. Recurrent seizures can cause ongoing negative mental and cognitive damage to the patient. Therefore, timely diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy are crucial for patients. Manual electroencephalography (EEG) signals analysis is time and energy consuming, making automatic detection using EEG signals particularly important. Many deep learning algorithms have thus been proposed to detect seizures. These methods rely on expensive and bulky hardware, which makes them unsuitable for deployment on devices with limited resources due to their high demands on computer resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight neural network for seizure detection using pure convolutions, which is composed of inverted residual structure and multi-scale channel attention mechanism. Compared with other methods, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, making it possible to deploy on low-cost portable devices for seizures detection. We conduct experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset and achieves 98.7% accuracy, 98.3% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity with 2.68[Formula: see text]M multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and only 88[Formula: see text]K parameters.",

            "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) based on deep learning has been significantly improved. However, existing works have not adequately excavate the spatial-temporal information between EEG channels. Besides, most works mainly focus on patient-specific scenarios while cross-patient seizure detection is more challenging and meaningful. Regarding the above problems, we propose a hybrid attention network (HAN) for automatic seizure detection. Specifically, the graph attention network (GAT) extracts spatial features at the front end, and Transformer gets time features as the back end. HAN leverages the attention mechanism and fully extracts the spatial-temporal correlation of EEG signals. The focal loss function is introduced to HAN to deal with the imbalance of the dataset accompanied by seizure detection based on EEG. Both patient-specific and patient-independent experiments are carried out on the public CHB-MIT database. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HAN in both experimental settings.",

            "title": "Hybrid Network for Patient-Specific Seizure Prediction from EEG Data",
            "abstract": "Seizure prediction can improve the quality of life for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. With the rapid development of deep learning, lots of seizure prediction methods have been proposed. However, seizure prediction based on single convolution models is limited by the inherent defects of convolution itself. Convolution pays attention to the local features while underestimates the global features. The long-term dependence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) data cannot be captured. In view of these defects, a hybrid model called STCNN based on Swin transformer (ST) and 2D convolutional neural network (2DCNN) is proposed. Time-frequency features extracted by short-term Fourier transform (STFT) are taken as the input of STCNN. ST blocks are used in STCNN to capture the global information and long-term dependencies of EEGs. Meanwhile, the 2DCNN blocks are adopted to capture the local information and short-term dependent features. The combination of the two blocks can fully exploit the seizure-related information thus improve the prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. The average seizure prediction sensitivity, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the false positive rate (FPR) are 92.94%, 95.56% and 0.073, respectively.",
