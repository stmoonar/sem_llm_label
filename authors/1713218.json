            "abstract": "Thechaseis a well-established family of algorithms used to materialize Knowledge Bases (KBs) for tasks like query answering under dependencies or data cleaning. A general problem of chase algorithms is that they might perform redundant computations. To counter this problem, we introduce the notion ofTrigger Graphs(TGs), which guide the execution of the rules avoiding redundant computations. We present the results of an extensive theoretical and empirical study that seeks to answer when and how TGs can be computed and what are the benefits of TGs when applied over real-world KBs. Our results include introducing algorithms that compute (minimal) TGs. We implemented our approach in a new engine, called GLog, and our experiments show that it can be significantly more efficient than the chase enabling us to materialize Knowledge Graphs with 17B facts in less than 40 min using a single machine with commodity hardware.",

            "abstract": "Querying inconsistent knowledge bases is a problem that has attracted a great deal of interest over the last decades. While several semantics of query answering have been proposed, and their complexity is rather well-understood, little attention has been paid to the problem of explaining query answers. Explainability has recently become a prominent problem in different areas of AI. In particular, explaining query answers allows users to understand not only what is entailed by an inconsistent knowledge base, but also why. In this paper, we address the problem of explaining query answers for existential rules under three popular inconsistency-tolerant semantics, namely, the ABox repair, the intersection of repairs, and the intersection of closed repairs semantics. We provide a thorough complexity analysis for a wide range of existential rule languages and for different complexity measures.",

Ontology-mediated query answering is a paradigm that seeks to exploit the semantic knowledge expressed in terms of ontologies to improve query answers over incomplete data sources. In this paper, we focus on description logic ontologies, and study the problem of explaining why an ontology-mediated query is entailed from a given data source. Speci\ufb01cally, we view explanations as minimal sets of assertions from an ABox, which satisfy the ontology-mediated query. Based on such explanations, we study a variety of problems taken from the recent literature on explanations (studied for existential rules), such as recognizing all minimal explanations. Our results establish tight connections between intractable explanation problems and variants of propositional satis\ufb01ability problems.

Due to the exponential nature of combinatorial preferences, compact representations are needed, and (m)CP-nets are among the most studied formalisms.

An initial complexity analysis for mCP-nets was carried out only recently. In this paper, we further investigate the complexity of mCP-nets. In particular, we show the \u03a3^P_3$-completeness of checking the existence of max optimal outcomes, which was left as an open problem.

            "abstract": "\n \n \nA key issue in cooperative game theory is coalitional stability, usually captured by the notion of the core---the set of outcomes that are resistant to group deviations. However, some coalitional games have empty cores, and any outcome in such a game is unstable. We investigate the possibility of stabilizing a coalitional game by using subsidies. We consider scenarios where an external party that is interested in having the players work together offers a supplemental payment to the grand coalition, or, more generally, a particular coalition structure. This payment is conditional on players not deviating from this coalition structure, and may be divided among the players in any way they wish. We define the cost of stability as the minimum external payment that stabilizes the game. We provide tight bounds on the cost of stability, both for games where the coalitional values are nonnegative (profit-sharing games) and for games where the coalitional values are nonpositive (cost-sharing games), under natural assumptions on the characteristic function, such as superadditivity, anonymity, or both. We also investigate the relationship between the cost of stability and several variants of the least core. Finally, we study the computational complexity of problems related to the cost of stability, with a focus on weighted voting games. \n \n \n",

            "abstract": "\n \n mCP-nets are an expressive and intuitive formalism based on CP-nets to reason about preferences of groups of agents. The dominance semantics of mCP-nets is based on the concept of voting, and different voting schemes give rise to different dominance semantics for the group. Unlike CP-nets, which received an extensive complexity analysis, mCP-nets, as reported multiple times in the literature, lack a precise study of the voting tasks' complexity. Prior to this work, only a complexity analysis of brute-force algorithms for these tasks was available, and this analysis only gave EXPTIME upper bounds for most of those problems. In this paper, we start to fill this gap by carrying out a precise computational complexity analysis of voting tasks on acyclic binary polynomially connected mCP-nets whose constituents are standard CP-nets. Interestingly, all these problems actually belong to various levels of the polynomial hierarchy, and some of them even belong to PTIME or LOGSPACE. Furthermore, for most of these problems, we provide completeness results, which show tight lower bounds for problems that (up to date) did not have any explicit non-obvious lower bound.\n \n",

            "abstract": "The nucleolus is a well-known solution concept for coalitional games to fairly distribute the total available worth among the players. The nucleolus is known to be NP-hard to compute over compact coalitional games, that is, over games whose functions specifying the worth associated with each coalition are encoded in terms of polynomially computable functions over combinatorial structures. In particular, hardness results have been exhibited over minimum spanning tree games, threshold games, and flow games. However, due to its intricate definition involving reasoning over exponentially many coalitions, a nontrivial upper bound on its complexity was missing in the literature and looked for.\n This article faces this question and precisely characterizes the complexity of the nucleolus, by exhibiting an upper bound that holds on any class of compact games, and by showing that this bound is tight even on the (structurally simple) class of graph games. The upper bound is established by proposing a variant of the standard linear-programming based algorithm for nucleolus computation and by studying a framework for reasoning about succinctly specified linear programs, which are contributions of interest in their own. The hardness result is based on an elaborate combinatorial reduction, which is conceptually relevant for it provides a \u201cmeasure\u201d of the computational cost to be paid for guaranteeing voluntary participation to the distribution process. In fact, the pre-nucleolus is known to be efficiently computable over graph games, with this solution concept being defined as the nucleolus but without guaranteeing that each player is granted with it at least the worth she can get alone, that is, without collaborating with the other players.\n Finally, this article identifies relevant tractable classes of coalitional games, based on the notion of type of a player. Indeed, in most applications where many players are involved, it is often the case that such players do belong in fact to a limited number of classes, which is known in advance and may be exploited for computing the nucleolus in a fast way.",

            "abstract": "The hypergraph duality problem Dual is defined as follows: given two simple hypergraphs G and H, decide whether H consists precisely of all minimal transversals of G (in which case we say that G is the dual of H). This problem is equivalent to decide whether two given non-redundant monotone DNFs are dual. It is known that DUAL, the complementary problem to Dual, is in GC (log2 n, PTIME), where GC(f(n), C) denotes the complexity class of all problems that after a nondeterministic guess of O(f(n)) bits can be decided (checked) within complexity class C. It was conjectured that DUAL is in GC(log2 n, LOGSPACE). In this paper we prove this conjecture and actually place the DUAL problem into the complexity class GC(log2 n, TC0) which is a subclass of GC(log2 n, LOGSPACE). We here refer to the logtime-uniform version of TC0, which corresponds to FO(COUNT), i.e., first order logic augmented by counting quantifiers. We achieve the latter bound in two steps. First, based on existing problem decomposition methods, we develop a new nondeterministic algorithm for DUAL that requires to guess O(log2 n) bits. We then proceed by a logical analysis of this algorithm, allowing us to formulate its deterministic part in FO(COUNT).",

            "abstract": "Coalitional games model scenarios where rational agents can form coalitions so as to obtain higher worths than by acting in isolation. Once a coalition forms and obtains its worth, the problem of how this worth can be fairly distributed has to be faced. Desirable worth distributions are usually referred to as solution concepts. Recent research pointed out that, while reasoning problems involving such solution concepts are hard in general for games specified in compact form (e.g., graph games), some of them, in particular the core, become tractable when agents come partitioned into a fixed number k of types, i.e., of classes of strategically equivalent players. The paper continues along this line of research, by firstly showing that two other relevant solution concepts, the kernel and the nucleolus, are tractable in this setting and independently of the specific game encoding, provided worth functions are given as a polynomial-time computable oracles. Then, it analyzes a different setting where games are still k-typed but the actual player partitioning is not a-priori known. Within this latter setting, the paper addresses the question about how efficiently strategic equivalence between pairs of players can be recognized, and reconsiders the computational complexity of the core, the kernel, and the nucleolus. All such problems and notions emerged to be intractable, thereby evidencing that the knowledge of player types marks the boundary of tractability for reasoning about k-typed coalitional games.",

In the analysis, games are assumed to be in \"compact\" form, i.e., their worth functions are implicitly given as polynomial-time computable functions over succinct game encodings provided as input. Within this setting, a complete picture of the complexity issues arising with the core, as well as with the related stability concepts of least core and cost of stability, is depicted. In particular, the special cases of superadditive games and of games whose sets of feasible coalitions are restricted over tree-like interaction graphs are also studied.",

Coalitional (i.e., cooperative) game theory supplies conceptual and mathematical tools useful in the analysis of such interactions, and in particular in the achievement of stable outcomes among self-interested agents. Here, we study the minimal external subsidy required to stabilize the core of a coalitional game. Following the Cost of Stability (CoS) model introduced by Bachrach et al. [2009a], we give tight bounds on the required subsidy under various restrictions on the social structure of the game. We then compare the extended core induced by subsidies with the least core of the game, proving tight bounds on the ratio between the minimal subsidy and the minimal demand relaxation that each lead to stability.",

            "abstract": "Coalitional games serve the purpose of modeling payoff distribution problems in scenarios where agents can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths than by acting in isolation. In the classical Transferable Utility (TU) setting, coalition worths can be freely distributed amongst agents. However, in several application scenarios, this is not the case and the Non-Transferable Utility setting (NTU) must be considered, where additional application-oriented constraints are imposed on the possible worth distributions. \n \nIn this paper, an approach to define NTU games is proposed which is based on describing allowed distributions via a set of mixed-integer linear constraints applied to an underlying TU game. It is shown that such games allow non-transferable conditions on worth distributions to be specified in a natural and succinct way. The properties and the relationships among the most prominent solution concepts for NTU games that hold when they are applied on (mixed-integer) constrained games are investigated. Finally, a thorough analysis is carried out to assess the impact of issuing constraints on the computational complexity of some of these solution concepts.",

There are different proposals for representing coalitional games in a compact way, where the worths of coalitions may be computed in polynomial time. In all those frameworks, it was shown that core non-emptiness is a co-NP-hard problem. However, for the most general of them, it was left as an open problem whether it belongs to co-NP or it actually is an harder problem. We solve this open problem in a positive way; indeed, we are able to show that, for the case of transferable payoffs, the problem belongs to co-NP for any compact representation of the game where the worths of coalitions may be computed in polynomial time (also, non-deterministic polynomial time), encompassing all previous proposals of this kind. This is proved by showing that games with empty cores have small infeasibility certificates. The picture is completed by looking at coalitional games with non-transferable payoffs. We propose a compact representation based on marginal contribution nets. Also in this case, we are able to settle the precise complexity of core non-emptiness, which turns out to be \u03a32p-complete.",
