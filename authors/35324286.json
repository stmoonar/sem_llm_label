            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the digital world has propelled sentiment analysis into a critical tool across diverse sectors such as marketing, politics, customer service, and healthcare. While there have been significant advancements in sentiment analysis for widely spoken languages, low-resource languages, such as Bangla, remain largely under-researched due to resource constraints. Furthermore, the recent unprecedented performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications highlights the need to evaluate them in the context of low-resource languages. In this study, we present a sizeable manually annotated dataset encompassing 33,606 Bangla news tweets and Facebook comments. We also investigate zero- and few-shot in-context learning with several language models, including Flan-T5, GPT-4, and Bloomz, offering a comparative analysis against fine-tuned models. Our findings suggest that monolingual transformer-based models consistently outperform other models, even in zero and few-shot scenarios. To foster continued exploration, we intend to make this dataset and our research tools publicly available to the broader research community.",

            "abstract": "Twenty-first century, there has been moderate forced migration where it articulates human civilization. This forced migration is the identity of various territories and demography. According to this issue, Bangladesh is now the largest populated country for being stateless refugees in the world. The Rohingya community is hopeless about placing their lives, therefore, stateless refugees possessions in the southeastern border region of Bangladesh. Due to the part of Bangladesh addressing that stateless refugees and Bangladeshi peoples and other countries people have a tremendous debate on this issue. Tropically, according to these stateless refugees the victim of hate speech. This study aims to detect the daily report of negativity predicting actual analysis among machine learning approaches using hate speech features. Employed 5 classifiers like SVM, DT, KNN, RF, and NB. Necessary cleaning steps accommodate the model using preprocessing. NB shows the results outcome accuracy of 79% which is more than all other models. The approach of predicting hate speech on stateless refugees took 310 comments data which can rule as a global application..",

Fake news is spreading in our society day by day. Web-based media stages permit nearly everybody to distribute their musings or offer stories with the world. The difficulty is, a great many people don't check the wellspring of the material that they see online before they share it, which can prompt phony word getting out rapidly or in any event, circulating around the web. For this reason, we wanted to work with the detection of fake news. Bangla fake news observation is not as easy as English. The features of the Bangla language are comparatively different from other languages. We use machine learning approaches like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for detecting Bangla fake news. We have got the best accuracy for the Random Forest Classifier. Finally, our proposed model can recognize fake report successfully.",

            "abstract": "Road network is a key element of a society and its recovery becomes the most important task after any severe natural disaster. Road network recovery (RNR) becomes the top priority to reach isolated areas for rescue and/or rehabilitation. Recently, task scheduling of RNR (SRNR) is emerged as a challenging optimization task in computational intelligence domain. The exiting methods work well on planned road network environment with established base stations. On the other hand, there are many areas across the globe (especially, the old city parts in megacities), which are vulnerable as well as congested with no base station nearby. The probability of road network disintegration in those areas is high due to natural catastrophe. Therefore, base station establishment in such areas is an important issue and the optimal position selection is very important for better post disaster service. In this study, suitable base station position selection is investigated for post disaster quick RNR. Old Dhaka area in the megacity of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is chosen as a case study. Nodes are marked with resilience capacity and road network disintegration is considered probabilistically for different earthquake levels. Finally, optimal base station location is identified employing Ant Colony Optimization based SRNR values.",

            "abstract": "The increasing demand for advanced services in wireless networks raises the problem for quality of service (QoS) provisioning with proper resource management. In this research work, such a provisioning technique for wireless networks is performed by Call Admission Control (CAC). A new approach in CAC named by Defined Limited Fractional Channel (DLFC) is proposed in this work for the wireless networks in order to provide proper priority between the new calls and handover calls. This DLFC scheme is basically a new style of handover priority scheme. Handover priority is provided by two stages in this scheme which helps the network to utilize more resources. The first priority stage is a fractional priority and the second stage is an integral priority. Fractional priority is provided by the uniform fractional acceptance factor that accepts new calls with the predefined acceptance ratio throughout the fractional priority stage. The two significant parameters of QoS: new call blocking probability and handover call dropping probability of single service wireless network have been analyzed under this DLFC scheme. Besides, the results of the proposed scheme have been compared with the conventional new thinning scheme and cut-off priority scheme and we found that our proposed scheme outperforms than the conventional schemes. Integral priority is given to the handover calls by reserving some channels only for handover calls. In this work, it is shown that DLFC scheme proves itself as optimal call admission controlling technique which is concerned about not only the QoS but also the proper channel utilization with respect to conventional thinning scheme and fractional channel schemes. The handover call rate estimation and its impact on QoS provisioning is discussed widely to attain the optimum QoS in the proposed handover priority scheme. We hope this proposed DLFC scheme will contribute to design high performance CAC in the wireless cellular network. of services (QoS) Thinning schemes Acceptance factor Defined",

            "abstract": "This work investigates to remove highly wandered path from ECG signal. In normal condition, ECG signal contains a very little amount of baseline wandering which can easily be removed by high pass filtering. On the other hand, acquired ECG signal during walking, running, push-up or pull-up the body contain different shapes of baseline wandering which cannot be possible to remove by conventional filtering concept. To meet the challenge, in this paper we have proposed a baseline wandering removal technique based on baseline wandering path finding (BWPF) algorithm. This BWPF algorithm works by piecewise polynomial fitting. In this paper, the impact of this algorithm on wandered ECG signal is discussed elaborately with graphical interpretations. In addition, it is also shown that why this algorithm works better than the conventional polynomial baseline wandering removing technique.",
