            "title": "Crowdsourcing Upon Learning: Energy-Aware Dispatch With Guarantee for Video Analytics",
            "abstract": "Over the last decade, the mobile crowdsourcing has become a paradigm to conduct the manual annotation and further analytics by recruited workers, with their rewards depending on the result quality. Existing dispatchers cannot precisely capture the resource-quality trade-off for video analytics, because the configurations supported by recruited workers are limited, and workers\u2019 availability changes over time. To determine the most suitable configurations as well as workers for video analytics, we formulate a non-linear mixed program in long term, maximizing the crowdsourcing profit. Based on previous results under various configurations and workers, we design an algorithm via a series of subproblems to decide the configurations adaptively upon the prediction of workers\u2019 feedbacks. Such prediction is based on volatile multi-armed bandit to capture workers\u2019 availability and stochastic changes on resource uses. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithms to the multi-worker selection scenario where the platform needs to determine a candidate worker set instead of a single worker for video analytics. Via rigorous proof, the regret is ensured upon the Lyapunov optimization and the bandit, measuring the gap between the online decisions and the offline optimum. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that our proposed algorithm improves the profit by 37% compared with other algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Human mobility forecasting is the key to energizing considerable mobile computing services. However, we find that the collective mobility suffers the spatiotemporal heterogeneity issue and therefore leads to inferior performances of conventional homogeneous aggregations. Given two fundamental factors, i.e., data and objectives in machine learning, we propose to counter such heterogeneity by improving data utilization and optimization objectives. 1) From data utilization perspective, we discover that such heterogeneity is inherently induced by mobility-related context factors and thus these factors can be exploited to learn heterogeneous mobility patterns. 2) From the optimization perspective, the dependencies among output elements, which give another prior to learning, can extract heterogeneous correlations within output sequences. Specifically, we propose a novel Context-Directional SpatioTemporal Graph Network (CD-STGNet), which tackles the above-mentioned heterogeneity, for achieving accurate mobility predictions. First, we improve data utilization by inputting the encoded context-wise interactions to a direction field learner, which realizes directional spatial aggregations. Second, regarding series learning and optimization objectives, a context-trend highway is designed to enable context-aware temporal learning while two regularization objectives are proposed to keep the correlations among predicted elements consistent with the ground-truth. Experiments demonstrate that CD-STGNet surpasses competitive baselines by 13% to 22% and boosts the interpretability of context-directional learning.",

            "abstract": "The usage of live streaming services has led to a substantial increase in live video traffic. However, the perceived quality of experience of users is frequently limited by variations in the upstream bandwidth of streamers. To address this issue, several adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms have been developed to mitigate bandwidth variations. Nevertheless, the ability of users to enjoy high-quality live streams remains limited. While neural-enhanced approaches, such as super-resolution, offer significant quality improvements, frame-oriented super-resolution leads to excessive inference delay that violates the real-time feature of live streaming. In response, we propose ViChaser, which examines block-oriented super-resolution for live streaming. ViChaser performs neural super-resolution on potential blocks of interest in the media server, corresponding to the user\u2019s viewpoint, and uses online learning to adapt to the dynamic content of the video. Additionally, ViChaser utilizes the Lyapunov framework to efficiently allocate uplink bandwidth for original low-quality live video and high-quality labels. The experimental results demonstrate that ViChaser achieves 1.2\u20131.5 dB higher video quality in Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio than WebRTC and increases processing speed by 11\u201316 fps relative to LiveNAS.",

            "abstract": "In high-mobility wireless communication scenarios, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is a promising two-dimensional (2D) modulation scheme that can efficiently represent the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel using only a few parameters. However, fractional delay and/or fractional Doppler reduce the channel\u2019s sparsity, thus increasing the difficulty in channel estimation. Off-grid methods are previously utilized to estimate the fractional delay-Doppler channels, based on the expectation-maximization sparse Bayesian learning (EMSBL). However, these methods require matrix inversion in each iteration which results in significant computational complexity. To reduce the complexity, this paper proposes a low-complexity off-grid channel estimation scheme by employing a recently introduced efficient sparse Bayesian learning (ESBL). Additionally, a strategy for updating the off-grid parameters is adopted, further reducing the complexity of off-grid channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to existing channel estimation schemes in the doubly fractional scenarios, at a slight tolerable loss in channel estimation performance.",

            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.",

We then elaborate the limitations of using standard benchmarks such as TPC-C and YCSB to resemble these workloads. To overcome these limitations, we devise a learning-based I/O workload benchmark called CDS-Ben. We demonstrate the superiority of CDSBen by deploying it at ByteDance and showing that its generated I/O traces accurately resemble the real I/O traces in production. Additionally, we verify the accuracy and flexibility of CDSBen by generating a wide range of I/O workloads with different I/O characteristics.",

Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the most popular method for STG forecasting, but they often struggle with temporal out-of-distribution (OoD) issues and dynamic spatial causation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called CaST to tackle these two challenges via causal treatments. Concretely, leveraging a causal lens, we first build a structural causal model to decipher the data generation process of STGs. To handle the temporal OoD issue, we employ the back-door adjustment by a novel disentanglement block to separate invariant parts and temporal environments from input data. Moreover, we utilize the front-door adjustment and adopt the Hodge-Laplacian operator for edge-level convolution to model the ripple effect of causation. Experiments results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CaST, which consistently outperforms existing methods with good interpretability.",

            "abstract": "Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is a promising technique for high mobility wireless communications, as it approaches a sparse representation of doubly-selective fading channel and can obtain delay-Doppler (DD) diversity gain. However, in practical OTFS systems, fractional channel parameter is a great challenge and will seriously deteriorates the sparsity and the performance of channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation scheme for doubly selective channel in the presence of both fractional Doppler and fractional delay. First, we analyze the input-output relationship of single-input single-output (SISO) OTFS system based on the integer sampling DD grid, then extend it to the fractional DD grid. Compared with the integer DD domain, the model in the fractional DD domain is sparser and more accurate. Based on our analysis, two kinds of off-grid models, i.e., doubly fractional model and mixed one- and two-dimensional (1&2D) fractional models are proposed and compared. The mixed 1&2D fractional model has an advantage of low complexity, but encounters a tandem off-grid distortion. To tackle this distortion problem, as well as to balance the accuracy and the computational workload, a novel two dimensional off-grid decomposition and combination scheme is proposed based on the doubly and mixed 1&2D fractional model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed channel estimation schemes, compared with the existing work for OTFS systems under doubly selective channels.",

            "abstract": "Mobile devices with limited resources are prevalent as they have a relatively low price. Providing a good user experience with limited resources has been a big challenge. This paper found that foreground applications are often unexpectedly interfered by background applications' memory activities. Improving user experience on resource-limited mobile devices calls for a strong collaboration between memory and process management. This paper proposes a framework, Ice, to optimize the user experience on resource-limited mobile devices. With Ice, processes that will cause frequent refaults in the background are identified and frozen accordingly. The frozen application will be thawed when memory condition allows. Evaluation of resource-limited mobile devices demonstrates that the user experience is effectively improved with Ice. Specifically, Ice boosts the frame rate by 1.57x on average over the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "Relational databases have gone through a phase of architectural transition from a monolithic to a distributed architecture to take full advantage of cloud technology. These distributed databases can leverage remote storage to maintain larger amounts of data than monolithic databases at the cost of increased latency. At ByteDance, we have built a distributed database called veDB based on the popular compute-storage separation architecture, however we have observed the system is unable to provide both low latency and high throughput required by some business critical applications, such as batched order processing.In this paper we present our novel approaches to tackle this problem. We have modified our system\u2019s storage to utilize persistent memory (PMem) coupled with a remote direct memory access (RDMA) network to reduce read/write latency and increase the throughput. We also propose a query push-down framework to push partial computations to the PMem storage layer to accelerate analytical queries and reduce the impact of the transaction workload in the computation layer. Our experiments show that our methods improve the throughput by up to 1.5\u00d7 and reduce latency by up to 20\u00d7 for standard benchmarks and real-world applications.",
