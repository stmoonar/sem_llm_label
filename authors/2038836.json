            "title": "Adaptive Test Recommendation for Mastery Learning",
            "abstract": "We tackle the problem of recommending tests to learners to achieve upskilling. Our work is grounded in two learning theories: mastery learning, an instructional strategy that guides learners by providing them tests of increasing difficulty, reviewing their test results, and iterating until they reach a level of mastery; Flow Theory, which identifies different test zones, frustration, learnable, flow and boredom zones, to determine the best k tests to recommend to a learner. We formalize the AdUp Problem and develop a multi-objective optimization solution that adapts the difficulty of recommended tests to the learner's predicted performance, aptitude, and skill gap. We leverage existing models to simulate learner behavior and run experiments to demonstrate that our formalization is best to attain skill mastery. We discuss open research directions including the applicability of reinforcement learning and the recommendation of peers in collaborative projects.",

            "abstract": "APIs allow companies to export, via the Internet, their skills and know-how, or even to open up new markets and new media for sale. But to fully exploit the advantages of these services, customers, mainly developers, must be equipped with tools giving the possibility of being able to assemble different services together. Fortunately, the notion of service composition is quite advanced, and different tools exist to compose services. However, as APIs with similar functionality are expected to be provided by competing providers, the key challenge is to find the most relevant compositions. This issue has been addressed in the context of QoS-based composite service selection. The downside, in practice, customers choose services based on the number of call limits. In this paper, we propose an approach to select the most relevant compositions based on the notion of call limit. Specifically, we show how the call limits of the individual services can be aggregated to obtain the call limits of a given composition. Then, we introduce the notion of minimal budget skyline, which comprises the most interesting compositions that fit within the customer's budget. In addition, we develop two algorithms, based on effective pruning strategies, to efficiently compute the minimal budget skyline. Finally, we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Diversity in recommendation has been studied extensively. It has been shown that maximizing diversity subject to constrained relevance yields high user engagement over time. Existing work largely relies on setting some attributes that are used to craft an item similarity function and diversify results. In this paper, we examine the question of learning diversity attributes. That is particularly important when users receive recommendations over multiple sessions. We devise two main approaches to look for the best diversity attribute in each session: the first is a generalization of traditional diversity algorithms and the second is based on reinforcement learning. We implement both approaches and run extensive experiments on a semi-synthetic dataset. Our results demonstrate that learning diversity attributes yields a higher overall diversity than traditional diversity algorithms. We also find that training policies using reinforcement learning is more efficient in terms of response time, in particular for high dimensional data.",

            "abstract": "We tackle the longstanding question of checking hypotheses on the social Web. In particular, we address the challenges that arise in the context of testing an input hypothesis on many data samples, in our case, user groups. This is referred to as Multiple Hypothesis Testing, a method of choice for data-driven discoveries. Ensuring sound discoveries in large datasets poses two challenges: the likelihood of accepting a hypothesis by chance, i.e., returning false discoveries, and the pitfall of not being representative of the input data. We develop GroupTest, a framework for group testing that addresses both challenges. We formulate CoverTest, a generic top-n problem that seeks n user groups satisfying one-sample, two-sample, or multiple-sample tests, and maximizing data coverage. We show the hardness of CoverTest and develop a greedy algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee as well as a faster heuristic-based algorithm based on \u03b1-investing. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the necessity to optimize coverage for sound data-driven discoveries, and the efficiency of our heuristic-based algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Despite the proliferation of recommendation algorithms, the question of which recommender works best for which user-item instance remains widely open. In this paper, we develop a meta-learning approach that chooses among several recommendation algorithms, which one is best suited for predicting the preference of a user for an item. We propose an empirical investigation of the meta-learner when applied to implicit and explicit datasets. The meta-learner is trained using four classifiers/regressors: logistic regression, decision trees, stochastic gradient descent, and gradient boosting. We run extensive experiments on four real datasets: RETAIL, a proprietary implicit dataset provided by our industrial partner, TAFENG, a publicly available grocery shopping dataset and two publicly available AMAZON datasets with explicit preferences. Results show that using a meta-learner yields higher accuracy than single recommendation algorithms for explicit datasets when compared to state-of-the-art ensemble-learned models and factorization machines. This work is an ongoing collaboration with the marketing department of a major industrial partner to test promotional offers for different customer segments.",

Our study aims to compare representative collaborative filtering approaches in practice and study the ones yielding the highest recommendation accuracy, with respect to well-established evaluation measures. These experiments are part of the development of a promotional offers campaign for TOTAL customers owning a loyalty card. We show how different settings for training and applying the selected algorithms influence their absolute and relative performances. The results are valuable to our TOTAL partners as they constitute the first large-scale analysis of recommendation algorithms in the context of their datasets. In particular, the study of the impact of recency in the training set and the role of customer activity and of context in recommendation shed light on a finer design of promotional product campaigns.",

Our formulation goes beyond traditional recommendations by capturing two conflicting objectives: utility that serves customers\u2019 interests, and profit margin, a business-oriented goal. To satisfy the needs of our business partners, we formulate a new problem, namely generating a result containing all sets of k products such that there does not exist any other set of k products that dominates the returned sets, i.e., whose cumulative values for each objective is higher than a set of k products in the result. We study properties of k-Pareto sets that enable us to reduce the number of candidates, as well as the number of dominance tests between candidate sets. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that leverages those properties to prune the space of solutions. We generalize traditional measures of recommendation accuracy to be applicable to sets of k products. Our experiments on a large set of real customer transactions validate the need for a bi-objective optimization to reconcile customer and business interests, and the scalability of our solution.",

In this paper, we present a recommender system for mobile devices that (1) adapts to the users profiles and (2) is sensitive to their context (location, time, expertise, etc.). Our system aims to improve the visitors' experience and help them build their tours on-site according to their preferences and constraints. We first describe our recommendation framework, which consists in a hybrid recommendation system. It combines a semantic approach for the representation of museum domain using ontologies and thesauruses with a semantically-enhanced collaborative filtering method. Then, we present a contextual post filtering that enables the generation of a highly personalized tour based on the physical environment, the location of the visitors and the time they want to spend in the museum.",
