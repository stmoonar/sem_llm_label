            "abstract": "We present an overview of CheckThat! Lab\u2019s 2024 Task 3, which focuses on detecting 23 persuasion techniques at the text-span level in online media. The task covers five languages, namely, Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Portuguese, and Slovene, and highly-debated topics in the media, e.g., the Isreali\u2013Palestian conflict, the Russia\u2013 Ukraine war, climate change, COVID-19, abortion, etc. A total of 23 teams registered for the task, and two of them submitted system responses which were compared against a baseline and a task organizers\u2019 system, which used a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. We provide a description of the dataset and the overall task setup, including the evaluation methodology, and an overview of the participating systems. The datasets accompanied with the evaluation scripts are released to the research community, which we believe will foster research on persuasion technique detection and analysis of online media content in various fields and contexts.",

            "abstract": "We systematically explore the predictive power of features derived from Persuasion Techniques detected in texts, for solving different tasks of interest for media analysis; notably: detecting mis/disinformation, fake news, propaganda, partisan news and conspiracy theories. Firstly, we propose a set of meaningful features, aiming to capture the persuasiveness of a text. Secondly, we assess the discriminatory power of these features in different text classification tasks on 8 selected datasets from the literature using two metrics. We also evaluate the per-task discriminatory power of each Persuasion Technique and report on different insights. We find out that most of these features have a noticeable potential to distinguish conspiracy theories, hyperpartisan news and propaganda, while we observed mixed results in the context of fake news detection.",

We highlight the techniques that appear to be difficult for humans to annotate and elaborate on our findings on the causes of this phenomenon. We introduce Holistic IAA, a new word embedding-based annotator agreement metric and we report on various experiments using this metric and its correlation with the traditional Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) metrics. However, given somewhat limited and loose interaction between annotators, i.e., only a few annotators annotate the same document subsets, we try to devise a way to assess the coherence of the entire dataset and strive to find a good proxy for IAA between an-notators tasked to annotate different documents and in different languages, for which classical IAA metrics can not be applied.",

Secondly, we compare the difference in performance of a learned dictionary and of a dictionary designed by experts in the field of values.Our findings surprisingly show that transformers perform on par with a dictionary containing less than 1k words, when evaluated with 19 fine-grained categories, and only outperform a dictionary-based approach in a coarse setting with 10 categories.Interestingly, the expert dictionary has a precision on par with the learned one, while its recall is clearly lower, potentially an indication of overfitting of topics to values in the shared task\u2019s dataset.Our findings should be of interest to both the NLP and Value scientific communities on the use of automated approaches for value classification",

            "abstract": "In order to address the growing need of monitoring climate-change denial narratives in online sources, NLP-based methods have the potential to automate this process. Here, we report on preliminary experiments of exploiting Data Augmentation techniques for improving climate change denial classification. We focus on a selection of both known techniques, and augmentation transformations not reported elsewhere that replace certain type of named entities with high probability of preserving labels. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset consisting of text snippets extracted from online news labeled with fine-grained climate change denial types.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first ever publicly available annotated dataset for sentiment classification and semantic polarity dictionary for Georgian. The characteristics of these resources and the process of their creation are described in detail. The results of various experiments on the performance of both lexicon- and machine learning-based models for Georgian sentiment classification are also reported. Both 3-label (positive, neutral, negative) and 4-label settings (same labels + mixed) are considered. The machine learning models explored include, i.a., logistic regression, SVMs, and transformed-based models. We also explore transfer learning- and translation-based (to a well-supported language) approaches. The obtained results for Georgian are on par with the state-of-the-art results in sentiment classification for well studied languages when using training data of comparable size.",
