            "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is crucial in many sectors, including computer vision. However, ML models trained on sensitive data face security challenges, as they can be attacked and leak information. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this by using Differential Privacy (DP) to balance utility and privacy. This study identifies image dataset characteristics that affect the utility and vulnerability of private and non-private Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Through analyzing multiple datasets and privacy budgets, we find that imbalanced datasets increase vulnerability in minority classes, but DP mitigates this issue. Datasets with fewer classes improve both model utility and privacy, while high entropy or low Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) datasets deteriorate the utility-privacy trade-off. These insights offer valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers in estimating and optimizing the utility-privacy trade-off in image datasets, helping to inform data and privacy modifications for better outcomes based on dataset characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Cluster repair methods aim to determine errors in clusters and modify them so that each cluster consists of records representing the same entity. Current cluster repair methodologies primarily assume duplicate-free data sources, where each record from one source corresponds to a unique record from another. However, real-world data often deviates from this assumption due to quality issues. Recent approaches apply clustering methods in combination with link categorization methods so they can be applied to data sources with duplicates. Nevertheless, the results do not show a clear picture since the quality highly varies depending on the configuration and dataset. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for cluster repair that utilizes graph metrics derived from the underlying similarity graphs. These metrics are pivotal in constructing a classification model to distinguish between correct and incorrect edges. To address the challenge of limited training data, we integrate an active learning mechanism tailored to cluster-specific attributes. The evaluation shows that the method outperforms existing cluster repair methods without distinguishing between duplicate-free or dirty data sources. Notably, our modified active learning strategy exhibits enhanced performance when dealing with datasets containing duplicates, showcasing its effectiveness in such scenarios.",

However, such medical data often comprise sensitive personal information and are resource-intensive to acquire for research purposes. In response to this challenge, we introduce the privacy-aware synthetization of multi-sensor smartwatch health readings related to moments of stress, employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Differential Privacy (DP) safeguards. Our method not only protects patient information but also enhances data availability for research. To ensure its usefulness, we test synthetic data from multiple GANs and employ different data enhancement strategies on an actual stress detection task. Our GAN-based augmentation methods demonstrate significant improvements in model performance, with private DP training scenarios observing an 11.90\u201315.48% increase in F1-score, while non-private training scenarios still see a 0.45% boost. These results underline the potential of differentially private synthetic data in optimizing utility\u2013privacy trade-offs, especially with the limited availability of real training samples. Through rigorous quality assessments, we confirm the integrity and plausibility of our synthetic data, which, however, are significantly impacted when increasing privacy requirements.",

            "abstract": "Record linkage is the task of identifying records from different databases that refer to the same real-world entity. This task is an essential component of data integration to facilitate data analysis in a variety of domains, including healthcare, national security, and e-commerce. To evaluate the quality of record linkage approaches, the performance measures of precision, recall, and F-measure are commonly used. These measures require ground truth data that specifies known matches and non-matches. However, in practical linkage applications there typically is no such ground truth data available. Although linkage quality can be assessed manually by domain experts, such a clerical review process is time-and resource-consuming and generally not feasible when linking databases that are very large or that contain sensitive (personal) data. We review existing and propose improved unsupervised approaches for estimating the quality of linkage re-sults. We evaluate our approaches on multiple datasets from three different domains. This evaluation shows that our approaches outperform existing methods and lead to estimates that are close to the actual linkage quality.",

            "abstract": ": In contrast to privacy attacks focussing on individuals in a training dataset (e.g., membership inference), Property Inference Attacks (PIAs) are aimed at extracting population-level properties from trained Machine Learning (ML) models. These sensitive properties are often based on ratios, such as the ratio of male to female records in a dataset. If a company has trained an ML model on customer data, a PIA could for example reveal the demographics of their customer base to a competitor, compromising a potential trade secret. For ratio-based properties, inferring over a continuous range using regression is more natural than classification. We therefore extend previous white-box and black-box attacks by modelling property inference as a regression problem. For the black-box attack we further reduce prior assumptions by using an arbitrary attack dataset, independent from a target model\u2019s training data. We conduct experiments on three datasets for both white-box and black-box scenarios, indicating promising adversary performances in each scenario with a test R\u00b2 between 0.6 and 0.86. We then present a new defense mechanism based on adversarial training that successfully inhibits our black-box attacks. This mechanism proves to be effective in reducing the adversary\u2019s R\u00b2 from 0.63 to 0.07 and induces practically no utility loss, with the accuracy of target models dropping by no more than 0.2 percentage points.",

In this work, we propose Seraph, a Cypher-based language supporting native streaming features within industry-ready property graph query languages. We formally define the Seraph semantics by combining stream processing with property graphs and time-varying relations while treating time as a first-class citizen of the underlying semantics, thus laying a formal foundation necessary for future implementations.
