            "abstract": "We present a method enabling the scaling of NeRFs to learn a large number of semantically-similar scenes. We combine two techniques to improve the required training time and memory cost per scene. First, we learn a 3D-aware latent space in which we train Tri-Plane scene representations, hence reducing the resolution at which scenes are learned. Moreover, we present a way to share common information across scenes, hence allowing for a reduction of model complexity to learn a particular scene. Our method reduces effective per-scene memory costs by 44% and per-scene time costs by 86% when training 1000 scenes. Our project page can be found at https://3da-ae.github.io .",

However, a less explored area is the one of 3D model generation, with a lot of potential applications to game design, video production, and physical product design. In our paper, we present 3DGEN, a model that leverages the recent work on both Neural Radiance Fields for object reconstruction and GAN-based image generation. We show that the proposed architecture can generate plausible meshes for objects of the same category as the training images and compare the resulting meshes with the state-of-the-art baselines, leading to visible uplifts in generation quality.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems make algorithmic decisions about what will be shown to whom, billions of times every day across the web. These decisions have consequences that can often be far-reaching. Indeed, users that are exposed to certain items, might be convinced to explore interests that are novel to them. At the same time, exposure is often linked to economic incentives for the item producer, which platform-level metrics will be impacted by as well. Feedback loops in existing systems also imply that algorithmic decisions made by the model itself, have an impact on the data future model iterations will be trained and evaluated on. The literature on the intersection of recommender systems, and causal or counterfactual inference, is often focused on short-term, user-focused metrics. Nevertheless, as algorithmic consequences influence many stakeholders, it is our belief that a broader holistic view of the problem can lead to an improved understanding of these systems that touch upon many people\u2019s daily lives. The 2nd edition of the CONSEQUENCES workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in this research topic, and wish to help shape its future.",

However, both contribute significantly to user satisfaction, underpinning our assumption that it relies on both an item's relevance and its presentation, particularly in the case of visual creatives. In response, we introduce the task of {\\itshape Generative Creative Optimization (GCO)}, which proposes the use of generative models for creative generation that incorporate user interests, and {\\itshape AdBooster}, a model for personalized ad creatives based on the Stable Diffusion outpainting architecture. This model uniquely incorporates user interests both during fine-tuning and at generation time. To further improve AdBooster's performance, we also introduce an automated data augmentation pipeline. Through our experiments on simulated data, we validate AdBooster's effectiveness in generating more relevant creatives than default product images, showing its potential of enhancing user engagement.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are more and more often modelled as repeated decision making processes \u2013 deciding which (ranking of) items to recommend to a given user. Each decision to recommend or rank an item has a significant impact on immediate and future user responses, long-term satisfaction or engagement with the system, and possibly valuable exposure for the item provider. This interactive and interventionist view of the recommender uncovers a plethora of unanswered research questions, as it complicates the typically adopted offline evaluation or learning procedures in the field. We need an understanding of causal inference to reason about (possibly unintended) consequences of the recommender, and a notion of counterfactuals to answer common \u201cwhat if\u201d-type questions in learning and evaluation. Advances at the intersection of these fields can foster progress in effective, efficient and fair learning and evaluation from logged data. These topics have been emerging in the Recommender Systems community for a while, but we firmly believe in the value of a dedicated forum and place to learn and exchange ideas. We welcome contributions from both academia and industry and bring together a growing community of researchers and practitioners interested in sequential decision making, offline evaluation, batch policy learning, fairness in online platforms, as well as other related tasks, such as A/B testing.",

Furthermore, to better account for the commercial nature of the recommendation, we unify the retailer and shoppers' contradictory objectives into a single welfare metric, which we propose as a new recommendation goal. We test our framework on synthetic data and show its performance in a wide range of scenarios.

The combination of deep learning stacks with fast maximum inner product search (MIPS) algorithms have shown it is possible to deploy flexible models in production that can rapidly deliver personalized recommendations to users. Albeit promising, this methodology is unfortunately not sufficient to build a recommender system which maximizes the reward, e.g. the probability of click.

            "abstract": "Both in academic and industry-based research, online evaluation methods are seen as the golden standard for interactive applications like recommendation systems. Naturally, the reason for this is that we can directly measure utility metrics that rely on interventions, being the recommendations that are being shown to users. Nevertheless, online evaluation methods are costly for a number of reasons, and a clear need remains for reliable offline evaluation procedures. In industry, offline metrics are often used as a first-line evaluation to generate promising candidate models to evaluate online. In academic work, limited access to online systems makes offline metrics the de facto approach to validating novel methods. Two classes of offline metrics exist: proxy-based methods, and counterfactual methods. The first class is often poorly correlated with the online metrics we care about, and the latter class only provides theoretical guarantees under assumptions that cannot be fulfilled in real-world environments. Here, we make the case that simulation-based comparisons provide ways forward beyond offline metrics, and argue that they are a preferable means of evaluation.",
