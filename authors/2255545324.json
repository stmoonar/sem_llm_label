            "abstract": "Multivariate time series find extensive applications in conjunction with machine learning methodologies for scenario forecasting across various domains. Nevertheless, certain domains exhibit inherent complexities and diversities, which detrimentally impact the predictive efficacy of global models. This ongoing study introduces a Subset Modeling Framework designed to acknowledge the inherent diversity within a domain\u2019s multivariate space. Comparative assessments between subset models and global models are conducted in terms of performance, revealing compelling findings and suggesting the potential for further exploration and refinement of this novel framework.",

            "abstract": "The success of machine learning (ML) systems depends on data availability, volume, quality, and efficient computing resources. A challenge in this context is to reduce computational costs while maintaining adequate accuracy of the models. This paper presents a framework to address this challenge. The idea is to identify \u201csubdomains\u201d within the input space, train local models that produce better predictions for samples from that specific subdomain, instead of training a single global model on the full dataset. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets. Our results indicate that subset modelling (i) improves the predictive performance compared to a single global model and (ii) allows data-efficient training.",
