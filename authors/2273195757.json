            "title": "Efficient Time-Series Clustering through Sparse Gaussian Modeling",
            "abstract": "In this work, we consider the problem of shape-based time-series clustering with the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. We present a novel two-stage framework based on Sparse Gaussian Modeling. In the first stage, we apply Sparse Gaussian Process Regression and obtain a sparse representation of each time series in the dataset with a logarithmic (in the original length T) number of inducing data points. In the second stage, we apply k-means with DTW Barycentric Averaging (DBA) to the sparsified dataset using a generalization of DTW, which accounts for the fact that each inducing point serves as a representative of many original data points. The asymptotic running time of our Sparse Time-Series Clustering framework is \u03a9(T2/log2T) times faster than the running time of applying k-means to the original dataset because sparsification reduces the running time of DTW from \u0398(T2) to \u0398(log2T). Moreover, sparsification tends to smoothen outliers and particularly noisy parts of the original time series. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation using datasets from the UCR Time-Series Classification Archive, showing that the quality of clustering computed by our Sparse Time-Series Clustering framework is comparable to the clustering computed by the standard k-means algorithm.",

            "title": "On the Distortion of Committee Election with 1-Euclidean Preferences and Few Distance Queries",
            "abstract": "We consider committee election of $k \\geq 2$ (out of $m \\geq k+1$) candidates, where the voters and the candidates are associated with locations on the real line. Each voter's cardinal preferences over candidates correspond to her distance to the candidate locations, and each voter's cardinal preferences over committees is defined as her distance to the nearest candidate elected in the committee. We consider a setting where the true distances and the locations are unknown. We can nevertheless have access to degraded information which consists of an order of candidates for each voter. We investigate the best possible distortion (a worst-case performance criterion) wrt. the social cost achieved by deterministic committee election rules based on ordinal preferences submitted by $n$ voters and few additional distance queries. For $k = 2$, we achieve bounded distortion without any distance queries; we show that the distortion is $3$ for $m = 3$, and that the best possible distortion achieved by deterministic algorithms is at least $n-1$ and at most $n+1$, for any $m \\geq 4$. For any $k \\geq 3$, we show that the best possible distortion of any deterministic algorithm that uses at most $k-3$ distance queries cannot be bounded by any function of $n$, $m$ and $k$. We present deterministic algorithms for $k$-committee election with distortion of $O(n)$ with $O(k)$ distance queries and $O(1)$ with $O(k \\log n)$ distance queries.",

            "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations have emerged as an important tool to understand, debug, and audit complex machine learning models. To offer global counterfactual explainability, state-of-the-art methods construct summaries of local explanations, offering a trade-off among conciseness, counterfactual effectiveness, and counterfactual cost or burden imposed on instances. In this work, we provide a concise formulation of the problem of identifying global counterfactuals and establish principled criteria for comparing solutions, drawing inspiration from Pareto dominance. We introduce innovative algorithms designed to address the challenge of finding global counterfactuals for either the entire input space or specific partitions, employing clustering and decision trees as key components. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, considering various instances of the problem and comparing our proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the consistent capability of our algorithms to generate meaningful and interpretable global counterfactual explanations.",

            "abstract": "There has been great interest in fairness in machine learning, especially in relation to classification problems. In ranking-related problems, such as in online advertising, recommender systems, and HR automation, much work on fairness remains to be done. Two complications arise: first, the protected attribute may not be available in many applications. Second, there are multiple measures of fairness of rankings, and optimization-based methods utilizing a single measure of fairness of rankings may produce rankings that are unfair with respect to other measures. In this work, we propose a randomized method for post-processing rankings, which do not require the availability of the protected attribute. In an extensive numerical study, we show the robustness of our methods with respect to P-Fairness and effectiveness with respect to Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) from the baseline ranking, improving on previously proposed methods.",

            "abstract": "The performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) deteriorates as the depth of the network increases. That performance drop is mainly attributed to over-smoothing, which leads to similar node representations through repeated graph convolutions. We show that in deep GNNs the activation function plays a crucial role in oversmoothing. We explain theoretically why this is the case and propose a simple modification to the slope of ReLU to reduce oversmoothing. The proposed approach enables deep architectures without the need to change the network architecture or to add residual connections. We verify the theoretical results experimentally and further show that deep networks, which do not suffer from over-smoothing, are beneficial in the presence of the \u201ccold start\u201d problem, i",
