            "abstract": "Abstract The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) underwent a focused review of assay term annotations, logic and hierarchy with a goal to improve and standardize these terms. As a result, inconsistencies in W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) expressions were identified and corrected, and additionally, standardized design patterns and a formalized template to maintain them were developed. We describe here this informative and productive process to describe the specific benefits and obstacles for OBI and the universal lessons for similar projects.",

            "abstract": "Immunoinformatics is a discipline that applies methods of computer science to study and model the immune system. A fundamental question addressed by immunoinformatics is how to understand the rules of antigen presentation by MHC molecules to T cells, a process that is central to adaptive immune responses to infections and cancer. In the modern era of personalized medicine, the ability to model and predict which antigens can be presented by MHC is key to manipulating the immune system and designing strategies for therapeutic intervention. Since the MHC is both polygenic and extremely polymorphic, each individual possesses a personalized set of MHC molecules with different peptide-binding specificities, and collectively they present a unique individualized peptide imprint of the ongoing protein metabolism. Mapping all MHC allotypes is an enormous undertaking that cannot be achieved without a strong bioinformatics component. Computational tools for the prediction of peptide-MHC binding have thus become essential in most pipelines for T cell epitope discovery and an inescapable component of vaccine and cancer research. Here, we describe the development of several such tools, from pioneering efforts to the current state-of-the-art methods, that have allowed for accurate predictions of peptide binding of all MHC molecules, even including those that have not yet been characterized experimentally.",

            "title": "Benchmarking predictions of MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes",
            "abstract": "T cell epitope candidates are commonly identified using computational prediction tools in order to enable applications such as vaccine design, cancer neoantigen identification, development of diagnostics and removal of unwanted immune responses against protein therapeutics. Most T cell epitope prediction tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data. The ability of currently available tools to predict T cell epitopes has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we used a recently published dataset that systematically defined T cell epitopes recognized in vaccinia virus (VACV) infected mice, considering both peptides predicted to bind MHC or experimentally eluted from infected cells, making this the most comprehensive dataset of T cell epitopes mapped in a complex pathogen. We evaluated the performance of all currently publicly available computational T cell epitope prediction tools to identify these major epitopes from all peptides encoded in the VACV proteome. We found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). Impressively, these methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top 0.04% (N = 277) of peptides in the VACV proteome (N = 767,788). These performance metrics provide guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use. In addition, this benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools. Author summary Computational prediction tools are used to screen peptides to identify potential T cell epitope candidates. These tools, developed using machine learning methods, save time and resources in many immunological studies including vaccine discovery and cancer neoantigen identification. In addition to the already existing methods several epitope prediction tools are being developed these days but they lack a comprehensive and uniform evaluation to see which method performs best. In this study we did a comprehensive evaluation of publicly accessible MHC I restricted T cell epitope prediction tools using a recently published dataset of Vaccinia virus epitopes. We found that methods based on artificial neural network architecture and trained on both MHC binding and ligand elution data showed very high performance (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). This benchmark analysis will help immunologists to choose the right prediction method for their desired work and will also serve as a framework for tool developers to evaluate new prediction methods.",

            "abstract": "Research in computational biology has given rise to a vast number of methods developed to solve scientific problems. For areas in which many approaches exist, researchers have a hard time deciding which tool to select to address a scientific challenge, as essentially all publications introducing a new method will claim better performance than all others. Not all of these claims can be correct. Equally, for this same reason, developers struggle to demonstrate convincingly that they created a new and superior algorithm or implementation. Moreover, the developer community often has difficulty discerning which new approaches constitute true scientific advances for the field. The obvious answer to this conundrum is to develop benchmarks\u2014meaning standard points of reference that facilitate evaluating the performance of different tools\u2014allowing both users and developers to compare multiple tools in an unbiased fashion.",

            "abstract": "Gene-set analysis (GSA) summarizes information from molecule to gene-set level to facilitate biological interpretation of molecular profiling experiments. We present a statistical framework for single sample GSA of multiple 'omic data. MOGSA learns the most variant biomolecules and integrates data sets to generate gene set scores (GSS) for each sample. It extracts the contribution of individual data sets and biomolecules to GSS. MOGSA is rigorously benchmarked with simulated and real biological data and is implemented in the Bioconductor package \u201cmogsa.\u201d Graphical Abstract Highlights MOGSA is a new integrative multi 'omics single sample gene set analysis method. Integrating diverse biomolecular data increases the power to discover gene sets. MOGSA evaluates the contribution of biomolecules, samples and data sets to gene sets. The method and tutorial are available in the R/Bioconductor package mogsa. Gene-set analysis (GSA) summarizes individual molecular measurements to more interpretable pathways or gene-sets and has become an indispensable step in the interpretation of large-scale omics data. However, GSA methods are limited to the analysis of single omics data. Here, we introduce a new computation method termed multi-omics gene-set analysis (MOGSA), a multivariate single sample gene-set analysis method that integrates multiple experimental and molecular data types measured over the same set of samples. The method learns a low dimensional representation of most variant correlated features (genes, proteins, etc.) across multiple omics data sets, transforms the features onto the same scale and calculates an integrated gene-set score from the most informative features in each data type. MOGSA does not require filtering data to the intersection of features (gene IDs), therefore, all molecular features, including those that lack annotation may be included in the analysis. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that integrating multiple diverse sources of molecular data increases the power to discover subtle changes in gene-sets and may reduce the impact of unreliable information in any single data type. Using real experimental data, we demonstrate three use-cases of MOGSA. First, we show how to remove a source of noise (technical or biological) in integrative MOGSA of NCI60 transcriptome and proteome data. Second, we apply MOGSA to discover similarities and differences in mRNA, protein and phosphorylation profiles of a small study of stem cell lines and assess the influence of each data type or feature on the total gene-set score. Finally, we apply MOGSA to cluster analysis and show that three molecular subtypes are robustly discovered when copy number variation and mRNA data of 308 bladder cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are integrated using MOGSA. MOGSA is available in the Bioconductor R package \u201cmogsa.\u201d",
