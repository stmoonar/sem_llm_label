            "title": "Gender Gaps in Online Social Connectivity, Promotion and Relocation Reports on LinkedIn",
            "abstract": "Online professional social networking platforms provide opportunities to expand networks strategically for job opportunities and career advancement. A large body of research shows that women\u2019s offline networks are less advantageous than men\u2019s. How online platforms such as LinkedIn may reflect or reproduce gendered networking behaviours, or how online social connectivity may affect outcomes differentially by gender is not well understood. This paper analyses aggregate, anonymised data from almost 10 million LinkedIn users in the UK and US information technology (IT) sector collected from the site\u2019s advertising platform to explore how being connected to Big Tech companies (\u2018social connectivity\u2019) varies by gender, and how gender, age, seniority and social connectivity shape the propensity to report job promotions or relocations. Consistent with previous studies, we find there are fewer women compared to men on LinkedIn in IT. Furthermore, female users are less likely to be connected to Big Tech companies than men. However, when we further analyse recent promotion or relocation reports, we find women are more likely than men to have reported a recent promotion at work, suggesting high-achieving women may be self-selecting onto LinkedIn. Even among this positively selected group, though, we find men are more likely to report a recent relocation. Social connectivity emerges as a significant predictor of promotion and relocation reports, with an interaction effect between gender and social connectivity indicating the payoffs to social connectivity for promotion and relocation reports are larger for women. This suggests that online networking has the potential for larger impacts for women, who experience greater disadvantage in traditional networking contexts, and calls for further research to understand differential impacts of online networking for socially disadvantaged groups.",

            "title": "Examining Global Mobile Diffusion and Mobile Gender Gaps through Facebook's Advertising Data",
            "abstract": "Social media advertising data, particularly data from Facebook's advertising platform, have been successfully used for monitoring population and development indicators, with an emphasis on monitoring digital gender inequality. This paper contributes to this literature by assessing the feasibility of the attribute of user behavior of \"using a mobile device for X months\" available from Facebook's advertising platform to understand short-term global mobile diffusion dynamics and mobile phone gender gaps. We compare this attribute with other features of the platform to form a better understanding of the data and the digital behaviours they capture, and show how this Facebook attribute relates to mobile phone penetration rates and gender gaps in mobile access. We find that this \"Uses a mobile device (X months)\" advertising targeting attribute can be used as a proxy for changes in mobile phone penetration rates, especially among younger users, and that it captures cross-national variation in mobile gender gaps. We further find that countries with larger gender gaps disfavoring women are comparatively more gender-equal among the most recently joined cohort.",

            "title": "Humans in the Loop: Incorporating Expert and Crowd-Sourced Knowledge for Predictions Using Survey Data",
            "abstract": "Survey data sets are often wider than they are long. This high ratio of variables to observations raises concerns about overfitting during prediction, making informed variable selection important. Recent applications in computer science have sought to incorporate human knowledge into machine-learning methods to address these problems. The authors implement such a \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d approach in the Fragile Families Challenge. The authors use surveys to elicit knowledge from experts and laypeople about the importance of different variables to different outcomes. This strategy offers the option to subset the data before prediction or to incorporate human knowledge as scores in prediction models, or both together. The authors find that human intervention is not obviously helpful. Human-informed subsetting reduces predictive performance, and considered alone, approaches incorporating scores perform marginally worse than approaches that do not. However, incorporating human knowledge may still improve predictive performance, and future research should consider new ways of doing so.",

            "abstract": "Improving digital literacy and reducing gender inequalities in internet access and use have been recognized as important development targets within the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tracking progress on digital gender inequalities however is challenging due to limited gender-disaggregated data, especially in less developed country contexts and at the subnational level. We show how data obtained from social media advertising APIs can be used to generate a real-time measure of digital gender inequality. Using data from the Facebook (FB) Marketing API, we document gender gaps in FB use across Indian states and examine to what extent state-level development indicators help predict these gender gaps. Higher GDP per capita, literacy and internet penetration are associated with lower gender gaps in FB presence. These state-level development predictors however are only able to explain a small proportion (7.3%) of the overall variation in gender gaps on FB. Employment-related occupational or industry characteristics from within FB emerge as important variables associated with more gender-balanced FB use.",
