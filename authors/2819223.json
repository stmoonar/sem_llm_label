            "abstract": "Abstract The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) underwent a focused review of assay term annotations, logic and hierarchy with a goal to improve and standardize these terms. As a result, inconsistencies in W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) expressions were identified and corrected, and additionally, standardized design patterns and a formalized template to maintain them were developed. We describe here this informative and productive process to describe the specific benefits and obstacles for OBI and the universal lessons for similar projects.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) is a community resource that provides an ontology of terms used to capture the type of evidence that supports biomedical annotations and assertions. Consistent capture of evidence information with ECO allows tracking of annotation provenance, establishment of quality control measures, and evidence-based data mining. ECO is in use by dozens of data repositories and resources with both specific and general areas of focus. ECO is continually being expanded and enhanced in response to user requests as well as our aim to adhere to community best-practices for ontology development. The ECO support team engages in multiple collaborations with other ontologies and annotating groups. Here we report on recent updates to the ECO ontology itself as well as associated resources that are available through this project. ECO project products are freely available for download from the project website (https://evidenceontology.org/) and GitHub (https://github.com/evidenceontology/evidenceontology). ECO is released into the public domain under a CC0 1.0 Universal license.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) provides the most comprehensive resource currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products. Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two years. The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine GO and report a 10% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer findings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5% of experimental GO annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of GO data with a consistent format and file structure for both the ontology and annotations.",

            "abstract": "Abstract High-throughput studies constitute an essential and valued source of information for researchers. However, high-throughput experimental workflows are often complex, with multiple data sets that may contain large numbers of false positives. The representation of high-throughput data in the Gene Ontology (GO) therefore presents a challenging annotation problem, when the overarching goal of GO curation is to provide the most precise view of a gene's role in biology. To address this, representatives from annotation teams within the GO Consortium reviewed high-throughput data annotation practices. We present an annotation framework for high-throughput studies that will facilitate good standards in GO curation and, through the use of new high-throughput evidence codes, increase the visibility of these annotations to the research community.",

ECO terms are used in the process of biocuration to capture the evidence that supports biological assertions (e.g. gene product X has function Y as supported by evidence Z). Capture of this information allows tracking of annotation provenance, establishment of quality control measures and query of evidence. ECO contains over 1500 terms and is in use by many leading biological resources including the Gene Ontology, UniProt and several model organism databases. ECO is continually being expanded and revised based on the needs of the biocuration community. The ontology is freely available for download from GitHub (https://github.com/evidenceontology/) or the project\u2019s website (http://evidenceontology.org/). Users can request new terms or changes to existing terms through the project\u2019s GitHub site. ECO is released into the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal.",

            "abstract": "The Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) has been developed to provide standardized descriptions for types of evidence within the biological domain. Best practices in biocuration require that when a biological assertion is made (e.g. linking a Gene Ontology (GO) term for a molecular function to a protein), the type of evidence supporting it is captured. In recent development efforts, we have been working with other ontology groups to ensure that ECO classes exist for the types of curation they support. These include the Ontology for Microbial Phenotypes and GO. In addition, we continue to support user-level class requests through our GitHub issue tracker. To facilitate the addition and maintenance of new classes, we utilize ROBOT (a command line tool for working with Open Biomedical Ontologies) as part of our standard workflow. ROBOT templates allow us to define classes in a spreadsheet and convert them to Web Ontology Language (OWL) axioms, which can then be merged into ECO. ROBOT is also part of our automated release process. Additionally, we are engaged in ongoing work to map ECO classes to Ontology for Biomedical Investigation classes using logical definitions. ECO is currently in use by dozens of groups engaged in biological curation and the number of ECO users continues to grow. The ontology, in OWL and Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) formats, and associated resources can be accessed through our GitHub site (https://github.com/evidenceontology/evidenceontology) as well as the ECO web page (http://evidenceontology.org/).

            "title": "Logical Axiomatization of the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) by Integrating External Ontology Classes",
            "abstract": "Mapping semantically equivalent classes across ontologies is a crucial step toward increasing interoperability and is necessary to enable the leveraging of existing external ontologies during ontology development. Interoperability can allow the adoption of logical design patterns, which can enhance ontology manageability, improve structural consistency, and reduce development time, in addition to facilitating knowledge discovery. The Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) began a loose collaboration, i.e. talking, in 2011. Recently, however, great strides have been made toward harmonizing these two ontologies through integrating components of OBI into ECO, i.e. creating logical definitions in ECO using imported OBI classes. As these are two orthogonal OWL ontologies, enabling such integration required creation of a logical design pattern to transform OBI classes (which define instruments, assays, etc.) into equivalent ECO evidence classes. This design pattern allows ECO to harness the expressivity of OBI in capturing complex experimental workflows that generate \u201cevidence\u201d that is cited in scientific publications. The goals of this effort are to increase consistency in the structure of ECO, facilitate further ECO and OBI development, better describe the methodologies that produce evidence, and discover new relationships between ECO evidence types. Here, we present the methods for integration and discuss this work as a model for future ontology harmonization efforts. 1 STRUCTURING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE When interpreting the findings of any scientific investigation, \u201cevidence\u201d is an important aspect to consider. What methods were employed? What types of data were generated? How were findings interpreted? Documenting aspects of the scientific methodology employed in a given study affords investigators a basis for interpreting the results. Ultimately researchers use evidence to support a variety of conclusions. In the biomedical realm, one such conclusion might be the interpretation that a protein has a particular function. Professional biocurators meticulously extract such information \u2013 about methods, evidence, and conclusions \u2013 from the scientific literature using a variety of manual and automated methods. This information is represented variously so that it can be stored at databases where it can be readily manipulated and used by researchers. 1.1 The Evidence & Conclusion Ontology The Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) systematically describes types of scientific evidence in biological research, such as evidence generated from laboratory experiments, computational methods, or statements curated from Funding acknowledgement: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) under Award Number 1458400 to MCC. literature (Fig. 1). ECO represents a range of evidence categories spanning from broad (e.g. \u2018sequence similarity evidence\u2019 or \u2018author statement evidence\u2019) to specific (e.g. \u2018sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis evidence\u2019). Evidence types, as summarized by over 800 ECO classes, become important pieces of metadata associated with annotations at databases that are used by researchers worldwide to support their investigations. Fig. 1. ECO\u2019s current highest-level evidence classes as depicted at http://evidenceontology.org/browse ECO terms, as ontology classes, contain standard definitions and synonyms and are networked with relationships. Thus, associating research data with ECO evidence terms allows bioinformatics resources to manage large volumes of annotation data by providing mechanisms for sorting, querying, and performing quality control checks. For example, UniProt-Gene Ontology Annotation (UniProt-GOA) uses ECO to support searching of more than 365 million evidence-linked GO annotations and the Gene Ontology resource itself uses ECO in support of various quality control mechanisms including annotation consistency.",

Annotations at the world's most frequented biological databases (e.g. model organisms, UniProt, Gene Ontology) are supported using ECO terms. ECO describes evidence derived from experimental and computational methods, author statements curated from the literature, inferences drawn by curators, and other types of evidence. Here, we describe recent ECO developments and collaborations, most notably: (i) a new ECO website containing user documentation, up-to-date news, and visualization tools; (ii) improvements to the ontology structure; (iii) implementing logic via an ongoing collaboration with the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI); (iv) addition of numerous experimental evidence types; and (v) addition of new evidence classes describing computationally derived evidence. Due to its utility, popularity, and simplicity, ECO is now expanding into realms beyond the protein annotation community, for example the biodiversity and phenotype communities. As ECO continues to grow as a resource, we are seeking new users and new use cases, with the hope that ECO will continue to be a broadly used and easy-to-implement community standard for representing evidence in diverse biological applications.

            "abstract": "The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an ontology that provides terms with precisely defined meanings to describe all aspects of how investigations in the biological and medical domains are conducted. OBI re-uses ontologies that provide a representation of biomedical knowledge from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) project and adds the ability to describe how this knowledge was derived. We here describe the state of OBI and several applications that are using it, such as adding semantic expressivity to existing databases, building data entry forms, and enabling interoperability between knowledge resources. OBI covers all phases of the investigation process, such as planning, execution and reporting. It represents information and material entities that participate in these processes, as well as roles and functions. Prior to OBI, it was not possible to use a single internally consistent resource that could be applied to multiple types of experiments for these applications. OBI has made this possible by creating terms for entities involved in biological and medical investigations and by importing parts of other biomedical ontologies such as GO, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and Phenotype Attribute and Trait Ontology (PATO) without altering their meaning. OBI is being used in a wide range of projects covering genomics, multi-omics, immunology, and catalogs of services. OBI has also spawned other ontologies (Information Artifact Ontology) and methods for importing parts of ontologies (Minimum information to reference an external ontology term (MIREOT)). The OBI project is an open cross-disciplinary collaborative effort, encompassing multiple research communities from around the globe. To date, OBI has created 2366 classes and 40 relations along with textual and formal definitions. The OBI Consortium maintains a web resource (http://obi-ontology.org) providing details on the people, policies, and issues being addressed in association with OBI. The current release of OBI is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl.",

            "title": "From data repositories to submission portals: rethinking the role of domain-specific databases in CollecTF",
            "abstract": "Domain-specific databases are essential resources for the biomedical community, leveraging expert knowledge to curate published literature and provide access to referenced data and knowledge. The limited scope of these databases, however, poses important challenges on their infrastructure, visibility, funding and usefulness to the broader scientific community. CollecTF is a community-oriented database documenting experimentally validated transcription factor (TF)-binding sites in the Bacteria domain. In its quest to become a community resource for the annotation of transcriptional regulatory elements in bacterial genomes, CollecTF aims to move away from the conventional data-repository paradigm of domain-specific databases. Through the adoption of well-established ontologies, identifiers and collaborations, CollecTF has progressively become also a portal for the annotation and submission of information on transcriptional regulatory elements to major biological sequence resources (RefSeq, UniProtKB and the Gene Ontology Consortium). This fundamental change in database conception capitalizes on the domain-specific knowledge of contributing communities to provide high-quality annotations, while leveraging the availability of stable information hubs to promote long-term access and provide high-visibility to the data. As a submission portal, CollecTF generates TF-binding site information through direct annotation of RefSeq genome records, definition of TF-based regulatory networks in UniProtKB entries and submission of functional annotations to the Gene Ontology. As a database, CollecTF provides enhanced search and browsing, targeted data exports, binding motif analysis tools and integration with motif discovery and search platforms. This innovative approach will allow CollecTF to focus its limited resources on the generation of high-quality information and the provision of specialized access to the data.
