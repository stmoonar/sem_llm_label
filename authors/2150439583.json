            "title": "Large-scale Urban Cellular Traffic Generation via Knowledge-Enhanced GANs with Multi-Periodic Patterns",
            "abstract": "With the rapid development of the cellular network, network planning is increasingly important. Generating large-scale urban cellular traffic contributes to network planning via simulating the behaviors of the planned network. Existing methods fail in simulating the long-term temporal behaviors of cellular traffic while cannot model the influences of the urban environment on the cellular networks. We propose a knowledge-enhanced GAN with multi-periodic patterns to generate large-scale cellular traffic based on the urban environment. First, we design a GAN model to simulate the multi-periodic patterns and long-term aperiodic temporal dynamics of cellular traffic via learning the daily patterns, weekly patterns, and residual traffic between long-term traffic and periodic patterns step by step. Then, we leverage urban knowledge to enhance traffic generation via constructing a knowledge graph containing multiple factors affecting cellular traffic in the surrounding urban environment. Finally, we evaluate our model on a real cellular traffic dataset. Our proposed model outperforms three state-of-art generation models by over 32.77%, and the urban knowledge enhancement improves the performance of our model by 4.71%. Moreover, our model achieves good generalization and robustness in generating traffic for urban cellular networks without training data in the surrounding areas.",

            "abstract": "Network traffic data facilitates understanding the Internet of Things (IoT) behaviors and improving IoT service quality in the real world. However, large-scale IoT traffic data is rarely accessible, and privacy issues also impede realistic data sharing even with anonymous personal identifiable information. Researchers propose to generate synthetic IoT traffic but fail to cover the multiple services provided by widespread real-world IoT devices. In this work, we take the first step to generate large-scale IoT traffic via a knowledge-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which introduces both the semantic knowledge (e.g., location and environment information) and the network structure knowledge for various IoT devices via a knowledge graph. We use a condition mechanism to incorporate the knowledge and device category for IoT traffic generation. Then, we adopt LSTM and a self-attention mechanism to capture the temporal correlation in the traffic series. Extensive experiment results show that the synthetic IoT traffic datasets generated by our proposed model outperform state-of-art baselines in terms of data fidelity and applications. Moreover, our proposed model is able to generate realistic data by only training on small real datasets with knowledge enhanced.",

            "title": "An Atmospheric Turbulence Compensation Algorithm Based on FSM-DM Cascaded AO Architecture for FSO Communications",
            "abstract": "Free-space optics (FSO) communication enjoys desirable modulation rates at unexploited frequency bands, however, its application is hindered by atmospheric turbulence which causes phase shifting in laser links. Although a single deformable mirror (DM) adaptive optics (AO) system is a good solution, its performance remains unsatisfactory as the proportion of tilts aberrations becomes relatively high. This condition happens when the incident angle of the laser beam for the optical receiver dynamically shifts. To tackle this problem, we introduce a fast steering mirror (FSM), DM cascaded AO architecture, based upon which we also propose an atmospheric turbulence compensation algorithm. In this paper, we compare the compensation ability of FSM and DM towards tilts aberrations. Furthermore, we gain model matrices for FSM and DM from testbed and simulatively verify the effectiveness of our work. For a Kolmogorov theory-based atmospheric turbulence disturbed incident laser beam where the tilt components take up 80% of the total proportion of wavefront aberrations, our proposed architecture compensates the input wavefront to a residual wavefront root mean square (RMS) of 116 wavelength, compared to 16 wavelength for single DM architecture. The study intends to overcome atmospheric turbulence and has the potential to guide the development of future FSO communications.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial images, while their robustness in text classification are rarely studied. Several lines of text attack methods have been proposed in the literature, such as character-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. However, it is still a challenge to minimize the number of word distortions necessary to induce misclassification, while simultaneously ensuring the lexical correctness, syntactic correctness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose the Bigram and Unigram based Monotonic Heuristic Search (BU-MHS) method to examine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has three major merits. Firstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level but also at the bigram level to avoid producing meaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input words with both their synonyms and sememe candidates, which greatly enriches potential substitutions compared to only using synonyms. Lastly, we design a search algorithm, i.e., Monotonic Heuristic Search (MHS), to determine the priority of word replacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost in an adversarial attack. We evaluate the effectiveness of BU-MHS on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by attacking four state-of-the-art DNNs models. Experimental results show that our BU-MHS achieves the highest attack success rate by changing the smallest number of words compared with other existing models.",

            "abstract": "Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are known immensely brittle towards text adversarial examples. Recent attack algorithms usually adopt word-level substitution strategies following a pre-computed word replacement mechanism. However, their resultant adversarial examples are still imperfect in achieving grammar correctness and semantic similarities, which is largely because of their unsuitable candidate word selections and static optimization methods. In this research, we propose BESA, a BERT-based Simulated Annealing algorithm, to address these two problems. Firstly, we leverage the BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) to generate contextual-aware candidate words to produce fluent adversarial text and avoid grammar errors. Secondly, we employ Simulated Annealing (SA) to adaptively determine the word substitution order. The SA provides sufficient word replacement options via internal simulations, with an objective to obtain both a high attack success rate and a low word substitution rate. Besides, our algorithm is able to jump out of local optima with a controlled probability, making it closer to achieve the best possible attack (i.e., the global optima). Experiments on five popular datasets manifest the superiority of BESA compared with existing methods, including TextFooler, BAE, BERT-Attack, PWWS, and PSO.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning models are known immensely brittle to adversarial text examples. Existing text adversarial attack strategies can be roughly divided into character-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. Despite the success brought by recent text attack methods, how to induce misclassification with minimal text modifications while keeping the lexical correctness, syntactic soundness, and semantic consistency is still a challenge. In this paper, we devise a Bigram and Unigram-based adaptive Semantic Preservation Optimization (BU-SPO) approach which attacks text documents not only at a unigram word level but also at a bigram level to avoid generating meaningless sentences. We also present a hybrid attack strategy that collects substitution words from both synonyms and sememe candidates, to enrich the potential candidate set. Besides, a Semantic Preservation Optimization (SPO) method is devised to determine the word substitution priority and reduce the perturbation cost. Furthermore, we constrain the SPO with a semantic Filter (dubbed SPOF) to improve the semantic similarity. To estimate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, BU-SPO and BU-SPOF, we attack four victim deep learning models trained on three text datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approaches accomplish the highest semantics consistency and attack success rates by making minimal word modifications compared with competitive methods.",
