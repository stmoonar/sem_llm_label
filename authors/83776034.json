            "title": "Retrieval Helps or Hurts? A Deeper Dive into the Efficacy of Retrieval Augmentation to Language Models",
            "abstract": "While large language models (LMs) demonstrate remarkable performance, they encounter challenges in providing accurate responses when queried for information beyond their pre-trained memorization. Although augmenting them with relevant external information can mitigate these issues, failure to consider the necessity of retrieval may adversely affect overall performance. Previous research has primarily focused on examining how entities influence retrieval models and knowledge recall in LMs, leaving other aspects relatively unexplored. In this work, our goal is to offer a more detailed, fact-centric analysis by exploring the effects of combinations of entities and relations. To facilitate this, we construct a new question answering (QA) dataset called WiTQA (Wikipedia Triple Question Answers). This dataset includes questions about entities and relations of various popularity levels, each accompanied by a supporting passage. Our extensive experiments with diverse LMs and retrievers reveal when retrieval does not consistently enhance LMs from the viewpoints of fact-centric popularity. Confirming earlier findings, we observe that larger LMs excel in recalling popular facts. However, they notably encounter difficulty with infrequent entity-relation pairs compared to retrievers. Interestingly, they can effectively retain popular relations of less common entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our finer-grained metric and insights through an adaptive retrieval system that selectively employs retrieval and recall based on the frequencies of entities and relations in the question.",

            "title": "A Simple and Scalable Graph Neural Network for Large Directed Graphs",
            "abstract": "Node classification is one of the hottest tasks in graph analysis. Though existing studies have explored various node representations in directed and undirected graphs, they have overlooked the distinctions of their capabilities to capture the information of graphs. To tackle the limitation, we investigate various combinations of node representations (aggregated features vs. adjacency lists) and edge direction awareness within an input graph (directed vs. undirected). We address the first empirical study to benchmark the performance of various GNNs that use either combination of node representations and edge direction awareness. Our experiments demonstrate that no single combination stably achieves state-of-the-art results across datasets, which indicates that we need to select appropriate combinations depending on the dataset characteristics. In response, we propose a simple yet holistic classification method A2DUG which leverages all combinations of node representations in directed and undirected graphs. We demonstrate that A2DUG stably performs well on various datasets and improves the accuracy up to 11.29 compared with the state-of-the-art methods. To spur the development of new methods, we publicly release our complete codebase under the MIT license.",

            "abstract": "Recently, active learning (AL) methods have been used to effectively fine-tune pre-trained language models for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and document classification. However, given the task of fine-tuning language models, understanding the impact of different aspects on AL methods such as labeling cost, sample acquisition latency, and the diversity of the datasets necessitates a deeper investigation. This paper examines the performance of existing AL methods within a low-resource, interactive labeling setting. We observe that existing methods often underperform in such a setting while exhibiting higher latency and a lack of generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel active learning method T YROGUE that employs a hybrid sampling strategy to minimize labeling cost and acquisition latency while providing a framework for adapting to dataset diversity via user guidance. Through our experiments, we observe that compared to SOTA methods, T Y - ROGUE reduces the labeling cost by up to 43% and the acquisition latency by as much as 11 X , while achieving comparable accuracy. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of T YROGUE by exploring the impact of dataset characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on a node classification task. Despite the broad interest in developing and evaluating GNNs, they have been assessed with limited benchmark datasets. As a result, the existing evaluation of GNNs lacks fine-grained analysis from various characteristics of graphs. Motivated by this, we conduct extensive experiments with a synthetic graph generator that can generate graphs having controlled characteristics for fine-grained analysis. Our empirical studies clarify the strengths and weaknesses of GNNs from four major characteristics of real-world graphs with class labels of nodes, i.e., 1) class size distributions (balanced vs. imbalanced), 2) edge connection proportions between classes (homophilic vs. heterophilic), 3) attribute values (biased vs. random), and 4) graph sizes (small vs. large). In addition, to foster future research on GNNs, we publicly release our codebase that allows users to evaluate various GNNs with various graphs. We hope this work offers interesting insights for future research.",

            "abstract": "We propose a framework that automatically transforms non-scalable GNNs into precomputation-based GNNs which are efficient and scalable for large-scale graphs. The advantages of our framework are two-fold; 1) it transforms various non-scalable GNNs to scale well to large-scale graphs by separating local feature aggregation from weight learning in their graph convolution, 2) it efficiently executes precomputation on GPU for large-scale graphs by decomposing their edges into small disjoint and balanced sets. Through extensive experiments with large-scale graphs, we demonstrate that the transformed GNNs run faster in training time than existing GNNs while achieving competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art GNNs. Consequently, our transformation framework provides simple and efficient baselines for future research on scalable GNNs.",

The features of our method are three holds. 1) it learns a non-linear projection function between the different cluster assignments of the topology and the attributes of graphs so as to capture the complicated relationship between the topology and the attributes in real-world graphs, 2) it leverages the positive unlabeled learning to take the effect of partially observed positive edges into the cluster assignment, and 3) it achieves efficient computational complexity, $O((n^2+mn)kt)$, where $n$ is the vertex size, $m$ is the attribute size, $k$ is the number of clusters, and $t$ is the number of iterations for learning the cluster assignment. We conducted experiments extensively for various clustering methods with various real datasets to validate that our method outperforms the former clustering methods regarding the clustering quality.",
