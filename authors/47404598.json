            "title": "Examining risks of racial biases in NLP tools for child protective services",
            "abstract": "Although much literature has established the presence of demographic bias in natural language processing (NLP) models, most work relies on curated bias metrics that may not be reflective of real-world applications. At the same time, practitioners are increasingly using algorithmic tools in high-stakes settings, with particular recent interest in NLP. In this work, we focus on one such setting: child protective services (CPS). CPS workers often write copious free-form text notes about families they are working with, and CPS agencies are actively seeking to deploy NLP models to leverage these data. Given well-established racial bias in this setting, we investigate possible ways deployed NLP is liable to increase racial disparities. We specifically examine word statistics within notes and algorithmic fairness in risk prediction, coreference resolution, and named entity recognition (NER). We document consistent algorithmic unfairness in NER models, possible algorithmic unfairness in coreference resolution models, and little evidence of exacerbated racial bias in risk prediction. While there is existing pronounced criticism of risk prediction, our results expose previously undocumented risks of racial bias in realistic information extraction systems, highlighting potential concerns in deploying them, even though they may appear more benign. Our work serves as a rare realistic examination of NLP algorithmic fairness in a potential deployed setting and a timely investigation of a specific risk associated with deploying NLP in CPS settings.",

            "abstract": "Although recent neural models for coreference resolution have led to substantial improvements on benchmark datasets, it remains a challenge to successfully transfer these models to new target domains containing many out-of-vocabulary spans and requiring differing annotation schemes. Typical approaches involve continued training on annotated target-domain data, but obtaining annotations is costly and time-consuming. In this work, we show that adapting mention detection is the key component to successful domain adaptation of coreference models, rather than antecedent linking. We also show annotating mentions alone is nearly twice as fast as annotating full coreference chains. Based on these insights, we propose a method for efficiently adapting coreference models, which includes a high-precision mention detection objective and requires only mention annotations in the target domain. Extensive evaluation across three English coreference datasets: CoNLL-2012 (news/conversation), i2b2/VA (medical notes), and child welfare notes, reveals that our approach facilitates annotation-efficient transfer and results in a 7-14% improvement in average F1 without increasing annotator time.",

            "abstract": "Recent work has shown fine-tuning neural coreference models can produce strong performance when adapting to different domains. However, at the same time, this can require a large amount of annotated target examples. In this work, we focus on supervised domain adaptation for clinical notes, proposing the use of concept knowledge to more efficiently adapt coreference models to a new domain. We develop methods to improve the span representations via (1) a retrofitting loss to incentivize span representations to satisfy a knowledge-based distance function and (2) a scaffolding loss to guide the recovery of knowledge from the span representation. By integrating these losses, our model is able to improve our baseline precision and F-1 score. In particular, we show that incorporating knowledge with end-to-end coreference models results in better performance on the most challenging, domain-specific spans.",

            "abstract": "Drug use reporting is often a bottleneck for modern public health surveillance; social media data provides a real-time signal which allows for tracking and monitoring opioid overdoses. In this work we focus on text-based feature construction for the prediction task of opioid overdose rates at the county level. More specifically, using a Twitter dataset with over 3.4 billion tweets, we explore semantic features, such as topic features, to show that social media could be a good indicator for forecasting opioid overdose crude rates in public health monitoring systems. Specifically, combining topic and TF-IDF features in conjunction with demographic features can predict opioid overdose rates at the county level.",

            "abstract": "With the rise of opioid abuse in the US, there has been a growth of overlapping hotspots for overdose-related and HIV-related deaths in Springfield, Boston, Fall River, New Bedford, and parts of Cape Cod. With a large part of population, including rural communities, active on social media, it is crucial that we leverage the predictive power of social media as a preventive measure. We explore the predictive power of micro-blogging social media website Twitter with respect to HIV new diagnosis rates per county. While trending work in Twitter NLP has focused on primarily text-based features, we show that multi-dimensional feature construction can significantly improve the predictive power of topic features alone with respect STI's (sexually transmitted infections). By multi-dimensional features, we mean leveraging not only the topical features (text) of a corpus, but also location-based information (counties) about the tweets in feature-construction. We develop novel text-location-based smoothing features to predict new diagnoses of HIV.",

            "abstract": "The effectiveness of social media-based prediction highly depends on whether we can construct effective content-based features based on social media text data. Features constructed based on topics learned using a topic model are very attractive due to their expressiveness in semantic representation and accommodation of inexact matching of semantically related words. We develop a novel general framework for constructing multi-attribute topic features using multi-views of the text data defined according to metadata attributes and study their effectiveness for a text-based prediction task. Furthermore we propose and study multiple weighting strategies to align text-based features and prediction outcomes. We evaluate the proposed method on a Twitter corpus of over 100 million tweets collected over a seven year period in 2009-2015 to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) new diagnosis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) new diagnosis in the United States at the zipcode-level and county-level resolutions. The results show that feature representations based on attributes such as authors, locations, and hashtags are generally more effective than the conventional topic feature representation.",
