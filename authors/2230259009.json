            "title": "A New Mechanism for Eliminating Implicit Conflict in Graph Contrastive Learning",
            "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention because it can self-supervisedly extract low-dimensional representation of graph data. InfoNCE-based loss function is widely used in graph contrastive learning, which pulls the representations of positive pairs close to each other and pulls the representations of negative pairs away from each other. Recent works mainly focus on designing new augmentation methods or sampling strategies. However, we argue that the widely used InfoNCE-based methods may contain an implicit conflict which seriously confuses models when learning from negative pairs. This conflict is engendered by the encoder's message-passing mechanism and the InfoNCE loss function. As a result, the learned representations between negative samples cannot be far away from each other, compromising the model performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to report and analysis this conflict of GCL. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective method called Partial ignored Graph Contrastive Learning (PiGCL). Specifically, PiGCL first dynamically captures the conflicts during training by detecting the gradient of representation similarities. It then enables the loss function to ignore the conflict, allowing the encoder to adaptively learn the ignored information without self-supervised samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently enjoyed great success as an efficient self-supervised representation learning approach. However, the existing methods have focused on designing of contrastive modes and used data augmentation with a rigid and inefficient one-to-one sampling strategy. We adopted node neighborhoods to extend positive samplings and made avoided resorting to data augmentation to create different views. We also considered the homophily problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between the inter-class node pairs. The key novelty of our method hinged upon analyzing this GNNs problem and integrating the GCL sampling strategy with homophily discrimination, where we solved these two significant problems using one approach. We introduced a new parameterized neighbor sampling component to replace the conventional sub-optimal samplings. By keeping and updating the neighbor sets, both the positive sampling of GCL and the message passing of GNNs can be optimized. Moreover, we theoretically proved that the new method provided a lower bound of mutual information for unsupervised semantic learning, and it can also keep the lower bound with downstream tasks. In essence, our method is a new self-supervised approach, which we refer to as group discrimination, and it can make the downstream fine-tuning efficient. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the new method can significantly outperform the existing GCL methods because the former can solve the homophily problem in a self-supervised",
