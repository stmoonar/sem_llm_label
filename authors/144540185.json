            "abstract": "Graphs have often been used to answer questions about the interaction between real-world entities by taking advantage of their capacity to represent complex topologies. Complex networks are known to be graphs that capture such non-trivial topologies; they are able to represent human phenomena such as epidemic processes, the dynamics of populations, and the urbanization of cities. The investigation of complex networks has been extrapolated to many fields of science, with particular emphasis on computing techniques, including artificial intelligence. In such a case, the analysis of the interaction between entities of interest is transposed to the internal learning of algorithms, a paradigm whose investigation is able to expand the state of the art in Computer Science. By exploring this paradigm, this thesis puts together complex networks and machine learning techniques to improve the understanding of the human phenomena observed in pandemics, pendular migration, and street networks. Accordingly, we contribute with: (i) a new neural network architecture capable of modeling dynamic processes observed in spatial and temporal data with applications in epidemics propagation, weather forecasting, and patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning methodology for analyzing and predicting links in the scope of human mobility between all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques for identifying inconsistencies in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most influential vertices, with applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We obtained results sustained by sound evidence of advances to the state of the art in artificial intelligence, rigorous formalisms, and ample experimentation. Our findings rely upon real-world applications in a range of domains, demonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.",

            "title": "Aircraft Fuselage Corrosion Detection Using Artificial Intelligence",
            "abstract": "Corrosion identification and repair is a vital task in aircraft maintenance to ensure continued structural integrity. Regarding fuselage lap joints, typically, visual inspections are followed by non-destructive methodologies, which are time-consuming. The visual inspection of large areas suffers not only from subjectivity but also from the variable probability of corrosion detection, which is aggravated by the multiple layers used in fuselage construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatic image-based corrosion detection of aircraft structures using deep neural networks. For machine learning, we use a dataset that consists of D-Sight Aircraft Inspection System (DAIS) images from different lap joints of Boeing and Airbus aircrafts. We also employ transfer learning to overcome the shortage of aircraft corrosion images. With precision of over 93%, we demonstrate that our approach detects corrosion with a precision comparable to that of trained operators, aiding to reduce the uncertainties related to operator fatigue or inadequate training. Our results indicate that our methodology can support specialists and engineers in corrosion monitoring in the aerospace industry, potentially contributing to the automation of condition-based maintenance protocols.",

            "abstract": "Processing navigational graph-like queries in relational databases requires executing several recursive join operations, which are computationally costly. However, when the need for graph-like queries arises, applications often execute a sequence of related queries in a single session. We argue that it is possible to reduce the total cost of a set of related queries, by expanding individual intermediate results and sharing them among multiple queries. SHARq is our framework that enables sharing intermediate results of the common graph-like queries Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP), Connected Components (CC), and PageRank (PR). Our solution prepares result tables expanded with additional columns to store partial results of graph-like query combinations, such as multiple SSSP, or a sequence of queries comprising SSSP, CC, and PR. Experimental results on 9 datasets show query speedups of up to ten times when combining multiple SSSP queries, and up to two times when combining SSSP, CC, and PR queries. The results reveal a significant reduction in the query time, providing timely results for analyses relying on multiple navigational graph-like queries.",

            "abstract": "Recursive queries are one of the main mechanisms in Relational Database Management Systems to process topology-aware, or graph-like, queries. However, existing works focus only on optimizing the recursive query statements and processing, disregarding the potential physical arrangements that might improve performance. In this work, we propose to use an approach based on adjacent-list storage to physically organize the graph-like data aiming at both reducing the recursive query time and the number of I/O operations. By using Clustered Tables, we tied the adjacency list in chunks for (i) storing both vertex and edge tables together in a Combined Tables approach; and (ii) reordering the edge table with the Edge Clustered Table approach using 20% and 80% of the total adjacency list size. The clustered approaches enabled a faster recursive query processing (up to 22%) and a reduction of up to 61% in the number of page accesses when compared to the Conventional approach. When starting from multiple vertices, the Combined Tables approach achieved a query reduction time of up to 50% in the first join operation, and Edge Clustered Table 20% provided an overall time reduction of up to 20%. The results show that our physical design is effective and allows one to use recursive queries without adaptations.",

In this work, we introduce a novel architecture that benefits from cutting-edge CNNs techniques Aggregated Transformations combined to the mechanism of Squeeze-and-Excite organized in a residual block; our architecture is designed and trained from scratch having the melanoma problem as goal.

            "abstract": "Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are widely employed in several applications, including those that deal with data modeled as graphs. Existing solutions store every edge in a distinct row in the edge table, however, for most cases, such modeling does not provide adequate performance. In this work, we propose Edge-k, a technique to group the vertex neighborhood into a reduced number of rows in a table through additional columns that stores up to k edges per row. The technique provides a better table organization and reduces both table size and query processing time. We evaluate Edge-k table management for insert, update, delete and bulkload operations, and compare the query processing performance both with the conventional edge table \u2014 adopted by the existing frameworks \u2014 and with the Neo4j graph database. Experiments using Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) queries reveal that our new proposal approach always outperforms the conventional edge table as well as it was faster than Neo4j for the first iterations, being slightly slower than Neo4j only for iterations after having loaded the whole graph from disk to memory. It was able to reach a speedup of 66% over a representative real dataset, with an average reduction of up to 58% in our tests. The average speedup over synthetic datasets was up to 54%. Edge-k was also the best one when performing graph degree distribution queries. Moreover, the Edge-k table obtained a processing time reduction of 70% for bulkload operations, despite having an overhead of 50% for individual insert, update and delete operations. Finally, Edge-k advances the state of the art for graph data management within relational database systems.",

            "abstract": "Pantanal is one of the most important biomes of the world, with a large number of wild animal species, some of them are in extinction. The automatic identification of wild animals is extremely important for the estimation of the species\u2019 population within Pantanal. However, digital processing techniques for the identification and tracking of species have faced great challenges due to clumsy light and pose conditions present in images taken in the wild. To overcome such problems, we propose a methodology that, by combining regular RGB images and thermal images, improves the identilication of species even in images taken in rough circumstances. We use the SLIC segmentation algorithm to identify the regions of the images where animals are present; after that, we apply convolutional neural networks to classify the identified regions according to eight possible animal species. We experiment on a real-world dataset composed of 1,600 images. Our results showed an average gain between 6% and 10% when compared to the method Fast R-CNN.",

            "title": "Computer-assisted City Touring for Explorers",
            "abstract": "The basic purpose of a map is to trace shortest paths between two locations in a city. However, this is not always what a user needs. Consider a tourist in an unknown city, he/she might want to trace routes to visit multiple landmarks while passing through the main streets of the city, possibly more than once through the same street. Such functionality is not yet available in online map services, which are prone to provide shortest paths that connect all landmarks. Rather, is of common interest a tour that puts together the most central streets (topologically speaking), minimizes the trajectory and, at the same time, passes through such landmarks. To cope with this problem, it is possible to investigate techniques of Center-Piece Subgraph, Absorbing Random Walk Centrality and Spanning Edge-Betweenness; such techniques can be used to find induced subgraphs that optimize centrality measures for a set of referential nodes or edges, i.e. landmarks or streets. The results shall be in the form of optimized algorithms, and how to integrate them into online systems. Studies in this line can succeed if they can guarantee timely scalability at the same time that they provide algorithms that produce tours (1) considering all the known destinations; (2) including the main streets of a city; and, (3) ensuring the shortest routes.",

            "abstract": "The need for higher agricultural productivity has demanded the intensive use of pesticides. However, their correct use depends on assessment methods that can accurately predict how well the pesticides' spraying covered the intended crop region. Some methods have been proposed in the literature, but their high cost and low portability harm their widespread use. This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a new methodology based on the use of a smartphone-based mobile application, named DropLeaf. Experiments performed using DropLeaf showed that, in addition to its versatility, it can predict with high accuracy the pesticide spraying. DropLeaf is a five-fold image-processing methodology based on: (i) color space conversion; (ii) threshold noise removal; (iii) convolutional operations of dilation and erosion; (iv) detection of contour markers in the water-sensitive card; and, (v) identification of droplets via the marker-controlled watershed transformation. The authors performed successful experiments over two case studies, the first using a set of synthetic cards and the second using a real-world crop. The proposed tool can be broadly used by farmers equipped with conventional mobile phones, improving the use of pesticides with health, environmental and financial benefits.",
