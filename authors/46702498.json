            "abstract": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question is, can we treat graph structures node-like as a whole to learn high-level features? Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose a novel multi-view graph representation learning model via structure-aware searching and coarsening (GRLsc) on GT architecture for graph classification. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to construct the conversion view. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of GRLsc over 28 baselines from various architectures.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous graphs have attracted a lot of research interests recently due to the success for representing complex real-world systems. However, existing methods have two pain points in embedding them into low-dimensional spaces: the mixing of structural and semantic information, and the distributional mismatch between data and embedding spaces. These two challenges require representation methods to consider the global and partial data distributions while unmixing the information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose $\\text{Dis-H}^2\\text{GCN}$, a Disentangled Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. On the one hand, we leverage the mutual information minimization and discrimination maximization constraints to disentangle the semantic features from comprehensively learned representations by independent message propagation for each edge type, away from the pure structural features. On the other hand, the entire model is constructed upon the hyperbolic geometry to narrow the gap between data distributions and representing spaces. We evaluate our proposed $\\text{Dis-H}^2\\text{GCN}$ on five real-world heterogeneous graph datasets across two downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. The results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in disentangling and representing heterogeneous graph data in hyperbolic spaces.",

            "abstract": "Temporal link prediction, aiming to predict future edges between paired nodes in a dynamic graph, is of vital importance in diverse applications. However, existing methods are mainly built upon uniform Euclidean space, which has been found to be conflict with the power-law distributions of real-world graphs and unable to represent the hierarchical connections between nodes effectively. With respect to the special data characteristic, hyperbolic geometry offers an ideal alternative due to its exponential expansion property. In this paper, we propose HGWaveNet, a novel hyperbolic graph neural network that fully exploits the fitness between hyperbolic spaces and data distributions for temporal link prediction. Specifically, we design two key modules to learn the spatial topological structures and temporal evolutionary information separately. On the one hand, a hyperbolic diffusion graph convolution (HDGC) module effectively aggregates information from a wider range of neighbors. On the other hand, the internal order of causal correlation between historical states is captured by hyperbolic dilated causal convolution (HDCC) modules. The whole model is built upon the hyperbolic spaces to preserve the hierarchical structural information in the entire data flow. To prove the superiority of HGWaveNet, extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world graph datasets and the results show a relative improvement by up to 6.67% on AUC for temporal link prediction over SOTA methods.",

            "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) has attracted more and more attention from visual researchers in recent years, since Scene Graph (SG) is valuable in many downstream tasks due to its rich structural-semantic details. However, the ap-plication value of SG on downstream tasks is severely lim-ited by the predicate classification bias, which is caused by long-tailed data and presented as semantic bias of predicted relation predicates. Existing methods mainly reduce the prediction bias by better aggregating contexts and integrating external priori knowledge, but rarely take the semantic similarities between predicates into account. In this paper, we propose a Predicate Probability Distribution based Loss (PPDL) to train the biased SGG models and obtain unbi-ased Scene Graphs ultimately. Firstly, we propose a predi-cate probability distribution as the semantic representation of a particular predicate class. Afterwards, we re-balance the biased training loss according to the similarity between the predicted probability distribution and the estimated one, and eventually eliminate the long-tailed bias on predicate classification. Notably, the PPDL training method is model- agnostic, and extensive experiments and qualitative anal-yses on the Visual Genome dataset reveal significant per-formance improvements of our method on tail classes compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) aims to predict missing entities in MKGs. Previous works usually share relation representation across modalities. This results in mutual interference between modalities during training, since for a pair of entities, the relation from one modality probably contradicts that from another modality. Furthermore, making a unified prediction based on the shared relation representation treats the input in different modalities equally, while their importance to the MKGC task should be different. In this paper, we propose MoSE, a Modality Split representation learning and Ensemble inference framework for MKGC. Specifically, in the training phase, we learn modality-split relation embeddings for each modality instead of a single modality-shared one, which alleviates the modality interference. Based on these embeddings, in the inference phase, we first make modality-split predictions and then exploit various ensemble methods to combine the predictions with different weights, which models the modality importance dynamically. Experimental results on three KG datasets show that MoSE outperforms state-of-the-art MKGC methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/OreOZhao/MoSE4MKGC.",

            "abstract": "An image is worth a thousand words. Many researchers have conducted extensive studies to understand visual emotions since an increasing number of users express emotions via images and videos online. However, most existing methods based on convolutional neural networks aim to retrieve and classify affective images in a discrete label space while ignoring both the hierarchical and complex nature of emotions. On the one hand, different from concrete and isolated object concepts (e.g.,\u00a0cat and dog), a hierarchical relationship exists among emotions. On the other hand, most widely used deep methods depend on the representation from fully connected layers, which lacks the essential texture information for recognizing emotions. In this work, we address the above problems via adaptive deep metric learning. Specifically, we design an adaptive sentiment similarity loss, which is able to embed affective images considering the emotion polarity and adaptively adjust the margin between different image pairs. To effectively distinguish affective images, we further propose the sentiment vector that captures the texture information extracted from multiple convolutional layers. Finally, we develop a unified multi-task deep framework to simultaneously optimize both retrieval and classification goals. Extensive and thorough evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Recently, subgraph matching has been implemented in more and more domains, such as social network and semantic web. An approximated solution for subgraph matching named strong simulation has been put forward. Strong Simulation can preserve the topology of data graphs and find a bounded number of matches, but the complexity further holds a cubic-time, so it's yet intractable to deal with large graphs. To solve the problem, this paper focuses on a partition scheme to reduce the search space of subgraph matching algorithm. Firstly, we present a pruning method on data graph based on the connection relationships of nodes and edges in query graph. Secondly, we propose to use a multilevel partitioning algorithm when the subgraphs we get from former step are too large. Thirdly, we propose an algorithm for subgraph matching based on the partitioning scheme, which can preserve the topology of query graph and guarantee the correctness of results. Lastly, we experimentally prove the effectiveness and efficiency of this scheme, both using real-life data and synthetic data. It turns out that our method is quite efficient and the matching results are also satisfactory.",

Numerous different descriptions of the properties towards the same objects can be obtained from a variety of data sources. This will inevitably lead to data incompleteness, data conflicts and out-of-date information problems. These issues make truth discovery among multiple data sources non-trivial. However, most of previous works consider only one single property, or deal with different properties separately by ignoring several characteristics of the properties, which will often cause unexpected deviations. In this paper, we propose a modified method to find the most trustable source and identify the true information. Our goal is to minimize the distance between the true information and the overall observed descriptions through considering the accuracy and the coverage of all the data sources at the same time.

As rumor can spread misinformation around people, causing social problems such as panic, and the rapid growth of online social media has made it possible for rumors to spread more quickly, it is important to automatically identify rumors for social media. Existing methods on rumor detection always concentrate on telling rumor from truth with handcrafted regular expressions, dealing with out of date rumor related message. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel hot topic detection method combining bursty term identification and multi-dimension sentence modeling to automatically detect emerging hot topics for rumor identification. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on two data sets from real-world social media. Experiment results show that our emerging rumor identification for social media with hot topic detection work well both in news data set and twitter data set, and combining the hot topic detection with the rumor detection is possible to finish real-time rumor identification. We believe our method to automatically detect rumor will open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of social media mining.",

            "abstract": "RDF is considered to be an important data model for Semantic Web as a labeled directed graph. Querying in massive RDF graph data is known to be hard. In order to reduce the data size, we present ASSG, an Adaptive Structural Summary for RDF Graph data by bisimulations between nodes. ASSG compresses only the part of the graph related to queries. Thus ASSG contains less nodes and edges than existing work. More importantly, ASSG has the adaptive ability to adjust its structure according to the updating query graphs. Experimental results show that ASSG can reduce graph data with the ratio 85% in average, higher than that of existing work.",
