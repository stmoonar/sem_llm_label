            "title": "Detecting and Quantifying Wash Trading on Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges",
            "abstract": "Cryptoassets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens are increasingly traded on decentralized exchanges. The advantage for users is that the funds are not in custody of a centralized external entity. However, these exchanges are prone to manipulative behavior. In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity can be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta. We identify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal definitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash trading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and two-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify these activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30% of all traded tokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the tokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for future research. Our findings underpin the need for countermeasures that are applicable in decentralized systems.",

            "title": "Continuous Prototyping",
            "abstract": "Developing for devices like smartphones, tablets or smartwatches is more than just \"shipping code\". Especially in mobile development there is a strong focus on user interface design and user experience. In order to explore the design space, development teams and designers need early feedback from users testing the designs. Continuous Delivery (CD) is a well-established technique for the delivery of software. In this paper we describe Continuous Prototyping which extends CD to cover the delivery of early artifacts like user interface mockups that usually do not benefit from an automated delivery process. Continuous Prototyping enables stakeholders to receive all artifacts through a unified delivery pipeline in fast cycles, from the first mockup to the finished product. We developed PROTOTYPER as a tool to demonstrate the technical feasibility of Continuous Prototyping. PROTOTYPER allows developers and designers to deliver mockups, mobile applications as will as a mixture of both using the same deployment pipeline. In a experiment with 42 developers we found that applying Continuous Prototyping not only reduces the cycle time for delivering mockups and receiving feedback but also facilitates the frequent delivery of mockups in early project stages.",
