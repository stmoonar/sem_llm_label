            "abstract": "The rapid growth of decentralized digital currencies, enabled by blockchain technology, has ushered in a new era of peer-to-peer transactions, revolutionizing the global economy. Cryptocurrency wallets, serving as crucial endpoints for these transactions, have become increasingly prevalent. However, the escalating value and usage of these wallets also expose them to significant security risks and challenges. This research aims to comprehensively explore the security aspects of cryptocurrency wallets. It provides a taxonomy of wallet types, analyzes their design and implementation, identifies common vulnerabilities and attacks, and discusses defense mechanisms and mitigation strategies. The taxonomy covers custodial, non-custodial, hot, and cold wallets, highlighting their unique characteristics and associated security considerations. The security analysis scrutinizes the theoretical and practical aspects of wallet design, while assessing the efficacy of existing security measures and protocols. Notable wallet attacks, such as Binance, Mt. Gox are examined to understand their causes and consequences. Furthermore, the paper surveys defense mechanisms, transaction monitoring, evaluating their effectiveness in mitigating threats.",

This evolution has increased publications, making manual literature analysis increasingly challenging. We address this with a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based systematic literature review method to explore the intersection of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects. Our approach involves building and refining a directed citation network from 107 seed papers to a corpus of 24,539 publications and fine-tuning a transformer-based language model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on DLT and ESG domains. Applying this model, we distilled the corpus to 505 key publications, enabling an inaugural literature review and temporal graph analysis of DLT's evolution in ESG contexts. Our contributions include an adaptable and scalable NLP-driven systematic literature review methodology and a unique NER dataset of 54,808 entities, tailored for DLT and ESG research. Our inaugural literature review demonstrates their applicability and effectiveness in analyzing DLT's evolution and impacts, proving invaluable for stakeholders in the DLT domain.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has experienced remarkable growth, with various protocols such as lending protocols and automated market makers (AMMs) emerging. Traditionally, these protocols employ off-chain governance, where token holders vote to modify parameters. However, manual parameter adjustment, often conducted by the protocol's core team, is vulnerable to collusion, compromising the integrity and security of the system. Furthermore, purely deterministic, algorithm-based approaches may expose the protocol to novel exploits and attacks. In this paper, we present\"Auto.gov\", a learning-based on-chain governance framework for DeFi that enhances security and reduces susceptibility to attacks. Our model leverages a deep Q- network (DQN) reinforcement learning approach to propose semi-automated, intuitive governance proposals with quantitative justifications. This methodology enables the system to efficiently adapt to and mitigate the negative impact of malicious behaviors, such as price oracle attacks, more effectively than benchmark models. Our evaluation demonstrates that Auto.gov offers a more reactive, objective, efficient, and resilient solution compared to existing manual processes, thereby significantly bolstering the security and, ultimately, enhancing the profitability of DeFi protocols.",

It involves supplying, borrowing, or staking crypto assets to earn an income in forms of transaction fees, interest, or participation rewards at different DeFi marketplaces. In this systematic survey, we present yield farming protocols as an aggregation-layer constituent of the wider DeFi ecosystem that interact with primitive-layer protocols such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and loanable funds (PLFs) protocol for loanable funds (PLF). We examine the yield farming mechanism by first studying the operations encoded in the yield farming smart contracts, and then performing stylized, parameterized simulations on various yield farming strategies. We conduct a thorough literature review on related work, and establish a framework for yield farming protocols that takes into account pool structure, accepted token types, and implemented strategies. Using our framework, we characterize major yield aggregators in the market including Yearn Finance, Beefy, and Badger DAO. Moreover, we discuss anecdotal attacks against yield aggregators and generalize a number of risks associated with yield farming.",

            "abstract": "We conduct a gap analysis to identify shortcomings in current accounting systems, juxtaposing the application of blockchain-inspired triple-entry accounting (TEA). The application of TEA remediates a number of issues or \u201cpain points\u201d in the accounting domain, from multi-party logistic nightmares and billing inefficiencies to \u201ccreative accounting.\u201d An inventory of current practice further reveals that, although not intended to serve as an ultimate accounting tool in most cases, DLT has been used to develop a quasi or full TEA application in many separate instances. DLT developers are, with innovative TEA applications, breaking new ground in the accounting world, especially in the logistics and supply chains sectors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the efficiency effects may well surpass the primary DLT-based TEA input costs, in particular given the addition of single truth: a common, shared ledger with IoT oracles between parties potentiates an agreed understanding of the facts. A TEA system thus reduces friction between parties, and thus lowers costs related to reconciliation and risk management.",

            "abstract": "Popular permissionless distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems using proof-of-work (PoW) for Sybil attack resistance have extreme energy requirements, drawing stern criticism from academia, business and the media. DLT systems building on alternative consensus mechanisms, particularly proof-of-stake (PoS), aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take an initial step towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While multiple studies have analysed the energy demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has been done. We approach this research gap by formalising a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main findings. First, we confirm the concerns around the energy footprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analysed by at least three orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in energy consumption among the PoS-based systems analysed, with permissionless systems having a larger energy footprint overall owing to their higher replication factor. Third, we point out that the type of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on whether the energy consumption of PoS blockchains is comparable with or considerably larger than that of centralised systems.",
