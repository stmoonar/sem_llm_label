            "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing technologies that simultaneously generate multimodal cellular profiles present opportunities for improved understanding of cell heterogeneity in tissues. How the multimodal information can be integrated to obtain a common cell type identification, however, poses a computational challenge. Multilayer graphs provide a natural representation of multi-omic single-cell sequencing datasets, and finding cell clusters may be understood as a multilayer graph partition problem. We introduce two spectral algorithms on multilayer graphs, spectral clustering on multilayer graphs (SCML) and the weighted locally linear (WLL) method, to cluster cells in multi-omic single-cell sequencing datasets. We connect these algorithms through a unifying mathematical framework that represents each layer using a Hamiltonian operator and a mixture of its eigenstates to integrate the multiple graph layers, demonstrating in the process that the WLL method is a rigorous multilayer spectral graph theoretic reformulation of the popular Seurat weighted nearest neighbor (WNN) algorithm. Implementing our algorithms and applying them to a CITE-seq dataset of cord blood mononuclear cells yields results similar to the Seurat WNN analysis. Our work thus extends spectral methods to multimodal single-cell data analysis. The code used in this study can be found at https://github.com/jssong-lab/sc-spectrum",

Methods ClusterEnG (acronym for Clustering Engine for Genomics) provides a web interface for clustering data and interactive visualizations including 3D views, data selection and zoom features. Eighteen clustering validation measures are also presented to aid the user in selecting a suitable algorithm for their dataset. ClusterEnG also aims at educating the user about the similarities and differences between various clustering algorithms and provides tutorials that demonstrate potential pitfalls of each algorithm. Conclusions The web resource will be particularly useful to scientists who are not conversant with computing but want to understand the structure of their data in an intuitive manner. The validation measures facilitate the process of choosing a suitable clustering algorithm among the available options.

            "abstract": "In the statistical learning language, samples are snapshots of random vectors drawn from some unknown distribution. Such vectors usually reside in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and thus, the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d often undermines the power of learning methods, including community detection and clustering algorithms, that rely on Euclidean geometry. This paper presents the idea of effective dissimilarity transformation (EDT) on empirical dissimilarity hyperspheres and studies its effects using synthetic and gene expression data sets. Iterating the EDT turns a static data distribution into a dynamical process purely driven by the empirical data set geometry and adaptively ameliorates the curse of dimensionality, partly through changing the topology of a Euclidean feature space \u211dn into a compact hypersphere Sn. The EDT often improves the performance of hierarchical clustering via the automatic grouping information emerging from global interactions of data points. The EDT is not restricted to hierarchical clustering, and other learning methods based on pairwise dissimilarity should also benefit from the many desirable properties of EDT.

            "abstract": "Motivation Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field that has emerged from the synergy of computer science, statistics, and biology. Given the interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics, many students from diverse fields struggle with grasping bioinformatic concepts only from classroom lectures. Interactive tools for helping students reinforce their learning would be thus desirable. Here, we present an interactive online educational tool called TeachEnG (acronym for Teaching Engine for Genomics) for reinforcing key concepts in sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Our instructional games allow students to align sequences by hand, fill out the dynamic programming matrix in the Needleman-Wunsch global sequence alignment algorithm, and reconstruct phylogenetic trees via the maximum parsimony and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithms. With an easily accessible interface and instant visual feedback, TeachEnG will help promote active learning in bioinformatics.

            "abstract": "Summary Clustering is one of the most common techniques used in data analysis to discover hidden structures by grouping together data points that are similar in some measure into clusters. Although there are many programs available for performing clustering, a single web resource that provides both state-of-the-art clustering methods and interactive visualizations is lacking. ClusterEnG (acronym for Clustering Engine for Genomics) provides an interface for clustering big data and interactive visualizations including 3D views, cluster selection and zoom features. ClusterEnG also aims at educating the user about the similarities and differences between various clustering algorithms and provides clustering tutorials that demonstrate potential pitfalls of each algorithm. The web resource will be particularly useful to scientists who are not conversant with computing but want to understand the structure of their data in an intuitive manner. Availability ClusterEnG is part of a bigger project called KnowEnG (Knowledge Engine for Genomics) and is available at http://education.knoweng.org/clustereng. Contact songi@illinois.edu",

            "abstract": "Quantum time evolution exhibits rich physics, attributable to the interplay between the density and phase of a wave function. However, unlike classical heat diffusion, the wave nature of quantum mechanics has not yet been extensively explored in modern data analysis. We propose that the Laplace transform of quantum transport (QT) can be used to construct an ensemble of maps from a given complex network to a circle S^{1}, such that closely related nodes on the network are grouped into sharply concentrated clusters on S^{1}. The resulting QT clustering (QTC) algorithm is as powerful as the state-of-the-art spectral clustering in discerning complex geometric patterns and more robust when clusters show strong density variations or heterogeneity in size. The observed phenomenon of QTC can be interpreted as a collective behavior of the microscopic nodes that evolve as macroscopic cluster \"orbitals\" in an effective tight-binding model recapitulating the network. python source code implementing the algorithm and examples are available at https://github.com/jssong-lab/QTC.",

            "abstract": "Many contemporary statistical learning methods assume a Euclidean feature space. This paper presents a method for defining similarity based on hyperspherical geometry and shows that it often improves the performance of support vector machine compared to other competing similarity measures. Specifically, the idea of using heat diffusion on a hypersphere to measure similarity has been previously proposed, demonstrating promising results based on a heuristic heat kernel obtained from the zeroth order parametrix expansion; however, how well this heuristic kernel agrees with the exact hyperspherical heat kernel remains unknown. This paper presents a higher order parametrix expansion of the heat kernel on a unit hypersphere and discusses several problems associated with this expansion method. We then compare the heuristic kernel with an exact form of the heat kernel expressed in terms of a uniformly and absolutely convergent series in high-dimensional angular momentum eigenmodes. Being a natural measure of similarity between sample points dwelling on a hypersphere, the exact kernel often shows superior performance in kernel SVM classifications applied to text mining, tumor somatic mutation imputation, and stock market analysis.",

            "abstract": "New architectures of multilayer artificial neural networks and new methods for training them are rapidly revolutionizing the application of machine learning in diverse fields, including business, social science, physical sciences, and biology. Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.",
