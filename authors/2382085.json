            "abstract": "A sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action sequence. While previous methods have made many efforts to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce a new concept dubbed socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. In light of this, we contribute a novel solution named GCARec (short for graph-augmented co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. GCARec decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps. First, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user preference. Then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at sequential-level and social-level, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of GCARec against several state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets have been released at: https://github.com/wubinzzu/GCARec.",

            "abstract": "Multitask image clustering approaches intend to improve the model accuracy on each task by exploring the relationships of multiple related image clustering tasks. However, most existing multitask clustering (MTC) approaches isolate the representation abstraction from the downstream clustering procedure, which makes the MTC models unable to perform unified optimization. In addition, the existing MTC relies on exploring the relevant information of multiple related tasks to discover their latent correlations while ignoring the irrelevant information between partially related tasks, which may also degrade the clustering performance. To tackle these issues, a multitask image clustering method named deep multitask information bottleneck (DMTIB) is devised, which aims at conducting multiple related image clustering by maximizing the relevant information of multiple tasks while minimizing the irrelevant information among them. Specifically, DMTIB consists of a main-net and multiple subnets to characterize the relationships across tasks and the correlations hidden in a single clustering task. Then, an information maximin discriminator is devised to maximize the mutual information (MI) measurement of positive samples and minimize the MI of negative ones, in which the positive and negative sample pairs are constructed by a high-confidence pseudo-graph. Finally, a unified loss function is devised for the optimization of task relatedness discovery and MTC simultaneously. Empirical comparisons on several benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE, Pascal VOC, Caltech-256, CIFAR-100, and COCO, show that our DMTIB approach outperforms more than 20 single-task clustering and MTC approaches.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems commonly encounter with the problems of data sparsity and cold start. Recently, social recommendation has emerged with the rapid expansion of social platforms, offering an opportunity to alleviate such two obstacles. Nevertheless, there are still two key limitations in existing studies. From the perspective of model design, previous social recommenders only consider the influence of a user's direct friends or uniformly treat the influences from different friends. From the perspective of model learning, most of them apply a sampling\u2010based optimization strategy, which requires high\u2010quality positive and negative samples. In light of the aforementioned limitations, we propose a new probabilistic method, named Graph Attentive Matrix Factorization (GAMF). Our method not only explicitly captures high\u2010order social relationships, but also adopts an attention mechanism to automatically pick up different influences between friends. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to learn model parameters in a non\u2010sampling manner. Extensive experiments on four large\u2010scale datasets show the superiority of GAMF over state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art recommenders, especially under the cold start scenario.",

            "abstract": "In many practical applications, massive data are observed from multiple sources, each of which contains multiple cohesive views, called hierarchical multiview (HMV) data, such as image\u2013text objects with different types of visual and textual features. Naturally, the inclusion of source and view relationships offers a comprehensive view of the input HMV data and achieves an informative and correct clustering result. However, most existing multiview clustering (MVC) methods can only process single-source data with multiple views or multisource data with single type of feature, failing to consider all the views across multiple sources. Observing the rich closely related multivariate (i.e., source and view) information and the potential dynamic information flow interacting among them, in this article, a general hierarchical information propagation model is first built to address the above challenging problem. It describes the process from optimal feature subspace learning (OFSL) of each source to final clustering structure learning (CSL). Then, a novel self-guided method named propagating information bottleneck (PIB) is proposed to realize the model. It works in a circulating propagation fashion, so that the resulting clustering structure obtained from the last iteration can \u201cself-guide\u201d the OFSL of each source, and the learned subspaces are in turn used to conduct the subsequent CSL. We theoretically analyze the relationship between the cluster structures learned in the CSL phase and the preservation of relevant information propagated from the OFSL phase. Finally, a two-step alternating optimization method is carefully designed for optimization. Experimental results on various datasets show the superiority of the proposed PIB method over several state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have enjoyed considerable success in computer vision and attracted much attention from recommender systems. However, due to the discrete nature of items, it is infeasible to graft GANs directly onto recommendation models. Although several methods have taken steps forward, their training processes are slow-convergent, time-consuming, or even unstable. This article proposes a novel framework named attentive adversarial collaborative filtering (AACF) and an efficient training strategy to improve GANs in recommender systems. There are two distinct novelties over previous work. First, AACF is a differentiable generative adversarial framework that introduces an attention mechanism and \u201cvirtual items\u201d to bridge the gap between the generator and the discriminator. Owing to the intrinsic differentiability, AACF can be stably optimized with gradient descent methods. Second, the efficient training strategy substantially reduces computational complexity. It is capable of efficiently training and scaling up the AACF model to large datasets. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, fast convergence, stability, and scalability of AACF. Since our ideas are general in nature, they will open a path to stably and efficiently train GANs in the research areas with discrete data.

            "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nDiscovering the drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a crucial step in drug development such as the identification of drug side effects and drug repositioning. Since identifying DTIs by web-biological experiments is time-consuming and costly, many computational-based approaches have been proposed and have become an efficient manner to infer the potential interactions. Although extensive effort is invested to solve this task, the prediction accuracy still needs to be improved. More especially, heterogeneous network-based approaches do not fully consider the complex structure and rich semantic information in these heterogeneous networks. Therefore, it is still a challenge to predict DTIs efficiently.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we develop a novel method via Multiview heterogeneous information network embedding with Hierarchical Attention mechanisms to discover potential Drug-Target Interactions (MHADTI). Firstly, MHADTI constructs different similarity networks for drugs and targets by utilizing their multisource information. Combined with the known DTI network, three drug-target heterogeneous information networks (HINs) with different views are established. Secondly, MHADTI learns embeddings of drugs and targets from multiview HINs with hierarchical attention mechanisms, which include the node-level, semantic-level and graph-level attentions. Lastly, MHADTI employs the multilayer perceptron to predict DTIs with the learned deep feature representations. The hierarchical attention mechanisms could fully consider the importance of nodes, meta-paths and graphs in learning the feature representations of drugs and targets, which makes their embeddings more comprehensively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MHADTI performs better than other SOTA prediction models. Moreover, analysis of prediction results for some interested drugs and targets further indicates that MHADTI has advantages in discovering DTIs.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nhttps://github.com/pxystudy/MHADTI.",

However, most existing approaches still rely heavily on traditional computational strategies, which are not guaranteed to achieve satisfactory performance. In this study, we propose a novel computational approach called GOGCN to measure gene functional similarity by modeling the Gene Ontology (GO) through Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). GOGCN is a graph-based approach that performs sufficient representation learning for terms and relations in the GO graph. First, GOGCN employs the GCN-based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model to learn vector representations (i.e., embeddings) for all entities (i.e., terms). Second, GOGCN calculates the semantic similarity between two terms based on their corresponding vector representations. Finally, GOGCN estimates gene functional similarity by making use of the pair-wise strategy. During the representation learning period, GOGCN promotes semantic interaction between terms through GCN, thereby capturing the rich structural information of the GO graph. Further experimental results on various datasets suggest that GOGCN is superior to the other state-of-the-art approaches, which shows its reliability and effectiveness.",

            "title": "Crowd Counting Using Scale Enhanced Network with Dual Attention Booster",
            "abstract": "Crowd counting has been a fundamental yet challenging problem in pattern recognition. Most recent deep models for crowd counting rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Although CNN visual features comprise the spatial and channel features, existing deep models on crowd counting have limited descriptive ability as they only focus on the spatial or channel information. In this paper, we propose Scale Enhanced Network with Dual Attention Booster named as SEN-DAB, a novel method to jointly learn the representations of spatial and channel information for crowd counting. Moreover, to further leverage the multi-scale information, a pyramid residual scale enhanced block is presented to process the multi-scale features. As a result, the learned spatial, channel and multi-scale features can be robust to appearance changes of the crowd. Our model is tested on three benchmarks and the experimental results confirm that the promising performance of SEN-DAB when compared with various networks.",
