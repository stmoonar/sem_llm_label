            "abstract": "In the realm of recommender systems, handling noisy implicit feedback is a prevalent challenge. While most research efforts focus on mitigating noise through data cleaning methods like resampling and reweighting, these approaches often rely on heuristic assumptions. Alternatively, model perspective denoising strategies actively incorporate noise into user-item interactions, aiming to bolster the model\u2019s inherent denoising capabilities. Nonetheless, this type of denoising method presents substantial challenges to the capacity of the recommender model to accurately identify and represent noise patterns. Toovercome these hurdles, we introduce a plug-in diffusion model for embedding denoising in recommendation systems, which employs a multi-step denoising approach based on diffusion models to foster robust representation learning of embeddings. Our model operates by introducing controlled Gaussian noise into user and item embeddings derived from various recommender systems during the forward phase. Subsequently, it iteratively eliminates this noise in the reverse denoising phase, thereby augmenting the embeddings\u2019 resilience to noisy feedback. The primary challenge in this process is determining direction and an optimal starting point for the denoising process. To address this, we incorporate a specialized denoising module that utilizes collaborative data as a guide for the denoising process. Furthermore, during the inference phase, we employ the average of item embeddings previously favored by users as the starting point to facilitate ideal item generation. Our thorough evaluations across three datasets and in conjunction with three classic backend models confirm its superior performance.",

            "title": "Denoising Diffusion Recommender Model",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems often grapple with noisy implicit feedback. Most studies alleviate the noise issues from data cleaning perspective such as data resampling and reweighting, but they are constrained by heuristic assumptions. Another denoising avenue is from model perspective, which proactively injects noises into user-item interactions and enhances the intrinsic denoising ability of models. However, this kind of denoising process poses significant challenges to the recommender model's representation capacity to capture noise patterns. To address this issue, we propose Denoising Diffusion Recommender Model (DDRM), which leverages multi-step denoising process of diffusion models to robustify user and item embeddings from any recommender models. DDRM injects controlled Gaussian noises in the forward process and iteratively removes noises in the reverse denoising process, thereby improving embedding robustness against noisy feedback. To achieve this target, the key lies in offering appropriate guidance to steer the reverse denoising process and providing a proper starting point to start the forward-reverse process during inference. In particular, we propose a dedicated denoising module that encodes collaborative information as denoising guidance. Besides, in the inference stage, DDRM utilizes the average embeddings of users' historically liked items as the starting point rather than using pure noise since pure noise lacks personalization, which increases the difficulty of the denoising process. Extensive experiments on three datasets with three representative backend recommender models demonstrate the effectiveness of DDRM.",

            "title": "Diffusion Models for Generative Outfit Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Outfit Recommendation (OR) in the fashion domain has evolved through two stages: Pre-defined Outfit Recommendation and Personalized Outfit Composition. However, both stages are constrained by existing fashion products, limiting their effectiveness in addressing users' diverse fashion needs. Recently, the advent of AI-generated content provides the opportunity for OR to transcend these limitations, showcasing the potential for personalized outfit generation and recommendation. To this end, we introduce a novel task called Generative Outfit Recommendation (GOR), aiming to generate a set of fashion images and compose them into a visually compatible outfit tailored to specific users. The key objectives of GOR lie in the high fidelity, compatibility, and personalization of generated outfits. To achieve these, we propose a generative outfit recommender model named DiFashion, which empowers exceptional diffusion models to accomplish the parallel generation of multiple fashion images. To ensure three objectives, we design three kinds of conditions to guide the parallel generation process and adopt Classifier-Free-Guidance to enhance the alignment between the generated images and conditions. We apply DiFashion on both personalized Fill-In-The-Blank and GOR tasks and conduct extensive experiments on iFashion and Polyvore-U datasets. The quantitative and human-involved qualitative evaluation demonstrate the superiority of DiFashion over competitive baselines.",
