            "title": "Semantic Foundations of Seraph Continuous Graph Query Language",
            "abstract": "The scientific community has been studying graph data models for decades. Their high expressiveness and elasticity led the scientific community to design a variety of graph data models and graph query languages, and the practitioners to use them to model real-world cases and extract useful information. Recently, property graphs and, in particular, Cypher 9 (the first open version of the well-known Neo4j Inc.'s language) are gaining popularity. Practitioners find Cypher useful and applicable in many scenarios. However, we are living in a streaming world where data continuously flows. A growing number of Cypher's users show interest in continuously querying graph data to act in a timely fashion. Indeed, Cypher lacks the features for dealing with streams of (graph) data and continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, an extension of Cypher, as a first attempt to introduce streaming features in the context of property graph query languages. Specifically, we define Seraph semantics, we propose a first version of Seraph syntax, and we discuss the potential impacts from a user perspective.",

            "abstract": "We investigate how a state of the art path index can be integrated into the Cypher query pipeline of the industrial Neo4j graph data-base. We identify the characteristics of practical use-cases where application of path indexes is beneficial to query evaluation and performance of index maintenance. Through in-depth empirical evaluation, we conclude that path indexes are most effective when used on selective patterns that allows the query planner to avoid high intermediate state cardinality and thus significantly accelerate query performance. As such patterns arise naturally in querying on real graphs, we can conclude that path indexes are a valuable method for improving the performance of graph database systems in practice.",

            "abstract": "As graph databases become widespread, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have approved a project to create GQL, a standard property graph query language. This complements the SQL/PGQ project, which specifies how to define graph views over a SQL tabular schema, and to run read-only queries against them. Both projects have been assigned to the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC32 working group for Database Languages, WG3, which continues to maintain and enhance SQL as a whole. This common responsibility helps enforce a policy that the identical core of both PGQ and GQL is a graph pattern matching sub-language, here termed GPML. The WG3 design process is also analyzed by an academic working group, part of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC), whose task is to produce a formal semantics of these graph data languages, which complements their standard specifications. This paper, written by members of WG3 and LDBC, presents the key elements of the GPML of SQL/PGQ and GQL in advance of the publication of these new standards.",

            "abstract": "The paper describes the present and the future of graph updates in Cypher, the language of the Neo4j property graph database and several other products. Update features include those with clear analogs in relational databases, as well as those that do not correspond to any relational op-erators. Moreover, unlike SQL, Cypher updates can be ar-bitrarily intertwined with querying clauses. After present-ing the current state of update features, we point out their shortcomings, most notably violations of atomicity and nondeterministic behavior of updates. These have not been previously known in the Cypher community. We then describe the industry-academia collaboration on designing a revised set of Cypher update operations. Based on discovered shortcomings of update features, a number of possible solutions were devised. They were presented to key Cypher users, who were given the opportunity to comment on how update features are used in real life, and on their preferences for proposed \ufb01xes. As the result of the consultation, a new set of update operations for Cypher were designed. Those led to a streamlined syntax, and eliminated the unexpected and problematic behavior that original Cypher updates exhib-ited.",

            "abstract": "Cypher is a property graph query language that provides expressive and efficient querying of graph data. Originally designed and implemented within the Neo4j graph database, it is now being used by several industrial database products, as well as open-source and research projects. Since 2015, Cypher has been an open, evolving language, with the aim of becoming a fullyspecified standard with many independent implementations. We introduce Cypher and the property graph model, and then describe extensions \u2013 either actively being developed or under discussion \u2013 which will be incorporated into Cypher in the near future. These include (i) making Cypher into a fully compositional language by supporting multiple graphs and allowing graphs to be returned from queries; (ii) allowing for more complex patterns (based on regular path queries) to be expressed; and (iii) allowing for different pattern matching semantics \u2013 homomorphism, relationship isomorphism (the current default) or node isomorphism \u2013 to be configured at a query-by-query level. A subset of the proposed Cypher language extensions has already been implemented on top of Apache Spark. In the tutorial, wewill present our approach including an in-depth analysis of the challenges we faced. This includes mapping the property graph model to the Spark DataFrame abstraction and the translation of Cypher query operators into relational transformations. The tutorial will conclude with a demonstration based on a real-world graph analytical use case.",

            "abstract": "The Cypher property graph query language is an evolving language, originally designed and implemented as part of the Neo4j graph database, and it is currently used by several commercial database products and researchers. We describe Cypher 9, which is the first version of the language governed by the openCypher Implementers Group. We first introduce the language by example, and describe its uses in industry. We then provide a formal semantic definition of the core read-query features of Cypher, including its variant of the property graph data model, and its ASCII Art graph pattern matching mechanism for expressing subgraphs of interest to an application. We compare the features of Cypher to other property graph query languages, and describe extensions, at an advanced stage of development, which will form part of Cypher 10, turning the language into a compositional language which supports graph projections and multiple named graphs.",

            "abstract": "We report on a community effort between industry and academia to shape the future of graph query languages. We argue that existing graph database management systems should consider supporting a query language with two key characteristics. First, it should be composable, meaning, that graphs are the input and the output of queries. Second, the graph query language should treat paths as first-class citizens. Our result is G-CORE, a powerful graph query language design that fulfills these goals, and strikes a careful balance between path query expressivity and evaluation complexity.",
