            "abstract": "The management of modern IT systems poses unique challenges, necessitating scalability, reliability, and efficiency in handling extensive data streams. Traditional methods, reliant on manual tasks and rule-based approaches, prove inefficient for the substantial data volumes and alerts generated by IT systems. Artificial Intelligence for Operating Systems (AIOps) has emerged as a solution, leveraging advanced analytics like machine learning and big data to enhance incident management. AIOps detects and predicts incidents, identifies root causes, and automates healing actions, improving quality and reducing operational costs. However, despite its potential, the AIOps domain is still in its early stages, decentralized across multiple sectors, and lacking standardized conventions. Research and industrial contributions are distributed without consistent frameworks for data management, target problems, implementation details, requirements, and capabilities. This study proposes an AIOps terminology and taxonomy, establishing a structured incident management procedure and providing guidelines for constructing an AIOps framework. The research also categorizes contributions based on criteria such as incident management tasks, application areas, data sources, and technical approaches. The goal is to provide a comprehensive review of technical and research aspects in AIOps for incident management, aiming to structure knowledge, identify gaps, and establish a foundation for future developments in the field.",

            "abstract": "Software applications, particularly Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, are crucial to the day-to-day operations of many industries, where it is essential to maintain these systems effectively and reliably. In response, Artificial Intelligence for Operations Systems (AIOps) has emerged as a dynamic framework, harnessing cutting-edge analytical technologies like machine learning and big data to enhance incident management procedures by detecting, predicting, and resolving issues while pinpointing their root causes. In this paper, we leverage a promising data-driven strategy, dubbed Subgroup Discovery (SD), a data mining method that can automatically mine incident datasets and extract discriminant patterns to identify the root causes. However, current SD solutions have limitations in handling complex target concepts with multiple attributes organized hierarchically. We illustrate this scenario by examining the case of Java out-of-memory incidents among several possible applications. We have a dataset that describes these incidents, including their topology and the types of Java objects occupying memory when it reaches saturation, with these types arranged hierarchically. This scenario inspires us to propose a novel Subgroup Discovery approach that can handle complex target concepts with hierarchies. To achieve this, we design a new Subgroup Discovery framework along with a pattern syntax and a quality measure that ensure the identified subgroups are relevant, non-redundant, and resilient to noise. To achieve the desired quality measure, we use the Subjective Interestingness model that incorporates prior knowledge about the data and promotes patterns that are both informative and surprising relative to that knowledge. We apply this framework to investigate out-of-memory errors and demonstrate its usefulness in root-cause diagnosis. Notably, this paper stands out as a contribution to both Data Mining and Java memory analysis research. To validate the effectiveness of our approach and the quality of the retrieved patterns, we present an empirical study conducted on a real-world scenario from our ERP system.",

            "abstract": "Automatic crash bucketing is a crucial phase in the software de-velopment process for efficiently triaging bug reports. It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLsh, a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist. We support this claim with a series of experiments on an original dataset, which we make available.",

            "abstract": "Information Technology has become a critical component in various industries, leading to an increased focus on software maintenance and monitoring. With the complexities of modern software systems, traditional maintenance approaches have become insufficient. The concept of AIOps has emerged to enhance predictive maintenance using Big Data and Machine Learning capabilities. However, exploiting AIOps requires addressing several challenges related to the complexity of data and incident management. Commercial solutions exist, but they may not be suitable for certain companies due to high costs, data governance issues, and limitations in covering private software. This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing on-premise AIOps solutions by leveraging open-source tools. We introduce a comprehensive AIOps infrastructure that we have successfully deployed in our company, and we provide the rationale behind different choices that we made to build its various components. Particularly, we provide insights into our approach and criteria for selecting a data management system and we explain its integration. Our experience can be beneficial for companies seeking to internally manage their software maintenance processes with a modern AIOps approach.",

            "abstract": "The need of predictive maintenance comes with an increasing number of incidents reported by monitoring systems and equipment/software users. In the front line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of severity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective actions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been proposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly limiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model based on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and emphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively reported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent developments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing global explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local explanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with an explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an important number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an original data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining technique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar explanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each group. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give us good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach provides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome explanation.",

Although DBAs can easily pinpoint queries repeatedly causing performance issues, it remains challenging to automatically identify subsets of queries that share some properties only (a pattern) and simultaneously foster some target measures, such as execution time. Patterns are defined on combinations of query clauses, environment variables, database alerts and metrics and help answer questions like what makes SQL queries slow? What makes I/O communications high? Automatically discovering these patterns in a huge search space and providing them as hypotheses for helping to localize issues and root-causes is important in the context of explainable AI. To tackle it, we introduce an original approach rooted on Subgroup Discovery. We show how to instantiate and develop this generic data-mining framework to identify potential causes of SQL workloads issues. We believe that such data-mining technique is not trivial to apply for DBAs. As such, we also provide a visualization tool for interactive knowledge discovery. We analyse a one week workload from hundreds of databases from our company, make both the dataset and source code available, and experimentally show that insightful hypotheses can be discovered.",

            "abstract": "Concepts are often described in terms of positive integer-valued attributes that are organized in a hierarchy. For example, cities can be described in terms of how many places there are of various types (e.g. nightlife spots, residences, food venues), and these places are organized in a hierarchy (e.g. a Portuguese restaurant is a type of food venue). This hierarchy imposes particular constraints on the values of related attributes---e.g. there cannot be more Portuguese restaurants than food venues. Moreover, knowing that a city has many food venues makes it less surprising that it also has many Portuguese restaurants, and vice versa. In the present paper, we attempt to characterize such concepts in terms of so-called contrastive antichains: particular kinds of subsets of their attributes and their values. We address the question of when a contrastive antichain is interesting, in the sense that it concisely describes the unique aspects of the concept, and this while duly taking into account the known attribute dependencies implied by the hierarchy. Our approach is capable of accounting for previously identified contrastive antichains, making iterative mining possible. Besides the interestingness measure, we also present an algorithm that scales well in practice, and demonstrate the usefulness of the method in an extensive empirical results section.",

In this paper, we tackle the problem of local event detection from social media data. We present a method to automatically identify events by evaluating the burstiness of hashtags in a geographical area and a time interval, and at the same time integrating user feedback. We devise two algorithms to discover user-driven events. The first one relies on an exact enumeration process, while the other directly samples the space of events. In our empirical study, we provide evidence that geolocated events cannot be detected by non location-aware methods. We also show that our methods (i) outperform by a factor of two to several orders of magnitude state-of-the-art methods designed to discover geolocated events, (ii) are more robust to noise, and (iii) produce high quality events with respect to user interests.",

            "title": "Mining useful patterns in attributed graphs",
            "abstract": "In this thesis, we address the problem of pattern discovery in vertex-attributed graphs. This kind of structure consists of a graph augmented with attributes associated to vertices. Vertex-attributed graphs provide a powerful abstraction that can be used to represent many datasets in an intuitive manner. Mining these graphs can be very useful for many applications, such as analyzing social networks, biological networks, the World Wide Web, etc. Several methods have been proposed to identify patterns in these structures. Generally, these methods define a pattern as a subgraph whose vertices satisfy some structural constraints (e.g., density, connectivity) and have a subset of attributes with homogeneous values. \nWhen mining vertex-attributed graphs, the principled integration of both graph and attribute data poses two important challenges. First, we need to define a pattern syntax (the abstract form of patterns) that is intuitive and lends itself to efficient search. A pattern being intuitive means that it can be easily interpreted and assimilated by the user. Considering that a pattern is generally defined over a subgraph, a pattern can be often huge in terms of vertices, which makes it difficult to grasp. Thus, the assimilation cost of a pattern is an important question that needs to be addressed. The second challenge is the formalization of the pattern interestingness. A pattern is generally relevant if it depicts some local properties that are somehow exceptional, otherwise, it will be already expected from the overall properties of the graph. Furthermore, the interestingness of patterns is subjective in practice, i.e., it significantly depends on the final user, her background knowledge and her preferences. A user would consider that a pattern is useful if it brings some new knowledge to her, especially if this pattern informs about some features or topics that usually interest this user. Another common problem related to the interestingness of patterns is the redundancy issue in the result set. In other terms, a data mining approach may return a set of patterns that give redundant information, because these patterns cover very overlapping parts of vertices and attributes. Information redundancy can be also due to some semantic relation between different attributes, such as attribute hierarchies. For example, knowing that a community of a social network is characterized by a high interest in ``rock music'' makes it less informative that it also has a high interest in ``music'', because ``rock music'' is a subtype ``music''. Consequently, the quality of patterns depends on many different factors. \nWe address these challenges for the problem of mining attributed graphs. More precisely, we first introduce the task of discovering exceptional attributed subgraphs, which is rooted in the Subgroup Discovery framework. The goal is to identify connected subgraphs whose vertices share characteristics that distinguish them from the rest of the graph. Then, we propose methods that aim to take into account the user and the domain knowledge when assessing the interestingness of patterns. We design a method that makes it possible to incorporate user's background knowledge and pattern's assimilation cost. This method is able to identify patterns that are both unexpected (thus informative) and easy to interpret. To ease the assimilation, alternative descriptions of exceptional attributed subgraphs are provided. Furthermore, we propose another graph mining approach that integrates user's preferences. This method exploits an interactive process with the user to bias the pattern interestingness. It has been defined for the task of geo-located event detection in social media. Then, we design an approach that is able to incorporate hierarchical attribute dependencies into the pattern interestingness, which allows to avoid redundancy related to this kind of semantic relations between attributes. In other terms, when the attributes are organized as a hierarchy, this method is able to account for the inference that the user would make about some attribute values when she is informed about values of other attributes. Finally, we conclude this thesis by discussing some research perspectives.",

            "abstract": "Subgroup discovery (SD) is the task of discovering interpretable patterns in the data that stand out w.r.t. some property of interest. Discovering patterns that accurately discriminate a class from the others is one of the most common SD tasks. Standard approaches of the literature are based on local pattern discovery, which is known to provide an overwhelmingly large number of redundant patterns. To solve this issue, pattern set mining has been proposed: instead of evaluating the quality of patterns separately, one should consider the quality of a pattern set as a whole. The goal is to provide a small pattern set that is diverse and well-discriminant to~the target class. In this work, we introduce a novel formulation of the task of diverse subgroup set discovery where both discriminative power and diversity of the subgroup set are incorporated in the same quality measure. We propose an efficient and parameter-free algorithm dubbed FSSD and based on a greedy scheme. FSSD uses several optimization strategies that enable to efficiently provide a high quality pattern set in a short amount of time.",

            "abstract": "Community detection in graphs, data clustering, and local pattern mining \nare three mature fields of data mining and machine learning. \nIn recent years, attributed subgraph mining is emerging as a new \npowerful data mining task in the intersection of these areas. \n \nGiven a graph and a set of attributes for each vertex, \nattributed subgraph mining aims to find cohesive subgraphs \nfor which (a subset of) the attribute values has exceptional values in some sense. \nWhile research on this task can borrow from the three abovementioned fields, \nthe principled integration of graph and attribute data poses two challenges: \nthe definition of a pattern language that is intuitive and lends itself to efficient search strategies, \nand the formalization of the interestingness of such patterns. \n \nWe propose an integrated solution to both of these challenges. \nThe proposed pattern language improves upon prior work in being both highly flexible and intuitive. \nWe show how an effective and principled algorithm can enumerate patterns of this language. \nThe proposed approach for quantifying interestingness of patterns of this language \nis rooted in information theory, and is able to account for prior knowledge on the data. \n \nPrior work typically quantifies interestingness based on the cohesion of the subgraph \nand for the exceptionality of its attributes separately, \ncombining these in a parameterized trade-off. \nInstead, in our proposal this trade-off is implicitly handled in a principled, parameter-free manner. \n \nExtensive empirical results confirm the proposed pattern syntax is intuitive, \nand the interestingness measure aligns well with actual subjective interestingness.",
