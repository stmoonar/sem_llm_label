            "title": "EVKG: An interlinked and interoperable electric vehicle knowledge graph for smart transportation system",
            "abstract": "Over the past decade, the electric vehicle (EV) industry has experienced unprecedented growth and diversification, resulting in a complex ecosystem. To effectively manage this multifaceted field, we present an EV\u2010centric knowledge graph (EVKG) as a comprehensive, cross\u2010domain, extensible, and open geospatial knowledge management system. The EVKG encapsulates essential EV\u2010related knowledge, including EV adoption, EV supply equipment, and electricity transmission network, to support decision\u2010making related to EV technology development, infrastructure planning, and policy\u2010making by providing timely and accurate information and analysis. To enrich and contextualize the EVKG, we integrate the developed EV\u2010relevant ontology modules from existing well\u2010known knowledge graphs and ontologies. This integration enables interoperability with other knowledge graphs in the Linked Data Open Cloud, enhancing the EVKG's value as a knowledge hub for EV decision\u2010making. Using six competency questions, we demonstrate how the EVKG can be used to answer various types of EV\u2010related questions, providing critical insights into the EV ecosystem. Our EVKG provides an efficient and effective approach for managing the complex and diverse EV industry. By consolidating critical EV\u2010related knowledge into a single, easily accessible resource, the EVKG supports decision\u2010makers in making informed choices about EV technology development, infrastructure planning, and policy\u2010making. As a flexible and extensible platform, the EVKG is capable of accommodating a wide range of data sources, enabling it to evolve alongside the rapidly changing EV landscape.",

            "title": "On the Opportunities and Challenges of Foundation Models for Geospatial Artificial Intelligence",
            "abstract": "Large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), are trained in a task-agnostic manner on large-scale data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks by fine-tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning. Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific fully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing foundation models still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing a FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodality nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal foundation model which can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this paper by discussing the unique risks and challenges to develop such a model for GeoAI.",

            "title": "GeoKG'2022 Workshop Report: The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "The topic of knowledge graphs (KGs) has recently attracted extensive attention in both industry and academia. Knowledge graphs are a new paradigm for representing, retrieving, integrating, and reasoning data from highly heterogeneous and multimodal sources. For example, international conferences, such as the Knowledge Graph Conference, have emerged in the past years, not to mention the increasing number of specialized workshops on KGs co-located with major computer science conferences, including Knowledge Graph Workshop at KDD 2021, Workshop for Deep Learning in Knowledge Graphs at ISWC 2021, Workshop on Knowledge Graph Construction at ESWC 2021, to name but a few. Also, the number of KGs-related papers accepted at these major conferences, including SIGSPATIAL, is rapidly increasing. Meanwhile, we also witness the increasing popularity of knowledge graph technologies in geography, geoinformatics, and GIScience domains. There are growing numbers of knowledge graph-related manuscripts accepted to the top geospatial-related venues, such as the International Journal of Geographical Information Science, Transactions in GIS, the International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, and so on. Transactions in GIS also held two special issues about knowledge graphs: 1) Symbolic and Subsymbolic GeoAI: Geospatial Knowledge Graphs and Spatially Explicit Machine Learning [4], and 2) Knowledge-based GIS (K-GIS): Theories, Techniques and Applications. In addition, government agencies, industries, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also lifting resources on topics of exploring KGs to build up interdisciplinary science and applications. One example is NSF's Accelerate Convergence Program, which promotes the idea of building an Open Knowledge Network to harness the data revolution. Funded by this program, the KnowWhereGraph is presently among the largest geo-enabled knowledge graphs, which integrates 28 different data layers at the intersection between humans and their environment [2].",

Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Qualitative spatio-temporal reasoning (QSTR) plays a key role in spatial cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) research. In the past, research and applications of QSTR have often taken place in the context of declarative forms of knowledge representation. For instance, conceptual neighborhoods (CN) and composition tables (CT) of relations are introduced explicitly and utilized for spatial/temporal reasoning. Orthogonal to this line of study, we focus on bottom-up machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate QSTR. More specifically, we are interested in questions of whether similarities between qualitative relations can be learned from data purely based on ML models, and, if so, how these models differ from the ones studied by traditional approaches. To achieve this, we propose a graph-based approach to examine the similarity of relations by analyzing trained ML models. Using various experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the relationships discovered by ML models are well-aligned with CN structures introduced in the (theoretical) literature, for both spatial and temporal reasoning. Noticeably, even with significantly limited qualitative information for training, ML models are still able to automatically construct neighborhood structures. Moreover, patterns of asymmetric similarities between relations are disclosed using such a data-driven approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to automatically discover CNs without any domain knowledge. Our results can be applied to discovering CNs of any set of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) relations.",

            "abstract": "Standard taxonomies that are meant to serve as reference specifications of specific scientific domains are developed through extensive review by scientists and experts. For data integration and interoperability needs within Knowledge Graphs (KGs), these taxonomies must be translated into formal ontologies. In this paper we present an ontology design pattern for modeling a scientific taxonomy as an ontology. The focus of the pattern is to 1) capture temporal dynamics of concepts as taxonomies evolve, 2) model the provenance of concepts to add context and enable governance, 3) assist the translation of taxonomic relations to ontological relations appropriately that will empower their use within KGs, and 4) tag provenance and other metadata information to mappings or alignments of uncertainty between concepts in different ontologies.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Qualitative spatial reasoning has been a core research topic in GIScience and AI for decades. It has been adopted in a wide range of applications such as wayfinding, question answering, and robotics. Most developed spatial inference engines use symbolic representation and reasoning, which focuses on small and densely connected data sets, and struggles to deal with noise and vagueness. However, with more sensors becoming available, reasoning over spatial relations on large-scale and noisy geospatial data sets requires more robust alternatives. This paper, therefore, proposes a subsymbolic approach using neural networks to facilitate qualitative spatial reasoning. More specifically, we focus on higher-order spatial relations as those have been largely ignored due to the binary nature of the underlying representations, e.g. knowledge graphs. We specifically explore the use of neural networks to reason over ternary projective relations such as between. We consider multiple types of spatial constraint, including higher-order relatedness and the conceptual neighborhood of ternary projective relations to make the proposed model spatially explicit. We introduce evaluating results demonstrating that the proposed spatially explicit method substantially outperforms the existing baseline by about 20%.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a rapidly growing paradigm and technology stack for integrating large-scale, heterogeneous data in an AI-ready form, i.e., combining data with the formal semantics required to understand it. However, toolchains that support data synthesis and knowledge discovery through information organization, search, filtering, and visualization have been developed at a pace lagging knowledge graph technology. In this paper, we present Knowledge Explorer, an open-source faceted search interface that provides environmentally intelligent services for interactively browsing and navigating KnowWhereGraph. Currently one of the largest open knowledge graphs, KnowWhereGraph contains over 12 billion statements with rich spatial and temporal information from more than 30 data layers. With an extensive collection of facets, Knowledge Explorer enables spatial, temporal, full-text, and expert search with dereferencing functionality to support \"follow-your-nose\" exploration, and it allows users to narrow their search by selecting facets. Given the size of the underlying graph and dependency on GeoSPARQL, we have improved query performance by implementing Elasticsearch indexing, spatial query generation, and caching. Knowledge Explorer is capable of retrieving information within seconds, answering a wide variety of competency questions posed by researchers, humanitarian relief organizations, and the broader public, thus helping better perform tasks such as cross-gazetteer place retrieval and disaster assessment from global to local geographic scales.",

            "abstract": "Disasters are often unpredictable and complex events, requiring humanitarian organizations to understand and respond to many different issues simultaneously and immediately. Often the biggest challenge to improving the effectiveness of the response is quickly finding the right expert, with the right expertise concerning a specific disaster type/disaster and geographic region. To assist in achieving such a goal, this paper demonstrates a knowledge graph-based search engine developed on top of an expert knowledge graph. It accommodates three modes of information retrieval, including a follow-your-nose search, an expert similarity search, and a SPARQL query interface. We will demonstrate utilizing the system to rapidly navigate from a hazard event to a specific expert who may be helpful, for example. More importantly, as the data is fully integrated including links between hazards and their abstract topics, we can find experts who have relevant expertise while navigating the graph.",
