            "abstract": "The use of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has seen significant growth in the research community, industry, and society. Many of these agents are equipped with communication systems that are essential for completing certain tasks successfully. This has led to the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field at the intersection of robotics and communications, which has been further driven by the integration of UAVs into 5G and 6G communication networks. However, one of the main challenges in this research area is how many researchers tend to oversimplify either the robotics or the communications aspects, hindering the full potential of this new interdisciplinary field. In this paper, we present some of the necessary modeling tools for addressing these problems from both a robotics and communications perspective, using the UAV communications relay as an example.",

            "abstract": "With the rise of Deep Learning (DL), our world braces for AI in every edge device, creating an urgent need for edge-AI SoCs. This SoC hardware needs to support high throughput, reliable and secure AI processing at Ultra Low Power (ULP), with a very short time to market. With its strong legacy in edge solutions and open processing platforms, the EU is well-positioned to become a leader in this SoC market. However, this requires AI edge processing to become at least 100 times more energy-efficient, while offering sufficient flexibility and scalability to deal with AI as a fast-moving target. Since the design space of these complex SoCs is huge, advanced tooling is needed to make their design tractable. The CONVOLVE project (currently in Inital stage) addresses these roadblocks. It takes a holistic approach with innovations at all levels of the design hierarchy. Starting with an overview of SOTA DL processing support and our project methodology, this paper presents 8 important design choices largely impacting the energy efficiency and flexibility of DL hardware. Finding good solutions is key to making smart-edge computing a reality.",

            "abstract": "There has been significant interest in using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based methods for Automated Vehicular Surveillance (AVS) systems. Although these methods provide high accuracy, they are computationally expensive. On the other hand, Background Subtraction (BS)-based approaches are lightweight but provide insufficient information for tasks such as monitoring driving behavior and detecting traffic rules violations. In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the complexity of CNN-based AVS methods, where a BS-based module is introduced as a preprocessing step to optimize the number of convolution operations executed by the CNN module. The BS-based module generates image-candidates containing only moving objects. A CNN-based detector with the appropriate number of convolutions is then applied to each image-candidate to handle the overlapping problem and improve detection performance. Four state-of-the-art CNN-based detection architectures were benchmarked as base models of the detection cores to evaluate the proposed framework. The experiments were conducted using a large-scale dataset. The computational complexity reduction of the proposed framework increases with the complexity of the considered CNN model\u2019s architecture (e.g., 30.6% for YOLOv5s with 7.3M parameters; 52.2% for YOLOv5x with 87.7M parameters), without undermining accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed as a promising technology to collect data from IoT devices and relay it to the network. In this work, we are interested in scenarios where the data is updated periodically, and the collected updates are time-sensitive. In particular, the data updates may lose their value if they are not collected and analyzed timely. To maximize the data freshness, we optimize a new performance metric, namely the Age-of-Updates (AoU). Our objective is to carefully schedule the UAVs hovering positions and the users' association so that the AoU is minimized. Unlike existing works where the association parameters are considered as binary variables, we assume that devices send their updates according to a probability distribution. As a consequence, instead of optimizing a deterministic objective function, the objective function is replaced by an expectation over the probability distribution. The expected AoU is therefore optimized under quality of service and energy constraints. The original problem being non-convex, we propose an equivalent convex optimization that we solve using an interior-point method. Our simulation results show the performance of the proposed approach against a binary association.",

            "abstract": "With the booming growth of advanced digital technologies, it has become possible for users as well as distributors of energy to obtain detailed and timely information about the electricity consumption of households. These technologies can also be used to forecast the household\u2019s electricity consumption (a.k.a. the load). In this paper, we investigate the use of Variational Mode Decomposition and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the load forecasting problem. Although this problem has been studied in the literature, selecting an appropriate decomposition level and a deep learning technique providing better forecasting performance have garnered comparatively less attention. This study bridges this gap by studying the e \ufb00 ect of six decomposition levels and \ufb01ve distinct deep learning networks. The raw load pro\ufb01les are \ufb01rst decomposed into intrinsic mode functions using the Variational Mode Decomposition in order to mitigate their non-stationary aspect. Then, day, hour, and past electricity consumption data are fed as a three-dimensional input sequence to a four-level Wavelet Decomposition Network model. Finally, the forecast sequences related to the di \ufb00 erent intrinsic mode functions are combined to form the aggregate forecast sequence. The proposed method was assessed using load pro\ufb01les of \ufb01ve Moroccan households from the Moroccan buildings\u2019 electricity consumption dataset (MORED) and was benchmarked against state-of-the-art time-series models and a baseline persistence model.",

            "abstract": "Air pollution continues to draw global attention, and still causes adverse environmental issues and health effects. Questions about how air pollution evolves spatially are also still unsolved. Many air quality monitoring stations are deployed in several countries to give insight about air quality. However, it is quite frequent for these stations to go out of order during their long life time. These incidents may lead to a significant loss of pollution data. To mitigate this issue, we propose to leverage spatial correlation between pollution monitoring stations to predict the lost data. To reduce the complexity of the prediction model, for each monitoring station, we identify the best set of other stations to use in the prediction model. Correlation-based station selection is shown to outperform distance-based station selection and provides an R2 above 0.8 when applied to the Airparif datasets.",

            "abstract": "We propose a system for monitoring the headway and following distance using a roadside camera and deep learning-based computer vision techniques. The system is composed of a vehicle detector and tracker, a speed estimator and a headway estimator. Both motion-based and appearance-based methods for vehicle detection are investigated. Appearance-based methods using convolutional neural networks are found to be most appropriate given the high detection accuracy requirements of the system. Headway estimation is then carried out using the detected vehicles on a video sequence. The following distance estimation is carried out using the headway and speed estimations. We also propose methods to assess the performance of the headway and speed estimation processes. The proposed monitoring system has been applied to data that we have collected using a roadside camera. The root mean square error of the headway estimation is found to be around 0.045 seconds.",

This \u201cframework\u201d examines urban Big Data in the old medina of Sale in Morocco. The computational tools are more effective to provide insights within complexity, becoming a key to generate more efficient solutions throughout the design process. The findings of this study highlight the potential of a data driven approach to explore analytical aspects and move further to generative design using algorithms.",
