            "title": "Open Assistant Toolkit - version 2",
            "abstract": "We present the second version of the Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT-v2), an open-source task-oriented conversational system for composing generative neural models. OAT-v2 is a scalable and flexible assistant platform supporting multiple domains and modalities of user interaction. It splits processing a user utterance into modular system components, including submodules such as action code generation, multimodal content retrieval, and knowledge-augmented response generation. Developed over multiple years of the Alexa TaskBot challenge, OAT-v2 is a proven system that enables scalable and robust experimentation in experimental and real-world deployment. OAT-v2 provides open models and software for research and commercial applications to enable the future of multimodal virtual assistants across diverse applications and types of rich interaction.",
