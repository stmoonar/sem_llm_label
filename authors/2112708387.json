            "title": "Band Selection of Hyperspectral Images Using Attention-Based Autoencoders",
            "abstract": "Band selection is an effective method to reduce redundancy in a hyperspectral image (HSI) without compromising the original contents. Popular band selection methods usually use strong assumptions, such as linear or nonlinear assumptions with simple predefined Kernel functions, to model the correlations between bands. However, this kind of strong assumption may not valid in the real environment due to the complex interactions between bands. In this letter, we treat hyperspectral band selection as a spectral reconstruction task. By assuming that an HSI can be sparsely reconstructed from a few informative bands, we propose an attention-based autoencoder to model the underlying nonlinear interdependencies between bands. The proposed model consists of two parts: an attention module and an autoencoder. The attention module is used to produce the attention mask which selects the most informative bands for every pixel. The autoencoder uses these informative bands to reconstruct the raw HSI. The final band selection is conducted via clustering column vectors of the attention mask and exploring the most representative band for each cluster. Different from most of the existing band selection methods, the proposed method directly learns global nonlinear correlations between bands without strong assumptions. The proposed model is easy to implement and all the parameters can be jointly optimized using the stochastic gradient descend algorithm. Experiments on three open public data sets show that the proposed method offers the promising results.",

            "title": "On-Orbit MTF Estimation for GF-4 Satellite Using Spatial Multisampling on a New Target",
            "abstract": "GF-(Gaofen- means high resolution in Chinese) satellite launched in 2015 is the first geosynchronous orbit remote sensing satellite in China. To evaluate the on-orbit modulation transfer function (MTF) of the space-borne panchromatic camera in GF-4, a modified pulse target is proposed. This new type target is laid in the uniform low-reflection background region whose center region is a high-reflection square with the size of 3 ~ 4 ground sampled distance (GSD), and then two low-reflection rectangle stripes are extended along the center square toward both ends with the length over 4 GSD. In consideration of the staring imaging mechanism of GF-4, the target image sequences are accessed with relative random distance taken by the space-borne camera in a short period to reduce accidental error of one sampling and enhance the accuracy of estimation. Based on the multi-sampling calibrating images, maximum a posteriori estimation model and gradient descent solution with grid searching method are used to fit the pulse response function (PRF) when taking the target center positions as references. MTF is then calculated from PRF via Fourier transformation. Numerical simulation results reveal our method can keep the accuracy stable despite of different kinds of noise. Actual calibration result using this method shows that on-orbit MTF of GF-4 camera at Nyquist frequency is 0.1473.",

            "title": "Variable Exponent Regularization Approach for Blur Kernel Estimation of Remote Sensing Image Blind Restoration",
            "abstract": "Spatial remote sensing images are usually degraded during image capturing procedures mainly due to the mixed factors of atmospheric turbulence, spacecraft motion, and out of focus lenses. The real point spread function (PSF) of the whole imaging system is the convolution of all factors contributing to degradation. The exact degradation PSF model estimation is important for the image restoration result. In this paper, we considered the properties of the mixed degradation factors and proposed a new blind deconvolution model to simultaneously estimate and remove blurs from remote sensing images. Inconsistent with existing models, which mainly focus on only one degradation type and estimate blur kernel parameters using the fixed regularizer, we concentrated on the diversity of different PSF types and used the variable exponent regularizer to improve kernel flexibility. The proposed model could estimate not only single PSF types, such as motion, uniform, and Gaussian, but also composite PSFs of different types. Following the split Bregman method, we employed an efficient computational method, which did not require PSF initial values, to minimize the proposed cost function iteratively. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for simulated and real remote sensing images with different PSFs\u2019 types.",

            "abstract": "During traditional multi-resolution infrared and visible image fusion processing, the low contrast ratio target may be weakened and become inconspicuous because of the opposite DN values in the source images. So a novel target pseudo-color enhanced image fusion algorithm based on the modified attention model and fast discrete curvelet transformation is proposed. The interesting target regions are extracted from source images by introducing the motion features gained from the modified attention model, and source images are performed the gray fusion via the rules based on physical characteristics of sensors in curvelet domain. The final fusion image is obtained by mapping extracted targets into the gray result with the proper pseudo-color instead. The experiments show that the algorithm can highlight dim targets effectively and improve SNR of fusion image.",

            "abstract": "On-orbit Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is an important indicator to evaluate the performance of the optical remote sensors in a satellite. There are many methods to estimate MTF, such as pinhole method, slit method and so on. Among them, knife-edge method is quite efficient, easy-to-use and recommended in ISO12233 standard for the wholefrequency MTF curve acquisition. However, the accuracy of the algorithm is affected by Edge Spread Function (ESF) fitting accuracy significantly, which limits the range of application. So in this paper, an optimized knife-edge method using Powell algorithm is proposed to improve the ESF fitting precision. Fermi function model is the most popular ESF fitting model, yet it is vulnerable to the initial values of the parameters. Considering the characteristics of simple and fast convergence, Powell algorithm is applied to fit the accurate parameters adaptively with the insensitivity to the initial parameters. Numerical simulation results reveal the accuracy and robustness of the optimized algorithm under different SNR, edge direction and leaning angles conditions. Experimental results using images of the camera in ZY-3 satellite show that this method is more accurate than the standard knife-edge method of ISO12233 in MTF estimation.",
