            "abstract": "PurposeAs the quality of the environment decreases, enterprises and consumers' awareness of environmental protection is constantly improving. More and more enterprises begin to increase their investment in carbon emission reduction and attract environmentally friendly consumers to buy low-carbon products through advertising. The purpose of this paper is to utilize a realistic differential game model to provide dynamic carbon emission reduction strategies, advertising strategies and cooperation methods for complex supply chain members from a long-term perspective.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses the extend Vidale-Wolfe model (V-W model) to discuss the dynamic joint emission reduction strategy in the supply chain.Findings(1) When consumers' awareness of environmental protection increases, on the whole, carbon emission reduction and profit of products show an upward trend. (2) From a long-term perspective, the manufacturer's advertising subsidy to one of the retailers is the best choice. If the strength of the two retailers is unbalanced, the manufacturer will choose to cooperate with the dominant retailer. (3) Advertising, as a marketing means for retailers to promote low-carbon products, can alleviate the adverse effects of prisoner's dilemma in a semi-cooperative state, but it cannot achieve the Pareto optimization result.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper focuses on the analysis of the situation that when the manufacturer is the leader and thinks that consumers are active advocates of low-carbon products.Originality/valueThe results of this paper can provide theoretical basis for the joint emission strategy of supply chain members in low-carbon environment.",

            "abstract": "To overcome challenges like market dynamic configuration, information integration, and quick response, it is necessary to build an efficient, stable, and well-coordinated supply chain relationship for cruise ship supply. This requires building of a solid evaluation index system of logistics service providers (LSPs) in the cruise ship supply chain. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation index system that consists of four dimensions, based on the characteristics of cruise ship supply and the connotation and type of cruise ship supply LSPs. The four dimensions are business level, collaborative capacity, service price, and information level, including ten subcriteria. We first establish an evaluation decision model for the interdependence and feedback relationship between the criteria by using analytic network process (ANP) for weight definition of each index; then, we use Super Decisions software to simulate the results, combine RBF neural network training and validation, and extract implicit knowledge and laws. We propose an incremental algorithm that can effectively avoid the influence of subjective factors and increase the dynamic nature of evaluation. The results show that the ANP-RBF method has strong practicability in the evaluation of cruise ship supply LSPs.",

Therefore, it is important to make optimal investment decisions for investors and consumers. This paper proposes an improved group decision-making method which integrates the cumulative prospect theory and Choquet integral for the investment options of small-scale PV systems. From the perspective of sustainability, the alternatives are evaluated by four criteria, including economic benefits, solar energy condition, carbon emissions and social benefits. Since the performances of criteria are given by decision makers as linguistic variables, the proposed method measures the criteria values by intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Then the alternatives are evaluated and ranked to determine the optimal option. Finally, the proposed method is implemented in a case study to illustrate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

The Quasi-Monte Carlo method is used to transform the optimization objective function with uncertainties of WP into an effective objective function to eliminate the influence of uncertain factors of WP. In the optimization process, low-bias sequence is introduced to improve the uniformity of sample distribution, and the optimal solution of the coordination optimization model is searched by robust optimization algorithm. The comparison experiment shows that the proposed coordinated optimization method still has strong robustness, can effectively reduce the abandonment of wind and achieve the goal of WP consumption.",

Therefore, optimizing the purchasing process can not only save costs for cruise companies but also improve cruise level service. Aiming at the purchasing characteristics and modes of cruise ship supply, an optimization model of multi-item joint ordering is constructed under global cruise ship supply chain, considering different order cycles, integrated operation of purchase, delivery, and inventory based on a cruise distribution center. And an improved swarm intelligence algorithm, called fireworks algorithm with inertia weight (WFWA), is proposed for global optimization of the objective function. By comparing the optimization results with fireworks algorithm (FWA), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) through experimental tests, it demonstrates that WFWA has higher optimization accuracy and better global convergence.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Due to the globalization of cruise tourism, in the early stage of cruise liner operation, contracting purchases with suppliers in advance incurs cost savings due to price reduction for the first replenishment of food and beverage (F&B) items. To meet the onboard customer demand of a cruise liner and deal with uncertainty in demand, the second replenishment is conducted from a spot market at an intermediate port if needed. Applying Bayesian updating theory to cases of incomplete information, this article studies the optimal strategy for two-stage replenishment in cruise liner operations, based on updating demand information under dynamic demand, and establishes a model with two-stage profit maximization as the objective function. Then, incomplete information updating theory is applied to assist in solving this problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to analyse the influence of parameter variation on the sensitivity of the results. The results show that an effective replenishment strategy for cruise ships must take into consideration the trade-offs between both replenishment approaches under different parameters.",

            "abstract": "This paper considers the co\u2010optimization operation problem of the multiple micro energy grids (MEGs), and proposes a novel concept of the flexible boundary. Then, a three\u2010level co\u2010optimization model of reconfiguration, dispatching, and reserve is designed considering different time scales. Furthermore, an improved ant colony algorithm based on the information entropy and the chaotic search is proposed. The Shenzhen international low\u2010carbon park in China is selected as an example. The results show that: (a) The capacity configuration scheme considering the flexible boundary conditions could decrease the reserve capacity of power, heating, and cooling from the upper energy grid, namely, 75%, 50%, and 75%, and delay 537\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u00a5 the investment cost of the new capacity by utilizing the complementary characteristics between different MEGs. (b) The proposed three\u2010level co\u2010optimization model could establish the multi\u2010level optimal cooperative operation schemes of multi\u2010MEGs and decrease the reserve power from the upper energy grid and incentive\u2010based demand response. Among them, UPG provides MEG 1, MEG 2, and MEG 3 with cooling load reserve capacity reduction of 53.95, 85.44, and 38.3\u2009kw\u2009h. The positive reserve provided by IBDR for MEG 1, MEG 2, and MEG 3 decreased by 30.53, 20.21, and 52\u2009kW\u2009h. (c) The proposed improved ant colony algorithm can consider the operational characteristics of each energy entity in different stages of multi\u2010MEGs and obtain the global optimal operation scheme. Compared the traditional ant colony algorithm, the average convergence times decrease by 18% and the optimization degree of the objective value increase by 12.38%. (d) The sensitivity analysis shows the conditional value at risk method can formulate the optimal dispatching schemes of multi\u2010MEGs according to the risk attitudes of decision makers. When confidence degree is between 0.3 and 0.8, the decision\u2010makers have a high\u2010risk sensitivity and are more willing to avoid uncertain risks of wind power plant and photovoltaic power. Overall, the proposed model and solution algorithm could achieve the optimal operation strategy of the micro energy grids.",

            "abstract": "In order to reduce the randomness of wind power and improve system consumption capacity, a jointly scheduling optimization model with energy storage systems (ESSs) and carbon emission trade (CET) is introduced. Firstly, the basic scheduling model for wind power and thermal power is established with the objective function of the maximum system benefit considering system operation constraints. Secondly, the carbon emission cost model for thermal power generation and the ESSs\u2019 operation profit model are established, respectively. System comprehensive scheduling objective function considering CET and ESSs is also presented. Thirdly, the jointly scheduling model for wind power and thermal power considering ESSs\u2019 operation condition, CET condition and newly system reserve condition are taken into consideration. Finally, the simulation system with 10 thermal power units and 2800MW wind power turbines is proposed. The results show the large-scale wind power grid connection relies on thermal power to provide reserve service, which could reduce unit utilization efficiency and the overall coal consumption rate. The cleaning characteristics of wind power could be transformed into economic benefits by CET, which will promote wind power consumption and reduce abandoned wind power. The charge-discharge characteristics of ESSs could smooth load curve and enlarge the grid-connected space of wind power. However, the overall benefit reduces due to ESS\u2019s high fixed costs. The system overall benefit reaches the maximum when ESSs and CET are simultaneously introduced, which indicates ESS and CET have synergistic optimization effect.",

Firstly, the paper takes the maximum system benefit as the objective function considering load supply and demand balance constraint, unit operation constraint and system reserve constraints, establishes the basic scheduling mathematical model for wind power and thermal power. Secondly, the paper respectively builds carbon emission cost model of thermal power generation considering CET, ESSs\u2019 operation profit model and puts forward system scheduling comprehensive objective function considering CET and ESSs. Thirdly, the paper constructs jointly scheduling model for wind power and thermal power considering ESSs\u2019 operation constraints, CET\u2019s constraint and newly system reserve constraint. Finally, 10 thermal power units and 2800MW wind power turbine are taken as simulation system. The result shows: the large-scale grid connection of wind power needs rely on thermal power units to provide reserve, which could result in the reduction of unit utilization efficiency and correspondingly increase coal consumption of units\u2019 power generation, but system overall coal consumption rate will reduce. CET can transform wind power cleaning characteristics into economic benefits, promote system to consume wind power and reduce abandoned wind power. ESSs can gentle the electric load curve and improve the grid-connected space by adjusting its charge and discharge characteristics, but system overall benefit reduces subjected to high ESSs\u2019 fixed costs. System overall benefit will reaches maximum when ESSs and CET are simultaneously introduced, which indicates that they have synergistic optimization effect.",
