            "title": "An Empirical Examination of Balancing Strategy for Counterfactual Estimation on Time Series",
            "abstract": "Counterfactual estimation from observations represents a critical endeavor in numerous application fields, such as healthcare and finance, with the primary challenge being the mitigation of treatment bias. The balancing strategy aimed at reducing covariate disparities between different treatment groups serves as a universal solution. However, when it comes to the time series data, the effectiveness of balancing strategies remains an open question, with a thorough analysis of the robustness and applicability of balancing strategies still lacking. This paper revisits counterfactual estimation in the temporal setting and provides a brief overview of recent advancements in balancing strategies. More importantly, we conduct a critical empirical examination for the effectiveness of the balancing strategies within the realm of temporal counterfactual estimation in various settings on multiple datasets. Our findings could be of significant interest to researchers and practitioners and call for a reexamination of the balancing strategy in time series settings.",

            "title": "Estimating Treatment Effects from Irregular Time Series Observations with Hidden Confounders",
            "abstract": "Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real world time series, i.e., large-scale irregular or sparse and intermittent time series, raise significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of temporal counterfactual outcomes from observed history is crucial for decision-making in many domains such as healthcare and e-commerce, particularly when randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suffer from high cost or impracticality. For real-world datasets, modeling time-dependent confounders is challenging due to complex dynamics, long-range dependencies and both past treatments and covariates affecting the future outcomes. In this paper, we introduce Counterfactual Self-Supervised Transformer (COSTAR), a novel approach that integrates self-supervised learning for improved historical representations. We propose a component-wise contrastive loss tailored for temporal treatment outcome observations and explain its effectiveness from the view of unsupervised domain adaptation. COSTAR yields superior performance in estimation accuracy and generalization to out-of-distribution data compared to existing models, as validated by empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Spatiotemporal data aggregated over regions or time windows at various resolutions demonstrate heterogeneous patterns and dynamics in each resolution. Meanwhile, the multi-resolution characteristic provides rich contextual information, which is critical for effective long-sequence forecasting. The importance of such inter-resolution information is more significant in practical cases, where fine-grained data is usually collected via approaches with lower costs but also lower qualities compared to those for coarse-grained data. However, existing works focus on uni-resolution data and cannot be directly applied to fully utilize the aforementioned extra information in multi-resolution data. In this work, we propose Spatiotemporal Koopman Multi-Resolution Network (ST-KMRN), a physics-informed learning framework for long-sequence forecasting from multi-resolution spatiotemporal data. Our method jointly models data aggregated in multiple resolutions and captures the inter-resolution dynamics with the self-attention mechanism. We also propose downsampling and upsampling modules among resolutions to further strengthen the connections among data of multiple resolutions. Moreover, we enhance the modeling of intra-resolution dynamics with physics-informed modules based on Koopman theory. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the best performance on the long-sequence forecasting tasks compared to baselines without a specific design for multi-resolution data.",

However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of dataset representation bias as well as interpretability and prediction fairness of deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction. In terms of interpretability, we observe that (1) the best-performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models; (2) demographic features are important for prediction. In terms of fairness, we observe that (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) all of the studied mortality predictors are generally fair while the IMV-LSTM (Interpretable Multi-Variable Long Short-Term Memory) model provides the most accurate and unbiased predictions across all protected groups. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors.",

            "abstract": "Vast amount of data generated from networks of sensors, wearables, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for advanced modeling techniques that leverage the spatio-temporal structure of decentralized data due to the need for edge computation and licensing (data access) issues. While federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without requiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints on data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while incurring modest communication cost.",

To effectively leverage the network correlations between labeled and unlabeled relationships to predict trust relationships, we formalize trust into multiple types and propose a graphical model to incorporate type-based dyadic and triadic correlations, namely eTrust. We also present a fast learning algorithm in order to handle billion-scale networks. Systematically, we evaluate the proposed methods on four different genres of datasets with labeled trust relationships: Alibaba, Epinions, Ciao, and Advogato.

            "title": "Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning",
            "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited. The scarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data distribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the knowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of the data can be helpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to exactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems. In this work, we propose a framework, physics-aware meta-learning with auxiliary tasks, whose spatial modules incorporate PDE-independent knowledge and temporal modules utilize the generalized features from the spatial modules to be adapted to the limited data, respectively. The framework is inspired by a local conservation law expressed mathematically as a continuity equation and does not require the exact form of governing equation to model the spatiotemporal observations. The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of real-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in simulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules. We apply the proposed framework to both synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal prediction tasks and demonstrate its superior performance with limited observations.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the interconnected-ness of our present-day globalized world. With social distancing policies in place, virtual communication has become an important source of (mis)information. As increasing number of people rely on social media platforms for news, identifying misinformation has emerged as a critical task in these unprecedented times. In addition to being malicious, the spread of such information poses a serious public health risk. To this end, we design a dashboard to track misinformation on popular social media news sharing platform - Twitter. Our dashboard allows visibility into the social media discussions around Coronavirus and the quality of information shared on the platform as the situation evolves. We collect streaming data using the Twitter API from March 1, 2020 to date and provide analysis of topic clusters and social sentiments related to important emerging policies such as \"#socialdistancing\" and \"#workfromhome\". We track emerging hashtags over time, and provide location and time sensitive analysis of sentiments. In addition, we study the challenging problem of misinformation on social media, and provide a detection method to identify false, misleading and clickbait contents from Twitter information cascades. The dashboard maintains an evolving list of detected misinformation cascades with the corresponding detection scores, accessible online athttps://ksharmar.this http URL.",
