            "abstract": "Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.",

            "title": "Look into the Future: Deep Contextualized Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to estimate how a user's interests evolve over time via uncovering valuable patterns from user behavior history. Many previous sequential models have solely relied on users' historical information to model the evolution of their interests, neglecting the crucial role that future information plays in accurately capturing these dynamics. However, effectively incorporating future information in sequential modeling is non-trivial since it is impossible to make the current-step prediction for any target user by leveraging his future data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of sequential recommendation called Look into the Future (LIFT), which builds and leverages the contexts of sequential recommendation. In LIFT, the context of a target user's interaction is represented based on i) his own past behaviors and ii) the past and future behaviors of the retrieved similar interactions from other users. As such, the learned context will be more informative and effective in predicting the target user's behaviors in sequential recommendation without temporal data leakage. Furthermore, in order to exploit the intrinsic information embedded within the context itself, we introduce an innovative pretraining methodology incorporating behavior masking. In our extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, LIFT achieves significant performance improvement on click-through rate prediction and rating prediction tasks in sequential recommendation over strong baselines, demonstrating that retrieving and leveraging relevant contexts from the global user pool greatly benefits sequential recommendation.

            "abstract": "Extending from sequential recommendation models, in this paper, we present a novel framework named Search-based Time-Aware Recommendation (STARec), which first retrieves the historical behaviors of the given user through a search-based retriever, and then captures the user\u2019s evolving demands over time through a time-aware sequential network. We notice that the key insight of STARec is to use the feature and labels to augment the representations, and thus the effectiveness of STARec relies on the acquisition of rich browsing records of the target user and powerful representation of each browsed item and thus its performance could heavily drop regarding long-tail users and items. To this end, we extend STARec by constructing a graph upon the user-item interactions and leveraging the graph structure to enhance the representation learning. We call this extended version Search-based Time-Aware Graph-Enhanced Recommendation (STAGE). We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and STARec achieves consistent superiority. We further compare STAGE against STARec long-tail users and our results demonstrate that STAGE could outperform STARec at most cases. Results of online A/B tests show that STARec and STAGE achieve an average CTR improvement of around 6% and 1.5% in the two main item recommendation scenarios respectively.",

            "abstract": "Data science is concerned with mining data patterns from a database, which is assembled by tabular data. As the routine of machine learning, most of the previous work mining the tabular data's pattern based on a single instance. However, they neglect the similar tabular data instances that could help make the label prediction of the target data instance. Recently, some retrieval-based methods for tabular data label prediction have been proposed, which, however, treat the data as sparse vectors to perform the retrieval, which fails to make use of the semantic information of the tabular data. To address such a problem, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of dense retrieval on tabular data (DERT) to support flexible data representation learning and effective label prediction on tabular data. DERT consists of two major components: (i) the encoder that makes the tabular data as embeddings, which could be trained by flexible neural networks and auxiliary loss functions; (ii) the retrieval and prediction component, which makes use of similar rows in the table to make label prediction of the target row. We test DERT on two tasks based on five real-world datasets and experimental results show that DERT achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art and various baselines.",

            "abstract": "User response prediction, which models the user preference w.r.t. the presented items, plays a key role in online services. With two-decade rapid development, nowadays the cumulated user behavior sequences on mature Internet service platforms have become extremely long since the user's first registration. Each user not only has intrinsic tastes, but also keeps changing her personal interests during lifetime. Hence, it is challenging to handle such lifelong sequential modeling for each individual user. Existing methodologies for sequential modeling are only capable of dealing with relatively recent user behaviors, which leaves huge space for modeling long-term especially lifelong sequential patterns to facilitate user modeling. Moreover, one user's behavior may be accounted for various previous behaviors within her whole online activity history, i.e., long-term dependency with multi-scale sequential patterns. In order to tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Periodic Memory Network for lifelong sequential modeling with personalized memorization of sequential patterns for each user. The model also adopts a hierarchical and periodical updating mechanism to capture multi-scale sequential patterns of user interests while supporting the evolving user behavior logs. The experimental results over three large-scale real-world datasets have demonstrated the advantages of our proposed model with significant improvement in user response prediction performance against the state-of-the-arts.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of real-time auction in online advertising has drawn huge attention of modeling the market competition, i.e., bid landscape forecasting. The problem is formulated as to forecast the probability distribution of market price for each ad auction. With the consideration of the censorship issue which is caused by the second-price auction mechanism, many researchers have devoted their efforts on bid landscape forecasting by incorporating survival analysis from medical research field. However, most existing solutions mainly focus on either counting-based statistics of the segmented sample clusters, or learning a parameterized model based on some heuristic assumptions of distribution forms. Moreover, they neither consider the sequential patterns of the feature over the price space. In order to capture more sophisticated yet flexible patterns at fine-grained level of the data, we propose a Deep Landscape Forecasting (DLF) model which combines deep learning for probability distribution forecasting and survival analysis for censorship handling. Specifically, we utilize a recurrent neural network to flexibly model the conditional winning probability w.r.t. each bid price. Then we conduct the bid landscape forecasting through probability chain rule with strict mathematical derivations. And, in an end-to-end manner, we optimize the model by minimizing two negative likelihood losses with comprehensive motivations. Without any specific assumption for the distribution form of bid landscape, our model shows great advantages over previous works on fitting various sophisticated market price distributions. In the experiments over two large-scale real-world datasets, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions under various metrics.",

            "abstract": "Survival analysis is a hotspot in statistical research for modeling time-to-event information with data censorship handling, which has been widely used in many applications such as clinical research, information system and other fields with survivorship bias. Many works have been proposed for survival analysis ranging from traditional statistic methods to machine learning models. However, the existing methodologies either utilize counting-based statistics on the segmented data, or have a pre-assumption on the event probability distribution w.r.t. time. Moreover, few works consider sequential patterns within the feature space. In this paper, we propose a Deep Recurrent Survival Analysis model which combines deep learning for conditional probability prediction at finegrained level of the data, and survival analysis for tackling the censorship. By capturing the time dependency through modeling the conditional probability of the event for each sample, our method predicts the likelihood of the true event occurrence and estimates the survival rate over time, i.e., the probability of the non-occurrence of the event, for the censored data. Meanwhile, without assuming any specific form of the event probability distribution, our model shows great advantages over the previous works on fitting various sophisticated data distributions. In the experiments on the three realworld tasks from different fields, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions under various metrics.",

            "abstract": "We introduce Texygen, a benchmarking platform to support research on open-domain text generation models. Texygen has not only implemented a majority of text generation models, but also covered a set of metrics that evaluate the diversity, the quality and the consistency of the generated texts. The Texygen platform could help standardize the research on text generation and improve the reproductivity and reliability of future research work in text generation.",
