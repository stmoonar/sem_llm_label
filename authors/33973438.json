            "abstract": "Knowledge Bases (KBs) find applications in many knowledge-intensive tasks and, most notably, in information retrieval. Wikidata is one of the largest public general-purpose KBs. Yet, its collaborative nature has led to a convoluted schema and taxonomy. The YAGO 4 KB cleaned up the taxonomy by incorporating the ontology of Schema.org, resulting in a cleaner structure amenable to automated reasoning. However, it also cut away large parts of the Wikidata taxonomy, which is essential for information retrieval. In this paper, we extend YAGO 4 with a large part of the Wikidata taxonomy - while respecting logical constraints and the distinction between classes and instances. This yields YAGO 4.5, a new, logically consistent version of YAGO that adds a rich layer of informative classes. An intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation show the value of the new resource.",

The paper presents Casual Learn , an application that proposes ubiquitous learning tasks about Cultural Heritage. Casual Learn leverages a dataset of 10,000 contextualized learning tasks that were semi-automatically generated out of open data from the Web. Casual Learn offers these tasks to learners according to their physical location. For example, it may suggest describing the characteristics of the Gothic style when passing by a Gothic Cathedral. Additionally, Casual Learn has an interactive mode where learners can geo-search available tasks.",

            "abstract": "Representation Learning of words and Knowledge Graphs (KG) into low dimensional vector spaces along with its applications to many real-world scenarios have recently gained momentum. In order to make use of multiple KG embeddings for knowledge-driven applications such as question answering, named entity disambiguation, knowledge graph completion, etc., alignment of different KG embedding spaces is necessary. In addition to multilinguality and domain-specific information, different KGs pose the problem of structural differences making the alignment of the KG embeddings more challenging. This paper provides a theoretical analysis and comparison of the state-of-the-art alignment methods between two embedding spaces representing entity-entity and entity-word. This paper also aims at assessing the capability and short-comings of the existing alignment methods on the pretext of different applications.",

Hence, the completeness and correctness of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are vital. Most of these KGs are mostly created either via an automated information extraction from Wikipedia snapshots or information accumulation provided by the users or using heuristics. However, it has been observed that the type information of these KGs is often noisy, incomplete, and incorrect. To deal with this problem a multi-label classification approach is proposed in this work for entity typing using KG embeddings. We compare our approach with the current state-of-the-art type prediction method and report on experiments with the KGs.",

These descriptions of entities provide valuable information that may not be explicitly represented in the structured part of the KG. Based on this fact, some link prediction methods which make use of the information presented in the textual descriptions of entities have been proposed to learn representations of (monolingual) KGs. However, these methods use entity descriptions in only one language and ignore the fact that descriptions given in different languages may provide complementary information and thereby also additional semantics.
