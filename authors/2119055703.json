            "title": "Ranking with submodular functions on the fly",
            "abstract": "Maximizing submodular functions have been studied extensively for a wide range of subset-selection problems. However, much less attention has been given to the role of submodularity in sequence-selection and ranking problems. A recently-introduced framework, named \\emph{maximum submodular ranking} (MSR), tackles a family of ranking problems that arise naturally when resources are shared among multiple demands with different budgets. For example, the MSR framework can be used to rank web pages for multiple user intents. In this paper, we extend the MSR framework in the streaming setting. In particular, we consider two different streaming models and we propose practical approximation algorithms. In the first streaming model, called \\emph{function arriving}, we assume that submodular functions (demands) arrive continuously in a stream, while in the second model, called \\emph{item arriving}, we assume that items (resources) arrive continuously. Furthermore, we study the MSR problem with additional constraints on the output sequence, such as a matroid constraint that can ensure fair exposure among items from different groups. These extensions significantly broaden the range of problems that can be captured by the MSR framework. On the practical side, we develop several novel applications based on the MSR formulation, and empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed~methods.",

            "abstract": "Computing the convolution $A \\star B$ of two vectors of dimension $n$ is one of the most important computational primitives in many fields. For the non-negative convolution scenario, the classical solution is to leverage the Fast Fourier Transform whose time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$. However, the vectors $A$ and $B$ could be very sparse and we can exploit such property to accelerate the computation to obtain the result. In this paper, we show that when $\\|A \\star B\\|_{\\geq c_1} = k$ and $\\|A \\star B\\|_{\\leq c_2} = n-k$ holds, we can approximately recover the all index in $\\mathrm{supp}_{\\geq c_1}(A \\star B)$ with point-wise error of $o(1)$ in $O(k \\log (n) \\log(k)\\log(k/\\delta))$ time. We further show that we can iteratively correct the error and recover all index in $\\mathrm{supp}_{\\geq c_1}(A \\star B)$ correctly in $O(k \\log(n) \\log^2(k) (\\log(1/\\delta) + \\log\\log(k)))$ time.",

            "abstract": "One of the most fundamental tasks in data science is to assist a user with unknown preferences in finding high-utility tuples within a large database. To accurately elicit the unknown user preferences, a widely-adopted way is by asking the user to compare pairs of tuples. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying one or more high-utility tuples by adaptively receiving user input on a minimum number of pairwise comparisons. We devise a single-pass streaming algorithm, which processes each tuple in the stream at most once, while ensuring that the memory size and the number of requested comparisons are in the worst case logarithmic in n, where n is the number of all tuples. An important variant of the problem, which can help to reduce human error in comparisons, is to allow users to declare ties when confronted with pairs of tuples of nearly equal utility. We show that the theoretical guarantees of our method can be maintained for this important problem variant. In addition, we show how to enhance existing pruning techniques in the literature by leveraging powerful tools from mathematical programming. Finally, we systematically evaluate all proposed algorithms over both synthetic and real-life datasets, examine their scalability, and demonstrate their superior performance over existing methods.",

            "title": "Coresets remembered and items forgotten: submodular maximization with deletions",
            "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed an increase on the development of methods for submodular optimization, which have been motivated by the wide applicability of submodular functions in real-world data-science problems. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by considering the problem of robust submodular maximization against unexpected deletions, which may occur due to privacy issues or user preferences. Specifically, we consider the minimum number of items an algorithm has to remember, in order to achieve a non-trivial approximation guarantee against adversarial deletion of up to d items. We refer to the set of items that an algorithm has to keep before adversarial deletions as a deletion-robust coreset.Our theoretical contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a single- pass streaming algorithm that yields a(1-2$\\epsilon$)/(4 p)-approximation for maximizing a non-decreasing submodular function under a general p-matroid constraint and requires a coreset of size k+ d/$\\epsilon$, where k is the maximum size of a feasible solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve an (asymptotically) optimal coreset, as no constant-factor approximation is possible with a coreset of size sublinear in $d.$ Second, we devise an effective offline algorithm that guarantees stronger approximation ratios with a coreset of size $O(d\\log(k)/\\epsilon)$. We also demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms in real-life applications.",

            "abstract": "Maximum diversity aims at selecting a diverse set of high-quality objects from a collection, which is a fundamental problem and has a wide range of applications, e.g., in Web search. Diversity under a uniform or partition matroid constraint naturally describes useful cardinality or budget requirements, and admits simple approximation algorithms. When applied to clustered data, however, popular algorithms such as picking objects iteratively and performing local search lose their approximation guarantees towards maximum intra-cluster diversity because they fail to optimize the objective in a global manner. We propose an algorithm that greedily adds a pair of objects instead of a singleton, % with respect to some intuitive measure at a time, and which attains a constant approximation factor over clustered data. We further extend the algorithm to the case of monotone and submodular quality function, and under a partition matroid constraint. We also devise a technique to make our algorithm scalable, and on the way we obtain a modification that gives better solutions in practice while maintaining the approximation guarantee in theory. Our algorithm achieves excellent performance, compared to strong baselines in a mix of synthetic and real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "While machine-learning models are flourishing and transforming many aspects of everyday life, the inability of humans to understand complex models poses difficulties for these models to be fully trusted and embraced. Thus, interpretability of models has been recognized as an equally important quality as their predictive power. In particular, rule-based systems are experiencing a renaissance owing to their intuitive if-then representation. However, simply being rule-based does not ensure interpretability. For example, overlapped rules spawn ambiguity and hinder interpretation. Here we propose a novel approach of inferring diverse rule sets, by optimizing small overlap among decision rules with a 2-approximation guarantee under the framework of Max-Sum diversification. We formulate the problem as maximizing a weighted sum of discriminative quality and diversity of a rule set. In order to overcome an exponential-size search space of association rules, we investigate several natural options for a small candidate set of high-quality rules, including frequent and accurate rules, and examine their hardness. Leveraging the special structure in our formulation, we then devise an efficient randomized algorithm, which samples rules that are highly discriminative and have small overlap. The proposed sampling algorithm analytically targets a distribution of rules that is tailored to our objective. We demonstrate the superior predictive power and interpretability of our model with a comprehensive empirical study against strong baselines.",
