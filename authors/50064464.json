            "abstract": "This study proposes the use of Machine Learning models to predict the early onset of sepsis using deidentified clinical data from Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, NY, USA. A supervised learning approach was adopted, wherein an XGBoost model was trained utilizing 80\\% of the train dataset, encompassing 107 features (including the original and derived features). Subsequently, the model was evaluated on the remaining 20\\% of the test data. The model was validated on prospective data that was entirely unseen during the training phase. To assess the model's performance at the individual patient level and timeliness of the prediction, a normalized utility score was employed, a widely recognized scoring methodology for sepsis detection, as outlined in the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge paper. Metrics such as F1 Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Flag Rate were also devised. The model achieved a normalized utility score of 0.494 on test data and 0.378 on prospective data at threshold 0.3. The F1 scores were 80.8\\% and 67.1\\% respectively for the test data and the prospective data for the same threshold, highlighting its potential to be integrated into clinical decision-making processes effectively. These results bear testament to the model's robust predictive capabilities and its potential to substantially impact clinical decision-making processes.",

            "abstract": "We study the problem of weakly supervised text classification, which aims to classify text documents into a set of pre-defined categories with category surface names only and without any annotated training document provided. Most existing classifiers leverage textual information in each document. However, in many domains, documents are accompanied by various types of metadata (e.g., authors, venue, and year of a research paper). These metadata and their combinations may serve as strong category indicators in addition to textual contents. In this paper, we explore the potential of using metadata to help weakly supervised text classification. To be specific, we model the relationships between documents and metadata via a heterogeneous information network. To effectively capture higher-order structures in the network, we use motifs to describe metadata combinations. We propose a novel framework, named MotifClass , which (1) selects category-indicative motif instances, (2) retrieves and generates pseudo-labeled training samples based on category names and indicative motif instances, and (3) trains a text classifier using the pseudo training data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MotifClass to existing weakly supervised text classification approaches. Further analysis shows the benefit of considering higher-order metadata information in our framework.",

            "abstract": "Scientific literature analysis needs fine-grained named entity recognition (NER) to provide a wide range of information for scientific discovery. For example, chemistry research needs to study dozens to hundreds of distinct, fine-grained entity types, making consistent and accurate annotation difficult even for crowds of domain experts. On the other hand, domain-specific ontologies and knowledge bases (KBs) can be easily accessed, constructed, or integrated, which makes distant supervision realistic for fine-grained chemistry NER. In distant supervision, training labels are generated by matching mentions in a document with the concepts in the knowledge bases (KBs). However, this kind of KB-matching suffers from two major challenges: incomplete annotation and noisy annotation. We propose ChemNER, an ontology-guided, distantly-supervised method for fine-grained chemistry NER to tackle these challenges. It leverages the chemistry type ontology structure to generate distant labels with novel methods of flexible KB-matching and ontology-guided multi-type disambiguation. It significantly improves the distant label generation for the subsequent sequence labeling model training. We also provide an expert-labeled, chemistry NER dataset with 62 fine-grained chemistry types (e.g., chemical compounds and chemical reactions). Experimental results show that ChemNER is highly effective, outperforming substantially the state-of-the-art NER methods (with .25 absolute F1 score improvement).",

            "abstract": "In this article, a novel learning methodology is introduced for the problem of classification in the context of high-dimensional data. In particular, the challenges introduced by high-dimensional data sets are addressed by formulating a $L_{1}$ regularized zero-sum game where optimal sparsity is estimated through a two-player game between the penalty coefficients/sparsity parameters and the deep neural network weights. In order to solve this game, a distributed learning methodology is proposed where additional variables are utilized to derive layerwise cost functions. Finally, an alternating minimization approach developed to solve the problem where the Nash solution provides optimal sparsity and compensation through the classifier. The proposed learning approach is implemented in a parallel and distributed environment through a novel computational algorithm. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically with nine data sets.",

            "abstract": "Preference aggregation, and specifically rank aggregation, is a well known problem in the fields of computational social choice and preference handling with broad application including web search and recommendation systems. Inspired by the recent advances in the area of deep neural representation learning, for the first time in the literature, in this paper we leverage unsupervised deep learning techniques - especially graph embeddings - for aggregating a collection of incomplete rank lists and accordingly we develop an algorithm called DeepAggregation. It takes as input a set of incomplete rank lists and constructs a multi-layer graph wherein the nodes are the alternatives that are ranked and the edges capture information contained in the incomplete rank lists. We then compute deep neural representation vectors (i.e. embeddings) for the nodes and then derive the aggregated order using these representation vectors. Our proposed algorithm can handle incomplete rank lists with or without ties. We conduct thorough empirical analysis of the proposed DeepAggregation algorithm using various real life data sets such as TripAdvisor reviews data. We empirically observe that DeepAggregation generates impressive results in comparison with a number of well-known state-of-the-art preference aggregation methods.",

            "abstract": "Learning the emergence of cooperation in conflicting scenarios such as social dilemmas is a centerpiece of research. Many reinforcement learning based theories exist in the literature to address this problem. The well-known fact about RL based model's very slow learning capabilities coupled with large state space exhibit significant negative effects especially in repeated version of social dilemma settings such as repeated Public Goods Game (PGG) and thereby making them ineffective to model sustainability of cooperation. In this paper, we address this research challenge by augmenting the reinforcement learning based models with a notion of collaboration among the agents, motivated by the fact that humans learn not only through their own actions but also by following the actions of other agents who also continuously learn about the environment. In particular, we propose a novel model, which we refer to as Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL), wherein we define collaboration among the agents as the ability of agents to fully follow other agent's actions/decisions. This is also termed as social learning. The proposed CRL model significantly influences the speed of individual learning, which eventually has a large effect on the collective behavior as compared to that of RL only models and thereby effectively explaining the sustainability of cooperation in repeated PGG settings. We also extend the CRL model for PGGs over different generations where agents die out and new agents are born following a birth-death process.",

Evaluating on recent answer selection datasets - InsuranceQA, SelQA, and an internal QA dataset, we show that using hard negatives with relatively simple model architectures (bag of words and LSTM-CNN) drives significant performance gains. On InsuranceQA, this strategy alone improves over previously reported results by a minimum of 1.6 points in P@1. Using hard negatives with a Transformer encoder provides a further improvement of 2.3 points. Further, we propose to use quadruplet loss for answer triggering, with the aim of producing globally meaningful similarity scores. We show that quadruplet loss function coupled with the selection of hard negatives enables bag-of-words models to improve F1 score by 2.3 points over previous baselines, on SelQA answer triggering dataset. Our results provide key insights into answer selection and answer triggering tasks.",

            "abstract": "While analyzing high dimensional data-sets using deep neural network (NN), increased sparsity is desirable but requires careful selection of \"sparsity parameters.\" In this paper, a novel distributed learning methodology is proposed to optimize the NN while addressing this challenge. To address this challenge, the optimal sparsity in the NN is estimated via a two player zero-sum game in the paper. In the proposed game, sparsity parameter is the first player with the aim of increasing sparsity in the NN while NN weights is the second player with the goal of improving its performance in the presence of increased sparsity. To solve the game, additional variables are introduced into the optimization problem such that the output at every layer in the NN depends on this variable instead of the previous layer. Using these additional variables, layer wise cost-functions are derived that are then independently optimized to learn the additional variables, NN weights and the sparsity parameters. To implement the proposed learning procedure in a parallelized and distributed environment, a novel computational algorithm is also proposed. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a total of six data-sets.",

The aim of the proposed framework is to generate music corresponding to the emotion of the person predicted by our model. The proposed framework is divided into two models, the Image Classification Model and the Music Generation Model. The music would be generated by the latter model which is essentially a Doubly Stacked LSTM architecture. This is to be done after classification and identification of the facial expression into one of the seven major sentiment categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral, which would be done by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using the emotional Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a popular evaluation metric for audio-visual data.",
