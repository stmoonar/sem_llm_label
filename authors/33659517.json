            "abstract": "Data-centric NLP is a highly iterative process requiring careful exploration of text data throughout entire model development lifecycle. Unfortunately, existing data exploration tools are not suitable to support data-centric NLP because of workflow discontinuity and lack of support for unstructured text. In response, we propose Weedle, a seamless and customizable exploratory text analysis system for data-centric NLP. Weedle is equipped with built-in text transformation operations and a suite of visual analysis features. With its widget, users can compose customizable dashboards interactively and programmatically in computational notebooks.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates how touchscreen exploration and verbal feedback can be used to support blind people to access visual artwork. We present two artwork exploration modalities. The first one, attribute-based exploration, extends prior work on touchscreen image accessibility, and provides fine-grained segmentation of artwork visual elements; when the user touches an element, the associated attributes are read. The second one, hierarchical exploration, is designed with domain experts and provides multi-level segmentation of the artwork; the user initially accesses a general description of the entire artwork and then explores a coarse segmentation of the visual elements with the corresponding high-level descriptions; once selected, coarse segments are subdivided into fine-grained ones, which the user can access for more detailed descriptions. The two exploration modalities, implemented as a mobile web app, were evaluated through a user study with 10 blind participants. Both modalities were appreciated by the participants. Attribute-based exploration is perceived to be easier to access. Instead, the hierarchical exploration was considered more understandable, useful, interesting and captivating, and the participants remembered more details about the artwork with this modality. Participants commented that the two modalities work well together and therefore both should be made available.",

            "abstract": "Algorithmic content moderation manages an explosive number of user-created content shared online everyday. Despite a massive number of 3D designs that are free to be downloaded, shared, and 3D printed by the users, detecting sensitivity with transparency and fairness has been controversial. Although sensitive 3D content might have a greater impact than other media due to its possible reproducibility and replicability without restriction, prevailed unawareness resulted in proliferation of sensitive 3D models online and a lack of discussion on transparent and fair 3D content moderation. As the 3D content exists as a document on the web mainly consisting of text and images, we first study the existing algorithmic efforts based on text and images and the prior endeavors to encompass transparency and fairness in moderation, which can also be useful in a 3D printing domain. At the same time, we identify 3D specific features that should be addressed to advance a 3D specialized algorithmic moderation. As a potential solution, we suggest a human-in-the-loop pipeline using augmented learning, powered by various stakeholders with different backgrounds and perspectives in understanding the content. Our pipeline aims to minimize personal biases by enabling diverse stakeholders to be vocal in reflecting various factors to interpret the content. We add our initial proposal for redesigning metadata of open 3D repositories, to invoke users' responsible actions of being granted consent from the subject upon sharing contents for free in the public spaces.",

            "abstract": "With the continuous growth of online 3D printing community and the democratization of 3D printers, growing number of users start sharing their own 3D designs on open platforms, enabling a wide audience to search, download, and 3D print models for free. Although sharing is mostly for altruistic reasons at first, open platforms had also created potential job opportunities to compensate creative labors. This paper analyzes new job opportunities emerged in online 3D printing social platforms and patterns of seeking compensations, and reveals various motivations for posting creative content online. We find that offering exclusive membership through subscriptions, selling final products or printing services through web stores, and using affiliate links are primary means of earning profits, while there exist gaps between creators' expectations and realities. We show that various socio-economic promises emerged, leading to a win-win situation for both creators to gain extra income and audiences to have access to more quality content. We also discuss future challenges that need to be addressed, such as ethical use of opensource content.",

            "abstract": "One of the reasons that people with visual impairments have difficulties in enjoying artworks is the limited number of accessible artworks. To enable people with visual impairments to explore and understand various artworks independently, we built a touchscreen-based mobile application as a prototype focusing on 2D paintings which plays object-level verbal descriptions upon users' touch. To confirm the needs and to collect initial feedback from potential users of such a system, we conducted an exploratory study with 8 participants with visual impairments using the prototype as a design probe. Overall, participants appreciated the prototype as they can learn artworks with less physical and time constraints while listening for details of contents as they explore each painting by touch.",

This study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of research and information activities of laboratory scientists in different work positions throughout a research lifecycle. Activity theory was applied as the conceptual and analytical framework. Method. Taking a qualitative research approach, in-depth interviews and field observations with twenty-four bioand nano-scientists were conducted at science laboratories in South Korea. A micro-moment time-line interview and critical incident technique guided the interviews. Analysis. Transcribed interview scripts, field notes, and video-recorded images were analysed using the frameworks of activity theory and the research lifecycle. Results. Laboratory scientists were largely divided into principal investigators and junior scientists supporting them. Each group used different information sources for different purposes throughout the research lifecycle. The study also revealed the socio-cultural norms and rules affecting the division of labour. All of this contextual information shaped the information behaviour of the scientists in different positions. Conclusion. Work position was revealed as a critical factor characterizing scientists\u2019 research and information activities. The study constructed a model explaining the division of labour among laboratory scientists in the research lifecycle. Socio-cultural norms should be taken into account when system designers and policymakers design new scientific research support systems.",

On the basis of in\u2010depth interviews with and on\u2010site observations of 24 scientists and a follow\u2010up focus group interview in the field of bioscience/nanoscience and technology in Korea, we examined scientific collaboration using the framework of the scientific research life cycle. We attempt to explain the major motivations, characteristics of communication and information sharing, and barriers associated with scientists' research collaboration practices throughout the research life cycle. The findings identify several notable phenomena including motivating factors, the timing of collaboration formation, partner selection, communication methods, information\u2010sharing practices, and barriers at each phase of the life cycle. We find that specific motivations were related to specific phases. The formation of collaboration was observed throughout the entire process, not only in the beginning phase of the cycle. For communication and information\u2010sharing practices, scientists continue to favor traditional means of communication for security reasons. Barriers to collaboration throughout the phases included different priorities, competitive tensions, and a hierarchical culture among collaborators, whereas credit sharing was a barrier in the research product phase.",
