            "abstract": "As social media grapples with the proliferation of misinformation, flagging systems emerge as vital digital tools that alert users to potential falsehoods, balancing the preservation of free speech. The efficacy of these systems hinges on user interpretation and reaction to the flags provided. This study probes the influence of warning flags on user perceptions, assessing their effect on the perceived accuracy of information, the propensity to share content, and the trust users have in these warnings, especially when supplemented with fact-checking explanations. Through a within-subject experiment involving 348 American participants, we mimicked a social media feed with a series of COVID-19-related headlines, both true and false, in various conditions\u2014with flags, with flags and explanatory text, and without any intervention. Explanatory content was derived from fact-checking sites linked to the news items. Our findings indicate that false news is perceived as less accurate when flagged or accompanied by explanatory text. The presence of explanatory text correlates with heightened trust in the flags. Notably, participants with high levels of neuroticism and a deliberative cognitive thinking style showed a higher trust for explanatory text alongside warning flags. Conversely, participants with conservative leanings exhibited distrust towards social media flagging systems. These results underscore the importance of clear explanations within flagging mechanisms and support a user-centric model in their design, emphasising transparency and engagement as essential in counteracting misinformation on social media.",

            "abstract": "Online Social Networking platforms (OSNs) are part of the people's everyday life answering the deep-rooted need for communication among humans. During recent years, a new generation of social media based on blockchain became very popular, bringing the power of the technology to the service of social networks. Steemit is one such and employs the blockchain to implement a rewarding mechanism, adding a new, economic, layer to the social media service. The reward mechanism grants virtual tokens to the users capable of engaging other users on the platform, which can be either vested in the platform for increased influence or exchanged for fiat currency. The introduction of an economic layer on a social networking platform can seriously influence how people socialize. In this work, we tackle the problem of understanding how this new business model conditions the way people create contents. We performed term frequency and topic modelling analyses over the written contents published on the platforms between 2017 and 2019. This analysis lets us understand the most common topics of the contents that appear in the platform. While personal mundane information still appears, along with contents related to arts, food, travels, and sport, we also see emerging a very strong presence of contents about blockchain, cryptocurrency and, more specifically, on Steemit itself and its users.",

            "abstract": "Social Media applications have become one of the most pervasive and most used digital technologies in modern societies. Consumer uses it, among others, to share and consume information, stay in contact with other users and to stay up to date about local events and activities. As producer, it serves as a highly targeted advertising platform. However, it can be argued that the main focus of current Social Media platforms is in the promotion of premium content and not, as it is often perceived, the promotion of inter-human relationships. The former concept relies on engagement trackings, such as likes and comments, to assess interest for content targeting. Interhuman relationships, however, are more difficult to assess, measure and therefore promote. This is mostly due to the complexity of trust-based interactions between individuals. Without assessing trustworthiness however it is difficult to promote meaningful relationships in Social Media Applications. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce a model of interpersonal trust as a function of multidimensional features that applies to Social Media specific interactions.",

            "abstract": "Online Social Networking platforms (OSNs) have become part of the real life of people. This is the natural outcome of many centuries of \"social media\" development answering the deep-rooted need for communication among humans. Existing social media platforms give users the impression that they are in full control of their data. However, it is actually those companies providing those services that have sole authority over a person's information. The need of trusted environment and the privacy issues in OSNs have seen the rise of Decentralized Online Social Networks. However, all of these platforms are far from being useful in real life. Indeed, they fail to address the complexity of social structures, in which we change our roles fluently from one to another leading to different roles in several independent and interconnected contexts. The envision of a Next Generation Internet focused on people is the main topic of the new generation of Decentralized Online Social Networks, which takes into account the main characteristics of the previous generations. In this paper, we present a new idea to model a multilayer P2P Social Overlay which takes into account different actors and relationships to be included in smart environments. Moreover, it is organized in layers, where one layer represents a specific social context of the peer it models. We present a formal definition of the Heterogeneous Ego Network and we show how it works in a general scenario.",

            "abstract": "Social media has become an important part of modern-day communication. Advantages span from instant communication via direct messages to sharing and consuming content and experiences. Lately, social media applications have been criticized for assisting the spreading of harmful or fake news and distorting reality by enabling unauthentic self-representation. It is often argued, that social media platforms are solely responsible for these challenges and for offering solutions. This research uses the notion of a digital footprint, a codified representation of a user's social media engagement, to facilitate user reflection. This footprint, however, is mostly a product of the user's deliberate and conscious engagement. This paper argues that users also have a responsibility in addressing the above-mentioned challenges by increasing their awareness of their social media usage. This paper presents a study with close to 300 participants investigating if they are aware of their digital footprint in social media. The paper presents the overall challenges, as well as experimental design and results, with the goal of motivating further debate regarding user awareness of their social media usage.",

            "abstract": "Social Media has transformed modern day society. It can be argued that one of the main drivers behind this transformation are novel ways to effectively distribute content in a highly targeted fashion and at scale. Recently, this effectiveness has come under attack based on new phenomena known as Fake News, Filter Bubble and Echo Chambers. The public debate about the impact of these phenomena on modern day society ranges from demanding a complete social media shutdown to government intervention and censorship. Furthermore, it appears that Social Media Platform providers are not sure what countermeasures are needed to address these new challenges. The main concern is that Black Mirror like scenarios will emerge simply by allowing privately held companies decide what content is conforming to public norms leading to a distortion of values. This paper presents an alternative solution by focusing on empowering meaningful relationships and not content engagement. The main motivation behind the proposed solution is to create social networks that follow a Trust by Design paradigm. This paper introduces and discusses the above-mentioned challenges and presents a novel new social media concept seeking to overcome current challenges.",

Privacy concerns, the challenges of working with interactive scenarios, and individual differences in behaviour between users must all be addressed in order to facilitate repeatable and comparable evaluation, and to advance research in this domain.
