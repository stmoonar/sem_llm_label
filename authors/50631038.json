            "title": "Quantum Mini-Apps: A Framework for Developing and Benchmarking Quantum-HPC Applications",
            "abstract": "With the increasing maturity and scale of quantum hardware and its integration into HPC systems, there is a need to develop robust techniques for developing, characterizing, and benchmarking quantum-HPC applications and middleware systems. This requires a better understanding of interaction, coupling, and common execution patterns between quantum and classical workload tasks and components. This paper identifies six quantum-HPC execution motifs - recurring execution patterns characterized by distinct coupling and interaction modes. These motifs provide the basis for a suite of quantum mini-apps - simplified application prototypes that encapsulate essential characteristics of production systems. To support these developments, we introduce a mini-app framework that offers the necessary abstractions for creating and executing mini-apps across heterogeneous quantum-HPC infrastructure, making it a valuable tool for performance characterizations and middleware development.",

            "abstract": "Benchmarking of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms is challenging due to the complexity and variability of QML systems, e. g., regarding model ansatzes, data sets, training techniques, and hyper-parameter selection. The QUantum computing Application benchmaRK (QUARK) framework simplifies and standardizes benchmarking studies for quantum computing applications. Here, we propose several extensions of QUARK to include the ability to evaluate the training and deployment of quantum generative models. We describe the updated software architecture and illustrate its flexibility through several example applications: (1) We trained different quantum generative models using several circuit ansatzes, data sets, and data transformations. (2) We evaluated our models on GPU and real quantum hardware. (3) We assessed the generalization capabilities of our generative models using a broad set of metrics that capture, e. g., the novelty and validity of the generated data.",

            "abstract": "Quantum computing is important for science and industry as it offers the potential to solve certain complex problems and perform calculations significantly faster than classical computers. Quantum computing systems evolved from monolithic systems towards modular architectures comprising multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) coupled to classical computing nodes (HPC). With the increasing scale, middleware systems that facilitate the efficient coupling of quantum-classical computing are becoming critical. Through an in-depth analysis of quantum applications, integration patterns and systems, we identified a gap in understanding Quantum-HPC middleware systems. We present a conceptual middleware to facilitate reasoning about quantum-classical integration and serve as the basis for a future middleware system. A key contribution of this paper lies in leveraging well-established high-performance computing abstractions for managing workloads, tasks, and resources to seamlessly integrate quantum computing into HPC systems.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

Our end-to-end solution integrates highly versatile random-key algorithms with model stacking and ensemble techniques, as well as path relinking for solution refinement. The core optimization module consists of a biased random-key genetic algorithm. Through a distinct separation of problem-independent and problem-dependent modules, we achieve an efficient problem representation, with a native encoding of constraints. We show that generalizations to alternative algorithmic paradigms such as simulated annealing are straightforward. We provide numerical benchmark results for industry-scale data sets. Our approach is found to consistently outperform greedy baseline results. To assess the capabilities of today's quantum hardware, we complement the classical approach with results obtained on quantum annealing hardware, using qbsolv on Amazon Braket. Finally, we show how the latter can be integrated into our larger pipeline, providing a quantum-ready hybrid solution to the problem.",

            "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) is anticipated to provide a speedup over classical approaches for specific problems in optimization, simulation, and machine learning. With the advances in quantum computing toward practical applications, the need to analyze and compare different quantum solutions is increasing. While different low-level benchmarks exist, they often do not provide sufficient insights into real-world application-level performance. We propose an application-centric benchmark method and the QUantum computing Application benchmaRK (QUARK) framework to foster the investigation and creation of application benchmarks for QC. This paper establishes three significant contributions: (1) it makes a case for application-level benchmarks and provides an in-depth \"pen and paper\" benchmark formulation of two reference problems: robot path and vehicle option optimization from the industrial domain; (2) it proposes the open-source QUARK framework for designing, implementing, executing, and analyzing benchmarks; (3) it provides multiple reference implementations for these two reference problems based on different known, and where needed, extended, classical and quantum algorithmic approaches and analyzes their performance on different types of infrastructures.",

Our completely reusable garbled circuit (CRGC) scheme allows the generator (party A) to construct and send an obfuscated boolean circuit along with an encoded input to the evaluator (party B). In contrast to Yao's Garbled Circuit protocol, B can securely evaluate the same CRGC with an arbitrary number of inputs. As a tradeoff, CRGCs predictably leak some input bits of A to B. We also propose a partially reusable garbled circuit (PRGC) scheme that divides a circuit into reusable and non-reusable sections. PRGCs do not leak input bits of A. We benchmark our CRGC implementation against the state-of-the-art garbled circuit libraries EMP SH2PC and TinyGarble2. Using our framework, evaluating a CRGC is up to twenty times faster, albeit with weaker privacy guarantees, than evaluating an equivalent garbled circuit constructed by the two existing libraries. Our open-source library can convert any C++ function to a CRGC at approx. 80 million gates per second and repeatedly evaluate a CRGC at approx. 350 million gates per second. Additionally, a compressed CRGC is approx. 75% smaller in file size than the unobfuscated boolean circuit.",

However, applying PETs in organizations requires a precise understanding of use cases, technologies, and limitations. This paper investigates several industrial use cases, their characteristics, and the potential applicability of PETs to these. We conduct expert interviews to identify and classify uses cases, a gray literature review of relevant open-source PET tools, and discuss how the use case characteristics can be addressed using PETs\u2019 capabilities. While we focus mainly on automotive use cases, the results also apply to other use case domains.",

            "abstract": "Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) promise to revolutionize business ecosystems by permitting secure transactions without intermediaries. A widely recognized challenge that inhibits the uptake of DLT is scalability and performance. Hence, quantifying key metrics such as throughput and latency is crucial for designing DLT-based infrastructures, applications, and ecosystems. However, current benchmarking frameworks for blockchains 1 do not cover the whole benchmarking process; impeding transparent comparisons of different DLT networks. In this paper, we present the Distributed Ledger Performance Scan (DLPS), an open-source 2 framework for end-to-end performance characterizations of blockchains, addressing the need to transparently and automatically evaluate the performance of highly customizable con\ufb01gurations. We describe our new framework and argue that it signi\ufb01cantly improves existing DLT benchmarking solutions. To demonstrate the capabilities of the DLPS, we also summarize the main results obtained from a series of experiments that we have conducted with it, giving a \ufb01rst comprehensive comparison of essential scalability properties of several commonly used enterprise blockchains.",
