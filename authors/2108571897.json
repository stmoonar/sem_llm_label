            "title": "Improved Strategy for High-Utility Pattern Mining Algorithm",
            "abstract": "High-utility pattern mining is a research hotspot in the field of pattern mining, and one of its main research topics is how to improve the efficiency of the mining algorithm. Based on the study on the state-of-the-art high-utility pattern mining algorithms, this paper proposes an improved strategy that removes noncandidate items from the global header table and local header table as early as possible, thus reducing search space and improving efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed strategy is applied to the algorithm EFIM (EFficient high-utility Itemset Mining). Experimental verification was carried out on nine typical datasets (including two large datasets); results show that our strategy can effectively improve temporal efficiency for mining high-utility patterns.",

            "abstract": "In order to solve the information transfer of social network media, a new information transfer prediction method is presented by a triangle ring attractor. At first, the description method of social media information is given in this model, and the evaluation indexes such as information recall rate, matching degree, and recall rate are emphatically expounded. At the same time, the characteristics of media information are analyzed with a triangular ring attractor, and an information transfer prediction model is established. Finally, through the simulation experiment, the key factors influencing the method are deeply analyzed. Experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, this method has good adaptability in the degree of information attenuation and information checking rate.",

In this method, the user click fraud advertising set is found by the training data set attributes at first, and then use the Bloom filter and outlier mining algorithm for the detection and localization of suspected fraud. Finally, all suspected fraud members were classified by the Bias classification method to detect fraud. The experiment results show that this method can effectively shield visitors from accidental unconscious clicks, and significantly reduce the probability of click fraud.",
