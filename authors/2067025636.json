A large body of recent work on question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA) employs neural network\u2010based systems. In this article, we provide an overview of these neural network\u2010based methods for KGQA. We introduce readers to the formalism and the challenges of the task, different paradigms and approaches, discuss notable advancements, and outline the emerging trends in the field. Through this article, we aim to provide newcomers to the field with a suitable entry point to semantic parsing for KGQA, and ease their process of making informed decisions while creating their own QA systems.",

In this work, we extend a pointer-generator and investigate the order-matters problem in semantic parsing for SQL. Even though our model is a straightforward extension of a general-purpose pointer-generator, it outperforms early works for WikiSQL and remains competitive to concurrently introduced, more complex models. Moreover, we provide a deeper investigation of the potential order-matters problem that could arise due to having multiple correct decoding paths, and investigate the use of REINFORCE as well as a dynamic oracle in this context.",

The motivation behind this work lies in the lack of scalable methods for analytics which exploit expressive structures underlying semantically structured knowledge bases. The demonstration is based on the BigDataEurope technical platform, which utilizes Docker technology. We present various examples of using SANSA in the form of interactive Spark notebooks, which are executed with Apache Zeppelin. The technical platform and the notebooks are available on SANSA Github and can be deployed on any Docker-enabled host, locally or in a Docker Swarm cluster.",

Existing products and services are developed for a particular domain, can be used only in combination with already integrated datasets or their language coverage is limited. In this paper, we present an innovative solution FREME - an open framework of e-Services for multilingual and semantic enrichment of digital content. The framework integrates six interoperable e-Services. We describe the core features of each e-Service and illustrate their usage in the context of four business cases: i) authoring and publishing; ii) translation and localisation; iii) cross-lingual access to data; and iv) personalised Web content recommendations. Business cases drive the design and development of the framework.",
