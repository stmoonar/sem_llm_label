            "abstract": "This article is focused on bibliographic analysis and collaboration pattern analysis of the textpapers published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) from January 2019 to January 2023. We have identified the authors, institutions, and countries/regions that are the most productive and have the highest impact. It is found that research on intelligent vehicles is dominated by researchers and institutions from China. Researchers from the US are the second largest contributor to the transaction, whilst those from Germany rank the third. It is also found that, Fei-Yue Wang, Mohan Manubhai Trivedi, and J. Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.",

            "abstract": "Mines are one of the important energy sources in the world. Due to mining areas are often affected by adverse weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, extreme cold, heavy snow, etc.), the efficiency and security of mining are low. As a new, efficient, prospective mode, Metaverse has been studied and successfully applied in various industries. However, there is still no research about its usage in mines. In this article, we apply Metaverse to mining and propose MetaMining. We present its definition and analyze the functions it could perform. Furthermore, we propose its development phases and architecture. Specifically, MetaMining is a mode, which aims to achieve high-efficiency, high-security mining in the physical world through the interaction between the physical world and the virtual world. Its development phases involve three steps: 1) digital twins; 2) digital natives; and 3) surreality. Its architecture consists of three components: 1) human world; 2) virtual mining system; and 3) physical mining system. In addition, we analyze key technologies and possible challenges in the construction of MetaMining.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel state-feedback switching linear parameter varying (LPV) control for automated vehicle path following under model uncertainty and external disturbances. A vehicle lateral error dynamic model is established and analyzed for trajectory tracking control using the discrete-time linear parameter varying generalized system plant, which considers four vehicle error states in the lateral direction, including vehicle lateral position, lateral velocity, yaw angle, and yaw rate. The synthesis approach for discrete-time switching LPV control under both average-dwell-time and arbitrary switching conditions is discussed. In particular, apart from the conventional design with common Lyapunov functions, the new synthesis condition with separate Lyapunov functions is developed for both system stability and guaranteed local performance (represented by the local L2 gain boundary) under model uncertainty and external disturbances. Meanwhile, the derived robust optimization of these conditions is expressed using the parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Simulation results for a vehicle path-following problem demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach in two designed traffic scenarios under four different switching control strategies.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle platooning for highway driving has many benefits, such as lowering fuel consumption, improving traffic safety, and reducing traffic congestion. However, its performance could be undermined due to uncertainty. This work proposes a new control method that combines distributed stochastic model predictive control with Taguchi\u2019s robustness (TR-DSMPC) for vehicle platooning. The proposed method inherits the advantages of both Taguchi\u2019s robustness (maximizing the mean performance and minimizing the performance variation due to uncertainty) and stochastic model predictive control (ensuring a specific reliability level). Taguchi\u2019s robustness is achieved by introducing a variation term in the control objective to bring a trade-off between mean performance and its variation. TR-DSMPC propagates uncertainty via an approximation method: First-Order Second Moment, which is far more efficient than Monte Carlo-based methods. The uncertainty is considered from two perspectives, time-independent uncertainty by random variables and time-dependent uncertainty by stochastic processes. We compare the proposed method with two other MPC-based methods in terms of safety (spacing error) and efficiency (relative velocity). The results indicate that our proposed method can effectively reduce the performance variation and maintain the mean performance.",

            "abstract": "Networked traffic signal control (NTSC) is essential for intelligent transportation systems. How to control multiple intersections in a cooperative way based on traffic conditions is critical for the success of NTSC. This paper proposes a Transformer-based cooperation mechanism (TCM) with the consideration of dynamic modeling and scale requirements simultaneously for large-scale traffic network control. Considering the physical constraints in traffic scenarios, a relative position encoding is designed to embed into TCM to characterize traffic conditions better. With the shared TCM module, intersection controllers could adequately exploit spatial-temporal correlations and adaptively capture global traffic dynamics, guiding them to explore collaborative traffic strategies more efficiently. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the suggested strategy greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

The data collection was completed in 68 driving sessions with different drivers, where each session lasted about 20\u201340 minutes. The main goal of creating this dataset is to provide the research community with real driving scenarios that have diverse trajectories and driving behaviors. The dataset contains ego-vehicle's waypoints, velocity, yaw angle, as well as non-ego actor's waypoints, velocity, yaw angle, entry-time, and exit-time. Certain flexibility is provided to users so that actors, sensors, lanes, roads, and obstacles can be added to the existing scenarios. We used a Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) tracker to detect non-ego vehicles on the road. We present some preliminary results of the proposed dataset and a few applications associated with it. The complete dataset is expected to be released by the end of 2022.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of this alerting system, subjects were recruited to participate in the designed test scenarios on a driving simulator. The test scenarios include three warning types (no alerts, roadside alerts, and in-vehicle auditory alerts), three driver states (normal, distracted, and drowsy), and two weather conditions (sunny and foggy). Driver responses related to vehicle dynamics data were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that on average, the drowsy state decreases the minimum time-to-collision by 1.6 seconds compared to the normal state. In-vehicle auditory alerts can effectively increase the driving safety across different combinations of situations (driver states and weather conditions), while roadside alerts perform better than no alerts.",

The vehicle longitudinal dynamics and information flow in the platoon are established and analyzed. The algorithm of DNMPC with robustness and reliability considerations at each vehicle (or node) is developed based on the leading vehicle and reference information from nodes in its neighboring set. Together with the physical constraints on the control input, the nonlinear constraints on vehicle longitudinal dynamics, the terminal constraints on states, and the reliability constraints on both input and output, the objective function is defined to optimize the control accuracy and efficiency by penalizing the tracking errors between the predicted outputs and desirable outputs of the same node and neighboring nodes, respectively. Meanwhile, the robust design optimization model also minimizes the expected quality loss which consists of the mean and standard deviation of node inputs and outputs. The simulation results also demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach under two different traffic scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose approaches for estimating the traffic flow and vehicle distributions based on labeled Petri nets. The traffic network is firstly modeled as a labeled Petri net structure, then the control algorithms are introduced. Different from many existing strategies that focus on avoiding collisions, we assign traffic capacities to places that represent different road segments in the traffic network, then algorithms are developed to maintain the number of tokens within given capacities. The existence of the unobservable transitions makes the problem more challenging. Under some assumptions of the unobservable transitions, we show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and has a complexity that is polynomial in the length of the label observations. An illustrative example is also provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

            "title": "Scheduling of Autonomous Mining Trucks: Allocation Model Based Tabu Search Algorithm Development",
            "abstract": "Transport activities in open-pit mines contribute to a large portion of total energy consumption. Most truck scheduling studies still take a traditional approach to autonomous mining trucks, which does not fully exploit the strengths of the autonomous trucks that can perform more accurate speed control compared to conventional manned trucks. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model is developed for joint optimization of autonomous truck trips and speed to reduce fuel consumption. To solve the integrated scheduling model, a new tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two stages, where an allocation model is formulated in the upper stage to identify the optimal truck flow, and in the lower stage a tabu search algorithm is developed initialized with the guidance of optimal truck flow. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia is used for example to analyze and verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution techniques.",
