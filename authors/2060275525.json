            "title": "Cryptocurrency Bubble Detection: A New Stock Market Dataset, Financial Task & Hyperbolic Models",
            "abstract": "The rapid spread of information over social media influences quantitative trading and investments. The growing popularity of speculative trading of highly volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks presents a fresh challenge in the financial realm. Investigating such \u201cbubbles\u201d - periods of sudden anomalous behavior of markets are critical in better understanding investor behavior and market dynamics. However, high volatility coupled with massive volumes of chaotic social media texts, especially for underexplored assets like cryptocoins pose a challenge to existing methods. Taking the first step towards NLP for cryptocoins, we present and publicly release CryptoBubbles, a novel multi- span identification task for bubble detection, and a dataset of more than 400 cryptocoins from 9 exchanges over five years spanning over two million tweets. Further, we develop a set of sequence-to-sequence hyperbolic models suited to this multi-span identification task based on the power-law dynamics of cryptocurrencies and user behavior on social media. We further test the effectiveness of our models under zero-shot settings on a test set of Reddit posts pertaining to 29 \u201cmeme stocks\u201d, which see an increase in trade volume due to social media hype. Through quantitative, qualitative, and zero-shot analyses on Reddit and Twitter spanning cryptocoins and meme-stocks, we show the practical applicability of CryptoBubbles and hyperbolic models.",

            "abstract": "Biometrics, an important research field emerging fast, has growing challenges related to the secured access and security of the systems protected. In this paper, the secured access to a smart robot is proposed using biometrics. The robot can be accessed by recognizing the user's face image, acting as a password, and also operates on the voice-commands given by the speaker. The face recognition technique uses `Principal Component Analysis' and `Eigenfaces'. The voice-commands are processed in real-time. The commands are processed in real-time using an on-line cloud server. The voice-commands converted to text form are sent via the Bluetooth network to a micro-controller on the robot, where these are interpreted and the smart robot performs the desired operation accordingly. The performance evaluation results of the face image recognition and the voice-commands signal processing are encouraging. Combining both the features makes the robot more robust. Few limitations of both the techniques have also been discussed with proposed solutions.",

            "title": "Multi-stage face recognition for biometric access",
            "abstract": "Protecting the privacy of user-identification data is fundamental to protect the information systems from attacks and vulnerabilities. Providing access to such data only to the limited and legitimate users is the key motivation for `Biometrics'. In `Biometric Systems' confirming a user's claim of his/her identity reliably, is more important than focusing on `what he/she really possesses' or `what he/she remembers'. In this paper the use of face image for biometric access is proposed using two multistage face recognition algorithms that employ biometric facial features to validate the user's claim. The proposed algorithms use standard algorithms and classifiers such as EigenFaces, PCA and LDA in stages. Performance evaluation of both proposed algorithms is carried out using two standard datasets, the Extended Yale database and AT&T database. Results using the proposed multi-stage algorithms are better than those using other standard algorithms. Current limitations and possible applications of the proposed algorithms are also discussed along, with further scope of making these robust to pose, illumination and noise variations.",
