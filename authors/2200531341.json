            "title": "A Distributionally Robust Optimization for Reliability-Based Lane Reservation and Route Design Under Uncertainty",
            "abstract": "Lane reservation optimization is important in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing studies are carried out under deterministic road conditions by assuming constant road travel time. However, road conditions vary due to various factors, resulting in uncertain road travel time. This work addresses a new reliability-based lane reservation and route design problem by considering uncertain road travel time with its known mean and covariance matrix. It aims to decide which road segments in a network should implement reserved lanes and to design routes for special time-crucial transportation tasks. The objective is to maximize transportation service reliability (i.e., the probability of completing the special tasks on time). For this problem, a novel distributionally robust optimization model is first established. To solve it, this work proposes i) an adapted sample average approximation-based approach and ii) a two-stage hierarchical heuristic algorithm based on second-order cone programming. Experimental results on an illustrative example and a real-world case demonstrate that the latter is more effective and efficient than the former. In addition, we conduct a series of parameter sensitivity analysis experiments to reveal the factors affecting lane reservation and provide optimal solutions given different parameter settings.",

            "abstract": "This work investigates a new dynamic bus lane reservation problem considering dynamic traffic demand. It is to optimally decide which road links in the bus transit network to set up reserved bus lanes and determine when they are implemented. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total cost of the transportation network, including construction costs and travel time costs for travelers. We formulate the problem as a new bi-level programming model. The upper level is to optimize where and when bus lanes are implemented, while the lower level contains the modal split, traffic assignment, and transit assignment. An improved genetic algorithm is proposed for solving the proposed model and converges to a satifactory solution. Computational results of a case study verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

            "title": "Distributionally robust lane reservation under uncertain road travel times",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a new stochastic lane reservation problem under uncertain road travel times. The problem needs to determine an optimal location of reserved lanes in a transportation network and design reserved lanes-based routes for special time-crucial transport tasks under the condition that the travel time is uncertain, but partial information, i.e., mean and covariance matrix are known. For the problem, we develop a service-oriented distributionally robust optimization model. The objective is to maximize the service satisfaction, which is measured by the probability of completing the tasks on time. To solve it, the widely used sample average approximation (SAA) method is first adapted. However, the SAA method is time-consuming to the NP-hardness of the problem. Thus, by analyzing the characteristics of the problem, we propose a new method based on approximate mixed integer second-order cone programming (MI-SOCP). The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by the results of a real case as compared with the SAA method.",

            "title": "Optimal Facility Location and Network Design in Hazardous Materials Transportation via Lane Reservation",
            "abstract": "The demand for hazardous material transportation in many countries is increasing each year. However, once accidents occur during hazardous material transportation, they will often cause irreversible consequences. The risk probability can be reduced by transporting hazardous materials on reserved lanes. This study considers a Stackelberg game and lane reservation strategy in the form of a bi-level optimization problem that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and network design in hazardous materials transportation. In the upper level (government), the leader intends to reduce facility setup cost, traffic impact cost and hazmat exposure risk by setting a reserved lane network and requiring carriers to ship in the network. In the lower level (Carrier), the follower intends to reduce shipping costs by selecting a route that meets the time limit. In order to solve the model, a genetic algorithm based on real number code is developed. Finally, computational results verify the efficiency of the proposed approach and model using an instance based on the Sioux Falls network.",
