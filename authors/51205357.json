            "title": "ORTOA: A Family of One Round Trip Protocols For Operation-Type Obliviousness",
            "abstract": "Many applications relying on cloud storage services typically encrypt their data to ensure data privacy. However, serving client requests by reading or writing the encrypted data reveals the type of client operation to a potentially untrusted cloud. An adversary can exploit this information leak to compromise a user\u2019s privacy by tracking read/write access patterns. Existing approaches such as Oblivious RAM (ORAM) schemes hide the type of client access by always reading and then writing the data sequentially for both reads and writes, rendering one of these rounds redundant with respect to a client request. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose ORTOA-a family of protocols enabling single-round data access on remote storage without revealing the operation type . Specifically, we propose three protocols, two using existing cryptographic primitives of fully homomorphic encryption and trusted execution environments (TEEs), and a new primitive inspired by garbled circuits. Each of these protocols has different trust assumptions, allowing an application to choose the option best suited for its needs. To our knowledge, ORTOA is the first to propose generalized protocols to obfuscate the type of access in a single round, reducing communication overhead by half. The proposed techniques can pave the way for novel ORAM schemes that hide both the type of access and the access pattern in a single round. Our experimental results show ORTOA achieving throughput gains of 1.7x-3.2x compared to a baseline requiring two rounds for access type hiding, with the baseline incurring latency 1.5-1.9x that of ORTOA for 160B-sized objects.",

            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

Waffle achieves this without prior knowledge of the input data access distribution, making it the first of its kind to adaptively handle input sequences under a passive persistent adversary. Waffle maintains a constant bandwidth and client-side storage overhead, which can be adjusted to suit the application owner's preferences. This flexibility allows the owner to fine-tune system parameters and strike a balance between security and performance. Our evaluation, utilizing the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) benchmark and Redis as the backend storage, demonstrates promising results. The insecure baseline outperforms Waffle by a mere 5-6x, whereas Waffle outperforms Pancake-a state-of-the-art oblivious datastore under passive persistent adversaries-by 45-57%, and a concurrent ORAM system, TaoStore, by 102x.",

            "abstract": "Edge computing while bringing computation and data closer to users in order to improve response time, distributes edge servers in wide area networks resulting in increased communication latency between the servers. Synchronizing globally distributed edge servers, especially in the presence of Byzantine servers, becomes costly due to the high communication complexity of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols. In this paper, we present Ziziphus, a geo-distributed system that partitions edge servers into fault-tolerant zones where each zone processes transactions initiated by nearby clients locally. Global synchronization among zones is required only in special situations, e.g., migration of clients from one zone to another. On the one hand, the two-level architecture of Ziziphus confines the malicious behavior of nodes within zones requiring a much cheaper protocol at the top level for global synchronization. On the other hand, Ziziphus processes local transactions within zones by edge servers closer to clients resulting in enhanced performance. Ziziphus further introduces zone clusters to enhance scalability where instead of running global synchronization among all zones, only zones of a single cluster are synchronized.",

            "abstract": "Use of cloud based storage-as-a-service has surged due to its many advantages such as scalability and pay-as-you-use cost model. However, storing data in the clear on third-party servers creates vulnerabilities, especially pertaining to data privacy. Applications typically encrypt their data before off-loading it to cloud storage to ensure data privacy. To serve a client\u2019s read or write request, an application either reads or updates the encrypted data on the cloud, revealing the type of client access to the untrusted cloud. An adversary however can exploit this information leak to compromise a user\u2019s privacy by tracking read/write access patterns. Existing approaches (used in Oblivious RAM (ORAM) and frequency smoothing datastores) hide the type of client access by always reading the data followed by writing it, sequentially , irrespective of a read or write request, rendering one of these rounds redundant with respect to a client request. To mitigate this re-dundancy, we propose ORTOA- a One Round Trip Oblivious Access protocol that reads or writes data stored on remote storage in one round without revealing the type of access . To our knowledge, ORTOA is the first generalized protocol to obfuscate the type of access in a single round, reducing the communication overhead in half. ORTOA hides the type of individual access as well as the read/write workload distribution of an application, and due to its generalized design, it can be integrated with many existing obliviousness techniques that hide access patterns such as ORAM or frequency smoothing. Our experimental evaluations show that for objects of 160B size ORTOA\u2019s throughput is 1.4-1.7x that of a baseline that requires two rounds to hide the type of access; and the baseline incurs 1.5-1.9x higher latency than ORTOA.",

            "abstract": "Privacy and security challenges due to the outsourcing of data storage and processing to third-party cloud providers are well known. With regard to data privacy, Oblivious RAM (ORAM) schemes provide strong privacy guarantees by not only hiding the contents of the data (by encryption) but also obfuscating the access patterns of the outsourced data. But most existing ORAM datastores are not fault tolerant in that if the external storage server (which stores encrypted data) or the trusted proxy (which stores the encryption key and other metadata) crashes, an application loses all of its data. To achieve fault-tolerance, we propose QuORAM , the \ufb01rst ORAM datastore to replicate data using a quorum-based replication protocol. QuORAM\u2019s contributions are three-fold: (i) it obfuscates access patterns to provide obliviousness guarantees, (ii) it replicates data using a novel lock-free and decentralized replication protocol to achieve fault-tolerance, and (iii) it guarantees linearizable semantics. Experimentally evaluating QuORAM highlights counter-intuitive results: QuO-RAM performs 46% better in terms of peak throughput than its non-replicated baseline; QuORAM performs 7.6x better than an ORAM datastore that relies on CockroachDB, an open-source geo-replicated database, for fault tolerance; and the cost of obliviousness is negligible in QuORAM when compared to an insecure fault-tolerant replicated system.",

            "abstract": "Recently the long standing problem of optimal construction of quantile sketches was resolved byKarnin,Lang, andLiberty using the KLL sketch (FOCS 2016). The algorithm for KLL is restricted to online insert operations and no delete operations. For many real-world applications, it is necessary to support delete operations. When the data set is updated dynamically, i.e., when data elements are inserted and deleted, the quantile sketch should reflect the changes. In this paper, we proposeKLL\u00b1, the first quantile approximation algorithm to operate in thebounded deletionmodel to account for both inserts and deletes in a given data stream. KLL\u00b1extends the functionality of KLL sketches to support arbitrary updates with small space overhead. The space bound for KLL\u00b1is [EQUATION], where \u2208 and \u03b4 are constants that determine precision and failure probability, and \u03b1 bounds the number of deletions with respect to insert operations. The experimental evaluation of KLL\u00b1highlights that with minimal space overhead, KLL\u00b1achieves comparable accuracy in quantile approximation to KLL.",

            "abstract": "Geo-distributed databases are the state of the art tools for managing cloud-based data. But maintaining hot records in geo-distributed databases such as Google\u2019s Spanner can be expensive, as it synchronizes each update across a majority of replicas. Frequent synchronization poses an obstacle to achieve high throughput for contentious updateheavy workloads. While such synchronizations are inevitable for complex data types, simple data types such as aggregate data can benefit from reduced synchronizations. To this end, we propose an alternate data management system, Samya, to manage aggregate cloud resource usage data. Samya disaggregates available resources and stores fractions of these resources across geo-distributed sites. Dis-aggregation allows sites to serve client requests independently without synchronization for each update. Samya incorporates a learning mechanism to predict future resource demands. If the predicted demand is not satisfied locally, a synchronization protocol, Avantan, is executed to redistribute available resources in the system. Avantan is a novel fault-tolerant consensus protocol where sites agree on the global availability of resources prior to redistribution. Experiments conducted on Google Cloud Platform highlight that dis-aggregating data and reducing synchronizations allows Samya to commit 16x to 18x more transactions than state of the art cloud geo-distributed systems such as Spanner and CockroachDB.",
