            "title": "A Spectral Representation of Networks: The Path of Subgraphs",
            "abstract": "Network representation learning has played a critical role in studying networks. One way to study a graph is to focus on its spectrum, i.e., the eigenvalue distribution of its associated matrices. Recent advancements in spectral graph theory show that spectral moments of a network can be used to capture the network structure and various graph properties. However, sometimes networks with different structures or sizes can have the same or similar spectral moments, not to mention the existence of the cospectral graphs. To address such problems, we propose a 3D network representation that relies on the spectral information of subgraphs: the Spectral Path, a path connecting the spectral moments of the network and those of its subgraphs of different sizes. We show that the spectral path is interpretable and can capture relationship between a network and its subgraphs, for which we present a theoretical foundation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the spectral path in applications such as network visualization and network identification.",

            "title": "Reducing power grid cascading failure propagation by minimizing algebraic connectivity in edge addition",
            "abstract": "Analyzing network robustness under various circumstances is generally regarded as a challenging problem. Robustness against failure is one of the essential properties of large-scale dynamic network systems such as power grids, transportation systems, communication systems, and computer networks. Due to the network diversity and complexity, many topological features have been proposed to capture specific system properties. For power grids, a popular process for improving a network\u2019s structural robustness is via the topology design. However, most of existing methods focus on localized network metrics, such as node connectivity and edge connectivity, which do not encompass a global perspective of cascading propagation in a power grid. In this paper, we use an informative global metric algebraic connectivity because it is sensitive to the connectedness in a broader spectrum of graphs. Our process involves decreasing the average propagation in a power grid by minimizing the increase in its algebraic connectivity. We propose a topology-based greedy strategy to optimize the robustness of the power grid. To evaluate the network robustness, we calculate the average propagation using MATCASC to simulate cascading line outages in power grids. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms existing techniques.",

            "abstract": "There have been some software tools of managing references when researchers prepare for their research publications, such as zotero and endnote. During last several years, developers of these kinds of tools tried to design a new feature or interface that can be used to visualize the \u201creference relations\u201d between scientific articles. However, probably because of the complexity of formatting reference data and the data inconsistency between different data sources, it seems that only a few existing tools have implemented similar but limited feature. In this study, we compared different graph algorithms and selected the most appropriate one to model and further implement the reference network. We also designed and implemented a reference mapping software which could demonstrate the relation network between scientific publications. A detailed evaluation on the tool was also provided.",
