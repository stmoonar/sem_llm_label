            "abstract": "As reinforcement learning methods increasingly amass accomplishments, the need for comprehending their solutions becomes more crucial. Most explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) methods generate a static explanation depicting their developers' intuition of what should be explained and how. In contrast, literature from the social sciences proposes that meaningful explanations are structured as a dialog between the explainer and the explainee, suggesting a more active role for the user and her communication with the agent. In this paper, we present ASQ-IT -- an interactive tool that presents video clips of the agent acting in its environment based on queries given by the user that describe temporal properties of behaviors of interest. Our approach is based on formal methods: queries in ASQ-IT's user interface map to a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), which we developed, and our algorithm for query processing is based on automata theory. User studies show that end-users can understand and formulate queries in ASQ-IT, and that using ASQ-IT assists users in identifying faulty agent behaviors.",

            "abstract": "The explosion of conference paper submissions in AI and related fields, has underscored the need to improve many aspects of the peer review process, especially the matching of papers and reviewers. Recent work argues that the key to improve this matching is to modify aspects of the \\emph{bidding phase} itself, to ensure that the set of bids over papers is balanced, and in particular to avoid \\emph{orphan papers}, i.e., those papers that receive no bids. In an attempt to understand and mitigate this problem, we have developed a flexible bidding platform to test adaptations to the bidding process. Using this platform, we performed a field experiment during the bidding phase of a medium-size international workshop that compared two bidding methods. We further examined via controlled experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk various factors that affect bidding, in particular the order in which papers are presented \\cite{cabanac2013capitalizing,fiez2020super}; and information on paper demand \\cite{meir2021market}. Our results suggest that several simple adaptations, that can be added to any existing platform, may significantly reduce the skew in bids, thereby improving the allocation for both reviewers and conference organizers.",

            "abstract": "Explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) methods aim to help elucidate agent policies and decision-making processes. The majority of XRL approaches focus on local explanations, seeking to shed light on the reasons an agent acts the way it does at a specific world state. While such explanations are both useful and necessary, they typically do not portray the outcomes of the agent's selected choice of action. \nIn this work, we propose ``COViz'', a new local explanation method that visually compares the outcome of an agent's chosen action to a counterfactual one. In contrast to most local explanations that provide state-limited observations of the agent's motivation, our method depicts alternative trajectories the agent could have taken from the given state and their outcomes. \nWe evaluated the usefulness of COViz in supporting people's understanding of agents' preferences and compare it with reward decomposition, a local explanation method that describes an agent's expected utility for different actions by decomposing it into meaningful reward types. Furthermore, we examine the complementary benefits of integrating both methods. Our results show that such integration significantly improved participants' performance.",

We examine the characteristics of the popular images shared on Twitter as part of \"Stop the Steal'', the widespread misinformation campaign during the 2020 U.S. election. We analyze the spread of the forty most popular images shared on Twitter as part of this campaign. Using a coding process, we categorize and label the images according to their type, content, origin, and role, and perform a mixed-method analysis of these images' spread on Twitter. Our results show that popular images include both photographs and text rendered as image. Only very few of these popular images included alleged photographic evidence of fraud; and none of the popular photographs had been manipulated. Most images reached a significant portion of their total spread within several hours from their first appearance, and both popular- and less-popular accounts were involved in various stages of their spread.",

Tracking visually-similar content is an important task for studying and analyzing social phenomena related to the spread of such content. In this paper, we address this need by building a dataset of social media images and evaluating visual near-duplicates retrieval methods based on image retrieval and several advanced visual feature extraction methods. We evaluate the methods using a large-scale dataset of images we crawl from social media and their manipulated versions we generated, presenting promising results in terms of recall. We demonstrate the potential of this method in two case studies: one that shows the value of creating systems supporting manual content review, and another that demonstrates the usefulness of automatic large-scale data analysis.",

            "abstract": "People have limited computational resources, yet they make complex strategic decisions over enormous spaces of possibilities. How do people efficiently search spaces with combinatorially branching paths? Here, we study players\u2019 search strategies for a winning move in a \u201ck-in-a-row\u201d game. We find that players use scoring strategies to prune the search space and augment this pruning by a \u201cshutter\u201d heuristic that focuses the search on the paths emanating from their previous move. This strong pruning has its costs\u2014both computational simulations and behavioral data indicate that the shutter size is correlated with players\u2019 blindness to their opponent\u2019s winning moves. However, simulations of the search while varying the shutter size, complexity levels, noise levels, branching factor, and computational limitations indicate that despite its costs, a narrow shutter strategy is the dominant strategy for most of the parameter space. Finally, we show that in the presence of computational limitations, the shutter heuristic enhances the performance of deep learning networks in these end-game scenarios. Together, our findings suggest a novel adaptive heuristic that benefits search in a vast space of possibilities of a strategic game.",

            "abstract": "With advances in reinforcement learning (RL), agents are now being developed in high-stakes application domains such as healthcare and transportation. Explaining the behavior of these agents is challenging, as they act in large state spaces, and their decision-making can be affected by delayed rewards. In this paper, we explore a combination of explanations that attempt to convey the global behavior of the agent and local explanations which provide information regarding the agent's decision-making in a particular state. Specifically, we augment strategy summaries that demonstrate the agent's actions in a range of states with saliency maps highlighting the information it attends to. Our user study shows that intelligently choosing what states to include in the summary (global information) results in an improved analysis of the agents. We find mixed results with respect to augmenting summaries with saliency maps (local information).",

Under these circumstances, it is critical to understand the discussions surrounding these claims on Twitter, a major platform where the claims were disseminated. To this end, we collected and released the VoterFraud2020 dataset, a multi-modal dataset with 7.6M tweets and 25.6M retweets from 2.6M users related to voter fraud claims. To make this data immediately useful for a diverse set of research projects, we further enhance the data with cluster labels computed from the retweet graph, each user's suspension status, and the perceptual hashes of tweeted images. The dataset also includes aggregate data for all external links and YouTube videos that appear in the tweets. Preliminary analyses of the data show that Twitter's user suspension actions mostly affected a specific community of voter fraud claim promoters, and exposes the most common URLs, images and YouTube videos shared in the data.",
