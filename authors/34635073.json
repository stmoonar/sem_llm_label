            "title": "Performance assessment of ensembles of in situ workflows under resource constraints",
            "abstract": "Scientific breakthroughs in biomolecular methods and improvements in hardware technology have shifted from a long\u2010running simulation to a large set of shorter simulations running simultaneously, called an ensemble. In an ensemble, simulations are usually coupled with analyses of data produced by the simulations. In situ methods can be used to analyze large volumes of data generated by scientific simulations at runtime (i.e., simulations and analyses are performed concurrently). In this work, we study the execution of ensemble\u2010based simulations paired with in situ analyses using in\u2010memory staging methods. Using an ensemble of molecular dynamics in situ workflows with multiple simulations and analyses, we first show that collecting traditional metrics such as makespan, instructions per cycle, memory usage, or cache miss ratio is not sufficient to characterize complex behaviors of ensembles. We propose a method to evaluate the performance of ensembles of workflows that captures multiple resource usage aspects: resource efficiency, resource allocation, and resource provisioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively distinguish the performance of different component placements in an ensemble with up to 32 ensemble members. By evaluating different co\u2010location scenarios, our proposed performance indicators demonstrate benefits of co\u2010locating simulation and coupled analyses within a compute node.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are important in modern computational science and are a convenient way to represent complex computations, which are often geographically distributed among several computers. In many scientific domains, scientists use sensors (e.g., edge devices) to gather data such as CO2 level or temperature, that are usually sent to a central processing facility (e.g., a cloud). However, these edge devices are often not powerful enough to perform basic computations or machine learning inference computations and thus applications need the power of cloud platforms to generate scientific results. This work explores the execution and deployment of a complex workflow on an edge-to-cloud architecture in a use case of the detection and classification of plankton. In the original application, images were captured by cameras attached to buoys floating in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland). We developed a workflow based on that application. The workflow aims to pre-process images locally on the edge devices (i.e., buoys) then transfer data from each edge device to a cloud platform. Here, we developed a Pegasus workflow that runs using HTCondor and leveraged the Chameleon cloud platform and its recent CHI@Edge feature to mimic such deployment and study its feasibility in terms of performance and deployment.",

CICF is part of the CI Compass project, which is the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence, created to provide support and enhance the data life-cycle of NSF Major Facilities (MFs) [1]. MFs are the largest-scale scientific efforts that the NSF supports and are highly diverse, have heterogeneous data, and a wide range of cyberinfrastructure for capturing, processing, archiving, and disseminating data, as well as providing access to sophisticated instruments and computational capabilities. MFs span many science domains, including astronomy, climate, ecology, natural hazard, ocean science, physics, and seismology [2]. Due to the complexity of the cyberinfrastructure and data that supports MFs, it is critical that we create educational opportunities for students interested in pursuing a career in this specialized cyberinfrastructure",

To handle the deployment, monitoring, and optimization of workflow executions, many workflow systems have been developed over the past decade. There is a need for workflow benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the performance of workflow systems on current and future software stacks and hardware platforms.We present a generator of realistic workflow benchmark specifications that can be translated into benchmark code to be executed with current workflow systems. Our approach generates workflow tasks with arbitrary performance characteristics (CPU, memory, and I/O usage) and with realistic task dependency structures based on those seen in production workflows. We present experimental results that show that our approach generates benchmarks that are representative of production workflows, and conduct a case study to demonstrate the use and usefulness of our generated benchmarks to evaluate the performance of workflow systems under different configuration scenarios.",

Therefore, detecting and diagnosing anomalies are both important and challenging for workflow executions that span complex, distributed computing infrastructures. In this paper we model the scientific workflow as a directed acyclic graph and apply graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify the anomalies at both the workflow and individual job levels. In addition, we generalize our GNN model to take into account a set of workflows together for the anomaly detection task rather than a specific workflow. By taking advantage of learning the hidden representation, not only from the job features, but also from the topological information of the workflow, our GNN models demonstrate higher accuracy and better runtime efficiency when compared with conventional machine learning models and other convolutional neural network approaches.",

            "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to study large-scale molecular systems. HPC systems are ideal platforms to run these studies, however, reaching the necessary simulation timescale to detect rare processes is challenging, even with modern supercomputers. To overcome the timescale limitation, the simulation of a long MD trajectory is replaced by multiple short-range simulations that are executed simultaneously in an ensemble of simulations. Analyses are usually co-scheduled with these simulations to efficiently process large volumes of data generated by the simulations at runtime, thanks to in situ techniques. Executing a workflow ensemble of simulations and their in situ analyses requires efficient co-scheduling strategies and sophisticated management of computational resources so that they are not slowing down each other. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to co-schedule simulations and in situ analyses such that the makespan of the workflow ensemble is minimized. We present a novel approach to allocate resources for a workflow ensemble under resource constraints by using a theoretical framework modeling the workflow ensemble\u2019s execution. We evaluate the proposed approach using an accurate simulator based on the WRENCH simulation framework on various workflow ensemble configurations. Results demonstrate the significance of co-scheduling simulations and in situ analyses that couple data together to benefit from data locality, in which inefficient scheduling decisions can lead to slowdown in makespan up to a factor of 30.",

            "abstract": "The amount of data generated by numerical simulations in various scientific domains led to a fundamental redesign of how the analysis and visualization of simulation outputs are performed. The throughput and capacity of storage subsystems have not evolved as fast as the computing power in extreme-scale supercomputers, making the classical post-hoc approach highly inefficient. In situ processing has then emerged as a solution in which simulation and data analysis/visualization are intertwined for better performance and greater interactivity. Determining the best allocation, i.e., how many resources to allocate to simulation and analysis respectively, mapping, i.e., where and at which frequency to run the analysis/visualization, and data transfer mode is a complex task whose performance assessment is crucial to the efficient execution of in situ processing. However, such a performance evaluation of different strategies usually relies either on directly running them on the targeted execution environments, which can rapidly become extremely time- and resource-consuming, or on resorting to simplified models of the components of an in situ application, which can lack of realism. In both cases, the validity of the performance evaluation is limited. In this paper, we present SIM-SITU, a framework for the faithful performance evaluation of in situ processing strategies. We designed SIM-SITU to reflect the typical features of in situ processing systems. Thanks to its modular design, Sim-Situ has the necessary flexibility to easily and faithfully evaluate the behavior and performance of various allocation, mapping, and data transfer strategies. We illustrate the capabilities of SIM-SITU on a Molecular Dynamics use case. We study the impact of different strategies on performance and show how users can leverage SIM-SITU to determine interesting tradeoffs when adding analysis/visualization components to their application.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows drive most modern large-scale science breakthroughs by allowing scientists to define their computations as a set of jobs executed in a given order based on their data dependencies. Workflow management systems (WMSs) have become key to automating scientific workflows-executing computational jobs and orchestrating data transfers between those jobs running on complex high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. Traditionally, WMSs use files to communicate between jobs: a job writes out files that are read by other jobs. However, HPC machines face a growing gap between their storage and compute capabilities. To address that concern, the scientific community has adopted a new approach called in situ, which bypasses costly parallel filesystem I/O operations with faster in-memory or in-network communications. When using in situ approaches, communication and computations can be interleaved. In this work, we leverage the Decaf in situ dataflow framework to accelerate task-based scientific workflows managed by the Pegasus WMS, by replacing file communications with faster MPI messaging. We propose a new execution engine that uses Decaf to manage communications within a sub-workflow (i.e., set of jobs) to optimize inter-job communications. We consider two workflows in this study: (i) a synthetic workflow that benchmarks and compares file- and MPI-based communication; and (ii) a realistic bioinformatics workflow that computes mu-tational overlaps in the human genome. Experiments show that in situ communication can improve the bioinformatics workflow execution time by 22% to 30% compared with file communication. Our results motivate further opportunities and challenges for bridging traditional WMSs with in situ frameworks.",

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",
