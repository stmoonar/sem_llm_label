            "title": "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2022 Report",
            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language understanding and processing have resulted in renewed interest in natural language interfaces to data, which provide an easy mechanism for non-technical users to access and query the data. While early systems evolved from keyword search and focused on simple factual queries, the complexity of both the input sentences as well as the generated SQL queries has evolved over time. More recently, there has also been a lot of focus on using conversational interfaces for data analytics, empowering a line of business owners and non-technical users with quick insights into the data. There are three main challenges in natural language querying: (1) identifying the entities involved in the user utterance, (2) connecting the different entities in a meaningful way over the underlying data source to interpret user intents, and finally (3) generating a structured query in the form of SQL or SPARQL. There are two main approaches in the literature for interpreting a user\u2019s natural language query.

It has been my mission to find more efficient, and effective ways to store, manage, query and analyze data to drive actionable insights.

In this talk, I will talk about lessons learned, both technical and non-technical, using two of these systems as examples.",
