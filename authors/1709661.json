            "title": "On Native Location-Optimized Data Systems",
            "abstract": "With the ubiquity of location detection devices and location services and the massive amounts of the location data being produced, there is dire need for developing highly scalable location data systems. Currently, location data is usually supported as an afterthought in existing data systems, and hence these systems are not optimized natively for location data handling. This short paper reflects a lightning talk presented by the author. It calls for designing systems with location data being a first-class citizen, and highlights several important aspects that characterize location-optimized data systems. These include deterministic performance, supporting write-optimization, update tolerance, having adaptive location indexes and adaptive data stores, and having tight integration with the graph, document, relational and other multi data models for optimized performance.",

            "abstract": "Skiplists have become prevalent in systems. The main advantages of skiplists are their simplicity and ease of implementation, and the ability to support operations in the same asymptotic complexities as their tree-based counterparts. In this survey, we explore skiplists and their many variants. We highlight many scenarios of how skiplists are useful and fit well in these usage scenarios. We study several extensions to skiplists to make them fit for more applications, e.g., their use in the multi-dimensional space, network overlaying algorithms, as well as serving as indexes in database systems. Besides, we also discuss systems that adopt the idea of skiplists and apply the probabilistic skip pattern into their designs.",

            "abstract": "A recent research trend involves treating database index structures as Machine Learning (ML) models. In this domain, single or multiple ML models are trained to learn the mapping from keys to positions inside a data set. This class of indexes is known as\"Learned Indexes.\"Learned indexes have demonstrated improved search performance and reduced space requirements for one-dimensional data. The concept of one-dimensional learned indexes has naturally been extended to multi-dimensional (e.g., spatial) data, leading to the development of\"Learned Multi-dimensional Indexes\". This survey focuses on learned multi-dimensional index structures. Specifically, it reviews the current state of this research area, explains the core concepts behind each proposed method, and classifies these methods based on several well-defined criteria. We present a taxonomy that classifies and categorizes each learned multi-dimensional index, and survey the existing literature on learned multi-dimensional indexes according to this taxonomy. Additionally, we present a timeline to illustrate the evolution of research on learned indexes. Finally, we highlight several open challenges and future research directions in this emerging and highly active field.",

            "abstract": "The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.",

            "title": "SELCC: Coherent Caching over Compute-Limited Disaggregated Memory",
            "abstract": "Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on round-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers makes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side caches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC builds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch release and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can guarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes communication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into RDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global concurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided cache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction layer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus enabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated memory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we implement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over SELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves better performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols. Additionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC can achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over disaggregated memory.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

This paper investigates how indexing can be efficiently designed in the memory disaggregated architecture. Although existing research has optimized the B-tree for this new architecture, its performance is moderate. This paper focuses on LSM-based indexing and proposes dLSM, the first highly optimized LSM-tree for disaggregated memory. dLSM introduces a suite of optimizations including reducing software overhead, leveraging near-data computing, tuning for byte-addressability, and an instantiation over RDMA as a case study with RDMA-specific customizations to improve system performance. Experiments illustrate that dLSM achieves 1.6\u00d7 to 11.7\u00d7 higher write throughput than running the optimized B-tree and four adaptations of existing LSM-tree indexes over disaggregated memory. dLSM is written in C++ (with approximately 41,000 LOC), and is open-sourced.",

            "abstract": "The Skiplist, or skip list, originally designed as an in-memory data structure, has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as a main-memory component in many NoSQL, cloud-based, and big data systems. Unlike the B-tree, the skiplist does not need complex rebalancing mechanisms, but it still shows expected logarithmic performance. It supports a variety of operations, including insert, point read, and range queries. To make the skiplist more versatile, many optimizations have been applied to its node structure, construction algorithm, list structure, concurrent access, to name a few. Many variants of the skiplist have been proposed and experimented with, in many big-data system scenarios. In addition to being a main-memory component, the skiplist also serves as a core index in systems to address problems including write amplification, write stalls, sorting, range query processing, etc. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview of the skiplist, its variants, optimizations, and various use cases of how big data and NoSQL systems make use of skiplists. Throughout this tutorial, we demonstrate the advantages of using a skiplist or skiplist-like structures in modern data systems.",

These papers have received the highest ranks by the conference\u2019s program committee members, and have also been endorsed by the PC co-chairs. Au-thors of all five conference papers have extended their papers and have submitted the extended versions for possible publication in ACM TSAS. To qualify for publication in ACM TSAS, one important criterion is that the extended version includes at least 30% new material over the published conference version of the paper. The reviewers and the editorial board of ACM TSAS are the ones to decide on this issue, as well as assess the significance of the newly added material. Another important criterion is that these extended versions should not have been published formerly in any other publication venue. To speed up the review process",
