            "title": "ExaWorks Software Development Kit: A Robust and Scalable Collection of Interoperable Workflow Technologies",
            "abstract": "Scientific discovery increasingly requires executing heterogeneous scientific workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. Heterogeneous workflows contain different types of tasks (e.g., simulation, analysis, and learning) that need to be mapped, scheduled, and launched on different computing. That requires a software stack that enables users to code their workflows and automate resource management and workflow execution. Currently, there are many workflow technologies with diverse levels of robustness and capabilities, and users face difficult choices of software that can effectively and efficiently support their use cases on HPC machines, especially when considering the latest exascale platforms. We contributed to addressing this issue by developing the ExaWorks Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK is a curated collection of workflow technologies engineered following current best practices and specifically designed to work on HPC platforms. We present our experience with (1) curating those technologies, (2) integrating them to provide users with new capabilities, (3) developing a continuous integration platform to test the SDK on DOE HPC platforms, (4) designing a dashboard to publish the results of those tests, and (5) devising an innovative documentation platform to help users to use those technologies. Our experience details the requirements and the best practices needed to curate workflow technologies, and it also serves as a blueprint for the capabilities and services that DOE will have to offer to support a variety of scientific heterogeneous workflows on the newly available exascale HPC platforms.",

            "abstract": "It is generally desirable for high-performance computing (HPC) applications to be portable between HPC systems, for example to make use of more performant hardware, make effective use of allocations, and to co-locate compute jobs with large datasets. Unfortunately, moving scientific applications between HPC systems is challenging for various reasons, most notably that HPC systems have different HPC schedulers. We introduce PSI/J, a job management abstraction API intended to simplify the construction of software components and applications that are portable over various HPC scheduler implementations. We argue that such a system is both necessary and that no viable alternative currently exists. We analyze similar notable APIs and attempt to determine the factors that influenced their evolution and adoption by the HPC community. We base the design of PSI/J on that analysis. We describe how PSI/J has been integrated in three workflow systems and one application, and also show via experiments that PSI/J imposes minimal overhead.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Modern large-scale scientific discovery requires multidisciplinary collaboration across diverse computing facilities, including High Performance Computing (HPC) machines and the Edge-to-Cloud continuum. Integrated data analysis plays a crucial role in scientific discovery, especially in the current AI era, by enabling Responsible AI development, FAIR, Reproducibility, and User Steering. However, the heterogeneous nature of science poses challenges such as dealing with multiple supporting tools, cross-facility environments, and efficient HPC execution. Building on data observability, adapter system design, and provenance, we propose MIDA: an approach for lightweight runtime Multi-workflow Integrated Data Analysis. MIDA defines data observability strategies and adaptability methods for various parallel systems and machine learning tools. With observability, it intercepts the dataflows in the background without requiring instrumentation while integrating domain, provenance, and telemetry data at runtime into a unified database ready for user steering queries. We conduct experiments showing end-to-end multi-workflow analysis integrating data from Dask and MLFlow in a real distributed deep learning use case for materials science that runs on multiple environments with up to 276 GPUs in parallel. We show near-zero overhead running up to 100,000 tasks on 1,680 CPU cores on the Summit supercomputer.",

Most experimental evaluations of these workflows rely on workflow instances, which can be either real-world or synthetic, to ensure relevance to current application domains or explore hypothetical/future scenarios. The WfCommons project addresses this need by providing data and tools to support such evaluations. In this paper, we present an overview of WfCommons and describe two recent developments. Firstly, we introduce a workflow execution \"tracer\" for Nextflow, which significantly enhances the set of real-world instances available in WfCommons. Secondly, we describe a workflow instance \"translator\" that enables the execution of any real-world or synthetic WfCommons workflow instance using Dask. Our contributions aim to provide researchers and practitioners with more comprehensive resources for evaluating scientific workflows.",

            "abstract": "Models derived from other models are extremely common in machine learning (ML) today. For example, transfer learning is used to create task-specific models from\"pre-trained\"models through finetuning. This has led to an ecosystem where models are related to each other, sharing structure and often even parameter values. However, it is hard to manage these model derivatives: the storage overhead of storing all derived models quickly becomes onerous, prompting users to get rid of intermediate models that might be useful for further analysis. Additionally, undesired behaviors in models are hard to track down (e.g., is a bug inherited from an upstream model?). In this paper, we propose a model versioning and management system called MGit that makes it easier to store, test, update, and collaborate on model derivatives. MGit introduces a lineage graph that records provenance and versioning information between models, optimizations to efficiently store model parameters, as well as abstractions over this lineage graph that facilitate relevant testing, updating and collaboration functionality. MGit is able to reduce the lineage graph's storage footprint by up to 7x and automatically update downstream models in response to updates to upstream models.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Tightening the Integration between Computing Facilities and Scientific Workflows",
            "abstract": "The importance of workflows is highlighted by the fact that they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past decades. Many of these workflows have significant computational, storage, and communication demands, and thus must execute on a range of large-scale computer systems, from local clusters to public clouds and upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Historically, infrastructures for workflow execution consisted of complex, integrated systems, developed in-house by workflow practitioners with strong dependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing need to support workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide abstractions for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and efficiently while ensuring portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile individually, there are now hundreds of independent workflow systems. The resulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may present significant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly comparable, yet usually mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to tackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded ExaWorks and NSF-funded WorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled the\"Workflows Community Summit\". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community Summit\"explored workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of computing centers and facilities. The third summit brought together a small group of facilities representatives with the aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.

            "abstract": "The analysis of vast amounts of data and the processing of complex computational jobs have traditionally relied upon high performance computing (HPC) systems, which offer reliable and efficient management of large-scale computational and data resources. Understanding these analyses\u2019 needs is paramount for designing solutions that can lead to better science, and similarly, understanding the characteristics of the user behavior on those systems is important for improving user experiences on HPC systems. A common approach to gathering data about user behavior is to extract workload characteristics from system log data available only to system administrators. Recently at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), however, we unveiled user behavior about the Summit supercomputer by collecting data from a user\u2019s point of view with ordinary Unix commands.In this paper, we discuss the process, challenges, and lessons learned while preparing this dataset for publication and submission to an open data challenge. The original dataset contains personal identifiable information (PII) about the users of OLCF which needed be masked prior to publication, and we determined that anonymization, which scrubs PII completely, destroyed too much of the structure of the data to be interesting for the data challenge. We instead chose to pseudonymize the dataset, which reduced the linkability of the dataset to the users\u2019 identities. Pseudonymization is significantly more computationally expensive than anonymization, and the size of our dataset, which is approximately 175 million lines of raw text, necessitated the development of a parallelized workflow that could be reused on different HPC machines. We demonstrate the scaling behavior of the workflow on two leadership class HPC systems at OLCF, and we show that we were able to bring the overall makespan time from an impractical 20+ hours on a single node down to around 2 hours. As a result of this work, we release the entire pseudonymized dataset and make the workflows and source code publicly available.",
