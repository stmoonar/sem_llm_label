            "title": "Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows",
            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

In order to help frame the development and improvement of data discovery tools, we collected a list of requirements and users\u2019 wishes. This paper presents the analysis of these 101 use cases to examine data discovery requirements; these cases were collected between 2019 and 2020. We categorized the information across 12 \u2018topics\u2019 and eight types of users. While the availability of metadata was an expected topic of importance, users were also keen on receiving more information on data citation and a better overview of their field. We conducted and analysed a survey among data infrastructure specialists in a first attempt at ranking the requirements. Between these data professionals, these rankings were very different, excepting the availability of metadata and data quality assessment.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The increased number of data repositories has greatly increased the availability of open data. To enable broad discovery and access to research dataset, some data repositories have begun leveraging the web architecture by embedding structured metadata markup in dataset web landing pages using vocabularies from Schema.org and extensions. This paper aims to examine metadata interoperability for supporting global data discovery. Specifically, the paper reports a survey on which metadata schema has been adopted by participating data repositories, and presents an analysis of crosswalks from fourteen research data schemas to Schema.org. The analysis indicates most descriptive metadata are interoperable among the schemas, the most inconsistent mapping is the rights metadata, and a large gap exists in the structural metadata and controlled vocabularies to specify various property values. The analysis and collated crosswalks can serve as a reference for data repositories when they develop crosswalks from their own schemas to Schema.org, and provide the research data community a benchmark of structured metadata implementation.",

            "abstract": "The findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific data management and stewardship aim to facilitate data reuse at scale by both humans and machines. Research and development (R&D) in the pharmaceutical industry is becoming increasingly data driven, but managing its data assets according to FAIR principles remains costly and challenging. To date, little scientific evidence exists about how FAIR is currently implemented in practice, what its associated costs and benefits are, and how decisions are made about the retrospective FAIRification of data sets in pharmaceutical R&D. This paper reports the results of semi-structured interviews with 14 pharmaceutical professionals who participate in various stages of drug R&D in seven pharmaceutical businesses. Inductive thematic analysis identified three primary themes of the benefits and costs of FAIRification, and the elements that influence the decision-making process for FAIRifying legacy data sets. Participants collectively acknowledged the potential contribution of FAIRification to data reusability in diverse research domains and the subsequent potential for cost-savings. Implementation costs, however, were still considered a barrier by participants, with the need for considerable expenditure in terms of resources, and cultural change. How decisions were made about FAIRification was influenced by legal and ethical considerations, management commitment, and data prioritisation. The findings have significant implications for those in the pharmaceutical R&D industry who are engaged in driving FAIR implementation, and for external parties who seek to better understand existing practices and challenges.",

            "abstract": "The FAIR principles have been widely cited, endorsed and adopted by a broad range of stakeholders since their publication in 2016. By intention, the 15 FAIR guiding principles do not dictate specific technological implementations, but provide guidance for improving Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of digital resources. This has likely contributed to the broad adoption of the FAIR principles, because individual stakeholder communities can implement their own FAIR solutions. However, it has also resulted in inconsistent interpretations that carry the risk of leading to incompatible implementations. Thus, while the FAIR principles are formulated on a high level and may be interpreted and implemented in different ways, for true interoperability we need to support convergence in implementation choices that are widely accessible and (re)-usable. We introduce the concept of FAIR implementation considerations to assist accelerated global participation and convergence towards accessible, robust, widespread and consistent FAIR implementations. Any self-identified stakeholder community may either choose to reuse solutions from existing implementations, or when they spot a gap, accept the challenge to create the needed solution, which, ideally, can be used again by other communities in the future. Here, we provide interpretations and implementation considerations (choices and challenges) for each FAIR principle.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Since its launch in 2010, Identifiers.org has become an important tool for the annotation and cross-referencing of Life Science data. In 2016, we established the Compact Identifier (CID) scheme (prefix: accession) to generate globally unique identifiers for data resources using their locally assigned accession identifiers. Since then, we have developed and improved services to support the growing need to create, reference and resolve CIDs, in systems ranging from human readable text to cloud-based e-infrastructures, by providing high availability and low-latency cloud-based services, backed by a high-quality, manually curated resource. Results We describe a set of services that can be used to construct and resolve CIDs in Life Sciences and beyond. We have developed a new front end for accessing the Identifiers.org registry data and APIs to simplify integration of Identifiers.org CID services with third-party applications. We have also deployed the new Identifiers.org infrastructure in a commercial cloud environment, bringing our services closer to the data. Availabilityand implementation https://identifiers.org.",

We discuss issues surrounding the representation, publication, integration, mining and reuse of biological data and metadata across a wide range of biomedical data types of relevance for the life sciences, including chemistry, genotypes and phenotypes, orthology and phylogeny, proteomics, genomics, glycomics, and metabolomics. We describe our progress to address ongoing challenges to the reusability and reproducibility of research results, and identify outstanding issues that continue to impede the progress of bioinformatics research. We share our perspective on the state of the art, continued challenges, and goals for future research and development for the life sciences Semantic Web.",

            "abstract": "Publishing databases in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) model is becoming widely accepted to maximize the syntactic and semantic interoperability of open data in life sciences. Here we report advancements made in the 6th and 7th annual BioHackathons which were held in Tokyo and Miyagi respectively. This review consists of two major sections covering: 1) improvement and utilization of RDF data in various domains of the life sciences and 2) meta-data about these RDF data, the resources that store them, and the service quality of SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints. The first section describes how we developed RDF data, ontologies and tools in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics and by literature text mining. The second section describes how we defined descriptions of datasets, the provenance of data, and quality assessment of services and service discovery. By enhancing the harmonization of these two layers of machine-readable data and knowledge, we improve the way community wide resources are developed and published. \u00a0Moreover, we outline best practices for the future, and prepare ourselves for an exciting and unanticipatable variety of real world applications in coming years.",

            "title": "Harmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology",
            "abstract": "Life science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition, and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current semantic annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation.",
