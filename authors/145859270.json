            "abstract": "Existing domain adaptation methods strive to align all domains equally under a single domain shift dimension, which poses two problems. On the one hand, multiaspect domain transferring factors and homogenous alignment may lead to suboptimal results in more distant domains. On the other hand, such a global alignment ignores local discriminatory information, making class boundary samples susceptible to misclassification. Hence, the three-types-of-graph-relational guided domain adaptation (TGGDA) is proposed. First, the domain graph is formed based on condition-dependent slow variables. The domain discriminator is redesigned to reconstruct the domain graph. Second, intrinsic and penalty graphs are integrated to draw the same class but different domains sample closer and vice versa. The TGGDA is a system-assisted cross-domain diagnosis method that enables multidimensional domain information measurable, and the adjacency alignment allows for more accurate diagnostic results. Finally, experiments on gearbox fault diagnosis in circulating water pumps show that TGGDA can improve diagnosis accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Journal bearings are the key components of the nuclear circulating water pump (NCWP), and accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is of great significance for improving the reliability, safety, and maintenance planning of NCWP. However, it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty of bearing RUL based on the current deep learning (DL) model, resulting in a lack of credibility and effective convincing for RUL predicted by the model. Meanwhile, all existing hybrid models are basically simple combinations, and they cannot solve the uncertainty quantification problem of RUL predicted by DL. Hence, the bearing RUL prediction method based on a dynamic interactive hybrid model is proposed. First, a degradation model based on a nonlinear enhanced generalized Wiener process (EGWP) is proposed, which combines gated neural networks and time-varying drift coefficients to describe the nonlinear degradation process of bearing. Then, a corrective gated recurrent unit (CGRU) network is designed to learn and predict real-time degradation increments, and the parameters of the degradation model are dynamically updated through the history and prediction of degradation increments. Finally, the bearing RUL prediction is given by the CGRU network, and the probability density function of RUL is given by the proposed hybrid model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the PHM 2012 bearing dataset and the NCWP journal bearing dataset. The results show that our proposed method can effectively predict bearing RUL and its uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Most data center services are finished by the cooperation among the connected servers. However, the malicious attackers always try to divide the network into disconnected components to start some attacks, such as the address resolution protocol (ARP) attack, the denial of service (DoS) attack, the botnet attack, and so on. The connectivity is an excellent indicator to measure the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the network. Whereas, the traditional connectivity and current conditional connectivity cannot well reflect the fault-tolerant performance of the network when attackers are a block or have a certain structure and the components of the remaining network still have a certain structure. Based on this fact, we propose a new measure: the double-structure connectivity, which can accurately reflect the fault-tolerant ability of the network when attackers are structured and each component of the network has a certain structure after removing the attacked servers. Meanwhile, a hypercube is a high-performance interconnection network that can also be used to design some data center networks. Therefore, we study the double-structure fault-tolerance of the hypercube and determine the double-structure connectivity of distinct structures of the hypercube. Furthermore, we propose algorithms to construct structures of attackers directly to measure the fault-tolerant ability of the hypercube under this attack. Our results can be applied not only to interconnection networks but also to some data center networks.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have notably enhanced the fluency and diversity of machine-generated text. However, this progress also presents a significant challenge in detecting the origin of a given text, and current research on detection methods lags behind the rapid evolution of LLMs. Conventional training-based methods have limitations in flexibility, particularly when adapting to new domains, and they often lack explanatory power. To address this gap, we propose a novel training-free detection strategy called Divergent N-Gram Analysis (DNA-GPT). Given a text, we first truncate it in the middle and then use only the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the new remaining parts. By analyzing the differences between the original and new remaining parts through N-gram analysis in black-box or probability divergence in white-box, we unveil significant discrepancies between the distribution of machine-generated text and the distribution of human-written text. We conducted extensive experiments on the most advanced LLMs from OpenAI, including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4, as well as open-source models such as GPT-NeoX-20B and LLaMa-13B. Results show that our zero-shot approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing between human and GPT-generated text on four English and one German dataset, outperforming OpenAI's own classifier, which is trained on millions of text. Additionally, our methods provide reasonable explanations and evidence to support our claim, which is a unique feature of explainable detection. Our method is also robust under the revised text attack and can additionally solve model sourcing. Codes are available at https://github.com/Xianjun-Yang/DNA-GPT.",

            "abstract": "The active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can amplify the incident signal besides reflecting, thus alleviating the double-fading effect of the cascaded link. However, if the interference caused by the cascaded link cannot be effectively cancelled, the alleviated effect may result in increased interference among users, thus limiting the performance gain brought by the active IRS. To this end, an active IRS aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is proposed in this paper for the millimeter-wave hybrid antenna array. In the proposed scheme, a user grouping method is designed to circumvent the narrow beamwidth constraint, and the 2-layer rate-splitting (RS) strategy applicable to the user grouping result and the corresponding successive interference cancellation are designed to cancel interference. To evaluate the max-min fairness (MMF) performance of the proposed scheme, an MMF optimization problem (OP) is formulated, where the digital precoder, the RS vector, and the reflecting vector are jointly optimized. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with a novel AO strategy is proposed to solve the MMF OP, where the RS vector is optimized in two subproblems. An initialization method is designed specially to start the AO algorithm. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can more fully exploit the active IRS, and although the active IRS consumes additional power, it can bring energy efficiency gain to system.",

A suboptimal two-step algorithm is proposed to solve the above OP. First, a K-means-based user grouping method is designed by using the location information of each user.

Of these, webshell attacks are particularly insidious, as they can be uploaded through legitimate paths and executed using network traffic that is indistinguishable from that of normal users. Despite the existence of several proposed detection methods for identifying webshell attacks, attackers can still easily evade them. To address this issue, we present HoneyContainer, an architecture designed to detect webshell-based command injection attacks, trace the origin of the attacker, and redirect malicious traffic to a honeypot container. Our prototype implementation of Honey-Container has been validated using 214 webshell files, with results demonstrating its ability to detect all shell command injection events and redirect malicious traffic. Our evaluations also indicate that the overhead caused by HoneyContainer is minimal and unlikely to be noticeable by normal users.

            "abstract": "Text summarization has been a crucial problem in natural language processing (NLP) for several decades. It aims to condense lengthy documents into shorter versions while retaining the most critical information. Various methods have been proposed for text summarization, including extractive and abstractive summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and ChatGPT has recently created significant interest in using these models for text summarization tasks. Recent studies \\cite{goyal2022news, zhang2023benchmarking} have shown that LLMs-generated news summaries are already on par with humans. However, the performance of LLMs for more practical applications like aspect or query-based summaries is underexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on four widely used benchmark datasets, encompassing diverse summaries from Reddit posts, news articles, dialogue meetings, and stories. Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT's performance is comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods in terms of Rouge scores. Moreover, we highlight some unique differences between ChatGPT-generated summaries and human references, providing valuable insights into the superpower of ChatGPT for diverse text summarization tasks. Our findings call for new directions in this area, and we plan to conduct further research to systematically examine the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated summaries through extensive human evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Infrared thermal imaging technology has been widely applied in the field of target detection at present, which lays the foundation of research on situational awareness for the Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship. Compared with the traditional image recognition technology with defects such as low recognition accuracy, strong light dependence and poor anti-interference ability, infrared thermal imaging technology is not only adaptive to different light intensity environments, but also has the advantages of high concealment, strong detection capability, long detection distance and high detection sensitivity. In this paper, it proposes an improved method of Canny segmentation algorithm based on maximum inter-class variance method on the basis of infrared imaging, where the image is preprocessed by wavelet transform, it is achieved the moving target detection, to restrain noise interference. And then, the edge blurring is effectively processed by using the mask image of Canny edge detection as inputs of pattern recognition. The optimal threshold is determined by the improved Otus algorithm, which can stabilize the optical flow field of the background, to realize effective segmentation of ship images to obtain the high definition moving target. Finally, the availability of the algorithm has been verified by taking the tourist ferry under the Yangtze River as the object. The results showed that the improved algorithm can stabilize the optical flow field of the background, and the application effect is improved, which can provide technical support for the research and application of intelligent ship target perception.",
