            "abstract": "Let $R \\cup B$ be a set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and let $k \\in 1..n$. Our goal is to compute a line that\"best\"separates the\"red\"points $R$ from the\"blue\"points $B$ with at most $k$ outliers. We present an efficient semi-online dynamic data structure that can maintain whether such a separator exists. Furthermore, we present efficient exact and approximation algorithms that compute a linear separator that is guaranteed to misclassify at most $k$, points and minimizes the distance to the farthest outlier. Our exact algorithm runs in $O(nk + n \\log n)$ time, and our $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm runs in $O(\\varepsilon^{-1/2}((n + k^2) \\log n))$ time. Based on our $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm we then also obtain a semi-online data structure to maintain such a separator efficiently.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Maps are used to solve a wide variety of tasks, ranging from navigation to analysis. Often, the quality of a map is directly related to the quality of its labelling. Consequently, a lot of research has focussed on the automatization of the labelling process. Surprisingly the (automated) labelling of island groups has received little attention so far. This is at least partially caused by the lack of cartographic principles. 31 Though extensive guidelines for map labelling exist, information on the labelling of groups of islands is surprisingly sparse. We define a formal framework for island labelling. The framework spawns a large series of unexplored computational geometry problems, which are interesting for the CG-community. In this paper we start by looking at a non-overlapping, straight label. We describe two algorithms for a straight-line label that is, or is not, allowed overlap with islands. Furthermore, we discus several extensions to these algorithms solving closely related problems.",

            "abstract": "In the trajectory segmentation problem we are given a polygonal trajectory with n vertices that we have to subdivide into a minimum number of disjoint segments (subtrajectories) that all satisfy a given criterion. The problem is known to be solvable efficiently for monotone criteria: criteria with the property that if they hold on a certain segment, they also hold on every subsegment of that segment [4]. To the best of our knowledge, no theoretical results are known for non-monotone criteria. \n \nWe present a broader study of the segmentation problem, and suggest a general framework for solving it, based on the start-stop diagram: a 2-dimensional diagram that represents all valid and invalid segments of a given trajectory. This yields two subproblems: (i) computing the start-stop diagram, and (ii) finding the optimal segmentation for a given diagram. We show that (ii) is NP-hard in general. However, we identify properties of the start-stop diagram that make the problem tractable, and give polynomial-time algorithm for this case. \n \nWe study two concrete non-monotone criteria that arise in practical applications in more detail. Both are based on a given univariate attribute function f over the domain of the trajectory. We say a segment satisfies an outlier-tolerant criterion if the value of f lies within a certain range for at least a given percentage of the length of the segment. We say a segment satisfies a standard deviation criterion if the standard deviation of f over the length of the segment lies below a given threshold. We show that both criteria satisfy the properties that make the segmentation problem tractable. In particular, we compute an optimal segmentation of a trajectory based on the outlier-tolerant criterion in O(n2 log n+kn2) time, and on the standard deviation criterion in O(kn2) time, where n is the number of vertices of the input trajectory and k is the number of segments in an optimal solution.",
