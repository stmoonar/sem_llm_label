            "title": "Integrating omics databases for enhanced crop breeding",
            "abstract": "Abstract Crop plant breeding involves selecting and developing new plant varieties with desirable traits such as increased yield, improved disease resistance, and enhanced nutritional value. With the development of high-throughput technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, crop breeding has entered a new era. However, to effectively use these technologies, integration of multi-omics data from different databases is required. Integration of omics data provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes underlying plant traits and their interactions. This review highlights the importance of integrating omics databases in crop plant breeding, discusses available omics data and databases, describes integration challenges, and highlights recent developments and potential benefits. Taken together, the integration of omics databases is a critical step towards enhancing crop plant breeding and improving global food security.",

            "abstract": "Background: Analyzing the local sequence content in proteins, earlier we found that amino acid residue frequencies differ on various distances between amino acid positions in the sequence, assuming the existence of structural units. Methods: We used informational entropy of protein sequences to find that the structural unit of proteins is a block of adjacent amino acid residues\u2014\u201cinformation unit\u201d. The ANIS (ANalysis of Informational Structure) method uses these information units for revealing hierarchically organized Elements of the Information Structure (ELIS) in amino acid sequences. Results: The developed mathematical apparatus gives stable results on the structural unit description even with a significant variation in the parameters. The optimal length of the information unit is five, and the number of allowed substitutions is one. Examples of the application of the method for the design of protein molecules, intermolecular interactions analysis, and the study of the mechanisms of functioning of protein molecular machines are given. Conclusions: ANIS method makes it possible not only to analyze native proteins but also to design artificial polypeptide chains with a given spatial organization and, possibly, function.",

            "title": "Statistical estimates of multiple transcription factors binding in the model plant genomes based on ChIP-seq data",
            "abstract": "Abstract The development of high-throughput genomic sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation technologies allows studying the binding sites of the protein transcription factors (TF) in the genome scale. The growth of data volume on the experimentally determined binding sites raises qualitatively new problems for the analysis of gene expression regulation, prediction of transcription factors target genes, and regulatory gene networks reconstruction. Genome regulation remains an insufficiently studied though plants have complex molecular regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and response to environmental stresses. It is important to develop new software tools for the analysis of the TF binding sites location and their clustering in the plant genomes, visualization, and the following statistical estimates. This study presents application of the analysis of multiple TF binding profiles in three evolutionarily distant model plant organisms. The construction and analysis of non-random ChIP-seq binding clusters of the different TFs in mammalian embryonic stem cells were discussed earlier using similar bioinformatics approaches. Such clusters of TF binding sites may indicate the gene regulatory regions, enhancers and gene transcription regulatory hubs. It can be used for analysis of the gene promoters as well as a background for transcription networks reconstruction. We discuss the statistical estimates of the TF binding sites clusters in the model plant genomes. The distributions of the number of different TFs per binding cluster follow same power law distribution for all the genomes studied. The binding clusters in Arabidopsis thaliana genome were discussed here in detail.",
