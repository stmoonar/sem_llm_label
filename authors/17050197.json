            "title": "Athena: Towards Decision-Centric Anticipatory Sensor Information Delivery",
            "abstract": "The paper introduces a new direction in quality-of-service-aware networked sensing that designs communication protocols and scheduling policies for data delivery that are optimized specifically for decision needs. The work complements present decision monitoring and support tools and falls in the larger framework of decision-driven resource management. A hallmark of the new protocols is that they are aware of the inference structure used to arrive at decisions (from logical predicates), as well as the data (and data quality) that need to be furnished to successfully evaluate the unknowns on which these decisions are based. Such protocols can therefore anticipate and deliver precisely the right data, at the right level of quality, from the right sources, at the right time, to enable valid and timely decisions at minimum cost to the underlying network. This paper presents the decision model used and the protocol design philosophy, reviews the key recent results and describes a novel system, called Athena, that is the first to embody the aforementioned data delivery paradigm. Evaluation results are presented that compare the performance of decision-centric anticipatory information delivery to several baselines, demonstrating its various advantages in terms of decision timeliness, validity and network resources used. The paper concludes with a discussion of remaining future challenges in this emerging area.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of online social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit), the detection of misleading content on social media has become a critical undertaking. This paper focuses on an important but largely unsolved problem: detecting fauxtography (i.e., social media posts with misleading images). We found that the existing literature falls short in solving this problem. In particular, current solutions either focus on the detection of fake images or misinformed texts of a social media post. However, they cannot solve our problem because the detection of fauxtography depends not only on the truthfulness of the images and the texts but also on the information they deliver together on the posts. In this paper, we develop the FauxBuster, an end-to-end supervised learning scheme that can effectively track down fauxtography by exploring the valuable clues from user\u2019s comments of a post on social media. The FauxBuster is content-free in that it does not rely on the analysis of the actual content of the images, and hence is robust against malicious uploaders who can intentionally modify the presentation and description of the images. We evaluate FauxBuster on real-world data collected from two mainstream social media platforms - Reddit and Twitter. Results show that our scheme is both effective and efficient in addressing the fauxtography problem.",

            "title": "Optimizing Source Selection in Social Sensing in the Presence of Influence Graphs",
            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of choosing the right sources to solicit data from in sensing applications involving broadcast channels, such as those crowdsensing applications where sources share their observations on social media. The goal is to select sources such that expected fusion error is minimized. We assume that soliciting data from a source incurs a cost and that the cost budget is limited. Contrary to other formulations of this problem, we focus on the case where some sources influence others. Hence, asking a source to make a claim affects the behavior of other sources as well, according to an influence model. The paper makes two contributions. First, we develop an analytic model for estimating expected fusion error, given a particular influence graph and solution to the source selection problem. Second, we use that model to search for a solution that minimizes expected fusion error, formulating it as a zero-one integer non-linear programming (INLP) problem. To scale the approach, the paper further proposes a novel reliability-based pruning heuristic (RPH) and a similarity-based lossy estimation (SLE) algorithm that significantly reduce the complexity of the INLP algorithm at the cost of a modest approximation. The analytically computed expected fusion error is validated using both simulations and real-world data from Twitter, demonstrating a good match between analytic predictions and empirical measurements. It is also shown that our method outperforms baselines in terms of resulting fusion error.",

            "abstract": "In this demo, we introduce the tweet-based newsfeed summary service, called iApollo, running on a named data network (NDN) stack. This novel application provides a customized newsfeed service to individual readers based on their interests. Data sampling is essential in iApollo because of the large volume of tweets. Espresso, the automatic naming agent, translates this sampling problem into the simple tree traversal by constructing a hierarchical namespace for the given set of tweets. Two types of tree traversals are introduced: a modified breadth-first-search (BFS) and depth-first-search (DFS) which result in generating headline and complementary news, respectively. This allows readers to quickly achieve the best semantic understanding of the news topic with the minimal number of data retrievals. The newsfeeds are transmitted over NDN because NDN caching can reduce the retrieval delay while releasing burden on the end server. Furthermore, Espresso is well-matched to NDN as it naturally resolves NDN's naming requirement. The application demonstrates not only the tweet-newsfeed service, but also the great synergy between Espresso and NDN. This work can be extended into a general software framework for content summarization.",

            "abstract": "Emerging distributed in-memory computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark, can process a huge amount of cached data within seconds. This remarkably high efficiency requires the system to well balance data across tasks and ensure data locality. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements for applications that operate on a collection of dynamically loaded and evicted datasets. The dynamics may lead to time-varying data volume and distribution, which would frequently invoke expensive data re-partition and transfer operations, resulting in high overhead and large delay. To address this problem, we present Stark, a system specifically designed for optimizing in-memory computing on dynamic dataset collections. Stark enforces data locality for transformations spanning multiple datasets (e.g., join and cogroup) to avoid unnecessary data replications and shuffles. Moreover, to accommodate fluctuating data volume and skeweddata distribution, Stark delivers elasticity into partitions to balance task execution time andreduce job makespan. Finally, Stark achieves bounded failure recovery latency byoptimizing the data checkpointing strategy. Evaluations on a 50-server cluster show that Stark reduces the job makespan by 4X and improves system throughput by 6X compared to Spark.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents unsupervised algorithms to uncover polarization in social networks (namely, Twitter) and identify polarized groups. The approach is language-agnostic and thus broadly applicable to global and multilingual media. In cases of conflict, dispute, or situations involving multiple parties with contrasting interests, opinions get divided into different camps. Previous manual inspection of tweets has shown that such situations produce distinguishable signatures on Twitter, as people take sides leading to clusters that preferentially propagate information confirming their individual cluster-specific bias. We propose a model for polarized social networks, and show that approaches based on factorizing the matrix of sources and their claims can automate the discovery of polarized clusters with no need for prior training or natural language processing. In turn, identifying such clusters offers insights into prevalent social conflicts and helps automate the generation of less biased descriptions of ongoing events. We evaluate our factorization algorithms and their results on multiple Twitter datasets involving polarization of opinions, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Experiments show that our method is almost always correct in identifying the polarized information from real-world twitter traces, and outperforms the baseline mechanisms by a large margin.",

Specifically, we focus on content shared by users on Twitter and Instagram in order to design a system capable of fusing data across multiple networks. Past work has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to detect physical events using various social network platforms. However, many of these signals need corroboration in order to handle events that lack proper support within a single network. We leverage this insight to design an unsupervised approach that can correlate event signals across multiple social networks. Our algorithm can detect events and identify the location of the event occurrence. We evaluate our algorithm using both simulations and real world datasets collected using Twitter and Instagram. The results indicate that our algorithm significantly improves false positive elimination and attains high precision compared to baseline methods on real world datasets.",

            "title": "Espresso: A Data Naming Service for Self-Summarizing Transport",
            "abstract": "Recent work suggested that, in the age of data overload produced by sensors, social media, and IoT devices, a key new type of network transport protocols will be one that offers representative summaries of requested data, retrieved at a consumer-controlled degree of granularity. Given the over-abundance of data, consumers will seldom need all data on a topic, but rather will increasingly favor an appropriate sampling for summarization purposes. The paper explores such sampling as a novel service enabled by information-centric networking paradigms that name data objects, not hosts. By naming data objects, it becomes possible to selectively retrieve them, but the properties of the resulting sampling depend on the naming scheme. This paper describes an automated object naming service, called Espresso, that facilitates content sampling over information- centric networks. We show how Espresso, combined with a trivial retrieval policy, translates the sampling problem into a naming problem, and customizes the naming to different applications' sampling needs. Experimental results show that the computational overhead of automated naming is affordable. The service is first evaluated in simulation, demonstrating a higher sampled-data utility to the consumer, while balancing retrieved data importance and diversity. Social network applications are then introduced, where naming is produced by Espresso. Results demonstrate the advantages of Espresso, compared to baselines, in terms of retrieving meaningful media data summaries.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel paradigm for resource management in distributed systems, called decision-driven execution. The paradigm is appropriate for mission-driven systems, where the goal is to enable faster, leaner, and more effective decision making. All resource consumption, in this paradigm, is tied to the needs of making decisions on alternative courses of action. A point of departure from traditional architectures lies in interfaces that allow applications to specify their underlying decision logic. This specification, in turn, allows the system to reason about most effective means to meet information needs of decisions, resulting in simultaneous optimization of decision accuracy, cost, and speed. The paper discusses the overall vision of decision-driven execution, outlining preliminary work and novel challenges.",

            "abstract": "The paper develops a recursive state estimator for social network data streams that allows exploitation of social networks, such as Twitter, as sensor networks to reliably observe physical events. Recent literature suggested using social networks as sensor networks leveraging the fact that much of the information upload on the former constitutes acts of sensing. A significant challenge identified in that context was that source reliability is often unknown, leading to uncertainty regarding the veracity of reported observations. Multiple truth finding systems were developed to solve this problem, generally geared towards batch analysis of offline datasets. This work complements the present batch approaches by developing an online recursive state estimator that recovers ground truth from streaming data. In this paper, we model physical world state by a set of binary signals (propositions, called assertions, about world state) and the social network as a noisy medium, where distortion, fabrication, omissions, and duplication are introduced. Our recursive state estimator is designed to recover the original binary signal (the true propositions) from the received noisy signal, essentially decoding the unreliable social network output to obtain the best estimate of ground truth in the physical world. Results show that the estimator is both effective and efficient at recovering the original signal with a high degree of accuracy. The estimator gives rise to a novel situation awareness tool that can be used for reliably following unfolding events in real time, using dynamically arriving social network data.",
