            "abstract": "Offline policy evaluation (OPE) aims to accurately estimate the performance of a hypothetical policy using only historical data, which has drawn increasing attention in a wide range of applications including recommender systems and personalized medicine. With the presence of rising granularity of consumer data, many industries started exploring larger action candidate spaces to support more precise personalized action. While inverse propensity score (IPS) is a standard OPE estimator, it suffers from more severe variance issues with increasing action spaces. To address this issue, we theoretically prove that the estimation variance can be reduced by merging actions into groups while the distinction among these action effects on the outcome can induce extra bias. Motivated by these, we propose a novel IPS estimator with outcome-oriented action Grouping (GroupIPS), which leverages a Lipschitz regularized network to measure the distance of action effects in the embedding space and merges nearest action neighbors. This strategy enables more robust estimation by achieving smaller variances while inducing minor additional bias. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Distributed storage systems (DESSs) are widely utilized to regulate voltages in active distribution networks with high penetration of volatile renewable energy. In this paper, the distributed multi-energy storage systems (MESSs) are integrated into the active distribution network to enhance the capability of voltage regulation by exploiting interactions among multi-energy loads. A novel distributed control strategy based on back-and-forth communication (BFC) framework is developed to optimally coordinate multiple MESSs for multi-time-step voltage regulation. To achieve the independent control of MESSs at each bus, the BFC is proposed to determine the global sensitivities of voltage violation in the whole network with respect to the power injection at each bus in only one-step iteration. These sensitivities updated in real time during BFC quantify the capability of the single MESS to mitigate voltage fluctuations across all buses, which can be used to individually inform the operation of each MESS. Distinct from traditional distributed control methods that achieve voltage regulation in a single timeslot, the proposed control strategy regulates MESSs in a multi-time-step manner to alleviate anticipated voltage violation in advance. The simulation based on a modified 11-bus radial distribution network demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed distributed control strategy.",

More multi-energy microgrids are connected to district integrated heating and distribution networks centrally managed by an energy service company (ESCO). Given the fact that microgrid clusters and district integrated heating and distribution networks belonging to different entities, this paper develops a hierarchical autonomous cooperative operation model to minimize total cost and improve calculation efficiency without transparent private information. The original problem is separated into twolevel with a master problem and a series sub-problems. In the upper level, ESCO operates the district integrated heating and distribution network with consideration of pipeline energy storage and heat transmission delay. While local operators (LO) that utilize the thermal inertia of buildings autonomously control energy conversion and flow in the lower level. Based on analytical target cascading (ATC) theory, interface electrical power and thermal energy power are modeled as a pseudo source and pseudo load to decoupling multi sectors. Numerical experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness and superior convergence of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Combined heat, and power dispatch promotes interactions, and synergies between electric power systems, and district heating systems. However, nonlinear, and nonconvex heating flow imposes significant challenges on finding qualified solutions efficiently. Most existing methods rely on constant flow assumptions to derive a linear heating flow model, sacrificing optimality for computational simplicity. This paper proposes a novel convex combined heat, and power dispatch model based on model simplification, and constraint relaxations, which improves solution quality, and avoids assumptions on operating regimes of district heating systems. To alleviate mathematical complexity introduced by the commonly used node method, a simplified thermal dynamic model is proposed to capture temperature changes in networked pipelines. Quadratic, and polyhedral relaxations are then applied to convexify the original problem with quadratic equality, and bilinear constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive solution algorithm is developed to successively reduce the relaxation area based on sequential bound tightening, which improves solution optimality with desirable computational efficiency. The proposed method is verified on a distribution-level, and a transmission-level integrated electricity, and heat systems, compared to constant-flow-based solutions, and iterative algorithms.",

By incorporating district heating networks (DHNs) into CHPD, the thermal storage capability of network pipelines can be exploited to increase the operational flexibility for high penetration of renewable energy. This article proposes a flexibility evaluation method based on a generalized thermal storage model to systematically characterize and quantify the flexibility of DHNs in CHPD. In particular, systematic flexibility metrics are introduced to define the parameters of the proposed thermal storage model, including heat ramping capability, heat input limits, and heat storage capacities. A direct quantification method is proposed to explicitly derive these metrics without extensive simulations required in traditional methods. Besides, four different control modes of district heating systems are identified and modeled according to the controllability of mass flow rates and supply temperature at heat sources. A simplified CHPD model is developed based on sequential linear programming and a lumped heat loss model to enhance the computational efficiency. Comprehensive case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in evaluating the flexibility of DHNs in CHPD. It is demonstrated that the flexibility of DHNs in CHPD can be exploited as far as possible in the control mode with adjustable mass flow and supply temperature.",

Inherent uncertainties ranging from internal parameters to external inputs also impose significant challenges on system operation. A coordinated scheduling method is, therefore, desired for facilitating efficient operation of multi-energy microgrids under multiple uncertainties. In this paper, a deterministic coordinated scheduling model is developed first with detailed modeling of system dynamics and device parameters to fully characterize complex interactions among multi-energy carriers. Then, a hybrid stochastic-interval method is proposed to account for heterogeneous uncertainties in decisions of operational strategies. Specifically, performance and efficiency uncertainties of distributed energy resources, and injection uncertainty of renewable sources and multi-energy demands are characterized by interval-based uncertain operation regions and probability distributions, respectively. A scenario-based two-stage algorithm is developed to solve the problem so that multiple uncertainties are preserved in the entire decision-making process.

In this paper, a combined heat and power dispatch method based on a simplified district heat flow model is proposed to enhance the computational efficiency with desirable accuracy for better operational decisions. Several novel modifications are incorporated to reduce the model size and relieve the model nonlinearity through analyzing operational principles of district heating networks. An iterative solution algorithm is developed accordingly based on sequential linear programming to boost computational efficiency and guarantee fast convergence.

            "abstract": "High penetration of distributed renewable energy introduces significant uncertainties to active distribution networks. Optimal control methods accounting for inherent uncertainties are needed to facilitate economic and reliable operation of active distribution networks. This paper proposes a stochastic receding horizon control method based on modified stochastic model predictive control framework to integrate high penetration of distributed generation. Multiple controllable resources are jointly optimized over a finite prediction horizon while ensuring relevant security restrictions. The simplified Z-bus sensitivity for active distribution networks is developed for computationally efficient estimation of system nonlinearity with high accuracy, and is combined with the sequential linear programming to iteratively derive the linear state space model for compensation of cumulative modeling errors. Furthermore, the voltage limitations are reformulated as chance constraints to indicate the probabilistic reliability index of voltage qualification rate, and achieve tradeoffs between cost reduction and voltage regulation. The affine-disturbance feedback control policy is leveraged here to enforce close-loop control performance and analytically transform intractable chance constraints into second-order cone constraints. Comprehensive case studies based on 33-bus and 123-bus distribution systems are carried out to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of modeling accuracy, control performance, cost reduction, and method scalability. The proposed approach can effectively enforce voltage regulation against uncertainties with the prescribed probability level. Control costs and constraint violation can be reduced compared with deterministic model predictive control and open-loop control strategies.",
