            "title": "LinkGPT: Teaching Large Language Models To Predict Missing Links",
            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results on various language and vision tasks. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying LLMs to graph-based tasks, particularly on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs). However, most studies have focused on node classification, while the use of LLMs for link prediction (LP) remains understudied. In this work, we propose a new task on LLMs, where the objective is to leverage LLMs to predict missing links between nodes in a graph. This task evaluates an LLM's ability to reason over structured data and infer new facts based on learned patterns. This new task poses two key challenges: (1) How to effectively integrate pairwise structural information into the LLMs, which is known to be crucial for LP performance, and (2) how to solve the computational bottleneck when teaching LLMs to perform LP. To address these challenges, we propose LinkGPT, the first end-to-end trained LLM for LP tasks. To effectively enhance the LLM's ability to understand the underlying structure, we design a two-stage instruction tuning approach where the first stage fine-tunes the pairwise encoder, projector, and node projector, and the second stage further fine-tunes the LLMs to predict links. To address the efficiency challenges at inference time, we introduce a retrieval-reranking scheme. Experiments show that LinkGPT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world graphs as well as superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot learning, surpassing existing benchmarks. At inference time, it can achieve $10\\times$ speedup while maintaining high LP accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Associating unstructured data with structured information is crucial for real-world tasks that require relevance search. However, existing graph learning benchmarks often overlook the rich semantic information associate with each node. To bridge such gap, we introduce the Multimodal Graph Benchmark (MM-GRAPH), the first comprehensive multi-modal graph benchmark that incorporates both textual and visual information. MM-GRAPH surpasses previous efforts, which have primarily focused on text-attributed graphs with various connectivity patterns. MM-GRAPH consists of five graph learning datasets of various scales that are appropriate for different learning tasks. Their multimodal node features, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of graph learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. To facilitate research on multimodal graph learning, we further provide an extensive study on the performance of various graph neural networks in the presence of features from various modalities. MM-GRAPH aims to foster research on multimodal graph learning and drive the development of more advanced and robust graph learning algorithms. By providing a diverse set of datasets and benchmarks, MM-GRAPH enables researchers to evaluate and compare their models in realistic settings, ultimately leading to improved performance on real-world applications that rely on multimodal graph data.",

            "title": "SpotTarget: Rethinking the Effect of Target Edges for Link Prediction in Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising outcomes across various tasks, including node classification and link prediction. Despite their remarkable success in various high-impact applications, we have identified three common pitfalls in message passing for link prediction, especially within industrial settings. Particularly, in prevalent GNN frameworks (e.g., DGL and PyTorch-Geometric), the target edges (i.e., the edges being predicted) consistently exist as message passing edges in the graph during training. Consequently, this results in overfitting and distribution shift , both of which adversely impact the generalizability to test the target edges. Additionally, during test time, the failure to exclude the test target edges leads to implicit test leakage caused by neighborhood aggregation. In this paper, we analyze these three pitfalls and investigate the impact of including or excluding target edges on the performance of nodes with varying degrees during training and test phases. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that low-degree nodes are more susceptible to these pitfalls. These pitfalls can have detrimental consequences when GNNs are implemented in production systems. To systematically address these pitfalls, we propose SpotTarget, an effective and efficient GNN training framework. During training, SpotTarget leverages our insight regarding low-degree nodes and excludes train target edges connected to at least one low-degree node. During test time, it emulates real-world scenarios of GNN usage in production and excludes all test target edges. Our experiments conducted on diverse real-world datasets, demonstrate that SpotTarget significantly enhances GNNs, achieving up to a 15 \u00d7 increase in accuracy in sparse graphs. Furthermore, SpotTarget consistently and dramatically improves the performance for low-degree nodes in dense graphs.",
