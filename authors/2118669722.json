            "abstract": "With the advent of big data era, short video social network has gradually become an important battlefield for the outbreak of online public opinion. Therefore, the study for information transmission model is a hot topic for governing online public opinion. Based on improving the shortcomings of traditional SEIR model, we establish the BLSI model. Furthermore, the main affecting factors of information dissemination are selected by the principal component analysis method. Through changing the value of model parameters, the processes of information dissemination are simulated under different conditions. The simulation results are similar to the real network.",

            "abstract": "In order to solve the information transfer of social network media, a new information transfer prediction method is presented by a triangle ring attractor. At first, the description method of social media information is given in this model, and the evaluation indexes such as information recall rate, matching degree, and recall rate are emphatically expounded. At the same time, the characteristics of media information are analyzed with a triangular ring attractor, and an information transfer prediction model is established. Finally, through the simulation experiment, the key factors influencing the method are deeply analyzed. Experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, this method has good adaptability in the degree of information attenuation and information checking rate.",
