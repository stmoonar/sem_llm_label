            "title": "Ponder: Online Prediction of Task Memory Requirements for Scientific Workflows",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are used to analyze large amounts of data. These workflows comprise numerous tasks, many of which are executed repeatedly, running the same custom program on different inputs. Users specify resource allocations for each task, which must be sufficient for all inputs to prevent task failures. As a result, task memory allocations tend to be overly conservative, wasting precious cluster resources, limiting overall parallelism, and increasing workflow makespan.In this paper, we first benchmark a state-of-the-art method on four real-life workflows from the nf-core workflow repository. This analysis reveals that certain assumptions underlying current prediction methods, which typically were evaluated only on simulated workflows, cannot generally be confirmed for real workflows and executions. We then present Ponder, a new online task-sizing strategy that considers and chooses between different methods to cater to different memory demand patterns. We implemented Ponder for Nextflow and made the code publicly available. In an experimental evaluation that also considers the impact of memory predictions on scheduling, Ponder improves Memory Allocation Quality on average by 71.0% and makespan by 21.8% in comparison to a state-of-the-art method. Moreover, Ponder produces 93.8% fewer task failures.",

            "title": "Sizey: Memory-Efficient Execution of Scientific Workflow Tasks",
            "abstract": "As the amount of available data continues to grow in fields as diverse as bioinformatics, physics, and remote sensing, the importance of scientific workflows in the design and implementation of reproducible data analysis pipelines increases. When developing workflows, resource requirements must be defined for each type of task in the workflow. Typically, task types vary widely in their computational demands because they are simply wrappers for arbitrary black-box analysis tools. Furthermore, the resource consumption for the same task type can vary considerably as well due to different inputs. Since underestimating memory resources leads to bottlenecks and task failures, workflow developers tend to overestimate memory resources. However, overprovisioning of memory wastes resources and limits cluster throughput. Addressing this problem, we propose Sizey, a novel online memory prediction method for workflow tasks. During workflow execution, Sizey simultaneously trains multiple machine learning models and then dynamically selects the best model for each workflow task. To evaluate the quality of the model, we introduce a novel resource allocation quality (RAQ) score based on memory prediction accuracy and efficiency. Sizey's prediction models are retrained and re-evaluated online during workflow execution, continuously incorporating metrics from completed tasks. Our evaluation with a prototype implementation of Sizey uses metrics from six real-world scientific workflows from the popular nf-core framework and shows a median reduction in memory waste over time of 24.68% compared to the respective best-performing state-of-the-art baseline.",

            "abstract": "Porting a scientific data analysis workflow (DAW) to a cluster infrastructure, a new software stack, or even only a new dataset with some notably different properties is often challenging. Despite the structured definition of the steps (tasks) and their interdependencies during a complex data analysis in the DAW specification, relevant assumptions may remain unspecified and implicit. Such hidden assumptions often lead to crashing tasks without a reasonable error message, poor performance in general, non-terminating executions, or silent wrong results of the DAW, to name only a few possible consequences. Searching for the causes of such errors and drawbacks in a distributed compute cluster managed by a complex infrastructure stack, where DAWs for large datasets typically are executed, can be tedious and time-consuming. We propose validity constraints (VCs) as a new concept for DAW languages to alleviate this situation. A VC is a constraint specifying some logical conditions that must be fulfilled at certain times for DAW executions to be valid. When defined together with a DAW, VCs help to improve the portability, adaptability, and reusability of DAWs by making implicit assumptions explicit. Once specified, VC can be controlled automatically by the DAW infrastructure, and violations can lead to meaningful error messages and graceful behaviour (e.g., termination or invocation of repair mechanisms). We provide a broad list of possible VCs, classify them along multiple dimensions, and compare them to similar concepts one can find in related fields. We also provide a first sketch for VCs' implementation into existing DAW infrastructures.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "title": "How Workflow Engines Should Talk to Resource Managers: A Proposal for a Common Workflow Scheduling Interface",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflow management systems (SWMSs) and resource managers together ensure that tasks are scheduled on provisioned resources so that all dependencies are obeyed, and some optimization goal, such as makespan minimization, is achieved. In practice, however, there is no clear separation of scheduling responsibilities between an SWMS and a resource manager because there exists no agreed-upon separation of concerns between their different components. This has two consequences. First, the lack of a standardized API to exchange scheduling information between SWMSs and resource managers hinders portability. It incurs costly adaptations when a component should be replaced by a different one (e.g., an SWMS with another SWMS on the same resource manager). Second, due to overlapping functionalities, current installations often actually have two schedulers, both making partial scheduling decisions under incomplete information, leading to suboptimal workflow scheduling. In this paper, we propose a simple REST interface between SWMSs and resource managers, which allows any SWMS to pass dynamic workflow information to a resource manager, enabling maximally informed scheduling decisions. We provide an implementation of this API as an example, using Nextflow as an SWMS and Kubernetes as a resource manager. Our experiments with nine real-world workflows show that this strategy reduces makespan by up to 25.1% and 10.8% on average compared to the standard Nextflow/Kubernetes configuration. Furthermore, a more widespread implementation of this API would enable leaner code bases, a simpler exchange of components of workflow systems, and a unified place to implement new scheduling algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Scientific workflow systems are increasingly popular for expressing and executing complex data analysis pipelines over large datasets, as they offer reproducibility, dependability, and scalability of analyses by automatic parallelization on large compute clusters. However, implementing workflows is difficult due to the involvement of many black-box tools and the deep infrastructure stack necessary for their execution. Simultaneously, user-supporting tools are rare, and the number of available examples is much lower than in classical programming languages. Results To address these challenges, we investigate the efficiency of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to support users when dealing with scientific workflows. We performed 3 user studies in 2 scientific domains to evaluate ChatGPT for comprehending, adapting, and extending workflows. Our results indicate that LLMs efficiently interpret workflows but achieve lower performance for exchanging components or purposeful workflow extensions. We characterize their limitations in these challenging scenarios and suggest future research directions. Conclusions Our results show a high accuracy for comprehending and explaining scientific workflows while achieving a reduced performance for modifying and extending workflow descriptions. These findings clearly illustrate the need for further research in this area.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows typically comprise a multitude of different processing steps which often are executed in parallel on different partitions of the input data. These executions, in turn, must be scheduled on the compute nodes of the computational infrastructure at hand. This assignment is complicated by the facts that (a) tasks typically have highly heterogeneous resource requirements and (b) in many infrastructures, compute nodes offer highly heterogeneous resources. In consequence, predictions of the runtime of a given task on a given node, as required by many scheduling algorithms, are often rather imprecise, which can lead to sub-optimal scheduling decisions.We propose Reshi, a method for recommending task-node assignments during workflow execution that can cope with heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous nodes. Reshi approaches the problem as a regression task, where task-node pairs are modeled as feature vectors over the results of dedicated micro benchmarks and past task executions. Based on these features, Reshi trains a regression tree model to rank and recommend nodes for each ready-to-run task, which can be used as input to a scheduler. For our evaluation, we benchmarked 27 AWS machine types using three representative workflows. We compare Reshi\u2019s recommendations with three state-of-the-art schedulers. Our evaluation shows that Reshi outperforms HEFT by a mean makespan reduction of 7.18% and 18.01% assuming a mean task runtime prediction error of 15%.",

Automatic tracing and investigation of the components\u2019 and tasks\u2019 performance metrics, traces, and behavior are necessary to support the end user with a level of abstraction since the large amount of data cannot be analyzed manually. The execution and monitoring of scientific workflows involves many components, the cluster infrastructure, its resource manager, the workflow, and the workflow tasks. All components in such an execution environment access different monitoring metrics and provide metrics on different abstraction levels. The combination and analysis of observed metrics from different components and their interdependencies are still widely unregarded.We specify four different monitoring layers that can serve as an architectural blueprint for the monitoring responsibilities and the interactions of components in the scientific workflow execution context. We describe the different monitoring metrics subject to the four layers and how the layers interact. Finally, we examine five state-of-the-art scientific workflow management systems (SWMS) in order to assess which steps are needed to enable our four-layer-based approach.",

Microservices offer advantages like scalability and independent service realization, but also pitfall. We noticed inconsistencies between the different existing definitions of the term microservice and practical implementations of microservice based systems. Therefore, we evaluate existing microservice-definitions and analyze the coherence of identified pitfalls to the definitions. Thereby, we observed that many pitfalls are related to imprecise definitions.
