            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability.",

            "title": "Ensemble Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "It is well established that graph neural networks (GNNs) can be interpreted and designed from the perspective of optimization objective. With this clear optimization objective, the deduced GNNs architecture has sound theoretical foundation, which is able to flexibly remedy the weakness of GNNs. However, this optimization objective is only proved for GNNs with single-relational graph. Can we infer a new type of GNNs for multi-relational graphs by extending this optimization objective, so as to simultaneously solve the issues in previous multi-relational GNNs, e.g., over-parameterization? In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble multi-relational GNNs by designing an ensemble multi-relational (EMR) optimization objective. This EMR optimization objective is able to derive an iterative updating rule, which can be formalized as an ensemble message passing (EnMP) layer with multi-relations. We further analyze the nice properties of EnMP layer, e.g., the relationship with multi-relational personalized PageRank. Finally, a new multi-relational GNNs which well alleviate the over-smoothing and over-parameterization issues are proposed. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Relation extraction, one of important natural language processing tasks, aims to find out the semantic relations between entities in text. It has been raised to the document level recently, which is a complex task that requires a logical inference to extract relations from multiple entities in intra-and inter-sentence. Existing methods mainly utilize co-references or syntactic trees to establish static document-level graphs. Different from these heuristic models which may not always yield the optimal structures, we propose a novel model that can automatically construct task-specific graphs. We regard the process of establishing a graph as a sequence problem and utilize a gated recurrent unit (GRU) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to construct a document graph. Afterwards, we utilize the graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to calculate the node representation. Particularly, our model exhibits comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on the large-scale human annotated document-level relation extraction dataset (DocRED).",

            "abstract": "With the development of computer technology and the popularity of the Internet, computer-assisted English teaching has increasingly become an important means of English learning. In the machine learning algorithm, the decision tree can make feasible and effective results for relatively large data sets in a relatively short time, and it is easy to understand and explain. Therefore, this paper attempts to propose a decision tree-based vocabulary difficulty judgment method in order to improve the accuracy and scientificity of English vocabulary difficulty judgment. Based on the above research contents, this paper designs and implements an English-assisted learning system which can meet the needs of different users for learning difficulty and has an exercise mechanism. The system is mainly composed of five core modules: retrieval module, fixed collocation module, keyword query module, new vocabulary module and single exercise module. Finally, the effect of English-assisted learning system is demonstrated and analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Although words are basic semantic units in text, phrases, and expressions contain additional information, which is important for text classification. To capture this information, traditional algorithms extract composite features via word sequences or co-occurrences, such as bigrams and termsets, but ignore the influence of stop words and punctuation, which results in huge amounts of weak features. In this paper, we propose a text structure-based algorithm to extract composite features. Termsets that cross punctuation marks or stop words in the text are excluded. To eliminate redundancy, a novel discriminative measure containing two factors is suggested. One is employed to measure the relevancy, while the other is incorporated to increase the values of composite features, whose class frequencies are much smaller than those of their sub-features. The experiments on three benchmark datasets with both a support vector machine and a naive Bayes classifier illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.",
