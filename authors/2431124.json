            "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation. As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.",

            "title": "Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Personalized Popularity Awareness",
            "abstract": "In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommender systems have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. Nevertheless, traditional Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and BERT4Rec, while effective, encounter challenges due to the unique characteristics of music listening habits. In fact, existing models struggle to create a coherent listening experience due to rapidly evolving preferences. Moreover, music consumption is characterized by a prevalence of repeated listening, i.e., users frequently return to their favourite tracks, an important signal that could be framed as individual or personalized popularity. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach that incorporates personalized popularity information into sequential recommendation. By combining user-item popularity scores with model-generated scores, our method effectively balances the exploration of new music with the satisfaction of user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that a Personalized Most Popular recommender, a method solely based on user-specific popularity, outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, augmenting Transformer-based models with personalized popularity awareness yields superior performance, showing improvements ranging from 25.2% to 69.8%.

            "abstract": "Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RSs) tasks are moving from computing a ranking of final results based on a single metric to multi-objective problems. Solving these problems leads to a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, known as Pareto frontier, in which no objective can be further improved without hurting the others. In principle, all the points on the Pareto frontier are potential candidates to represent the best model selected with respect to the combination of two, or more, metrics. To our knowledge, there are no well-recognized strategies to decide which point should be selected on the frontier in IR and RSs. In this paper, we propose a novel, post-hoc, theoretically-justified technique, named \"Population Distance from Utopia\" (PDU), to identify and select the one-best Pareto-optimal solution. PDU considers fine-grained utopia points, and measures how far each point is from its utopia point, allowing to select solutions tailored to user preferences, a novel feature we call \"calibration\". We compare PDU against state-of-the-art strategies through extensive experiments on tasks from both IR and RS, showing that PDU combined with calibration notably impacts the solution selection.",

            "abstract": "Although beyond-accuracy metrics have gained attention in the last decade, the accuracy of recommendations is still considered the gold standard to evaluate Recommender Systems (RSs). This approach prioritizes the accuracy of recommendations, neglecting the quality of suggestions to enhance user needs, such as diversity and novelty, as well as trustworthiness regulations in RSs for user and provider fairness. As a result, single metrics determine the success of RSs, but this approach fails to consider other criteria simultaneously. A downside of this method is that the most accurate model configuration may not excel in addressing the remaining criteria. This study seeks to broaden RS evaluation by introducing a multi-objective evaluation that considers all model configurations simultaneously under several perspectives. To achieve this, several hyper-parameter configurations of an RS model are trained, and the Pareto-optimal ones are retrieved. The Quality Indicators (QI) of Pareto frontiers, which are gaining interest in Multi-Objective Optimization research, are adapted to RSs. QI enables evaluating the model\u2019s performance by considering various configurations and giving the same importance to each metric. The experiments show that this multi-objective evaluation overturns the ranking of performance among RSs, paving the way to revisit the evaluation approaches of the RecSys research community.

            "abstract": "This paper details the creation of an official graph of Italian law, which is exposed using the Linked Data 5 stars standard and provides a SPARQL endpoint for users to query the data. The graph is constructed using a network analysis of legal documents, with each entity fully dereferenced to provide rich and comprehensive information. The graph also maps official descriptors to facilitate understanding and allows users to navigate the data visually using an intuitive interface. The paper discusses the technical implementation of the graph and the potential benefits for legislators and citizens.",
