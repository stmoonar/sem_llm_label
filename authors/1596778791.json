            "title": "Inductive Link Prediction via Interactive Learning Across Relations in Multiplex Networks",
            "abstract": "Network embedding is an important class of link prediction methods, which can use the distance between learned low-dimensional node representations to characterize the similarity between nodes. Traditional network embedding methods focus on single-layer networks, while in reality, a large part of complex networks are not isolated, but interdependent and interrelated, forming multiplex complex networks. Also, how to effectively exploit layer correlations in multiplex networks to learn more robust and valuable representations, to improve link prediction performance, has been a hot research topic in the field of complex network analysis. However, previous studies mainly focus on inferring intralinks in each layer of complex networks or anchor links among layers. Another issue that has not been discussed is how to predict potential links or reconstruct the network in unobserved relations based on existing multiplex networks. To this issue, we define a novel inductive link prediction problem in multiplex networks, in which most existing multichannel network embedding methods fail to solve. This is either because they only emphasize the specific structure information of an individual layer or only capture the common information for all layers. To effectively address this problem, we propose a novel embedding method termed interactive learning across relations (ILAR), to capture and fully exploit the multiple relations and complex layer correlations in multiplex networks. We leverage two convolutional modules and ILAR to capture the sufficient complementary and correlations in multiplex networks. Moreover, during interactive learning, a disparity constraint is introduced, which enforces the features encoded from two convolutional modules to be different and prevents information redundancy. Finally, the extensive experiments in several real-world datasets show that our model can significantly outperform the existing state-of-the-art network embedding methods on the novel link prediction problem in multiplex networks.",

            "abstract": "Offloading methods play a key role in optimizing computation, minimizing latency, and enhancing the overall performance of the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) system by transfer of tasks between vehicles and edge servers or other computational resources. However, many works neglect topological links generated by the request for privacy, the different preferences for communications and the qualities of transmission, where the topological links greatly influence on the search space of the optimal offloading decisions. In this work, we propose a Graph reinforcement learning (GRL) method to adaptively optimize the sum of the delay of tasks in joint vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), which is called link topology-adaptive Offloading (LTAO) method. The LTAO method is composed of two modules in series: the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) module and the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) module, where the former module extracts features from the current state and the latter module outputs offload decisions for the state. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed LTAO method.",

            "abstract": "Information diffusion prediction plays a crucial role in understanding the propagation of information in social networks, encompassing both macroscopic and microscopic prediction tasks. Macroscopic prediction estimates the overall impact of information diffusion, while microscopic prediction focuses on identifying the next user to be influenced. While prior research often concentrates on one of these aspects, a few tackle both concurrently. These two tasks provide complementary insights into the diffusion process at different levels, revealing common traits and unique attributes. The exploration of leveraging common features across these tasks to enhance information prediction remains an underexplored avenue. In this paper, we propose an intuitive and effective model that addresses both macroscopic and microscopic prediction tasks. Our approach considers the interactions and dynamics among cascades at the macro level and incorporates the social homophily of users in social networks at the micro level. Additionally, we introduce adversarial training and orthogonality constraints to ensure the integrity of shared features. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "MRFS: Mining Rating Fraud Subgraph in Bipartite Graph for Users and Products",
            "abstract": "Fraud in e-commerce fields (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, and so on) and social networks (e.g., Twitter and Weibo) has recently brought a very bad user experience. Rating fraud detection is an urgent issue for improving user experiences. However, existing methods have lots of limitations in some respects, because it is always very hard to acquire sufficient labeled data for fraud detection and detect new fraud patterns. Fortunately, the relationship for users rating (e.g., purchasing and following) products can be represented as a bipartite graph. So the problem of rating fraud detection can be transformed into the problem of abnormal subgraph detection in the bipartite graph. The major challenge of fraud detection is to distinguish fake rates from real user rates. In this article, we focus on mining rating fraud-connected subgraphs in a bipartite graph. The motivation for this work is fraud detection tasks, which can usually be formulated as mining a bipartite graph formed by source nodes (followers and users) and target nodes (followees and products) for malicious patterns. Now, smart fraudsters evade existing detection methods by buying a large pool of users and hijacking honest users, making them look \u201cnormal\u201d-this behavior is called \u201ccamouflage.\u201d Accordingly, we propose a fraud detection approach for mining rating fraud subgraph (MRFS), which addresses the problem from the intrinsic metric (e.g., fraudulence, badness and unreliability). The proposed MRFS mines the intrinsic characteristics of nodes and edges from node behavior information, which is an effective and scalable (linear on the input size) algorithm. A large number of comparative experimental results on real-world rating networks show that our proposed MRFS is efficient and universal.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various processing tasks for processing graphs and complex network data. However, in recent studies, GNNs cannot effectively process the structural topology information and characteristics of the nodes in the graph, or even fail to deal with the information of the nodes. For optimal node embedding aggregation and delivery, this weakness may severely affect the ability of GNNs to classify nodes. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel node Mutual Information-based Graph Convolutional Network (MI-GCN) for semi-supervised node classification. First, we analyze the node information entropy that measures the importance of nodes in the complex network, and further define the node joint information entropy and node mutual information in the graph data. Then, we use node mutual information to strengthen the ability of GNNs to fuse node structural information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MI-GCN not only retains the advantages of the most advanced GNNs, but also improves the ability to fuse node structural information. MI-GCN can achieve superior performance on node classification compared to several baselines on real-world multi-type datasets, including fixed data splits and random data splits.",

            "abstract": "Temporal community detection is helpful to discover and analyze significant groups or clusters hidden in dynamic networks in the real world. A variety of methods, such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model, has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving the accuracy of dynamic community detection.",

However, the constrained battery capacity of IoT devices greatly limits the user experience. Energy harvesting technologies enable green energy to provide continuous energy support for devices in the IoT environment. Together with the maturity of the mobile edge computing technology and the development of parallel computing, it provides a strong guarantee for the normal operation of resource-constrained IoT devices. In this article, we design a parallel offloading strategy based on Lyapunov optimization, which is conducive to efficiently finding the optimal decision for delay-sensitive and compute-intensive tasks. We establish a stochastic optimization problem on a discrete-time slot system and propose a green parallel online offloading algorithm (GPOOA). By decoupling the target problem three times, the joint optimization of green energy, task division factor, CPU frequency, and transmission power is realized. Experimental results demonstrate that under the constraints of strict task deadlines and limited server computing resources, GPOOA performs well in terms of system cost and task drop ratio, far superior to several existing offloading algorithms.",

            "title": "HB-DSBM: Modeling the Dynamic Complex Networks From Community Level to Node Level",
            "abstract": "A variety of methods have been proposed for modeling and mining dynamic complex networks, in which the topological structure varies with time. As the most popular and successful network model, the stochastic block model (SBM) has been extended and applied to community detection, link prediction, anomaly detection, and evolution analysis of dynamic networks. However, all current models based on the SBM for modeling dynamic networks are designed at the community level, assuming that nodes in each community have the same dynamic behavior, which usually results in poor performance on temporal community detection and loses the modeling of node abnormal behavior. To solve the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes a hierarchical Bayesian dynamic SBM (HB-DSBM) for modeling the node-level and community-level dynamic behavior in a dynamic network synchronously. Based on the SBM, we introduce a hierarchical Dirichlet generative mechanism to associate the global community evolution with the microscopic transition behavior of nodes near-perfectly and generate the observed links across the dynamic networks. Meanwhile, an effective variational inference algorithm is developed and we can easy to infer the communities and dynamic behaviors of the nodes. Furthermore, with the two-level evolution behaviors, it can identify nodes or communities with abnormal behavior. Experiments on simulated and real-world networks demonstrate that HB-DSBM has achieved state-of-the-art performance on community detection and evolution. In addition, abnormal evolutionary behavior and events on dynamic networks can be effectively identified by our model.",

            "title": "Modeling Community Evolution Characteristics of Dynamic Networks with Evolutionary Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization",
            "abstract": "In most cases, the block structures and evolution characteristics always coexist in dynamic networks. This leads to inaccurate results of temporal community structure analysis with a two-step strategy. Fortunately, a few approaches take the evolution characteristics into account for modeling temporal community structures. But the number of communities cannot be determined automatically. Therefore, a model, Evolutionary Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (EvoBNMF), is proposed in this paper. It focuses on modeling the temporal community structures with evolution characteristics. More specifically, the evolution behavior, which is introduced into EvoBNMF, can quantify the transfer intensity of communities between adjacent snapshots for modeling the evolution characteristics. Innovatively, the most appropriate number of communities can be determined autonomously by shrinking the corresponding evolution behaviors. Experimental results show that our approach has superior performance on temporal community detection with the virtue of autonomous determination of the number of communities.",
