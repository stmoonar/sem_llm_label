            "title": "AIDE: Antithetical, Intent-based, and Diverse Example-Based Explanations",
            "abstract": "For many use-cases, it is often important to explain the prediction of a black-box model by identifying the most influential training data samples. Existing approaches lack customization for user intent and often provide a homogeneous set of explanation samples, failing to reveal the model's reasoning from different angles. In this paper, we propose AIDE, an approach for providing antithetical (i.e., contrastive), intent-based, diverse explanations for opaque and complex models. AIDE distinguishes three types of explainability intents: interpreting a correct, investigating a wrong, and clarifying an ambiguous prediction. For each intent, AIDE selects an appropriate set of influential training samples that support or oppose the prediction either directly or by contrast. To provide a succinct summary, AIDE uses diversity-aware sampling to avoid redundancy and increase coverage of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AIDE on image and text classification tasks, in three ways: quantitatively, assessing correctness and continuity; qualitatively, comparing anecdotal evidence from AIDE and other example-based approaches; and via a user study, evaluating multiple aspects of AIDE. The results show that AIDE addresses the limitations of existing methods and exhibits desirable traits for an explainability method.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the impact of class outliers on the effectiveness of example-based explainability methods for black-box machine learning models. We reformulate existing explainability evaluation metrics, such as correctness and relevance, specifically for example-based methods, and introduce a new metric, distinguishability. Using these metrics, we highlight the shortcomings of current example-based explainability methods, including those who attempt to suppress class outliers. We conduct experiments on two datasets, a text classification dataset and an image classification dataset, and evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art explainability methods. Our findings underscore the need for robust techniques to tackle the challenges posed by class outliers.",

            "abstract": "Predicting patients hospital length of stay (LOS) is essential for improving resource allocation and supporting decision-making in healthcare organizations. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting LOS by modeling patient information as sequences of events. Specifically, we present a transformer-based model, termed Medic-BERT (M-BERT), for LOS prediction using the unique features describing patients medical event sequences. We performed empirical experiments on a cohort of more than 45k emergency care patients from a large Danish hospital. Experimental results show that M-BERT can achieve high accuracy on a variety of LOS problems and outperforms traditional nonsequence-based machine learning approaches.",

            "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning only utilize local features for the individual DNA sequences (contigs), neglecting additional information such as the assembly graph, in which the contigs are connected according to overlapping reads, and gene markers identified in the contigs. In this paper, we propose the use of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) tailored to leverage auxiliary structural information about contig relations when learning contig representations for subsequent metagenomic binning. Our method, CCVAE, improves on previous work that used VAEs for learning latent representations of the individual contigs, by constraining these representations according to the connectivity information from the assembly graph. Additionally, we incorporate into the model additional information in the form of marker genes to better differentiate contigs from different genomes. Our experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CCVAE outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, thus providing a more effective method for metagenomic binning.",

            "abstract": "A variety of hierarchical domain taxonomies exist in the medical domain for describing medical concepts such as laboratory tests, medications, and procedures. The structural information contained within domain taxonomies contains rich semantic information pertaining to the described concepts and their relationships to each other. As AI models are successfully applied in many medical areas, it is only natural to explore integrating AI models with medical domain taxonomies. However, only a few, nascent attempts have been made. In this work, we investigate how the structure of hierarchical medical taxonomies can be used to improve the performance of a diagnosis prediction task. Specifically, we suggest a method titled TreeEmb to pre-initialize the node embeddings of a patient graph derived from electronic health records using information from the taxonomy. We expect this method to improve the performance of graph convolution network models over the enriched patient graph. We evaluate our method over a patient graph created from the MIMIC-IV electronic health record dataset enriched by initializing node embeddings using hierarchical medical taxonomies. We use type-specific domain knowledge from hierarchical medical taxonomies such as the ICD-9 procedures, ATC medication, and LOINC laboratory test taxonomies. Experimental results from a multi-label diagnosis prediction task over this graph demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",
