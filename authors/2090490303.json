            "title": "Live Demonstration: An Integrated Computing and Communication Platform for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving",
            "abstract": "Perception, computing and communication are usually decoupled in today\u2019s vehicle-road coordination applications, which significantly adds to the system delay and cost. In contrast, we showcase a platform that integrates perception, communication and computing to provide timely roadside bird-eye-view (BEV) maps to vehicles for vision fusion. A neural processing unit and a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) wireless baseband are both implemented on FPGA.",

            "abstract": "Speech recognition has become a widely researched topic for decades, and there were already some successful products which has been put into commercial use, like Siri. However, sometimes it is hard to distinguish the word because words of different accents have different pronunciations. For instance, in Japanese English /r/ is usually pronounced as /l/. Therefore, it is natural to think that speech recognition could be divided into two parts. First attach a label to the audio about the accent, then recognize the contents based on the regular pattern of that accent. In this paper, we researched on several characteristics including voice onset region(VOR), vowels and formants to distinguish British English and American English. By applying both linear neural network and neural network with nonlinear classifications and two hidden layers(NN2HL), the accuracy rate reaches 86.67%, which is very satisfying.",
