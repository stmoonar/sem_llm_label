            "title": "Neurosymbolic Methods for Dynamic Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have recently been used for many tools and applications, making them rich resources in structured format. However, in the real world, KGs grow due to the additions of new knowledge in the form of entities and relations, making these KGs dynamic. This chapter formally defines several types of dynamic KGs and summarizes how these KGs can be represented. Additionally, many neurosymbolic methods have been proposed for learning representations over static KGs for several tasks such as KG completion and entity alignment. This chapter further focuses on neurosymbolic methods for dynamic KGs with or without temporal information. More specifically, it provides an insight into neurosymbolic methods for dynamic (temporal or non-temporal) KG completion and entity alignment tasks. It further discusses the challenges of current approaches and provides some future directions.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Bases (KBs) find applications in many knowledge-intensive tasks and, most notably, in information retrieval. Wikidata is one of the largest public general-purpose KBs. Yet, its collaborative nature has led to a convoluted schema and taxonomy. The YAGO 4 KB cleaned up the taxonomy by incorporating the ontology of Schema.org, resulting in a cleaner structure amenable to automated reasoning. However, it also cut away large parts of the Wikidata taxonomy, which is essential for information retrieval. In this paper, we extend YAGO 4 with a large part of the Wikidata taxonomy - while respecting logical constraints and the distinction between classes and instances. This yields YAGO 4.5, a new, logically consistent version of YAGO that adds a rich layer of informative classes. An intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation show the value of the new resource.",

It comes with a taxonomy that aligns, refines, and unifies existing classifications of fallacies. We further provide a manual annotation of a part of the dataset together with manual explanations for each annotation. We propose a new annotation scheme tailored for subjective NLP tasks, and a new evaluation method designed to handle subjectivity. We then evaluate several language models under a zero-shot learning setting and human performances on MAFALDA to assess their capability to detect and classify fallacies.",

            "abstract": "In our work, we are interested in facilitating the exploration by scholars of the geography of texts: in particular, historical narrative texts describing routes. Semantic annotation constitutes the first step to enrich such text with the necessary information for producing analytical maps. The present article focuses on the disambiguation of spatial named entities (SNE) by the attribution of an identifier of the ever-growing Web of Data. This giant knowledge base (KB) provides qualitative spatial information about geographic entities, in particular spatial relations such as (:Paris :southOf :Lille), (:Paris :country :France). We thus propose a graph-matching algorithm relying on the A* algorithm and graph-edit distances for choosing the best referent in the KB for the SNE. We performed preliminary experiments and noted the clear gain in performance. We propose some examples of maps that are built semi-automatically. Finally, we draw conclusions and describe our plans of future work.",
