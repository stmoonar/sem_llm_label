            "title": "BELLA: Black box model Explanations by Local Linear Approximations",
            "abstract": "In recent years, understanding the decision-making process of black-box models has become not only a legal requirement but also an additional way to assess their performance. However, the state of the art post-hoc interpretation approaches rely on synthetic data generation. This introduces uncertainty and can hurt the reliability of the interpretations. Furthermore, they tend to produce explanations that apply to only very few data points. This makes the explanations brittle and limited in scope. Finally, they provide scores that have no direct verifiable meaning. In this paper, we present BELLA, a deterministic model-agnostic post-hoc approach for explaining the individual predictions of regression black-box models. BELLA provides explanations in the form of a linear model trained in the feature space. Thus, its coefficients can be used directly to compute the predicted value from the feature values. Furthermore, BELLA maximizes the size of the neighborhood to which the linear model applies, so that the explanations are accurate, simple, general, and robust. BELLA can produce both factual and counterfactual explanations. Our user study confirms the importance of the desiderata we optimize, and our experiments show that BELLA outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on these desiderata.",

            "title": "Confident Interpretations of Black Box Classifiers",
            "abstract": "Deep Learning models provide state of the art classification results, but are not human-interpretable. We propose a novel method to interpret the classification results of a black box model a posteriori. We emulate the complex classifier by surrogate decision trees. Each tree mimics the behavior of the complex classifier by overestimating one of the classes. This yields a global, interpretable approximation of the black box classifier. Our method provides interpretations that are at the same time general (applying to many data points), confident (generalizing well to other data points), faithful to the original model (making the same predictions), and simple (easy to understand). Our experiments show that our method beats competing methods in these desiderata, and our user study shows that users prefer this type of interpretations over others.",

Following the intent of Kaggle, which serves as a platform for organizing machine learning competitions adapted for batch learning, we propose SCALAR as a novel platform explicitly designed for stream learning in real-time.

It has been developed in Python, using state of the art open-source solutions: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, gRPC, Protobuf, and Docker.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present the competition \u201cReal-time Machine Learning Competition on Data Streams a BigData Cup Challenge of the IEEE Big Data 2019 conference. Data streams, such as data originated from sensors, have increasingly gained the interest of researchers and companies and are currently widely studied in data science. Companies in the telecommunication and energy industries are trying to exploit these data and get real-time insights on their services and equipment. In order to extract valuable knowledge from data streams, one must be able to analyze the data as they arrive and make meaningful predictions. For this purpose, we use fast incremental learners. There already exists a great community that is organizing various competitions on machine learning tasks for batch learners. Our goal was to introduce the same approach to engage the whole community in solving essential problems in data stream mining. We performed a new kind of data science competition based on a real-time prediction setting, using a novel competition platform on data streams. The examples to predict were released in real-time, and the predictions had also to be submitted in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first data science competition conducted in real-time. The task of the competition was to predict network activity, and the data has been provided by one of our partner companies.",
