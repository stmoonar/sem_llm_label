            "abstract": "ABSTRACT An e-TextBook can serve as an interactive learning environment (ILE), facilitating more effective teaching and learning processes. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of an EPUB 3-based Hybrid e-TextBook, which allows for interaction between the digital and the physical world. In that regard, we first investigated the gap between the expectations of teachers with respect to e-TextBook functionalities, on the one hand, and the ILE functionalities offered by e-TextBooks, on the other hand. Next, together with teachers, we co-designed and developed prototype EPUB 3-based Hybrid e-TextBooks that make it possible to connect their learning content to smart devices in classrooms, leveraging both digital publishing and Semantic Web tools. Based on experimentation with our prototype Hybrid e-TextBooks, we can argue that a semantically enriched EPUB 3-based Hybrid e-TextBook is able to act as a comprehensive ILE, providing the tools needed by teachers in smart classrooms. Furthermore, expert observations and Smiley o\u2019meter results demonstrate an effective impact on student cognition and motivation.",

            "abstract": "In the recent years, Linked Data and Language Technology solutions gained popularity. Nevertheless, their coupling in real-world business is limited due to several issues. Existing products and services are developed for a particular domain, can be used only in combination with already integrated datasets or their language coverage is limited. In this paper, we present an innovative solution FREME - an open framework of e-Services for multilingual and semantic enrichment of digital content. The framework integrates six interoperable e-Services. We describe the core features of each e-Service and illustrate their usage in the context of four business cases: i) authoring and publishing; ii) translation and localisation; iii) cross-lingual access to data; and iv) personalised Web content recommendations. Business cases drive the design and development of the framework.",

            "title": "TinCan2PROV: Exposing Interoperable Provenance of Learning Processes through Experience API Logs",
            "abstract": "A popular way to log learning processes is by using the Experience API (abbreviated as xAPI), also referred to as Tin Can. While Tin Can is great for developers who need to log learning experiences in their applications, it is more challenging for data processors to interconnect and analyze the resulting data. An interoperable data model is missing to raise Tin Can to its full potential. We argue that in essence, these learning process logs are provenance. Therefore, the W3C PROV model can provide the much-needed interoperability. In this paper, we introduce a method to expose PROV using Tin Can statements. To achieve this, we made the following contributions: (1) a formal ontology of the xAPI vocabulary, (2) a context document to interpret xAPI statements as JSON-LD, (3) a mapping to convert xAPI JSON-LD statements into PROV, and (4) a tool implementing this mapping. We preliminarily evaluate the approach by converting 20 xAPI statements taken from the public Tin Can Learning Record Store to valid PROV. Where the conversion succeeded, it did so without loss of valid information, therefore suggesting that the conversion process is reversible, as long as the original JSON is valid.",

            "title": "SERIF: A Semantic ExeRcise Interchange Format",
            "abstract": "More and more users obtain new knowledge using e-learning systems, and often assess their understanding of this new knowledge using corresponding assessment items. However, the distribution of content items and assessment items in a learning object is tightly bound. To publish assessment items, independently of the corresponding content items, it is required to wrap these assessment items into separate learning objects, which introduces a large overhead. Moreover, current learning objects are closely coupled with their execution environment. A stand-alone and lightweight format to describe assessment items is needed. This way their publication is facilitated and their discoverability can be increased. This paper proposes some important features for such a format and introduces SERIF: a Semantic ExeRcise Interchange Format, whose underlying data model is based on the QTI data model, and that can be distributed into di erent RDF serializations. SERIF was applied successfully in three proof-of-concept applications, where we assessed how SERIF is decoupled from the execution environment and extendable to other content and interaction types. In future work, we will exploit its de ned semantics for automatic discovery and combination of assessment items.",

            "title": "Towards Making EPUB 3-Based e-TextBooks a First-Class Mobile Learning Environment",
            "abstract": "Students master courses by interacting with a multitude of learning objects. These interactions may include reading documents, watching explanatory videos, taking notes, completing assignments, and experimenting with physical objects. During these interactions, students often have to switch between different learning environments, including Web browsers, video players, textbooks, and workbooks. By integrating these different environments into a unified learning environment, we can save students' time. Moreover, thanks to an increasing adoption of tablets in schools and universities, we also have the opportunity to deploy this unified learning environment on a single mobile device, thus enabling anytime and anywhere learning. We refer to such a learning environment as a 'first-class' mobile learning environment. In this paper, we empirically investigate to what extent an EPUB 3-based e-TextBook can be used to facilitate a 'first-class' mobile learning environment. To that end, we created an EPUB 3-based prototype e-TextBook that has been enhanced in terms of both its presentation and representation, meeting requirements that are typically ascribed by the literature to mobile learning environments. Specifically, we integrated three interactive widgets into our e-TextBook that are able to (1) exchange information with each other (inter-widget communication) and (2) that are able to semi-automatically create new content (that is, that are able to act as semi-automatic content providers): a report maker widget, a sine formula widget, and a corresponding interactive graph maker widget. In addition, we integrated different types of learning objects into our e-TextBook, including multimedia objects, objects with augmented reality features (i.e., digital objects that allow for interaction with physical objects), and objects that offer contextualized content. Both the widgets and the learning objects can be used within a unified learning environment. Furthermore, we semantically annotated the learning content in order to improve its discoverability. We find that our e-TextBook complies with the requirements found in the literature. Moreover, our e-TextBook makes it possible to provide visual feedback on student actions, thus having positive effects on the learning process. In addition, our e-TextBook mitigates distraction by providing a unified mobile learning environment. Furthermore, the use of EPUB 3 allows for interoperable packaging of semantically annotated learning content. Finally, the use of EPUB 3 paves the way for mobile usage of learning content, and thus for anytime and anywhere learning.",
