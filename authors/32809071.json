            "abstract": "Scientific computing communities often run their experiments using complex data- and compute-intensive workflows that utilize high performance computing (HPC), distributed clusters and specialized architectures targeting machine learning and artificial intelligence. FAIR principles for data and software can be useful enablers for the reproducibility of performance (a key HPC metric) and that of scientific results (a crucial tenet of the scientific method) that are based in part on re-use, the R of FAIR principles. FAIR principles are under-used by HPC and data-intensive communities who have been slow to adopt them. This is due in part to the complexity of workflow life cycles, the numerous workflow management systems, the lack of integration of FAIR within existing technologies, and the specificity of managed systems that include rapidly evolving architectures and software stacks, and execution models that require resource managers and batch schedulers. Numerous challenges emerge for scientists attempting to publish FAIR datasets and software for the purpose of re-use and reproducibility, e.g. what data to publish and where due to sizes, how to \"FAIRify\" data subsetting, at what level of granularity to attribute persistent identifiers to software, what is the minimal amount of metadata needed to guarantee a certain level of reproducibility, what does reproducible AI actually mean? This talk will focus on such challenges and illustrate the negative impact of not applying FAIR on the reproducibility of experiments. We will introduce the notion of FAIR Digital Objects and present RECUP, a framework for data and metadata services for high performance workflows that proposes micro-solutions for adapting FAIR principles to HPC.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

To describe figures, authors add captions, which are often incomplete, and more descriptions reside in body text. This work presents a method to extract figure descriptive text from the body of scientific articles. We adopted ontological semantics to aid concept recognition of figure-related information, which generates human- and machine-readable knowledge representations from sentences. Our results show that conceptual models bring an improvement in figure descriptive sentence classification over word-based approaches.",

            "abstract": "The integrity of science and engineering research is grounded in assumptions of rigor and transparency on the part of those engaging in such research. HPC community effort to strengthen rigor and transparency take the form of reproducibility efforts. In a recent survey of the SC conference community, we collected information about the SC reproducibility initiative activities. We present the survey results in this article. Results show that the reproducibility initiative activities have contributed to higher levels of awareness on the part of SC conference technical program participants, and hint at contributing to greater scientific impact for the published papers of the SC conference series. Stringent point-of-manuscript-submission verification is problematic for reasons we point out, as are inherent difficulties of computational reproducibility in HPC. Future efforts should better decouple the community educational goals from goals that specifically strengthen a research work\u2019s potential for long-term impact through reuse 5\u201310 years down the road.",

Doing so, we address cross-cutting needs related to the goal of making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable [1]) for seamless use with Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Earth System Science at DOE. A novel idea is that AI/ML itself can help with the FAIR data goal and address issues in targeted areas e.g. missing data, data quality and reduction. In addition, the interpretability of results obtained with new AI methods is poised to impact broader scientific challenges in hydrology..",

            "abstract": "A growing disparity between supercomputer computation speeds and I/O rates means that it is rapidly becoming infeasible to analyze supercomputer application output only after that output has been written to a file system. Instead, data-generating applications must run concurrently with data reduction and/or analysis operations, with which they exchange information via high-speed methods such as interprocess communications. The resulting parallel computing motif, online data analysis and reduction (ODAR), has important implications for both application and HPC systems design. Here we introduce the ODAR motif and its co-design concerns, describe a co-design process for identifying and addressing those concerns, present tools that assist in the co-design process, and present case studies to illustrate the use of the process and tools in practical settings.",

A fundamental finding of this workshop is that the methodologies used to manage data among a variety of tasks in situ can be used to facilitate scientific discovery from many different data sources\u2014simulation, experiment, and sensors, for example\u2014and that being able to do so at numerous computing scales will benefit real-time decision-making, design optimization, and data-driven scientific discovery. This article describes six PRDs identified by the workshop, which highlight the components and capabilities needed for ISDM to be successful for a wide variety of applications\u2014making ISDM capabilities more pervasive, controllable, composable, and transparent, with a focus on greater coordination with the software stack and a diversity of fundamentally new data algorithms.",

            "abstract": "We present a supercomputer-driven pipeline for in silico drug discovery using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) and ensemble docking. Ensemble docking makes use of MD results by docking compound databases into representative protein binding-site conformations, thus taking into account the dynamic properties of the binding sites. We also describe preliminary results obtained for 24 systems involving eight proteins of the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The MD involves temperature replica exchange enhanced sampling, making use of massively parallel supercomputing to quickly sample the configurational space of protein drug targets. Using the Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, more than 1 ms of enhanced sampling MD can be generated per day. We have ensemble docked repurposing databases to 10 configurations of each of the 24 SARS-CoV-2 systems using AutoDock Vina. Comparison to experiment demonstrates remarkably high hit rates for the top scoring tranches of compounds identified by our ensemble approach. We also demonstrate that, using Autodock-GPU on Summit, it is possible to perform exhaustive docking of one billion compounds in under 24 h. Finally, we discuss preliminary results and planned improvements to the pipeline, including the use of quantum mechanical (QM), machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to cluster MD trajectories and rescore docking poses.",
