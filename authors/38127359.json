            "title": "RDF Surfaces: Enabling Classical Negation on the Semantic Web",
            "abstract": "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a fundamental technology in the Semantic Web, enabling the representation and interchange of structured data. However, RDF lacks the capability to express negated statements in a generic way. As a result, exchanging negative information on a Web scale is thus far restricted to specific cases and predefined statements. The ability to negate (virtually) any RDF statement allows for a comprehensive way to refute, deny or otherwise invalidate claims on a Web scale. Via an intermediate step of a diagrammatic approach to logical expressions called Peirce graphs, we introduce RDF Surfaces, an extension of RDF that incorporates the concept of classic negation, known from first-order logic. Overall, RDF Surfaces provides an abstract, visual approach to negation within the Semantic Web, offering a more general and widely applicable approach than previous attempts at incorporating negation. Aside from a (traditional) programmatic syntax, RDF Surfaces can also be represented visually by means of diagrams inspired by Peirce graphs. We demonstrate negation via RDF Surfaces and how to reason upon it in illustrative use cases drawn from the domains of academic publishing and eHealth. We hope this vision paper attracts new implementers and opens the discussion to its formal specification.",

            "abstract": "Notation3 Logic (\\nthree) is an extension of RDF that allows the user to write rules introducing new blank nodes to RDF graphs. Many applications (e.g., ontology mapping) rely on this feature as blank nodes -- used directly or in auxiliary constructs -- are omnipresent on the Web. However, the number of fast \\nthree reasoners covering this very important feature of the logic is rather limited. On the other hand, there are engines like VLog or Nemo which do not directly support Semantic Web rule formats but which are developed and optimized for very similar constructs: existential rules. In this paper, we investigate the relation between \\nthree rules with blank nodes in their heads and existential rules. We identify a subset of \\nthree which can be mapped directly to existential rules and define such a mapping preserving the equivalence of \\nthree formulae. In order to also illustrate that in some cases \\nthree reasoning could benefit from our translation, we then employ this mapping in an implementation to compare the performance of the \\nthree reasoners EYE and cwm to VLog and Nemo on \\nthree rules and their mapped counterparts. Our tests show that the existential rule reasoners perform particularly well for use cases containing many facts while especially the EYE reasoner is very fast when dealing with a high number of dependent rules. We thus provide a tool enabling the Semantic Web community to directly use existing and future existential rule reasoners and benefit from the findings of this active community.",

We identify the requirements for automating administrative workflows and present an architecture and its implemented components. By using Linked Data principles to decentrally describe independent steps using states as pre- and postconditions, and composing workflows on-the-fly whilst matching a user's state to those preconditions, we automatically generate next steps to reach the user's goal.

            "title": "RDF graph validation using rule-based reasoning",
            "abstract": "The correct functioning of Semantic Web applications requires that given RDF graphs adhere to an expected shape. This shape depends on the RDF graph and the application\u2019s supported entailments of that graph. During validation, RDF graphs are assessed against sets of constraints, and found violations help refining the RDF graphs. However, existing validation approaches cannot always explain the root causes of violations (inhibiting refinement), and cannot fully match the entailments supported during validation with those supported by the application. These approaches cannot accurately validate RDF graphs, or combine multiple systems, deteriorating the validator\u2019s performance. In this paper, we present an alternative validation approach using rule-based reasoning, capable of fully customizing the used inferencing steps. We compare to existing approaches, and present a formal ground and practical implementation \u201cValidatrr\u201d, based on N3Logic and the EYE reasoner. Our approach \u2013\u00a0supporting an equivalent number of constraint types compared to the state of the art\u00a0\u2013 better explains the root cause of the violations due to the reasoner\u2019s generated logical proof, and returns an accurate number of violations due to the customizable inferencing rule set. Performance evaluation shows that Validatrr is performant for smaller datasets, and scales linearly w.r.t. the RDF graph size. The detailed root cause explanations can guide future validation report description specifications, and the fine-grained level of configuration can be employed to support different constraint languages. This foundation allows further research into handling recursion, validating RDF graphs based on their generation description, and providing automatic refinement suggestions.",

            "abstract": "In healthcare, the aging of the population is resulting in a gradual shift from residential care to home care, requiring reliable follow-up of elderly people by a whole network of care providers. The environment of these patients is increasingly being equipped with different monitoring devices, which allow to obtain insight into the current condition of patient & environment. However, current monitoring platforms that support care providers are centralized and not personalized, reducing performance, scalability, autonomy and privacy. Because the available data is only exposed through custom APIs, profile knowledge cannot be efficiently exchanged, which is required to provide optimal care. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed data-driven platform, built on Semantic Web technologies, that enables the integration of all profile knowledge in order to deliver personalized continuous home care. It provides a distributed smart monitoring service, which allows to locally monitor only the relevant sensors according to the patient\u2019s profile, and infer personalized decisions when analyzing events. Moreover, it provides a medical treatment planning service, which composes treatment plans tailored to each patient, including personalized quality of service parameters allowing a doctor to select the optimal plan. To illustrate how the platform delivers these services, the paper also presents a demonstrator using a realistic home care scenario.",

This led to the introduction of RDF datasets, with each RDF dataset comprising a default graph and zero or more named graphs. However, due to differences in RDF implementations, no consensus could be reached on a standard semantics; and a range of different dataset semantics are currently assumed. For an RDF system not be limited to only a subset of online RDF datasets, the system would need to be extended to support different dataset semantics\u2014exactly the problem that eluded consensus before. In this paper, we transpose this problem to Notation3 Logic, an RDF-based rule language that similarly allows citing graphs within RDF documents. We propose a solution where an N3 author can directly indicate the intended semantics of a cited graph\u2014 possibly, combining multiple semantics within a single document. We supply an initial set of companion N3 rules, which implement a number of RDF dataset semantics, which allow an N3-compliant system to easily support multiple different semantics.",

            "abstract": ", Abstract In the Internet of Things, it is a challenging task to integrate & analyze high velocity sensor data with domain knowledge & context information in real-time. Semantic IoT platforms typically consist of stream processing components that use Semantic Web technologies to run a set of \ufb01xed queries processing the IoT data streams. Con\ufb01gur-ing these queries is still a manual task. To deal with changes in context information, which happen regularly in IoT domains, queries typically require reasoning on all sensor data in real-time to derive relevant sensors & events. This can be an issue in real-time, as expressive reasoning is required to deal with the complexity of many IoT domains. To solve these issues, this paper presents DIVIDE. DIVIDE automatically derives queries for stream processing components in an adaptive, context-aware way. When the context changes, it derives through reasoning which sensors & observations to \ufb01lter, given the context & a use case goal, without requiring any more reasoning in real-time. This paper presents the details of DIVIDE, and performs evaluations on a healthcare example showing how it can reduce real-time processing times, scale better when there are more sensors & observations, and can run e\ufb03ciently on low-end devices.",

            "title": "SENSdesc: Connect Sensor Queries and Context",
            "abstract": "Modern developments confront us with an ever increasing amount of streaming data: different sensors in environments like hospitals or factories communicate their measurements to other applications. Having this data at disposal faces us with a new challenge: the data needs to be integrated to existing frameworks. As the availability of sensors can rapidly change, these need to be flexible enough to easily incorporate new systems without having to be explicitly configured. Semantic Web applications offer a solution for that enabling computers to \u2018understand\u2019 data. But for them the pure amount of data and different possible queries which can be performed on it can form an obstacle. This paper tackles this problem: we present a formalism to describe stream queries in the ontology context in which they might become relevant. These descriptions enable us to automatically decide based on the actual setting and the problem to be solved which and how sensors should be monitored further. This helps us to limit the streaming data taken into account for reasoning tasks and make stream reasoning more performant. We illustrate our approach on a health-care use case where different sensors are used to measure data on patients and their surrounding in a hospital.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a distance-based approach for measuring the semantic dissimilarity between two concepts in a knowledge graph. The proposed Normalized Semantic Web Distance (NSWD) extends the idea of the Normalized Web Distance, which is utilized to determine the dissimilarity between two textural terms, and utilizes additional semantic properties of nodes in a knowledge graph. We evaluate our proposal on the knowledge graph Freebase, where the NSWD achieves a correlation of up to 0.58 with human similarity assessments on the established Miller-Charles benchmark of 30 term-pairs. These preliminary results indicate that the proposed NSWD is a promising approach for assessing semantic dissimilarity in very large knowledge graphs.",
