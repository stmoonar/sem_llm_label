            "title": "CleanEr: Interactive, Query-Guided Error Mitigation for Data Cleaning Systems",
            "abstract": "A key challenge in data cleaning is estimating which of the tuples in a given database are correct and which are not. However, the output of such systems typically includes both false positives and false negatives, i.e., incorrect tuples labeled as correct and vice versa. When queries are performed over the output of such cleaning systems, cleaning errors may have an intricate impact on the query results. We introduce CleanEr, a generic framework that is used on top of existing data cleaning systems and that assists users in identifying the impact of potential cleaning errors on query results, and in deciding accordingly whether and how to proceed with the cleaning. We introduce novel indicators reflecting the current uncertainty with respect to the tuples in the query result, as well as the effect of each relevant input tuple on this uncertainty. We design and implement efficient algorithms for computing these indicators in CleanEr. Based on these indicators, CleanEr helps the data analysts decide whether to trust the query output and guides them in further cleaning of relevant parts of the data through an interactive process. We propose to demonstrate CleanEr using NELL, a large database extracted from the Web.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in AI techniques, as well as enabling hardware and infrastructure, have led to the integration of AI across wide-ranging domains and tasks. In particular, AI has been used to handle various types of data (including numerical, textual and image data) and has been adopted in large-scale distributed systems. From a data management perspective, this calls for the harnessing of state-of-the-art AI solutions for data management tasks and systems. aiDM is a full-day workshop that offers a stage for innovative interdisciplinary research that studies the interaction between AI and data management and develops new AI technologies for data-related tasks. This year, aiDM'24 particularly focuses on the transparent exploitation of AI techniques (e.g., using Generative AI frameworks) for data management for enterprise class workloads.",
