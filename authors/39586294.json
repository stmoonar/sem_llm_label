            "abstract": "The governance technology of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provides an effective solution for solving existing organizational management issues. Governance mechanisms of DAOs are usually encoded in smart contracts in the form of rule sets and executed automatically. However, the mechanism\u2019s logical flaws and code errors expose DAOs to unpredictable risks. Complex adaptive dynamics computer-aided design (CadCAD) can test the effectiveness of the mechanisms through simulation. Nonetheless, as DAOs are typical complex systems with social and engineering complexity, managing, controlling, and supervising their operation through traditional methods are difficult. The parallel intelligence theory based on artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method provides an effective research framework and practical method for solving DAOs\u2019 governance issues. Therefore, in this article, we propose a parallel mechanism verification method and execution system, namely, complex adaptive systems for computer-aided dynamic design (casCAD2) as an extension of cadCAD. Leveraging parallel intelligence and cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSS), casCAD2 is capable of probing into the laws that govern system evolution within a simulated environment. It serves as a robust tool for verifying the efficacy of DAOs\u2019 mechanisms and predicting their potential risks. We also build a parallel market-based anchoring mechanism (MAM) system to demonstrate how it can be used for DAOs\u2019 mechanism verification. This study can provide a new research method and application system for DAOs\u2019 effective governance.",

            "title": "More Than Enough is Too Much: Adaptive Defenses Against Gradient Leakage in Production Federated Learning",
            "abstract": "With increasing concerns on privacy leakage from gradients, various attack mechanisms emerged to recover private data from gradients, which challenged the primary advantage of privacy protection in federated learning. However, we cast doubt upon the real impact of these gradient leakage attacks on production federated learning systems. By taking away several impractical assumptions that the literature has made, we find that these attacks pose a limited degree of threat to the privacy of raw data. In this paper, through a comprehensive evaluation of existing gradient leakage attacks in a federated learning system with practical assumptions, we have systematically analyzed their effectiveness under a wide range of configurations. We first present key priors required to make the attack possible or stronger, such as a narrow distribution of initial model weights, as well as inversion at early stages of training. We then propose a new lightweight defense mechanism that provides sufficient and self-adaptive protection against time-varying levels of the privacy leakage risk throughout the federated learning process. Our proposed defense, called OUTPOST, selectively adds Gaussian noise to gradients at each update iteration according to the Fisher information matrix, where the level of noise is determined by the privacy leakage risk quantified by the spread of model weights at each layer. To limit the computation overhead and training performance degradation, OUTPOST only performs perturbation with iteration-based decay. Our experimental results demonstrate that OUTPOST can achieve a much better tradeoff than the state-of-the-art with respect to convergence performance, computational overhead, and protection against gradient leakage attacks.",

            "abstract": "Accurate baseline load estimation is critical for the compensation settlement of incentive-based demand response (DR). Baseline load estimation is different from load forecasting in evaluation metric and time scale. In terms of evaluation metric, Precision (i.e., the closeness between the estimated and the actual value) and Accuracy (i.e., lack of bias) are two aspects for assessing the performance of an estimation. Load forecasting usually focuses more on Precision and ignores Accuracy, while these two aspects are both important for baseline load estimation. In terms of time scale, load forecasting must be conducted in advance while baseline load estimation is an ex-post problem. However, baseline load estimation is usually formulated as a load forecasting problem in most existing studies, which can be further improved using the load data before and after the DR event. This paper proposes a Precision and Accuracy co-optimization based baseline load estimation framework to improve its performance. The proposed framework uses the load data not only before but also after the DR event day as the input features. An optimal weighted ensemble method is proposed to combine these input features, in which both Precision and Accuracy are considered into the objective function. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework have been verified on a real smart meter dataset.",

            "abstract": "Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) based non-volatile computing-in-memory (nvCIM) has been regarded as a promising solution to enable efficient data-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) applications on resource-limited edge systems. However, existing weighted-current summation-based nvCIM suffers from device non-idealities and significant time, storage, and energy overheads when processing high-precision analog signals. To address these issues, we propose a 3T2R digital nvCIM macro for a fully hardware-implemented binary convolutional neural network (HBCNN), focusing on accelerating edge AI applications at low weight precision. By quantizing the voltage-division results of RRAMs through inverters, the 3T2R macro provides a stable rail-to-rail output without analog-to-digital converters or sensing amplifiers. Moreover, both batch normalization and sign activation are integrated on-chip. The hybrid simulation results show that the proposed 3T2R digital macro achieves an 86.2% (95.6%) accuracy on the CIFAR-10 (MNIST) dataset, corresponding to a 4.7% (1.9%) accuracy loss compared to the software baselines, which also feature a peak energy efficiency of 51.3 TOPS/W and a minimum latency of 8 ns, realizing an energy-efficient, low-latency, and robust AI processor.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning enables multiple clients to learn a general model without sharing local data, and the federated learning system also improves information security and advances responsible artificial intelligence (AI). However, the data of different clients in the system are non-independently and identically distributed (IID), which results in weight divergence, especially for complex graph data extraction. This article proposes a novel feature-contrastive graph federated (FcgFed) learning approach to improve the robustness of the federated learning system in graph data. First, we design an architecture for FcgFed learning systems to analyze graph information. Furthermore, we present a graph federated learning method based on contrastive learning to alleviate the weight divergence in federated learning. The experiments in node classification and graph classification demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than model-contrastive federated learning (MOON) and federated average (FedAvg). We also test the adaptability of our method in image classification, and the results demonstrate that weight similarity evaluation works for other frameworks and tasks.",

In particular, the UAV communicates with multiple GUs using active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which can actively amplify and thus significantly enhance the strengths of reflected signals. We develop an energy minimization scheme based on the multi-objective hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL), by decomposing the formulated optimization problem into two-layered subproblems. By solving the upper-level subproblem, we derive the optimal UAV trajectory and GUs scheduling strategies to minimize the UAV's energy consumption. By solving the lower-level subproblem, we obtain the IRS's phase shifts and amplification factors and GUs' transmit/receive beamforming to minimize the GUs' energy consumption. Finally, we validate and evaluate the proposed schemes through simulations, which show that the UAV's and GUs' energy consumption can be significantly reduced by using the active IRS, when the thermal noise powers at the IRS are much smaller than those at the UAV and GUs.",

            "abstract": "The wide applications of artificial intelligence (AI) on massive Internet of Things or smartphones raises significant concerns about privacy, heterogeneity, and resource efficiency. Correspondingly, federated learning (FL) emerges as an effective way to enable AI over massively distributed nodes without uploading the raw data. Conventional works mostly focus on learning a single unified model for one solitary task. Multitask learning (MTL) outperforms single-task learning by training multiple models concurrently, leading to reduced model sizes and increased flexibility. However, existing FL efforts often face challenges in efficiently managing MTL scenarios, particularly with the presence of stragglers, without incurring prohibitive computation and communication costs.In this article, inspired by the natural cloud-base station (BS)-terminal hierarchy of cellular networks, we provide a viable resource-aware hierarchical federated MTL (RHFedMTL) solution to meet the task heterogeneity corresponding to different nonindependent and identically distributed (IID) training data sets. Specifically, a primal-dual method has been leveraged to effectively transform the coupled MTL into some local optimization subproblems within BSs. Therefore, it enables solving different tasks within a BS and aggregating the multitask result in the cloud without uploading the raw data. Furthermore, compared with existing methods that reduce resource costs by simply changing the aggregation frequency, we dive into the intricate relationship between resource consumption and learning accuracy, and develop a resource-aware learning strategy for adjusting the iteration number on local terminals and BSs to meet the resource budget. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RHFedMTL in terms of improving the learning accuracy and boosting the convergence rate.",

            "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has become a classic paradigm to solve diverse, intelligent control tasks like autonomous driving in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the widely assumed existence of a central node to implement centralized federated learning-assisted MARL might be impractical in highly dynamic scenarios, and the excessive communication overheads possibly overwhelm the IoV system. Therefore, in this paper, we design a communication efficient cooperative MARL algorithm, named RSM-MAPPO, to reduce the communication overheads in a fully distributed architecture. In particular, RSM-MAPPO enhances the multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by incorporating the idea of segment mixture and augmenting multiple model replicas from received neighboring policy segments. Afterwards, RSM-MAPPO adopts a theory-guided metric to regulate the selection of contributive replicas to guarantee the policy improvement. Finally, extensive simulations in a mixed-autonomy traffic control scenario verify the effectiveness of the RSM-MAPPO algorithm.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose KGenre, a knowledge-embedded music representation learning framework for improved genre classification. We construct the knowledge graph from the metadata in the open-source FMA-medium and OpenMIC-2018 datasets, with no extra information/effort required. KGenre then mines the correlation between different genres from the knowledge graph and embeds such correlation in audio representation. To our knowledge, KGenre is the first method fusing the audio with high-level knowledge for music genre classification. Experimental results demonstrate the embedded knowledge can effectively enhance the audio feature representation, and the genre classification performance surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.",
