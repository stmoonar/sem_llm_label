In response to the challenges posed by Big Data, we propose the Ontology-Based Data Federation (OBDF) framework, which merges OBDA with Data Federation. This merging allows for the integration of numerous, distributed, and heterogeneous data sources in a virtual, uniform, and semantically coherent fashion.",

            "title": "Mining Frequent Structures in Conceptual Models",
            "abstract": "The problem of using structured methods to represent knowledge is well-known in conceptual modeling and has been studied for many years. It has been proven that adopting modeling patterns represents an effective structural method. Patterns are, indeed, generalizable recurrent structures that can be exploited as solutions to design problems. They aid in understanding and improving the process of creating models. The undeniable value of using patterns in conceptual modeling was demonstrated in several experimental studies. However, discovering patterns in conceptual models is widely recognized as a highly complex task and a systematic solution to pattern identification is currently lacking. In this paper, we propose a general approach to the problem of discovering frequent structures, as they occur in conceptual modeling languages. As proof of concept for our scientific contribution, we provide an implementation of the approach, by focusing on UML class diagrams, in particular OntoUML models. This implementation comprises an exploratory tool, which, through the combination of a frequent subgraph mining algorithm and graph manipulation techniques, can process multiple conceptual models and discover recurrent structures according to multiple criteria. The primary objective is to offer a support facility for language engineers. This can be employed to leverage both good and bad modeling practices, to evolve and maintain the conceptual modeling language, and to promote the reuse of encoded experience in designing better models with the given language.",

            "abstract": "We study verification of reachability properties over Communicating Datalog Programs (CDPs), which are networks of relational nodes connected through unordered channels and running Datalog-like computations. Each node manipulates a local state database (DB), depending on incoming messages and additional input DBs from external services. Decidability of verification for CDPs has so far been established only under boundedness assumptions on the state and channel sizes, showing at the same time undecidability of reachability for unbounded states with only two unary relations or unbounded channels with a single binary relation. The goal of this paper is to study the open case of CDPs with bounded states and unbounded channels, under the assumption that channels carry unary relations only. We discuss the significance of the resulting model and prove the decidability of verification of variants of reachability, captured in fragments of first-order CTL. We do so through a novel reduction to coverability problems in a class of high-level Petri Nets that manipulate unordered data identifiers. We study the tightness of our results, showing that minor generalizations of the considered reachability properties yield undecidability of verification, both for CDPs and the corresponding Petri Net model.",

            "title": "Integrating 3D City Data through Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "CityGML is a widely adopted standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for representing and exchanging 3D city models. The representation of semantic and topological properties in CityGML makes it possible to query such 3D city data to perform analysis in various applications, e.g., security management and emergency response, energy consumption and estimation, and occupancy measurement. However, the potential of querying CityGML data has not been fully exploited. The official GML/XML encoding of CityGML is only intended as an exchange format but is not suitable for query answering. The most common way of dealing with CityGML data is to store them in the 3DCityDB system as relational tables and then query them with the standard SQL query language. Nevertheless, for end users, it remains a challenging task to formulate queries over 3DCityDB directly for their ad-hoc analytical tasks, because there is a gap between the conceptual semantics of CityGML and the relational schema adopted in 3DCityDB. In fact, the semantics of CityGML itself can be modeled as a suitable ontology. The technology of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where an ontology is at the core, is a good solution to bridge such a gap. Moreover, embracing KGs makes it easier to integrate with other spatial data sources, e.g., OpenStreetMap and existing (Geo)KGs (e.g., Wikidata, DBPedia, and GeoNames), and to perform queries combining information from multiple data sources. In this work, we describe a CityGML KG framework to populate the concepts in the CityGML ontology using declarative mappings to 3DCityDB, thus exposing the CityGML data therein as a KG. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we use CityGML data from the city of Munich as test data and integrate OpenStreeMap data in the same area.",

This approach requires a combination of model-theoretic notions and algorithmic techniques based on backward reachability. We introduce here Ontology-Based Processes, which are a variant of one of the most investigated models in this spectrum, namely simple artifact systems (SASs), where, instead of managing a database, we operate over a description logic (DL) ontology. We prove that when the DL is expressed in (a slight extension of) RDFS, it enjoys suitable model-theoretic properties, and that by relying on such DL we can define Ontology-Based Processes to which backward reachability can still be applied. Relying on these results we are able to show that in this novel setting, verification of safety properties is decidable in PSPACE.",

Information preservation, along with other \u201cfundamental\u201d or \u201cdesirable\u201d properties proposed in the Semantic Web literature, has never been put into correspondence with over 40 years of extended literature coming from the traditional database perspective.

We formally introduce here the notion of ontology-based data federation (OBDF) to denote a framework that combines OBDA with a data federation layer where multiple, possibly heterogeneous sources are virtually exposed as a single relational database. We discuss opportunities and challenges of OBDF, and provide techniques to deliver efficient query answering in an OBDF setting. Such techniques are validated through an extensive experimental evaluation based on the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark.",

Virtual Knowledge Graphs (VKGs), a variant of KGs originating from the field of Ontology-based Data Access (OBDA), are a promising paradigm for integrating and accessing legacy data sources. The main idea of VKGs is that the KG remains virtual: the end-user interacts with a KG, but queries are reformulated on-the-fly as queries over the data source(s). To enable the paradigm, one needs to define declarative mappings specifying the link between the data sources and the elements in the VKG. In this work, we try to investigate common patterns that arise when specifying such mappings, building on well-established methodologies from the area of conceptual modeling and database design.",

            "abstract": "Data federation addresses the problem of uniformly accessing multiple, possibly heterogeneous data sources, by mapping them into a unified schema, such as an RDF(S)/OWL ontology or a relational schema, and by supporting the execution of queries, like SPARQL or SQL queries, over that unified schema. Data explosion in volume and variety has made data federation increasingly popular in many application domains. Hence, many data federation systems have been developed in industry and academia, and it has become challenging for users to select suitable systems to achieve their objectives. In order to systematically analyze and compare these systems, we propose an evaluation framework comprising four dimensions: (i) federation capabilities, i.e., query language, data source, and federation techniques; (ii) data security, i.e., authentication, authorization, auditing, encryption, and data masking; (iii) interface, i.e., graphical interface, command line interface, and application programming interface; and (iv) development, i.e., main development language, deployment, commercial support, open source, and release. Using this framework, we thoroughly studied 51 data federation systems from the Semantic Web and Database communities. This paper shares the results of our investigation and aims to provide reference material and insights for users, developers and researchers selecting or further developing data federation systems.",

The VKG approach uses an ontology to model the domain of interest and to hide the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources. Reusable UIs can be built by relying on queries that are issued to the VKG system and that use the high level vocabulary from the ontology layer. This use of VKGs allows for decoupling the data from the UIs, and brings great reusability in designing the latter. To illustrate our approach, we introduce significant use cases with various types of UIs, including programming, graphic, natural language, and voice interfaces.",

In the context of veri\ufb01cation of data-aware processes, a formal approach based on satis\ufb01ability modulo theories (SMT) has been considered to verify parameterised safety properties of so-called artifact-centric systems . This approach requires a combination of model-theoretic notions and algorithmic techniques based on backward reachability . We introduce here a variant of one of the most investigated models in this spectrum, namely simple artifact systems ( SASs ), where, instead of managing a database, we operate over a description logic (DL) ontology expressed in (a slight extension of) RDFS. This DL, enjoying suitable model-theoretic properties, allows us to de\ufb01ne DL-based SASs to which backward reachability can still be applied, leading to decidability in PSpace of the corresponding safety problems.",

We argue that, with the growth of process mining in breadth (variety of covered tasks) and depth (sophistication of the considered process models), event logs need to be augmented by commonsense knowledge to provide a better input for process mining algorithms. This is crucial to infer key facts that are not explicitly recorded in the logs, but are necessary in a variety of tasks, such as understanding the event data, assessing their compliance and quality, identifying outliers and clusters, computing statistics, and discovering decisions, ultimately empowering process mining as a whole.",

            "abstract": "A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",
