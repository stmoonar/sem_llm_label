            "title": "Navigating Industry 5.0: A Survey of Key Enabling Technologies, Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities",
            "abstract": "This century has been a major avenue for revolutionary changes in technology and industry. Industries have transitioned towards intelligent automation, relying less on human intervention, resulting in the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. That is why IoT has been the researcher\u2019s arena for quite some time. With Industry 4.0 still in motion, the world is on the verge of the $5^{\\textit {th}}$ industrial revolution, a relatively new concept with many unclear opinions regarding its potential benefits, challenges, opportunities, trends, and impact on society. There is a dire need for a broader and more critical perspective. This research paints a bigger picture of \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat to expect?\u201d during the transition phase of Industry 5.0. In this comprehensive review, we have addressed the state-of-the-art practices in Industry 4.0 and the transitional phase of Industry 5.0. We have highlighted the most promising key enabling technologies, trends, research topics, rising challenges, and unfolding opportunities that can help prepare society for this paradigm shift. The paper then surveys the work toward the outstanding key enablers, challenges, trends, and opportunities in the IoT evolution for Industry 5.0. To spur further avenues for researchers and industrialists, the paper offers conclusive insights at the end. In addition, the article has a precise set of research questions answered in consequent sections and subsections for the reader\u2019s clarity.",

            "title": "MESON: A Mobility-Aware Dependent Task Offloading Scheme for Urban Vehicular Edge Computing",
            "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is the transportation version of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in road scenarios. One key technology of VEC is task offloading, which allows vehicles to send their computation tasks to the surrounding Roadside Units (RSUs) or other vehicles for execution, thereby reducing computation delay and energy consumption. However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because vehicles with time-varying trajectories need to process massive data with high complexity and diversity. In this paper, a VEC-based computation offloading model is developed with consideration of data dependency of tasks. The minimization of the average response time and average energy consumption of the system is defined as a combinatorial optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobility-aware dependent task offloading (MESON) Scheme for urban VEC and develop a DRL-based algorithm to train the offloading strategy. To improve the training efficiency, a vehicle mobility detection algorithm is further designed to detect the communication time between vehicles and RSUs. In this way, MESON can avoid unreasonable decisions by lowering the size of the action space. Moreover, to improve the system stability and the offloading successful rate, we design a task priority determination scheme to prioritize the tasks in the waiting queue. The experimental results show that MESON is superior compared to other task offloading schemes in terms of the average response time, average system energy consumption, and offloading successful rate.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been advancing and gaining tremendous interests from both academia and industry. With the development of wireless technologies, a huge amount of data generated at the network edge provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop GANs applications. However, due to the constraints such as bandwidth, privacy, and legal issues, it is inappropriate to collect and send all data to the cloud or servers for analysis, training, and mining. Thus, deploying and training GANs at the edge becomes a promising alternative solution. The instability of GANs introduced by non-independent and identical data (Non-IID) poses significant challenges to training GANs. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel federated learning framework for GANs, namely, Collaborated gAme Parallel Learning (CAP). CAP supports parallel training of data and models for GANs, breaking the isolated training among generators that exists in the previous distributed algorithms, and achieving collaborative learning among cloud, edge servers, and devices. Then, to further enhance the ability of CAP-GAN for addressing Non-IID issues, we propose a Mix-Generator module (Mix-G) which divides a generator into the sharing layer and personalizing layer. The Mix-G module extracts the generic and personalization features and improves the performance of CAP-GAN on extremely personalizing datasets. Experimental results and analysis substantiate the usefulness and superiority of our proposed CAP-GAN scheme which can achieve better results in the Non-IID scenarios compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is inappropriate to use conventional unicast routing due to the broadcast storm problem and spatial diversity of communication links. Opportunistic Routing (OR) benefits the low duty-cycled WSNs by prioritizing the multiple candidates for each node instead of selecting one node as in conventional unicast routing. OR reduces the sender waiting time, but it also suffers from the duplicate packets problem due to multiple candidates waking up simultaneously. The number of candidates should be restricted to counterbalance between the sender waiting time and duplicate packets. In this paper, software-defined networking (SDN) is adapted for the flexible management of WSNs by allowing the decoupling of the control plane from the sensor nodes. This study presents an SDN based load balanced opportunistic routing for duty-cycled WSNs that addresses two parts. First, the candidates are computed and controlled in the control plane. Second, the metric used to prioritize the candidates considers the average of three probability distributions, namely transmission distance distribution, expected number of hops distribution and residual energy distribution so that more traffic is guided through the nodes with higher priority. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol can significantly improve the network lifetime, routing efficiency, energy consumption, sender waiting time and duplicate packets as compared with the benchmarks.",

RPL organizes its network in the form of a tree-like structure where a node is configured as the root of the tree while others integrate themselves into that structure based on their relative distance. A value called the Rank is used to define each node's relative position and it is used by other nodes to take their routing decisions. A malicious node can illegitimately claim a closer position to the root by advertising a lower rank value trapping other nodes to forward their traffic through that malicious node. In this study, we show how this behavior can have a detrimental side effect on the network via extensive simulations and propose a new secure objective function to prevent such an attack.",

            "abstract": "Time-Slotted Medium Access Control protocols bring advantages to the scalability of LoRa networks as an alternative to the ALOHA access method. However, such Time-Slotted protocols require nodes synchronization and schedules dissemination under stringent duty cycles likely resulting in improper performance and limited scalability. One possible solution is to adopt decentralized approaches where nodes autonomously determine their schedules and other transmission parameters. Thus, this paper proposes a novel Time-Slotted MAC protocol, named Autonomous Adaptive Frame Size (AAFS-LoRa) protocol, that allows nodes to individually determine their transmission parameters without extensive downlink transmissions from the gateway. The proposed protocol can conFigure nodes by maintaining information, such as their location and the gateway location. The main contribution of the proposed protocol is the adoption of adaptive frame sizes that are large enough to accommodate nodes with common transmission parameters to mitigate collisions among them. The proposed protocol has been investigated under different operating conditions, and the experiments demonstrates that our protocol can effectively improve the network performance, in terms of latency as well as the capacity.",

            "title": "A Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading Approach for Vehicular Edge Computing",
            "abstract": "Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that exposes Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to road scenarios. In VEC, task offloading can enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs) that deploy computing capabilities. However, the highly dynamic network topology, strict low-delay constraints, and massive data of tasks of VEC pose significant challenges for implementing efficient offloading. Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGNITE has significant advantages in terms of total system computational cost, total computational delay, and offloading success rate compared with its counterparts.",

            "abstract": "With the rise of computing-intensive applications like online gaming and telemedicine on user equipment (UE) and the evolution of 5G technology, there is a surge in demand for greater computing resources and power. Yet, UEs have limited resources and batteries. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has emerged as a method to enhance UEs computing capabilities and conserve energy by transferring tasks to the cloud. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) further aids by reducing delays, although it faces issues like limited resources and unpredictable network conditions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a remedy by serving as mobile stations for MEC, but optimal offloading decisions in UAV-assisted MEC remain intricate. Addressing this, I propose using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Q-Learning, Deep Q Network (DQN), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to enhance decision-making for offloading. Our focus is on energy efficiency and reduced service delay, and our simulations prove our method's efficacy in UAV-assisted MEC environments.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle trajectory prediction is a promising technology for improving the performance of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) applications by providing future road states. Various vehicle trajectory prediction methods have been proposed to increase the accuracy of the predicted trajectory. Although the existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods can accurately predict the future trajectory under the assumption that data comply with the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID), their performance is seriously degraded in practical implementation due to the ubiquitous distribution shifts in vehicle trajectory data. To improve the universality of the vehicle trajectory prediction method, generalizing the method to an environment that never appeared in the training data, namely, the Domain Generalization (DG) task, should be considered. Thus, we propose a plug-and-play inFORmaTive caUsality-based vehicle trajectory predictioN architecturE (FORTUNE) to improve the DG capability of vehicle trajectory prediction methods. First, a novel structural causal model (SCM) of vehicle trajectory prediction is established to simulate the causality of the data-generating process. Second, we utilize the principle of mutual information to learn the invariant representation of the SCM. Third, an invariant knowledge-transferring module is proposed to increase learning ability without destroying the structure of the original model. The results from simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the DG capability of vehicle trajectory prediction methods.",
