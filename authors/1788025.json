            "title": "The Secondary Use of Electronic Health Records for Data Mining: Data Characteristics and Challenges",
            "abstract": "The primary objective of implementing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is to improve the management of patients\u2019 health-related information. However, these records have also been extensively used for the secondary purpose of clinical research and to improve healthcare practice. EHRs provide a rich set of information that includes demographics, medical history, medications, laboratory test results, and diagnosis. Data mining and analytics techniques have extensively exploited EHR information to study patient cohorts for various clinical and research applications, such as phenotype extraction, precision medicine, intervention evaluation, disease prediction, detection, and progression. But the presence of diverse data types and associated characteristics poses many challenges to the use of EHR data. In this article, we provide an overview of information found in EHR systems and their characteristics that could be utilized for secondary applications. We first discuss the different types of data stored in EHRs, followed by the data transformations necessary for data analysis and mining. Later, we discuss the data quality issues and characteristics of the EHRs along with the relevant methods used to address them. Moreover, this survey also highlights the usage of various data types for different applications. Hence, this article can serve as a primer for researchers to understand the use of EHRs for data mining and analytics purposes.",

The task focuses on the problem of matching eligible clinical trials to topics constituting a summary of a patient's admission notes. We explore different ways of representing trials and topics using NLP techniques, and then use a common retrieval model to generate the ranked list of relevant trials for each topic. The results from all our submitted runs are well above the median scores for all topics, but there is still plenty of scope for improvement.",

            "title": "Crowdsourcing Backstories for Complex Task-Based Search",
            "abstract": "Backstories provide vital contextual information for information retrieval evaluation. They are useful as textual representations of information needs, for example to aid in relevance judgements as part of test collections for performance evaluation, for studying longer search queries, and for interactive retrieval. While backstories exist for some popular search tasks and domains thanks to evaluation campaigns such as TREC, NTCIR, and CLEF, they are not available for a large range of other tasks and domains. In this paper, we explore crowdsourcing as an approach for obtaining high-quality backstories, with the aim of supporting the development of backstories as key resources for new domains and search tasks. Compared to typical crowdsourcing tasks in the IR domain, such as gathering relevance judgements or short textual search queries, obtaining backstories is more complex. Workers are required to think of information need scenarios and put these thoughts into comparatively lengthy text fragments. This possibly entails a higher cognitive load and longer working time. We describe a crowdsourcing methodology to maximise the usefulness of results, using the creation of backstories for the job search domain as an example. We also present and release a collection of 756 job search backstories, which was obtained via the proposed methodology.",

            "title": "Component-based Analysis of Dynamic Search Performance",
            "abstract": "In many search scenarios, such as exploratory, comparative, or survey-oriented search, users interact with dynamic search systems to satisfy multi-aspect information needs. These systems utilize different dynamic approaches that exploit various user feedback granularity types. Although studies have provided insights about the role of many components of these systems, they used black-box and isolated experimental setups. Therefore, the effects of these components or their interactions are still not well understood. We address this by following a methodology based on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). We built a Grid Of Points that consists of systems based on different ways to instantiate three components: initial rankers, dynamic rerankers, and user feedback granularity. Using evaluation scores based on the TREC Dynamic Domain collections, we built several ANOVA models to estimate the effects. We found that (i) although all components significantly affect search effectiveness, the initial ranker has the largest effective size, (ii) the effect sizes of these components vary based on the length of the search session and the used effectiveness metric, and (iii) initial rankers and dynamic rerankers have more prominent effects than user feedback granularity. To improve effectiveness, we recommend improving the quality of initial rankers and dynamic rerankers. This does not require eliciting detailed user feedback, which might be expensive or invasive.",

The ChEMU evaluation lab focuses on information extraction over chemical reactions from patent texts. As the second instance of our ChEMU lab series, we build upon the ChEMU corpus developed for ChEMU 2020, extending it for two distinct tasks related to reference resolution in chemical patents. Task 1 \u2014 Chemical Reaction Reference Resolution \u2014 focuses on paragraph-level references and aims to identify the chemical reactions or general conditions specified in one reaction description referred to by another. Task 2 \u2014 Anaphora Resolution \u2014 focuses on expression-level references and aims to identify the reference relationships between expressions in chemical reaction descriptions. Herein, we describe the resources created for these tasks and the evaluation methodology adopted. We also provide a brief sum-mary of the results obtained in this lab, finding that one submission achieves substantially better results than our baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Chemical patents represent a valuable source of information about new chemical compounds, which is critical to the drug discovery process. Automated information extraction over chemical patents is, however, a challenging task due to the large volume of existing patents and the complex linguistic properties of chemical patents. The Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), was introduced to support the development of advanced text mining techniques for chemical patents. The ChEMU 2020 lab proposed two fundamental information extraction tasks focusing on chemical reaction processes described in chemical patents: (1) chemical named entity recognition, requiring identification of essential chemical entities and their roles in chemical reactions, as well as reaction conditions; and (2) event extraction, which aims at identification of event steps relating the entities involved in chemical reactions. The ChEMU 2020 lab received 37 team registrations and 46 runs. Overall, the performance of submissions for these tasks exceeded our expectations, with the top systems outperforming strong baselines. We further show the methods to be robust to variations in sampling of the test data. We provide a detailed overview of the ChEMU 2020 corpus and its annotation, showing that inter-annotator agreement is very strong. We also present the methods adopted by participants, provide a detailed analysis of their performance, and carefully consider the potential impact of data leakage on interpretation of the results. The ChEMU 2020 Lab has shown the viability of automated methods to support information extraction of key information in chemical patents.",

            "abstract": "Studies of interaction log analysis are a common tool to investigate behavioural data and contribute to insights into users\u2019 interaction patterns with a system [11, 18]. We present a log analysis from a bespoke conversational system, RealSAM1, an audio-only interaction media assistant in which users can navigate and interact with media content through natural language. The novel assistant is designed for people with a vision impairment or other disability that prevents a person from accessing printed material. The exploratory analysis was conducted to provide an initial insight into the communication and interaction behaviours. We focus on understanding how users utilise the application. The results are twofold, we highlight the (i) implications for the design of future voice-enabled systems such as \u201cinfinite-reading\u201d mode, enhanced interaction management enabling file navigation or time-compression techniques, and (ii) challenges of analysing conversational logs and suggest guidelines making these logs more accessible for future research.",

A 5-day program of the seminar consisted of six introductory and background sessions, three visionary talk sessions, one industry talk session, and seven working groups and reporting sessions. The seminar also had three social events during the program. This report provides the executive summary, overview of invited talks, and findings from the seven working groups which cover the definition, evaluation, modelling, explanation, scenarios, applications, and prototype of Conversational Search. The ideas and findings presented in this report should serve as one of the main sources for diverse research programs on Conversational Search.",

            "title": "An Extended Overview of the CLEF 2020 ChEMU Lab: Information Extraction of Chemical Reactions from Patents",
            "abstract": ". The discovery of new chemical compounds is perceived as a key driver of the chemistry industry and many other economic sectors. The information about the new discoveries are usually disclosed in sci-enti\ufb01c literature and in particular, in chemical patents, since patents are often the \ufb01rst venues where the new chemical compounds are publicized. Despite the signi\ufb01cance of the information provided in chemical patents, extracting the information from patents is costly due to the large volume of existing patents and its drastic expansion rate. The Cheminformat-ics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), provides a platform to advance the state-of-the-arts in automatic information extraction systems over chemical patents. In particular, we focus on extracting synthesis process of new chemical compounds from chemical patents. Using the ChEMU corpus of 1500 \u201csnippets\u201d (text segments) sampled from 170 patent documents and annotated by chemical experts, we de\ufb01ned two key information extraction tasks. Task 1 targets at chemical named entity recognition, i.e., the identi\ufb01cation of chemical compounds and their speci\ufb01c roles in chemical reactions. Task 2 targets at event extraction, i.e., the identi\ufb01cation of reaction steps, relating the chemical compounds involved in a chemical reaction. In this paper, we provide an overview of our ChEMU2020 lab. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks, the evaluation methodology adopted, and participants results. We also provide a brief summary of the meth-ods employed by participants of this lab and the results obtained across 46 runs from 11 teams, \ufb01nding that several submissions achieve substantially better results than the baseline methods prepared by the organizers.",
