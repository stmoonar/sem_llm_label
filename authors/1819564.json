            "title": "Cross-Lingual Link Discovery for Under-Resourced Languages",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an overview of current technologies for cross-lingual link discovery, and we discuss challenges, experiences and prospects of their application to under-resourced languages. We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

In particular it focused on four core tasks in the production/publication of linked data: generation, interlinking, publication, and validation. We discuss the importance of GLs and BPs for LLD before describing the survey and its results in full. Finally we offer a number of directions for future work in order to address the findings of the survey.",

            "abstract": "Since the inception of the Open Linguistics Working Group in 2010, there have been numerous efforts in transforming language resources into Linked Data. The research field of Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) has gained in importance, visibility and impact, with the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud gathering nowadays over 200 resources. With this increasing growth, new challenges have emerged concerning particular domain and task applications, quality dimensions, and linguistic features to take into account. This special issue aims to review and summarize the progress and status of LLD research in recent years, as well as to offer an understanding of the challenges ahead of the field for the years to come. The papers in this issue indicate that there are still aspects to address for a wider community adoption of LLD, as well as a lack of resources for specific tasks and (interdisciplinary) domains. Likewise, the integration of LLD resources into Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and the search for long-term infrastructure solutions to host LLD resources continue to be essential points to which to attend in the foreseeable future of the research line.",

This paper addresses one of the largest and most complex data curation work\ufb02ows in existence: Wikipedia and Wikidata, with a high number of users and curators adding factual information from exter-nal sources via a non-systematic Wiki work\ufb02ow to Wikipedia\u2019s infoboxes and Wikidata items. We present high-level analyses of the current state, the challenges and limitations in this work\ufb02ow and supplement it with a quantitative and semantic analysis of the resulting data spaces by deploying DBpedia\u2019s integration and extraction capabilities. Based on an analysis of millions of references from Wikipedia infoboxes in di\ufb00erent languages, we can \ufb01nd the most important sources which can be used to enrich other knowledge bases with information of better quality. An initial tool is presented, the GlobalFactSync browser, as a prototype to discuss further measures to develop a more systematic approach for data curation in the WikiVerse.",

In this paper we measure what contribution a structural analysis of the query and the datasets can bring to a recommendation strategy, to go alongside approaches that provide a semantic analysis. Here we concentrate on the case of star-shaped SPARQL queries over RDF datasets. The illustrated strategy performs a least general generalization on the given query, computes the specializations of it that are satisfiable by the target dataset, and organizes them into a graph. It then visits the graph to recommend first the reformulated queries that reflect the original query as closely as possible. This approach does not rely upon a semantic mapping between the two datasets. An implementation as part of the SQUIRE query recommendation library is discussed. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Information systems \u2192 Semantic web description languages",

These efforts have been primarily focused on harvesting, refinement and publishing semi-structured information found in Wikipedia articles, such as information from infoboxes, categorization information, images, wikilinks and citations. Nevertheless, still vast amount of valuable information is contained in the unstructured Wikipedia article texts. In this paper, we present DBpedia NIF - a large-scale and multilingual knowledge extraction corpus. The aim of the dataset is two-fold: to dramatically broaden and deepen the amount of structured information in DBpedia, and to provide large-scale and multilingual language resource for development of various NLP and IR task. The dataset provides the content of all articles for 128 Wikipedia languages. We describe the dataset creation process and the NLP Interchange Format (NIF) used to model the content, links and the structure the information of the Wikipedia articles. The dataset has been further enriched with about 25% more links and selected partitions published as Linked Data. Finally, we describe the maintenance and sustainability plans, and selected use cases of the dataset from the TextExt knowledge extraction challenge.",

            "abstract": "The ever increasing importance of machine learning in Natural Language Processing is accompanied by an equally increasing need in large-scale training and evaluation corpora. Due to its size, its openness and relative quality, the Wikipedia has already been a source of such data, but on a limited scale. This paper introduces the DBpedia Abstract Corpus, a large-scale, open corpus of annotated Wikipedia texts in six languages, featuring over 11 million texts and over 97 million entity links. The properties of the Wikipedia texts are being described, as well as the corpus creation process, its format and interesting use-cases, like Named Entity Linking training and evaluation.",
