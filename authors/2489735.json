            "title": "Information Entropy-based Camera Focus Point and Zoom Level Adjustment for Smart In-Situ Visualization",
            "abstract": "With the recent developments in computational science and HPC technology, large-scale numerical simulations have become common in various scientific and technological fields. The output volume data from these simulations have also become larger and more complex, creating a problem for the time-consuming input/output to/from the HPC storage system. To solve this problem, in-situ visualization has been used. However, the output data for posterior analysis is usually a large set of image data obtained from the visualization, and there is a lack of interactivity compared to the conventional analysis, which loads the volume data from the storage, after the simulation, and executes interactive visual exploration. To compensate for these problems, in-situ visualization often places multiple viewpoints in the simulation space and generates images from all of them. However, this may result in a huge number of images, and as a result, this can require time and effort to locate important visualization images that can provide clues to obtain knowledge during the analysis. To solve this problem, this study estimates the regions where important changes occur in the simulation, based on information entropy calculated from the visualization images, and generates a sequence of animated images focusing on these regions. In-situ visualization has widely been recognized as an effective approach for analyzing large-scale simulation outputs from modern HPC systems by reducing the inherent I/O bottleneck problem. However, batch-based in-situ visualization, such as the image- and video-based approaches, can produce large amounts of rendering results for the subsequent offline visual analysis. Therefore, this can make it difficult to gain rapid insight into the simulation results during post-hoc visual analysis. To minimize this problem, we have worked on a smart visualization approach focusing on extracting a set of images that may facilitate the rapid understanding of the underlying simulated phenomena as an alternative to accelerate the process of obtaining scientific knowledge. In this work, we present a method for automatically adjusting the camera focus point and zoom level during in-situ visualization in an attempt to obtain the most suitable rendering images for facilitating visual analysis. We integrated the proposed method with the existing in-situ smooth camera path estimation framework, for evaluation purposes, and used two CFD simulation codes and two HPC systems (x86-based server system and Arm-based Fugaku supercomputer) for the evaluations. We obtained encouraging results from the preliminary evaluations, and we are planning further improvements by working closely with domain expert collaborators.",

            "title": "Analysis Towards Energy-Aware Image-based In Situ Visualization on the Fugaku",
            "abstract": "Energy efficiency has become a serious concern when running applications on HPC systems. Although these systems were designed to mainly run simulation codes as fast as possible, due to the ever-increasing size of the simulation outputs, the in situ visualization has gained increasing attention. In situ visualization uses the same HPC system to execute a part or even the entire visualization processing, and there are currently a variety of tools and libraries, that facilitate domain scientists to integrate them with their simulation codes. Among different approaches, image- and video-based in situ visualization has been widely adopted as an effective approach for the subsequent offline visual analysis. In this approach, a large number of renderings are required at every visualization time step and can consume a considerable computational resource. Fugaku adopted PowerAPI which enables the users to set the power mode for their jobs. However, simulation and visualization codes may have different processing behaviors requiring different power settings for obtaining the most energy-efficient runnings. In this work, we tried to shed light on the energy efficiency of the visualization portion that was not considered before. We investigated the computational cost and energy consumption of some rendering techniques by using the PowerAPI and KVS (Kyoto Visualization System) on the Fugaku, and hope that the obtained findings will be useful for potential users looking to run in situ visualization on the Fugaku and other PowerAPI-enabled HPC systems.",

            "abstract": "Flagship-class high-performance computing (HPC) systems, also known as supercomputers, are large, complex systems that require particular attention for continuous and long-term stable operations. The K computer was a Japanese flagship-class supercomputer ranked as the fastest supercomputer in the Top500 ranking when it first appeared. It was composed of more than eighty thousand compute nodes and consumed more than 12 MW when running the LINPACK benchmark for the Top500 submission. A combined power substation, with a natural gas co-generation system (CGS), was used for the power supply, and also a large air/water cooling facility was used to extract the massive heat generated from this HPC system. During the years of its regular operation, a large log dataset has been generated from the K computer system and its facility, and several visual analytics systems have been developed to better understand the K computer\u2019s behavior during the operation as well as the probable correlation of operational temperature with the critical hardware failures. In this paper, we will reflect on these visual analytics systems, mainly developed by graduate students, intended to be used by different types of end users on the HPC site. In addition, we will discuss the importance of collaborative development involving the end users, and also the importance of technical people in the middle for assisting in the deployment and possible continuation of the developed systems.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "In-situ processing has widely been recognized as an effective approach for the visualization and analysis of large-scale simulation outputs from modern HPC systems. One of the most common approaches for batch-based in-situ visualization is the image- or video-based approach. In this kind of approach, a large number of rendered images are generated from different viewpoints at each time step and has proven useful for detailed analysis of the main simulation results. However, during test runs and model calibration runs before the main simulation run, a quick overview might be sufficient and useful. In this work, we focused on selecting the viewpoints which provide as much information as possible by using information entropy to maximize the subsequent visual analysis task. However, by simply following the selected viewpoints at each of the visualization time steps will probably lead to a rapidly changing video, which can impact the understanding. Therefore, we have also worked on an efficient camera path estimation approach for connecting selected viewpoints, at regular intervals, to generate a smooth video. This resulting video is expected to assist in rapid understanding of the underlying simulation phenomena and can be helpful to narrow down the temporal region of interest to minimize the turnaround time during detailed visual exploration via image- or video-based visual analysis of the main simulation run. We implemented and evaluated the proposed approach using the OpenFOAM CFD application, on an x86-based Server and an ARM A64FX-based supercomputer (Fugaku), and we obtained positive evaluations from domain scientists.",

It is widely known that the simulation outputs are large time-varying, multivariate, and multivalued datasets which pose a particular challenge to the visualization and analysis tasks. In this work, we focused on the widely used Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP) to analyze the interrelations between different parameters, such as variables, among the members. However, PCP may suffer from visual cluttering and drawing performance with the increase on the data size to be analyzed, that is, the number of polylines. To overcome this problem, we present an extension to the PCP by adding B\u00e9zier curves connecting the angular distribution plots representing the mean and variance of the inclination of the line segments between parallel axes. The proposed Angular-based Parallel Coordinates Plot (APCP) is capable of presenting a simplified overview of the entire ensemble data set while maintaining the correlation information between the adjacent variables. To verify its effectiveness, we developed a visual analytics prototype system and evaluated by using a meteorological ensemble simulation output from the supercomputer Fugaku.",

The size and complexity of supercomputer systems and their power and cooling facilities have continuously increased, thus posing additional challenge for long-term and stable operation.

            "abstract": "Data-driven problem solving in many real-world applications involves analysis of time-dependent multivariate data, for which dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to uncover the intrinsic structure and features of the data. However, DR is usually applied to a subset of data that is either single-time-point multivariate or univariate time-series, resulting in the need to manually examine and correlate the DR results out of different data subsets. When the number of dimensions is large either in terms of the number of time points or attributes, this manual task becomes too tedious and infeasible. In this paper, we present MulTiDR, a new DR framework that enables processing of time-dependent multivariate data as a whole to provide a comprehensive overview of the data. With the framework, we employ DR in two steps. When treating the instances, time points, and attributes of the data as a 3D array, the first DR step reduces the three axes of the array to two, and the second DR step visualizes the data in a lower-dimensional space. In addition, by coupling with a contrastive learning method and interactive visualizations, our framework enhances analysts' ability to interpret DR results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with four case studies using real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world applications involve analyzing time-dependent phenomena, which are intrinsically functional, consisting of curves varying over a continuum (e.g., time). When analyzing continuous data, functional data analysis (FDA) provides substantial benefits, such as the ability to study the derivatives and to restrict the ordering of data. However, continuous data inherently has infinite dimensions, and for a long time series, FDA methods often suffer from high computational costs. The analysis problem becomes even more challenging when updating the FDA results for continuously arriving data. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for monitoring and reviewing time series data streamed from a hardware system with a focus on identifying outliers by using FDA. To perform FDA while addressing the computational problem, we introduce new incremental and progressive algorithms that promptly generate the magnitude-shape (MS) plot, which conveys both the functional magnitude and shape outlyingness of time series data. In addition, by using an MS plot in conjunction with an FDA version of principal component analysis, we enhance the analyst's ability to investigate the visually-identified outliers. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with two use scenarios using real-world datasets. The resulting tool is evaluated by industry experts using real-world streaming datasets.",

            "abstract": "High Performance Computing (HPC) always had a close relationship with visualization as we can remember the landmark report on \u201cVisualization in Scienti\ufb01c Computing\u201d, which was credited to have coined the term Scienti\ufb01c Visualization (SciVis). K computer, a Japanese \ufb02agship HPC system, appeared in 2011 as the most powerful supercomputer in the Top500 list, and as other similar HPC systems in that ranking, it was designed to enable \u201cGrand Challenge\u201d scienti\ufb01c computing with unprecedented scale and size. RIKEN Center for Computational Science (RIKEN R-CCS) operated and provided the K computer\u2019s computational resources to the HPC community for almost 8 years until it was decommissioned in 2019. Considering that most of the scienti\ufb01c computing results were publicly presented in the form of visual images and movies, we can infer that the SciVis was widely applied for assisting the domain scientists with their end-to-end scienti\ufb01c computing work\ufb02ows. In addition to the traditional visualization applications, various others large data visualization software development were conducted in order to tackle the increased size and amount of the simulation outputs. RIKEN R-CCS participated in some of these development and deployment dealing with several environmental and human factors. Although we have no precise statistics regarding the visualization software usage, in this paper, we would like to present some \ufb01ndings and lessons learned from the large data visualization software development in the K computer environment.",
