            "title": "BiVRec: Bidirectional View-based Multimodal Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "The integration of multimodal information into sequential recommender systems has attracted significant attention in recent research. In the initial stages of multimodal sequential recommendation models, the mainstream paradigm was ID-dominant recommendations, wherein multimodal information was fused as side information. However, due to their limitations in terms of transferability and information intrusion, another paradigm emerged, wherein multimodal features were employed directly for recommendation, enabling recommendation across datasets. Nonetheless, it overlooked user ID information, resulting in low information utilization and high training costs. To this end, we propose an innovative framework, BivRec, that jointly trains the recommendation tasks in both ID and multimodal views, leveraging their synergistic relationship to enhance recommendation performance bidirectionally. To tackle the information heterogeneity issue, we first construct structured user interest representations and then learn the synergistic relationship between them. Specifically, BivRec comprises three modules: Multi-scale Interest Embedding, comprehensively modeling user interests by expanding user interaction sequences with multi-scale patching; Intra-View Interest Decomposition, constructing highly structured interest representations using carefully designed Gaussian attention and Cluster attention; and Cross-View Interest Learning, learning the synergistic relationship between the two recommendation views through coarse-grained overall semantic similarity and fine-grained interest allocation similarity BiVRec achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets and showcases various practical advantages.",

            "title": "EASRec: Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Long-term Sequential Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "In this age where data is abundant, the ability to distill meaningful insights from the sea of information is essential. Our research addresses the computational and resource inefficiencies that current Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) suffer from. especially those employing attention-based models like SASRec, These systems are designed for next-item recommendations in various applications, from e-commerce to social networks. However, such systems suffer from substantial computational costs and resource consumption during the inference stage. To tackle these issues, our research proposes a novel method that combines automatic pruning techniques with advanced model architectures. We also explore the potential of resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a technique prevalent in the realm of recommendation systems, to fine-tune models for reduced FLOPs, latency, and energy usage while retaining or even enhancing accuracy. The main contribution of our work is developing the Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Long-term Sequential Recommender Systems (EASRec). This approach aims to find optimal compact architectures for attention-based SRSs, ensuring accuracy retention. EASRec introduces data-aware gates that leverage historical information from input data batch to improve the performance of the recommendation network. Additionally, it utilizes a dynamic resource constraint approach, which standardizes the search process and results in more appropriate architectures. The effectiveness of our methodology is validated through exhaustive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which demonstrates EASRec's superiority in SRSs. Our research set a new standard for future exploration into efficient and accurate recommender systems, signifying a substantial advancement within this swiftly advancing field.",
