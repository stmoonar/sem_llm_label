            "title": "A weakly supervised textual entailment approach to zero-shot text classification",
            "abstract": "Zero-shot text classification is a widely studied task that deals with a lack of annotated data. The most common approach is to reformulate it as a textual entailment problem, enabling classification into unseen classes. This work explores an effective approach that trains on a weakly supervised dataset generated from traditional classification data. We empirically study the relation between the performance of the entailment task, which is used as a proxy, and the target zero-shot text classification task. Our findings reveal that there is no linear correlation between both tasks, to the extent that it can be detrimental to lengthen the fine-tuning process even when the model is still learning, and propose a straightforward method to stop training on time. As a proof of concept, we introduce a domain-specific zero-shot text classifier that was trained on Microsoft Academic Graph data. The model, called SCIroShot, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the scientific domain and competitive results in other areas. Both the model and evaluation benchmark are publicly available on HuggingFace and GitHub.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, several initiatives have been starting to offer access to research outputs data and metadata in an open fashion. The platforms developed by those initiatives are opening up scientific production to the wider public and they can be an invaluable asset for evidence\u2013based policy\u2013making in Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). These resources can indeed facilitate knowledge discovery and help identify available R&D assets and relevant actors within specific research niches of interest. Ideally, to gain a comprehensive view of entire STI ecosystems, the information provided by each of these resources should be combined and analysed accordingly. To ensure so, at least a certain degree of interoperability should be guaranteed across data sources, so that data could be better aggregated and complemented and that evidence provided towards policy\u2013making is more complete and reliable. Here, we study whether this is the case for the case of mapping Climate Action research in the whole Denmark STI ecosystem, by using 4 popular open access STI data sources, namely OpenAire, Open Alex, CORDIS and Kohesio. human-crafted",

            "abstract": "A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",
