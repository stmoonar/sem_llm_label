            "title": "Integrating omics databases for enhanced crop breeding",
            "abstract": "Abstract Crop plant breeding involves selecting and developing new plant varieties with desirable traits such as increased yield, improved disease resistance, and enhanced nutritional value. With the development of high-throughput technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, crop breeding has entered a new era. However, to effectively use these technologies, integration of multi-omics data from different databases is required. Integration of omics data provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes underlying plant traits and their interactions. This review highlights the importance of integrating omics databases in crop plant breeding, discusses available omics data and databases, describes integration challenges, and highlights recent developments and potential benefits. Taken together, the integration of omics databases is a critical step towards enhancing crop plant breeding and improving global food security.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease caused by malignant proliferation of lymphocytes, resulting in significant mortality worldwide. While more and more lymphoma biomarkers have been identified with the advent and development of precision medicine, there are currently no databases dedicated to systematically gathering these scattered treasures. Therefore, we developed a lymphoma biomarker database (LBD) to curate experimentally validated lymphoma biomarkers in this study. LBD consists of 793 biomarkers extracted from 978 articles covering diverse subtypes of lymphomas, including 715 single and 78 combined biomarkers. These biomarkers can be categorized into molecular, cellular, image, histopathological, physiological and other biomarkers with various functions such as prognosis, diagnosis and treatment. As a manually curated database that provides comprehensive information about lymphoma biomarkers, LBD is helpful for personalized diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma.
