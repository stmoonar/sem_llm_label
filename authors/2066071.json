            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

While next-generation exascale supercomputers promise strong support for I/O-intensive workflows, HPC remains largely untapped by live experiments, because data transfers and disparate batch-queueing policies are prohibitive when faced with scarce instrument time. To bridge this divide, we introduce Balsam: a distributed orchestration platform enabling workflows at the edge to securely and efficiently trigger analytics tasks across a user-managed federation of HPC execution sites. We describe the architecture of the Balsam service, which provides a workflow management API, and distributed sites that provision resources and schedule scalable, fault-tolerant execution. We demonstrate Balsam in efficiently scaling real-time analytics from two DOE light sources simultaneously onto three supercomputers (Theta, Summit, and Cori), while maintaining low overheads for on-demand computing, and providing a Python library for seamless integration with existing ecosystems of data analysis tools.",

            "abstract": "Emerging hardware tailored for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods provide novel means to couple them with traditional high performance computing (HPC) workflows involving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We propose Stream-AI-MD, a novel instance of applying deep learning methods to drive adaptive MD simulation campaigns in a streaming manner. We leverage the ability to run ensemble MD simulations on GPU clusters, while the data from atomistic MD simulations are streamed continuously to AI/ML approaches to guide the conformational search in a biophysically meaningful manner on a wafer-scale AI accelerator. We demonstrate the efficacy of Stream-AI-MD simulations for two scientific use-cases: (1) folding a small prototypical protein, namely \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1-fold (BBA) FSD-EY and (2) understanding protein-protein interaction (PPI) within the SARS-CoV-2 proteome between two proteins, nsp16 and nsp10. We show that Stream-AI-MD simulations can improve time-to-solution by ~50X for BBA protein folding. Further, we also discuss performance trade-offs involved in implementing AI-coupled HPC workflows on heterogeneous computing architectures.",

            "abstract": "The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will soon carry out an unprecedented wide, fast, and deep survey of the sky in multiple optical bands. The data from LSST will open up a new discovery space in astronomy and cosmology, simultaneously providing clues toward addressing burning issues of the day, such as the origin of dark energy and and the nature of dark matter, while at the same time yielding data that will, in turn, pose fresh new questions. To prepare for the imminent arrival of this remarkable data set, it is crucial that the associated scientific communities be able to develop the software needed to analyze it. Computational power now available allows us to generate synthetic data sets that can be used as a realistic training ground for such an effort. This effort raises its own challenges\u2014the need to generate very large simulations of the night sky, scaling up simulation campaigns to large numbers of compute nodes across multiple computing centers with different architectures, and optimizing the complex workload around memory requirements and widely varying wall clock times. We describe here a large-scale workflow that melds together Python code to steer the workflow, Parsl to manage the large-scale distributed execution of workflow components, and containers to carry out the image simulation campaign across multiple sites. Taking advantage of these tools, we developed an extreme-scale computational framework and used it to simulate five years of observations for 300 square degrees of sky area. We describe our experiences and lessons learned in developing this workflow capability, and highlight how the scalability and portability of our approach enabled us to efficiently execute it on up to 4000 compute nodes on two supercomputers.",

            "abstract": "Experimental and observational instruments for scientific research (such as light sources, genome sequencers, accelerators, telescopes and electron microscopes) increasingly require High Performance Computing (HPC) scale capabilities for data analysis and workflow processing. Next-generation instruments are being deployed with higher resolutions and faster data capture rates, creating a big data crunch that cannot be handled by modest institutional computing resources. Often these big data analysis pipelines also require near real-time computing and have higher resilience requirements than the simulation and modeling workloads more traditionally seen at HPC centers. While some facilities have enabled workflows to run at a single HPC facility, there is a growing need to integrate capabilities across HPC facilities to enable cross-facility workflows, either to provide resilience to an experiment, increase analysis throughput capabilities, or to better match a workflow to a particular architecture. In this paper we describe the barriers to executing complex data analysis workflows across HPC facilities and propose an architectural design pattern for enabling scientific discovery using cross-facility workflows that includes orchestration services, application programming interfaces (APIs), data access and co-scheduling.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Bringing the Scientific Workflows Community Together",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains, and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. These executions must be managed using some software infrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for creating and executing workflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. While these efforts are all worthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, many of which are moribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large, still elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or build upon, existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively impacts workflow users, developers, and researchers. The\"Workflows Community Summit\"was held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to stakeholders in the workflow community (including both developers of WMSs and users of workflows) helped to identify key challenges in this community that were translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them being the object of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community. This report documents and organizes the wealth of information provided by the participants before, during, and after the summit.",

            "abstract": "We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin\u2019s LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg2, as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.",

            "abstract": "We present a fully modular and scalable software pipeline for processing electron microscope (EM) images of brain slices into 3D visualization of individual neurons and demonstrate an end-to-end segmentation of a large EM volume using a supercomputer. Our pipeline scales multiple packages used by the EM community with minimal changes to the original source codes. We tested each step of the pipeline individually, on a workstation, a cluster, and a supercomputer. Furthermore, we can compose workflows from these operations using a Balsam database that can be triggered during the data acquisition or with the use of different front ends and control the granularity of the pipeline execution. We describe the implementation of our pipeline and modifications required to integrate and scale up existing codes. The modular nature of our environment enables diverse research groups to contribute to the pipeline without disrupting the workflow, i.e. new individual codes can be easily integrated for each step on the pipeline.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the Balsam service to manage high-throughput task scheduling and execution on supercomputing systems. Balsam allows users to populate a task database with a variety of tasks ranging from simple independent tasks to dynamic multi-task workflows. With abstractions for the local resource scheduler and MPI environment, Balsam dynamically packages tasks into ensemble jobs and manages their scheduling lifecycle. The ensembles execute in a pilot \"launcher\" which (i) ensures concurrent, load-balanced execution of arbitrary serial and parallel programs with heterogeneous processor requirements, (ii) requires no modification of user applications, (iii) is tolerant of task-level faults and provides several options for error recovery, (iv) stores provenance data (e.g task history, error logs) in the database, (v) supports dynamic workflows, in which tasks are created or killed at runtime. Here, we present the design and Python implementation of the Balsam service and launcher. The efficacy of this system is illustrated using two case studies: hyperparameter optimization of deep neural networks, and high-throughput single-point quantum chemistry calculations. We find that the unique combination of flexible job-packing and automated scheduling with dynamic (pilot-managed) execution facilitates excellent resource utilization. The scripting overheads typically needed to manage resources and launch workflows on supercomputers are substantially reduced, accelerating workflow development and execution.",
