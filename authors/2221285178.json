            "title": "Parallel Computing for Energy-Efficient Baseband Processing in O-RAN: Synchronization and OFDM Implementation Based on SPMD",
            "abstract": "Open radio access network (O-RAN) is considered as a viable method for reducing the cost and enhancing the energy efficiency of cellular networks, due to its native incorporation of intelligence and open interfaces. However, the processing delay of software-based wireless protocol stacks has hindered its development. This paper presents the implementation of parallel computing acceleration for an LTE baseband system based on single program multiple data (SPMD) methodology, and proposes detailed optimization strategies for the time-consuming synchronization and OFDM modulation modules in the system. Experiment results based on the implicit SPMD program compiler (ISPC) show that continuous memory access has a significant impact on the final acceleration effect. Moreover, the processing speed of software-based physical layer can be increased up to 10\u201330 times through SPMD.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle-Infrastructure cooperation is an advanced development stage of autonomous driving, which helps to upgrade the capability of vehicles by fully implementing real-time information interaction among vehicles, roads and pedestrians. However, perception, computing and communication are usually decoupled in today\u2019s vehicle-road coordination applications, which significantly adds delay and cost to the system. In this paper, we propose and implement a platform that integrates perception, computing and communication to provide timely roadside feature maps to vehicles for vision fusion. A neural processing unit (NPU) for computing and a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) wireless baseband IP for communication are both implemented on FPGA. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed platform using CoBEVT algorithm on the camera track of the OPV2V perception dataset. The experimental result show that our platform can expand the view of vehicles as well as improve information freshness in terms of end-to-end delay.",
