            "abstract": "Time series data is ubiquitous, and accurate time series forecasting is vital for many real-world application domains, including retail, healthcare, supply chain, climate science, e-commerce and economics. Forecasting, in general, has led to broad impact and a diverse range of applications. However, with large-scale, high-dimensional time-series data available, more advanced techniques must be invented or improved for highly accurate predictions. Latest data mining and machine learning techniques play a crucial role in the next generation of forecasting models. In this Applied Machine Learning Methods for Time Series Forecasting (AMLTS) workshop, we focus on effective and accurate latest machine learning approaches to solve various real-world problems. With this workshop's ability to attract audiences across various domains, we invite experienced industrial practitioners and researchers to help uncover new approaches and break new ground in time-series modelings' challenging and vital settings.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been well-studied within diverse research areas and application domains. A robust anomaly detection system identifies rare events and patterns in the absence of labelled data. The identified patterns provide crucial insights about both the fidelity of the data and deviations in the underlying data-generating process. For example a surveillance system designed to monitor the emergence of new epidemics will use a robust anomaly detection methods to separate spurious associations from genuine indicators of an epidemic with minimal lag time. The key concept in anomaly detection is the notion of \"robustness'', i.e., designing models and representations which are less-sensitive to small changes in the underlying data distribution. The canonical example is that the median is more robust than the mean as an estimator. The tutorial will primarily help researchers and developers design deep learning architectures and loss functions where the learnt representation behave more like the \"median'' rather than the \"mean.'' The tutorial will revisit well known unsupervised learning techniques in deep learning including autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs) from the perspective of anomaly detection. This in turn will give the audience a more grounded perspective on unsupervised deep learning methods. All the methods will be introduced in a hands-on manner to demonstrate how high-level ideas and concepts get translated to practical real code.",

The aim of this survey is two-fold, firstly we present a structured and comprehensive overview of research methods in deep learning-based anomaly detection. Furthermore, we review the adoption of these methods for anomaly across various application domains and assess their effectiveness. We have grouped state-of-the-art research techniques into different categories based on the underlying assumptions and approach adopted. Within each category we outline the basic anomaly detection technique, along with its variants and present key assumptions, to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. For each category, we present we also present the advantages and limitations and discuss the computational complexity of the techniques in real application domains. Finally, we outline open issues in research and challenges faced while adopting these techniques.",

            "abstract": "We propose a one-class neural network (OC-NN) model to detect anomalies in complex data sets. OC-NN combines the ability of deep networks to extract a progressively rich representation of data with the one-class objective of creating a tight envelope around normal data. The OC-NN approach breaks new ground for the following crucial reason: data representation in the hidden layer is driven by the OC-NN objective and is thus customized for anomaly detection. This is a departure from other approaches which use a hybrid approach of learning deep features using an autoencoder and then feeding the features into a separate anomaly detection method like one-class SVM (OC-SVM). The hybrid OC-SVM approach is sub-optimal because it is unable to influence representational learning in the hidden layers. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrate that on complex data sets (like CIFAR and GTSRB), OC-NN performs on par with state-of-the-art methods and outperformed conventional shallow methods in some scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Automated extraction of concepts from patient clinical records is an essential facilitator of clinical research. For this reason, the 2010 i2b2/VA Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical Records introduced a concept extraction task aimed at identifying and classifying concepts into predefined categories (i.e., treatments, tests and problems). State-of-the-art concept extraction approaches heavily rely on handcrafted features and domain-specific resources which are hard to collect and define. For this reason, this paper proposes an alternative, streamlined approach: a recurrent neural network (the bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding) initialized with general-purpose, off-the-shelf word embeddings. The experimental results achieved on the 2010 i2b2/VA reference corpora using the proposed framework outperform all recent methods and ranks closely to the best submission from the original 2010 i2b2/VA challenge.",

DNR aims to find drug name mentions in unstructured biomedical texts and classify them into predefined categories. State-of-the-art DNR approaches heavily rely on hand crafted features and domain specific resources which are difficult to collect and tune. For this reason, this paper investigates the effectiveness of contemporary recurrent neural architectures - the Elman and Jordan networks and the bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding - at performing DNR straight from the text. The experimental results achieved on the authoritative SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 benchmarks show that the bidirectional LSTM-CRF ranks closely to highly-dedicated, hand-crafted systems.",
