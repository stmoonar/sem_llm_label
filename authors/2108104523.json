            "abstract": "The effectiveness of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) largely depends on the ability to model intrinsic relation patterns and mapping properties. However, existing approaches can only capture some of them with insufficient modeling capacity. In this work, we propose a more powerful KGE framework named HousE, which involves a novel parameterization based on two kinds of Householder transformations: (1) Householder rotations to achieve superior capacity of modeling relation patterns; (2) Householder projections to handle sophisticated relation mapping properties. Theoretically, HousE is capable of modeling crucial relation patterns and mapping properties simultaneously. Besides, HousE is a generalization of existing rotation-based models while extending the rotations to high-dimensional spaces. Empirically, HousE achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/anrep/HousE.",

            "abstract": "Learning informative representations of users and items from the historical interactions is crucial to collaborative filtering (CF). Existing CF approaches usually model interactions solely within the Euclidean space. However, the sophisticated user-item interactions inherently present highly non-Euclidean anatomy with various types of geometric patterns (i.e., tree-likeness and cyclic structures). The Euclidean-based models may be inadequate to fully uncover the intent factors beneath such hybrid-geometry interactions. To remedy this deficiency, in this paper, we study the novel problem of Geometric Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (GDCF), which aims to reveal and disentangle the latent intent factors across multiple geometric spaces. A novel generative GDCF model is proposed to learn geometric disentangled representations by inferring the high-level concepts associated with user intentions and various geometries. Empirically, our proposal is extensively evaluated over five real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GDCF.",

            "abstract": "As the fundamental basis of sponsored search, relevance modeling measures the closeness between the input queries and the candidate ads. Conventional relevance models solely rely on the textual data, which suffer from the scarce semantic signals within the short queries. Recently, user historical click behaviors are incorporated in the format of click graphs to provide additional correlations beyond pure textual semantics, which contributes to advancing the relevance modeling performance. However, user behaviors are usually arbitrary and unpredictable, leading to the noisy and sparse graph topology. In addition, there exist other types of user behaviors besides clicks, which may also provide complementary information. In this paper, we study the novel problem of heterogeneous behavior graph learning to facilitate relevance modeling task. Our motivation lies in learning an optimal and task-relevant heterogeneous behavior graph consisting of multiple types of user behaviors. We further propose a novel HBGLR model to learn the behavior graph structure by mining the sophisticated correlations between node semantics and graph topology, and encode the textual semantics and structural heterogeneity into the learned representations. Our proposal is evaluated over real-world industry datasets, and has been mainstreamed in the Bing ads. Both offline and online experimental results demonstrate its superiority.",

            "abstract": "Text encoders based on C-DSSM or transformers have demonstrated strong performance in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Low latency variants of these models have also been developed in recent years in order to apply them in the field of sponsored search which has strict computational constraints. However these models are not the panacea to solve all the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) challenges as the pure semantic information in the data is not sufficient to fully identify the user intents. We propose the TextGNN model that naturally extends the strong twin tower structured encoders with the complementary graph information from user historical behaviors, which serves as a natural guide to help us better understand the intents and hence generate better language representations. The model inherits all the benefits of twin tower models such as C-DSSM and TwinBERT so that it can still be used in the low latency environment while achieving a significant performance gain than the strong encoder-only counterpart baseline models in both offline evaluations and online production system. In offline experiments, the model achieves a 0.14% overall increase in ROC-AUC with a 1% increased accuracy for long-tail low-frequency Ads, and in the online A/B testing, the model shows a 2.03% increase in Revenue Per Mille with a 2.32% decrease in Ad defect rate.",

            "abstract": "Transformers have achieved remarkable performance in a myriad of fields including natural language processing and computer vision. However, when it comes to the graph mining area, where graph neural network (GNN) has been the dominant paradigm, transformers haven't achieved competitive performance, especially on the node classification task. Existing graph transformer models typically adopt fully-connected attention mechanism on the whole input graph and thus suffer from severe scalability issues and are intractable to train in data insufficient cases. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel Gophormer model which applies transformers on ego-graphs instead of full-graphs. Specifically, Node2Seq module is proposed to sample ego-graphs as the input of transformers, which alleviates the challenge of scalability and serves as an effective data augmentation technique to boost model performance. Moreover, different from the feature-based attention strategy in vanilla transformers, we propose a proximity-enhanced attention mechanism to capture the fine-grained structural bias. In order to handle the uncertainty introduced by the ego-graph sampling, we further propose a consistency regularization and a multi-sample inference strategy for stabilized training and testing, respectively. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of Gophormer over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs, revealing the promising future of graph transformers.",

            "abstract": "User-item interactions in recommendations can be naturally de-noted as a user-item bipartite graph. Given the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in graph representation learning, GNN-based C methods have been proposed to advance recommender systems. These methods often make recommendations based on the learned user and item embeddings. However, we found that they do not perform well wit sparse user-item graphs which are quite common in real-world recommendations. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel perspective to build GNN-based CF methods for recommendations which leads to the proposed framework Localized Graph Collaborative Filtering (LGCF). One key advantage of LGCF is that it does not need to learn embeddings for each user and item, which is challenging in sparse scenarios. Alternatively, LGCF aims at encoding useful CF information into a localized graph and making recommendations based on such graph. Extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of LGCF especially in sparse scenarios. Furthermore, empirical results demonstrate that LGCF provides complementary information to the embedding-based CF model which can be utilized to boost recommendation performance.",

            "title": "AdsGNN: Behavior-Graph Augmented Relevance Modeling in Sponsored Search",
            "abstract": "Sponsored search ads appear next to search results when people look for products and services on search engines. In recent years, they have become one of the most lucrative channels for marketing. As the fundamental basis of search ads, relevance modeling has attracted increasing attention due to the significant research challenges and tremendous practical value. Most existing approaches solely rely on the semantic information in the input query-ad pair, while the pure semantic information in the short ads data is not sufficient to fully identify user's search intents. Our motivation lies in incorporating the tremendous amount of unsupervised user behavior data from the historical search logs as the complementary graph to facilitate relevance modeling. In this paper, we extensively investigate how to naturally fuse the semantic textual information with the user behavior graph, and further propose three novel AdsGNN models to aggregate topological neighborhood from the perspectives of nodes, edges and tokens. Furthermore, two critical but rarely investigated problems, domain-specific pre-training and long-tail ads matching, are studied thoroughly. Empirically, we evaluate the AdsGNN models over the large industry dataset, and the experimental results of online/offline tests consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.",
