            "abstract": "Data describing networks\u2014such as communication networks, transaction networks, disease transmission networks, collaboration networks, etc.\u2014are becoming increasingly available. While observational data can be useful, it often only hints at the actual underlying process that governs interactions and attributes. For example, an email communication network provides insight into its users and their relationships, but is not the same as the \u201creal\u201d underlying social network. In this article, we introduce the problem of graph identification, i.e., discovering the latent graph structure underlying an observed network. We cast the problem as a probabilistic inference task, in which we must infer the nodes, edges, and node labels of a hidden graph, based on evidence. This entails solving several canonical problems in network analysis: entity resolution (determining when two observations correspond to the same entity), link prediction (inferring the existence of links), and node labeling (inferring hidden attributes). While each of these subproblems has been well studied in isolation, here we consider them as a single, collective task. We present a simple, yet novel, approach to address all three subproblems simultaneously. Our approach, which we refer to as C3, consists of a collection of Coupled Collective Classifiers that are applied iteratively to propagate inferred information among the subproblems. We consider variants of C3 using different learning and inference techniques and empirically demonstrate that C3 is superior, both in terms of predictive accuracy and running time, to state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches on four real problems.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing amount of data describing networks\u2014examples include social networks, communication networks, and biological networks. As the amount of available data increases, so does our interest in analyzing the properties and characteristics of these networks. However, in most cases the data is noisy, incomplete, and the result of passively acquired observational data; naively analyzing these networks without taking these errors into account can result in inaccurate and misleading conclusions. In my dissertation, I study the tasks of entity resolution, link prediction, and collective classification to address these deficiencies. I describe these tasks in detail and discuss my own work on each of these tasks. For entity resolution, I develop a method for resolving the identities of name mentions in email communications. For link prediction, I develop a method for inferring subordinate-manager relationships between individuals in an email communication network. For collective classification, I propose an adaptive active surveying method to address node labeling in a query-driven setting on network data. In many real-world settings, however, these deficiencies are not found in isolation and all need to be addressed to infer the desired complete and accurate network. Furthermore, because of the dependencies typically found in these tasks, the tasks are inherently inter-related and must be performed jointly. I define the general problem of graph identification which simultaneously performs these tasks; removing the noise and missing values in the observed input network and inferring the complete and accurate output network. I present a novel approach to graph identification using a collection of Coupled Collective Classifiers, C3, which, in addition to capturing the variety of features typically used for each task, can capture the intra- and inter-dependencies required to correctly infer nodes, edges, and labels in the output network. I discuss variants of C 3 using different learning and inference paradigms and show the superior performance of C3, in terms of both prediction quality and runtime performance, over various previous approaches. I then conclude by presenting the Graph Alignment, Identification, and Analysis (GAIA) open-source software library which not only provides an implementation of C 3 but also algorithms for various tasks in network data such as entity resolution, link prediction, collective classification, clustering, active learning, data generation, and analysis.",

            "abstract": "In network classification problems such as those found in intelligence gathering, public health, and viral marketing, one is often only interested in inferring the labels of a subset of the nodes. We refer to this subset as the query set, and define the problem as query-driven collective classification. We study this problem in a practical active learning framework, in which the learning algorithm can survey non-query nodes to obtain their labels and network structure. We derive a surveying strategy aimed toward optimal inference on the query set. Considering both feature and structural smoothness, concepts that we formally define, we develop an algorithm which adaptively selects survey nodes by estimating which form of smoothness is most appropriate. We evaluate our algorithm on several network datasets and demonstrate its improvements over standard active learning methods.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing interest in methods for analyzing data describing networks of all types, including information, biological, physical, and social networks. Typically the data describing these networks is observational, and thus noisy and incomplete; it is often at the wrong level of fidelity and abstraction for meaningful data analysis. This has resulted in a growing body of work on extracting, cleaning, and annotating network data. Unfortunately, much of this work is ad hoc and domain-specific. In this paper, we present the architecture of a data management system that enables efficient, declarative analysis of large-scale information networks. We identify a set of primitives to support the extraction and inference of a network from observational data, and describe a framework that enables a network analyst to easily implement and combine new extraction and analysis techniques, and efficiently apply them to large observation networks. The key insight behind our approach is to decouple, to the extent possible, (a) the operations that require traversing the graph structure (typically the computationally expensive step), from (b) the operations that do the modification and update of the extracted network. We present an analysis language based on Datalog, and show how to use it to cleanly achieve such decoupling. We briefly describe our prototype system that supports these abstractions. We include a preliminary performance evaluation of the system and show that our approach scales well and can efficiently handle a wide spectrum of data cleaning operations on network data.",

Example applications for these algorithms include predicting which customers will recommend products to their friends in a viral marketing campaign using a customer network, predicting the topics of publications in a citation network, or predicting the political affiliations of people in a social network. It is important for an analyst to have tools to help compare the output of these machine learning algorithms. In this work, we present G-PARE, a visual analytic tool for comparing two uncertain graphs, where each uncertain graph is produced by a machine learning algorithm which outputs probabilities over node labels. G-PARE provides several different views which allow users to obtain a global overview of the algorithms output, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. By providing an adaptive exploration environment, G-PARE guides the users to places in the graph where two algorithms predictions agree and places where they disagree. This enables the user to follow cascades of misclassifications by comparing the algorithms outcome with the ground truth. After describing the features of G-PARE, we illustrate its utility through several use cases based on networks from different domains.",
