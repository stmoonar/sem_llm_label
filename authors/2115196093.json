            "title": "Dynamically Configurable FIR Filters Based on Serial MACs and Systolic Arrays",
            "abstract": "FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters are widely used in digital communication systems, digital image processing, and many other fields. A great deal of research has been done on the flexible configuration of FIR filters, particularly on the dynamic adjustment of coefficients and orders. Existing FIR filter structures can be configured to a higher-order filter for a lower-order use, leading to low hardware utilization. This paper presents a dynamically configurable architecture for FIR filters based on a novel architecture with systolic arrays and serial multiply accumulators (MACs). This design can be configured to a higher-order filter or to several independent lower-order filters, thus increasing utilization. We demonstrate a 2048-order FIR filter that can be configured to a minimum of 16 orders and a maximum of 128 channels using only 256 multipliers and adders.",

            "title": "A Hierarchical Dataflow-Driven Heterogeneous Architecture for Wireless Baseband Processing",
            "abstract": "Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\\times$ and $2.3\\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.",

Such a structure is beneficial to operators for flexible and low-cost network deployment, and to terminals for continuously evolving wireless technologies. Conventionally, they rely on General-Purpose-Processors (GPPs) such as Intel\u2019s x86 processors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for digital baseband signal processing. However, concerns regarding energy efficiency, open software environment and programmability still hinder the development. This paper proposes a domain specific manycore architecture based on RISC-V instruction extension and a multi-level dataflow programming model for open-source baseband signal processing in 6G networks. The proposed architecture shows promising performance which is comparable to state-of-the-art FPGA implementations, and meanwhile flexibility in terms of software programmability.",

Up to 16 codes can be decoded in parallel and the utilization of processing units is no less than 87.5% for various codeword lengths.
