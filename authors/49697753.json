            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation is the task of predicting the next interacted item of a target user, given his/her past interaction sequence. Conventionally, sequential recommenders are evaluated offline with the last item in each sequence as the sole correct (relevant) label for the testing example of the corresponding user. However, little is known about how this sparsity of preference data affects the robustness of the offline evaluation's outcomes. To help researchers address this, we collect additional preference data via crowdsourcing. Specifically, we propose an assessment interface tailored to the sequential recommendation task and ask crowd workers to assess the (potential) relevance of each candidate item in MovieLens 1M, a commonly used dataset. Toward establishing a more robust evaluation methodology, we release the collected preference data, which we call ML-1M++, as well as the code of the assessment interface.",

            "abstract": "How can recommender systems help people improve their skills? As a first step toward recommendation for the upskilling of users, this paper addresses the problems of modeling the improvement of user skills and the difficulty of items in action sequences where users select items at different times. We propose a progression model that uses latent variables to learn the monotonically non-decreasing progression of user skills. Once this model is trained with the given sequence data, we leverage it to find a statistical solution to the item difficulty estimation problem, where we assume that users usually select items within their skill capacity. Experiments on five datasets (four from real domains, and one generated synthetically) revealed that (1) our model successfully captured the progression of domain-dependent skills; (2) multi-faceted item features helped to learn better models that aligned well with the ground-truth skill and difficulty levels in the synthetic dataset; (3) the learned models were practically useful to predict items and ratings in action sequences; and (4) exploiting the dependency structure of our skill model for parallel computation made the training process more efficient.",

            "abstract": "The geographical imbalance of the healthcare workforce is a social problem in Japan. Except for big cities, hospitals have difficulties in securing a sufficient workforce to offer healthcare services stably. For local government, hospital service suspensions are potentially an essential indicator to figure out the capacity of the regional healthcare supply. This paper proposes an algorithm that automatically identifies and classifies hospital service suspensions from insurance claims data, based on periodicity and similarity. To verify the effectiveness, we have applied the algorithm to the insurance claim dataset, which has been provided 91 regional public insurers in Japan. The case studies have confirmed that the proposed algorithm has presented an evidential picture of hospital service suspensions, which is potentially useful to understand the actual capacity of healthcare service supply in regions.",

Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Large events with many attendees cause congestion in the traffic network around the venue. To avoid accidents or delays due to this kind of unexpected congestion, it is important to predict the level of congestion in advance of the event. This study aimed to forecast congestion triggered by large events. However, historical congestion information alone is insufficient to forecast congestion at large venues when non-recurrent events are held there. To address this problem, we utilize microblog posts that refer to future events as an indicator of event attendance. We propose a regression model that is trained with microblog posts and historical congestion information to accurately forecast congestion at large venues. Experiments on next 24-hour congestion forecasting using real-world traffic and Twitter data demonstrate that our model reduces the prediction errors over those of the baseline models (autoregressive and long short term memory) by 20% \u2013 50%.",

This study aims to detect the change in the prescription trends and to identify its cause through an analysis of Medical Insurance Claims (MICs), which comprise the specifications of medical fees charged to health insurers. Our approach is two-fold. (1) We propose a latent variable model that simulates the medication behavior of physicians to accurately reproduce monthly prescription time series from the MIC data, where prescription links between the diseases and medicines are missing. (2) We apply a state space model with intervention variables to decompose the monthly prescription time series into different components including seasonality and structural changes. Using a large dataset consisting of 3.5-year MIC records, we conduct experiments to evaluate our approach in terms of accuracy, usefulness, and efficiency. We also demonstrate three applications for our medical analysis.",

            "abstract": "In recall-oriented tasks, where collecting extensive information from different aspects of a topic is required, searchers often have difficulty formulating queries to explore diverse aspects and deciding when to stop searching. With the goal of helping searchers discover unexplored aspects and find the appropriate timing for search stopping in recall-oriented tasks, this paper proposes a query suggestion interface displaying the amount of missed information (i.e., information that a user potentially misses collecting from search results) for individual queries. We define the amount of missed information for a query as the additional gain that can be obtained from unclicked search results of the query, where gain is formalized as a set-wise metric based on aspect importance, aspect novelty, and per-aspect document relevance and is estimated by using a state-of-the-art algorithm for subtopic mining and search result diversification. Results of a user study involving 24 participants showed that the proposed interface had the following advantages when the gain estimation algorithm worked reasonably: (1) users of our interface stopped examining search results after collecting a greater amount of relevant information; (2) they issued queries whose search results contained more missed information; (3) they obtained higher gain, particularly at the late stage of their sessions; and (4) they obtained higher gain per unit time. These results suggest that the simple query visualization helps make the search process of recall-oriented tasks more efficient, unless inaccurate estimates of missed information are displayed to searchers.",

            "title": "Search by Screenshots for Universal Article Clipping in Mobile Apps",
            "abstract": "To address the difficulty in clipping articles from various mobile applications (apps), we propose a novel framework called UniClip, which allows a user to snap a screen of an article to save the whole article in one place. The key task of the framework is search by screenshots, which has three challenges: (1) how to represent a screenshot; (2) how to formulate queries for effective article retrieval; and (3) how to identify the article from search results. We solve these by (1) segmenting a screenshot into structural units called blocks, (2) formulating effective search queries by considering the role of each block, and (3) aggregating the search result lists of multiple queries. To improve efficiency, we also extend our approach with learning-to-rank techniques so that we can find the desired article with only one query. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high retrieval performance (F1 = 0.868), which outperforms baselines based on keyword extraction and chunking methods. Learning-to-rank models improve our approach without learning by about 6%. A user study conducted to investigate the usability of UniClip reveals that ours is preferred by 21 out of 22 participants for its simplicity and effectiveness.",

            "title": "A Study on Fine-Grained User Behavior Analysis in Web Search",
            "abstract": "Web search engines are now used by people with diverse search intents for various purposes. Some tasks they conduct with the search engines cannot be fulfilled just by issuing a single search query or browsing a single document. There are several characteristics common to such complex search tasks. The first two are related to search intents: (1) even if the same query is issued to a search engine, the desired information may differ among searchers, since the search intents behind the query depend on their search contexts; and (2) searchers\u2019 intents can also shift from one to another during a series of their searches on a particular topic. The remaining two concern search outcomes: (3) as complex tasks require searchers to collect more than one relevant document, browsing a single relevant document does not necessarily indicate the success of their search sessions; and (4) this requirement also makes it difficult for searchers to decide when to stop searching. This thesis aims to establish methodologies for understanding diverse intents of searchers and for appreciating their search outcomes in order to help searchers complete complex tasks efficiently and effectively. Our key idea for achieving this aim is analyzing fine-grained user behavior data, where we use the phrase \u201cuser behavior\u201d in a broader sense so that it can include search interaction data between searchers and search systems. More specifically, we address the following four research topics in this thesis: 1. Estimating Attractive Terms from Gazing Behavior We address the problem of estimating hidden intents of Web search users from their observable search behavior. To this end, we focus on searchers\u2019 gazing behavior on their browsed Web pages and assume that terms drawing a high degree of the attention of a searcher are likely to be relevant to his/her topical intent. On the basis of this assumption, we propose a method of estimating a set of weighted terms that clarify the searcher\u2019s ambiguous topical intent. Through a laboratory experiment, the proposed method is evaluated from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. 2. Predicting Query Reformulation from Current Search Behavior",

            "abstract": "For intrinsically diverse tasks, in which collecting extensive information from different aspects of a topic is required, searchers often have difficulty formulating queries to explore diverse aspects and deciding when to stop searching. With the goal of helping searchers discover unexplored aspects and find the appropriate timing for search stopping in intrinsically diverse tasks, we propose ScentBar, a query suggestion interface visualizing the amount of important information that a user potentially misses collecting from the search results of individual queries. We define the amount of missed information for a query as the additional gain that can be obtained from unclicked search results of the query, where gain is formalized as a set-wise metric based on aspect importance, aspect novelty, and per-aspect document relevance and is estimated by using a state-of-the-art algorithm for subtopic mining and search result diversification. Results of a user study involving 24 participants showed that the proposed interface had the following advantages when the gain estimation algorithm worked reasonably: (1) ScentBar users stopped examining search results after collecting a greater amount of relevant information; (2) they issued queries whose search results contained more missed information; (3) they obtained higher gain, particularly at the late stage of their sessions; and (4) they obtained higher gain per unit time. These results suggest that the simple query visualization helps make the search process of intrinsically diverse tasks more efficient, unless inaccurate estimates of missed information are visualized.",
