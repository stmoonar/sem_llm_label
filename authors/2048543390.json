            "title": "Towards Adaptive Continuous Trajectory Clustering Over a Distributed Web Data Stream",
            "abstract": "With the popularity of modern mobile devices and GPS technology, big web stream data with location are continuously generated and collected. The sequential positions form a trajectory, and the clustering analysis on trajectories is beneficial to a wide range of applications, e.g., route recommendation. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of static trajectory clustering. However, trajectory stream data is received incrementally, and the continuous trajectory clustering inevitably faces the following two problems: (1) physical structure design for trajectory representation leads to severe space overhead, and (2) dynamic maintenance of trajectory semantics and its retrieval structure brings intensive computation. To overcome the above problems, an adaptive continuous trajectory clustering framework (ACTOR) is proposed in this paper. Overall, it covers three key components: (1) Simplifier represents trajectory with a well-designed PT structure. (2) Partitioner utilizes a hexagonal-based indexing strategy to enhance the local computational efficiency. (3) Executor accommodates an adaptive selection of P-clustering and R-clustering approaches according to the ROC (rate of change) matrix. Empirical studies on real-world data validate the usefulness of our proposal and prove the huge advantage of our approach over available solutions in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) model the temporal evolution of events and have recently attracted increasing attention. Since TKGs are intrinsically incomplete, it is necessary to reason out missing elements. Although existing TKG reasoning methods have the ability to predict missing future events, they fail to generate explicit reasoning paths and lack explainability. As reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-hop reasoning on traditional knowledge graphs starts showing superior explainability and performance in recent advances, it has opened up opportunities for exploring RL techniques on TKG reasoning. However, the performance of RL-based TKG reasoning methods is limited due to: (1) lack of ability to capture temporal evolution and semantic dependence jointly; (2) excessive reliance on manually designed rewards. To overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptive reinforcement learning model based on attention mechanism (DREAM) to predict missing elements in the future. Specifically, the model contains two components: (1) a multi-faceted attention representation learning method that captures semantic dependence and temporal evolution jointly; (2) an adaptive RL framework that conducts multi-hop reasoning by adaptively learning the reward functions. Experimental results demonstrate DREAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on public datasets.",

            "abstract": "Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MKGs) include not only the relation triplets, but also related multi-modal auxiliary data (i.e., texts and images), which enhance the diversity of knowledge. However, the natural incompleteness has significantly hindered the applications of MKGs. To tackle the problem, existing studies employ the embedding-based reasoning models to infer the missing knowledge after fusing the multi-modal features. However, the reasoning performance of these methods is limited due to the following problems: (1) ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex reasoning ability as well as inability to conduct the multi-hop reasoning which is able to infer more missing knowledge. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel model entitled MMKGR (Multi-hop Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Reasoning). Specifically, the model contains the following two components: (1) a unified gate-attention network which is designed to generate effective multi-modal complementary features through sufficient attention interaction and noise reduction; (2) a complementary feature-aware reinforcement learning method which is proposed to predict missing elements by performing the multi-hop reasoning process, based on the features obtained in component (1). The experimental results demonstrate that MMKGR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the MKG reasoning task.",
