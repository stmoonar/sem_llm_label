            "abstract": "With the rapid development of 5G Internet of things technology, the traditional WebGIS visualization technology can not meet the needs of Oilfield Engineering for the integration and visualization of various sensor monitoring data. This paper uses the most advanced ecarts open source data visualization technology, combined with the basic architecture of WebGIS, to realize the multi-dimensional and comprehensive visualization of all kinds of sensor data with temporal and spatial characteristics, and improve the ability of integration and analysis of multi-source data.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of big data era, short video social network has gradually become an important battlefield for the outbreak of online public opinion. Therefore, the study for information transmission model is a hot topic for governing online public opinion. Based on improving the shortcomings of traditional SEIR model, we establish the BLSI model. Furthermore, the main affecting factors of information dissemination are selected by the principal component analysis method. Through changing the value of model parameters, the processes of information dissemination are simulated under different conditions. The simulation results are similar to the real network.",
