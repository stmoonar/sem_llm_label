            "abstract": "We present a novel technique for modulating the appearance frequency of a few tokens within a dataset for encoding an invisible watermark that can be used to protect ownership rights upon data. We develop optimal as well as fast heuristic algorithms for creating and verifying such watermarks. We also demonstrate the robustness of our technique against various attacks and derive analytical bounds for the false positive probability of erroneously \u201cdetecting\u201d a watermark on a dataset that does not carry it. Our technique is applicable to both single dimensional and multidimensional datasets, is independent of token type, allows for a fine control of the introduced distortion, and can be used in a variety of use cases that involve buying and selling data in contemporary data marketplaces.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we propose a method for using mobile network data to detect potential COVID-19 hospitalizations and derive corresponding epidemic risk maps. We apply our methods to a dataset from more than 2 million cellphones, collected by a mobile network provider located in London, UK. The approach yields a 98.6% agreement with released public records of patients admitted to NHS hospitals. Analyzing the mobility pattern of these individuals prior to their potential hospitalization, we present a series of risk maps. Compared with census-based maps, our risk maps indicate that the areas of highest risk are not necessarily the most densely populated ones and may change from day to day. Finally, we observe that hospitalized individuals tended to have a higher average mobility than non-hospitalized ones.",

In this paper, we consider a case to be active if it is infectious, and we propose methods to estimate the number of active infectious cases of COVID-19 from the official data (of confirmed cases and fatalities) and from public survey data. We show that the latter is a viable option in countries with reduced testing capacity or infrastructures.",

            "abstract": "The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. National governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, due to having limited resources and tests at their disposal. This problem is especially acute in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hence, any simple, cheap and flexible means of evaluating the incidence and evolution of the epidemic in a given country with a reasonable level of accuracy is useful. In this paper, we propose a technique based on (anonymous) surveys in which participants report on the health status of their contacts. This indirect reporting technique, known in the literature as network scale-up method, preserves the privacy of the participants and their contacts, and collects information from a larger fraction of the population (as compared to individual surveys). This technique has been deployed in the CoronaSurveys project, which has been collecting reports for the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two months. Results obtained by CoronaSurveys show the power and flexibility of the approach, suggesting that it could be an inexpensive and powerful tool for LMICs.",
