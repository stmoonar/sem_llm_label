            "abstract": "In social networks, to increase the number of followers, media express their opinions through posts, articles, and published content to cater to public preferences. Meanwhile, the evolution of public opinions is affected by both the media and peers. In this work, we investigate how the interactions between media affect the dynamics of public opinions in social networks. We propose a reinforcement learning framework to model the interactions between the public (gossipers) and media agents. We model each gossiper as an individually rational agent, which updates its opinion using the bounded confidence model (BCM). Media agents are interested in maximizing the number of following gossipers competitively, and an algorithm, i.e., WoLS-CALA, is proposed to achieve that goal. We analyze and experimentally verify that WoLS-CALA can learn Nash equilibria (NE) for games with continuous action space. In addition, the opinion dynamics of gossipers are theoretically analyzed, which shows that the existence of media will strengthen the consistency of gossipers' opinions. We then evaluate the framework in two synthetic networks, i.e., a fully connected network and a small-world network, and one real data network from Facebook. Extensive empirical simulation reveals that our framework facilitates the consensus of opinions and confirms the theoretical analysis.",

            "abstract": "With the development of cloud computing, service computing, IoT(Internet of Things) and mobile Internet, the diversity and sociality of services are increasingly apparent. With the increasing complexity of collaborative relationships between services, service ecosystems are beginning to emerge with the characteristics of natural ecosystems, economic systems and complex networks. Under this context, how to realize systematic evaluation of service ecosystem is of great significance to promote its sound development. Based on this, this article proposes a value entropy model that links the operating state of the system with the efficiency of value creation, which helps to clarify the performance of the service ecosystem from the perspective of multi-dimensional integration. In addition, a computational experiment system is established to verify the effectiveness of value entropy model, which stimulates the competitive evolution process of two service ecosystems with different strategies. The result shows that our model can provide new ideas for the analysis of service ecosystem evolution, and can also provide decision support for the optimization of operation strategy.",

            "abstract": "Multilingual pre-trained models are able to zero-shot transfer knowledge from rich-resource to low-resource languages in machine reading comprehension (MRC). However, inherent linguistic discrepancies in different languages could make answer spans predicted by zero-shot transfer violate syntactic constraints of the target language. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual MRC framework equipped with a Siamese Semantic Disentanglement Model (S2DM) to disassociate semantics from syntax in representations learned by multilingual pre-trained models. To explicitly transfer only semantic knowledge to the target language, we propose two groups of losses tailored for semantic and syntactic encoding and disentanglement. Experimental results on three multilingual MRC datasets (i.e., XQuAD, MLQA, and TyDi QA) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over models based on mBERT and XLM-100.",

            "abstract": "Trans-boundary has become not only a trend but also an important requirement and feature of Modern Service Industry. In Internet era, crossover service not only changes people's daily life, but also has a profound impact on the business model of traditional industry. However, because of the complexity and convergence of crossover service, it is difficult to analyze and identify whether crossover services are valuable and how to achieve them. In order to solve the problems, the analysis framework of crossover service is proposed from the perspective of value creation and realization, which includes four main parts: value assessment, data analysis, capability analysis, and execution path. Based on the proposed method, the New Retail in China is given as a case study to clarify the implementation process of crossover service. Furthermore, JD (self-employed mode) and Alibaba (platform mode) are taken as examples to explain how to migrate from different e-commerce models to the New Retail model. By introducing computational experiment, the performance of different execution paths can be evaluated. The comparison of experimental results with the reality shows that the proposed method can provide a roadmap for the implementation of crossover service.",

            "abstract": "Network embedding which is to learn a low dimensional representation of nodes in a network has been used in many network analysis tasks. Some network embedding methods, including those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (a promising deep learning model), have been proposed recently. Existing GAN-based methods typically use GAN to learn a Gaussian distribution as a prior for network embedding, which makes it difficult to distinguish the node representation from Gaussian distribution. It did not apply the adversarial learning strategy on the representation mechanism but just on representation results. Thus, it does not make full use of the essential advantage of GAN, and leads to compromised performance of the method. To address this problem, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework consisting of three players for network embedding, which applies the adversarial learning strategy on the representation mechanism, called Adversarial representation mechanism GAN (ArmGAN). Specifically, the first two players, named encoder and competitor, aim to learn two different representation mechanisms (i.e., two ways projecting data onto latent space). They compete with each other to improve their representation mechanisms. The third player is the discriminator, which discriminate the representation mechanism of the encoder from that of the competitor. In addition, we design a perturbation strategy to produce fake networks from the original network, and feed the fake networks to the competitor to obtain a \u201cfake\u201d representation mechanism. We evaluated ArmGAN on a variety of tasks including node clustering, node classification, link prediction and visualization. Moreover, we compared ArmGAN with 10 state-of-the-art methods (including DGI, which is well-known for its high accuracy) on 7 real-world networks. The experimental results show the significant superiority of ArmGAN over the existing methods.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of part-of-speech (POS) tagging for security vulnerability descriptions (SVD). In contrast to newswire articles, SVD often contains a high-level natural language description of the text composed of mixed language studded with codes, domain-specific jargon, vague language, and abbreviations. Moreover, training data dedicated to security vulnerability research is not widely available. Existing neural network-based POS tagging has often relied on manually annotated training data or applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques, suffering from two significant drawbacks. The former is extremely time-consuming and requires labor-intensive feature engineering and expertise. The latter is inadequate to identify linguistically-informed words specific to the SVD domain. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to assign POS tags to tokens in SVD. Our approach uses the character-level representation to automatically extract orthographic features and unsupervised word embeddings to capture meaningful syntactic and semantic regularities from SVD. The character level representations are then concatenated with the word embedding as a combined feature, which is then learned and used to predict the POS tagging. To deal with the issue of the poor availability of annotated security vulnerability data, we implement a finetuning approach. Our approach provides public access to a POS annotated corpus of ~8M tokens, which serves as a training dataset in this domain. Our evaluation results show a significant improvement in accuracy (17.72%-28.22%) of POS tagging in SVD over the current approaches.",

The traditional service matching algorithms lack consideration for the limited resources of O2O services, leading to the Matthew effect more seriously. In this context, how to alleviate the Matthew effect through the optimization of matching algorithms has become an urgent problem in this field. Based on this, this paper proposes an adaptive optimization algorithm of O2O service matching to achieve the balance of supply and demand by optimizing supply, thus alleviating the Matthew effect.

            "abstract": "Directed and undirected probabilistic graphical models have been successfully used in community detection in recent years, but existing graphical model based methods usually only use one type of probabilistic graphical model to discover communities. However, directed and undirected graphical models have their own advantages for characterizing different network information (attribute information and network topology). Intuitively, we can make use of the merit of both kinds of models by combining them into a unified model. However, combining directed and undirected graphical models is difficult, as they have different properties which prevent parameter sharing and joint training. In this article, we propose a unified model which integrates directed and undirected graphical models by transforming both them into factor graph. In addition, as network topology and attribute information may contain different degrees of noises, we add a selective attention layer to learn the reliable weight of each type of information source in node granularity. For training the model, we derive an iterative belief propagation algorithm to train all the parameters simultaneously. Extensive experiments on real networks and artificial benchmarks show the superiority of our approach over existing methods.",

            "abstract": "The prosperous development of Internet services such as O2O, IoT, and Web API has brought new vitality to service commercial platforms. However, these services involve online and offline business, which are widely diverse without a unified design and development standard. In addition, Internet services update frequently, which leads to repeat releases on commercial platforms. Therefore, in this paper, we present a generic method to rapidly release Internet services on commercial platforms. The method uses a highly abstract metamodel to express service business extensively and realizes service functions by executing metamodel objects. This method has wide versatility. Meanwhile, it extends the DevOps theory to solve the frequent changes of service functions during use after the release. Finally, we verified the usability of this method in the elderly healthcare domain.",

            "abstract": ". Retrieving responses is a subtask in the dialogue system. The focus of the existing methods is semantic matching, but the reasoning ability is insu\ufb03cient. The implicit feature association between the context and the candidate responses was not discovered. And this implicit feature association is precisely the key to realize reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on commonsense knowledge combined with graph features. We are using the advantages of graph structure in reasoning, putting the context and candidate responses in the same graph, and using commonsense knowledge to explicitly show the associated features, thereby improving the dialogue system\u2019s reasoning ability. Experiments show good performance through the e\ufb00ective combination of commonsense knowledge and graph structure.",
