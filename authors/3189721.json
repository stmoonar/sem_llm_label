            "title": "Achieving Data Survivability and Confidentiality in Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks",
            "abstract": "In Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) the nodes are subjected to hostile environment for sensing critical data. Due to the unattended nature of the network the sink is not always present. Hence, the nodes in the network are required to function in a distributed way in order to ensure Data Survivability and Data Confidentiality. In this work we address these two issues. We have proposed algorithm (s) to ensure Data Survivability by encryption and data replication. We propose a simple scheme for key management which ensures confidentiality by sharing the key among various nodes in the network so that the adversary cannot read the data by compromising a node in the network. We have compared our scheme with the existing ones, both mathematically and by simulations. Analysis shows that our scheme performs better in terms of overheads and efficiency.",
