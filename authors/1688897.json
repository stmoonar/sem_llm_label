            "abstract": "How can we adapt the composition of a post over a series of rounds to make it more appealing in a social network? Techniques that progressively learn how to make a fixed post more influential over rounds have been studied in the context of the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which seeks a set of seed users that maximize a post\u2019s influence. However, there is no work on progressively learning how a post\u2019s features affect its influence. In this article, we propose and study the problem of Adaptive Content-Aware Influence Maximization (ACAIM), which calls to find k features to form a post in each round so as to maximize the cumulative influence of those posts over all rounds. We solve ACAIM by applying, for the first time, an Online Learning to Rank (OLR) framework for IM purposes. We introduce the CATRID propagation model, which expresses how posts disseminate in a social network using click probabilities and post visibility criteria and develop a simulator that runs CATRID via a training-testing scheme based on real posts of the VK social network, so as to realistically represent the learning environment. We deploy three learners that solve ACAIM in an online (real-time) manner. We experimentally prove the practical suitability of our solutions via exhaustive experiments on multiple brands (operating as different case studies) and several VK datasets; the best learner is evaluated on 45 separate case studies yielding convincing results.",

            "abstract": "There is an abundance of data, but a large volume of it is unusable. Data may be noisy, unstructured, stored in incompatible for direct analysis medium or format, and often expensive to access. In most practical cases, the data needs to be processed before it can be used to extract valuable business insights. We refer to the nontrivial, end-to-end operation of extracting intelligence from raw data as an ETL process. In this paper, we review how the ETL technology has been evolved in the last 25 years, from a rather neglected engineering challenge to a first-class citizen in analytics and data processing. We present a brief historical overview of ETL, discuss its various applications and incarnations in modern data processing environments, and argue about exciting, feasible or wishful, potential future directions.",

            "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning tends to produce generic and reusable latent representations. However, these representations can often miss high-level features or semantic information, since they only observe the implicit properties of the dataset. On the other hand, supervised learning frameworks learn task-oriented latent representations that may not generalise in other tasks or domains. In this article, we introduce evidence transfer, a deep learning method that incorporates the outcomes of external tasks in the unsupervised learning process of an autoencoder. External task outcomes also referred to as categorical evidence, are represented by categorical variables, and are either directly or indirectly related to the primary dataset\u2014in the most straightforward case they are the outcome of another task on the same dataset. Evidence transfer allows the manipulation of generic latent representations in order to include domain or task-specific knowledge that will aid their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Evidence transfer is robust against evidence of low quality and effective when introduced with related, corresponding, or meaningful evidence.",

            "abstract": "How can we recommend content for a brand agent to use over a series of rounds so as to gain new subscribers to its social network page? The Influence Maximization (IM) problem seeks a set of~k users, and its content-aware variants seek a set of~k post features, that achieve, in both cases, an objective of expected influence in a social network. However, apart from raw influence, it is also relevant to study gain in subscribers, as long-term success rests on the subscribers of a brand page; classic IM may select~k users from the subscriber set, and content-aware IM starts the post's propagation from that subscriber set. In this paper, we propose a novel content recommendation policy to a brand agent for Gaining Subscribers by Messaging (GSM) over many rounds. In each round, the brand agent messages a fixed number of social network users and invites them to visit the brand page aiming to gain their subscription, while its most recently published content consists of features that intensely attract the preferences of the invited users. To solve GSM, we find, in each round, which content features to publish and which users to notify aiming to maximize the cumulative subscription gain over all rounds. We deploy three GSM solvers, named \\sR, \\sSC, and \\sSU, and we experimentally evaluate their performance based on VKontakte (VK) posts by considering different user sets and feature sets. Our experimental results show that \\sSU provides the best solution, as it is significantly more efficient than \\sSC with a minor loss of efficacy and clearly more efficacious than \\sR with competitive efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In today\u2019s world, technology has become deep-rooted and more accessible than ever over a plethora of different devices and platforms, ranging from company servers and commodity PCs to mobile phones and wearables, interconnecting a wide range of stakeholders such as households, organizations and critical infrastructures. The sheer volume and variety of the different operating systems, the device particularities, the various usage domains and the accessibility-ready nature of the platforms creates a vast and complex threat landscape that is difficult to contain. Staying on top of these evolving cyber-threats has become an increasingly difficult task that presently relies heavily on collecting and utilising cyber-threat intelligence before an attack (or at least shortly after, to minimize the damage) and entails the collection, analysis, leveraging and sharing of huge volumes of data. In this work, we put forward inTIME, a machine learning-based integrated framework that provides an holistic view in the cyber-threat intelligence process and allows security analysts to easily identify, collect, analyse, extract, integrate, and share cyber-threat intelligence from a wide variety of online sources including clear/deep/dark web sites, forums and marketplaces, popular social networks, trusted structured sources (e.g., known security databases), or other datastore types (e.g., pastebins). inTIME is a zero-administration, open-source, integrated framework that enables security analysts and security stakeholders to (i) easily deploy a wide variety of data acquisition services (such as focused web crawlers, site scrapers, domain downloaders, social media monitors), (ii) automatically rank the collected content according to its potential to contain useful intelligence, (iii) identify and extract cyber-threat intelligence and security artifacts via automated natural language understanding processes, (iv) leverage the identified intelligence to actionable items by semi-automatic entity disambiguation, linkage and correlation, and (v) manage, share or collaborate on the stored intelligence via open standards and intuitive tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution in the literature to provide an end-to-end cyber-threat intelligence management platform that is able to support the complete threat lifecycle via an integrated, simple-to-use, yet extensible framework.",

            "abstract": "An important task on land registration processes is to be able to determine the prevalent data provenance for a finalized polygon that represents a cadastral parcel, since the finalized polygon is derived by the examination of a set of initial polygons, drawn from several individual registers (databases). These registers might contain different, partially similar or conflicting information regarding the ownership, usage and polygon geometry of a cadastral parcel. In such cases, the cadastration expert either select one of of the initial geometries, or (in cases none of the initial accurately represents the finalized land parcel) creates a new geometry. Maintaining this provenance information is of high importance for further cadastration and validation/quality assessment processes; however, due to the gradual and long lasting nature of cadastration procedures, this information is absent from large parts of cadastral databases. In this paper, we present an approach for effectively classifying such land parcel polygons with respect to their provenance information. We propose a method that can produce highly accurate provenance recommendations based only on attributes derived from the geometry of a land parcel. In particular, we implement a set of spatial training features, capturing polygon properties and relations. These features are fed into several classification algorithms and are evaluated on a proprietary dataset of a cadastration company.",

An alternative approach, known as randomization tests, was introduced to alleviate this issue, however, such tests are computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce two novel indexing approaches that exploit frequently occurring patterns in classifications to avoid performing redundant computations during the analysis.

            "abstract": "The clear, social, and dark web have lately been identified as rich sources of valuable cyber-security information that -given the appropriate tools and methods-may be identified, crawled and subsequently leveraged to actionable cyber-threat intelligence. In this work, we focus on the information gathering task, and present a novel crawling architecture for transparently harvesting data from security websites in the clear web, security forums in the social web, and hacker forums/marketplaces in the dark web. The proposed architecture adopts a two-phase approach to data harvesting. Initially a machine learning-based crawler is used to direct the harvesting towards websites of interest, while in the second phase state-of-the-art statistical language modelling techniques are used to represent the harvested information in a latent low-dimensional feature space and rank it based on its potential relevance to the task at hand. The proposed architecture is realised using exclusively open-source tools, and a preliminary evaluation with crowdsourced results demonstrates its effectiveness.",
