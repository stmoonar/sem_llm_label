            "abstract": "Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph1, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.",

            "title": "Compound Figure Separation of Biomedical Images: Mining Large Datasets for Self-supervised Learning",
            "abstract": "With the rapid development of self-supervised learning (e.g., contrastive learning), the importance of having large-scale images (even without annotations) for training a more generalizable AI model has been widely recognized in medical image analysis. However, collecting large-scale task-specific unannotated data at scale can be challenging for individual labs. Existing online resources, such as digital books, publications, and search engines, provide a new resource for obtaining large-scale images. However, published images in healthcare (e.g., radiology and pathology) consist of a considerable amount of compound figures with subplots. In order to extract and separate compound figures into usable individual images for downstream learning, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework without using the traditionally required detection bounding box annotations, with a new loss function and a hard case simulation. Our technical contribution is four-fold: (1) we introduce a simulation-based training framework that minimizes the need for resource extensive bounding box annotations; (2) we propose a new side loss that is optimized for compound figure separation; (3) we propose an intra-class image augmentation method to simulate hard cases; and (4) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the efficacy of leveraging self-supervised learning with compound image separation. From the results, the proposed SimCFS achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation Database. The pretrained self-supervised learning model using large-scale mined figures improved the accuracy of downstream image classification tasks with a contrastive learning algorithm. The source code of SimCFS is made publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/ImageSeperation.",

            "abstract": "\n The past decade of functional neuroimaging research has seen the application of increasingly sophisticated advanced methods to characterize intrinsic functional brain organization. Accompanying these techniques are a patchwork of empirical findings highlighting novel properties of intrinsic functional brain organization. To date, there has been little attempt to understand whether there is an underlying unity across this patchwork of empirical findings. Our study conducted a systematic survey of popular analytic techniques and their output on a large sample of resting-state fMRI data. We found that the apparent complexity of intrinsic functional brain organization can be seamlessly reduced to three fundamental low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns. Our study demonstrates that a long list of previously observed phenomena, including functional connectivity gradients, the task-positive/task-negative pattern, the global signal, time-lag propagation patterns, the quasiperiodic pattern and the network structure of the functional connectome are simply manifestations of these three spatiotemporal patterns. An in-depth characterization of these three spatiotemporal patterns using a novel time-varying complex pattern analysis revealed that these three patterns may arise from a single hemodynamic mechanism.",

            "abstract": "An important goal in neuroscience is to understand the relationship between brain activity and cognitive traits. Toward this aim, many studies draw upon resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) datasets, which provide a means of probing the spatial and temporal structure of spontaneous brain activity in human subjects. However, as rsfMRI and behavioral data are both noisy, obtaining a robust relationship between them is difficult. Further, given the large number of candidate features in fMRI data, it is challenging to select those which may be most relevant for predicting a specific behavioral trait. In our research, we examined brain fMRI features based upon Sample Entropy (SampEn), which is a nonlinear signal processing measure that captures the complexity of a time series. Using 90 selected regions of interest (ROIs) across 96 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that our SampEn-based features contained reproducible patterns over different rs-fMRI scans. Further, we report the relative stability of each ROI\u2019s SampEn over four different scans of these 96 subjects. Finally, we apply multivariate models to relate SampEnbased brain features to cognition and emotion-related behavioral measures, and show that these models are reproducible when applied to different scans from the same individuals. Overall, these results suggest that SampEn of regional fMRI signals may be a reproducible metric of brain activity in healthy subjects.",

These brain regions are typically represented by atlases that capture general trends over large populations. Despite being indispensable to neuroimaging experts, population-level atlases do not capture individual differences in functional organization. In this work, we present an interactive visualization method, PRAGMA, that allows domain experts to derive scan-specific parcellations from established atlases. PRAGMA features a user-driven, hierarchical clustering scheme for defining temporally correlated parcels in varying granularity. The visualization design supports the user in making decisions on how to perform clustering, namely when to expand, collapse, or merge parcels. This is accomplished through a set of linked and coordinated views for understanding the user\u2019s current hierarchy, assessing intra-cluster variation, and relating parcellations to an established atlas. We assess the effectiveness of PRAGMA through a user study with four neuroimaging domain experts, where our results show that PRAGMA shows the potential to enable exploration of individualized and state-specific brain parcellations and to offer interesting insights into functional brain networks.",

Manual classification of ICA components is labor intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic algorithm that can reliably detect various types of functional brain networks is desirable. In this paper, we introduce a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, which provides an automatic solution for identifying resting-state networks extracted using ICA. Our results demonstrate that the proposed CNN method achieves over 98% classification accuracy and out-performs template matching methods.",

            "abstract": "Massive whole-brain blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal modulation (up to 95% of brain voxels) in response to task stimuli has recently been reported in functional MRI investigations. These findings have two implications. First, they highlight inability of a conventional \u2018top-down\u2019 general linear model approach to capture all forms of task-driven brain activity. Second, as opposed to a static \u2018active\u2019 or \u2018non-active\u2019 localization theory of the neural implementation of cognitive processes, functional neuroimaging should develop and pursue dynamical theories of cognition involving the dynamic interactions of all brain networks, in line with psychological constructionist theories of cognition. In this study, we describe a novel exploratory, bottom-up approach that directly estimates task-driven brain activity regardless of whether it follows an a priori reference function. Leveraging the property that task-driven brain activity is associated with reductions in BOLD signal variability, we combine the tools of instantaneous phase synchronization and independent component analysis to characterize whole-brain task-driven activity in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this novel framework to task fMRI data from a motor, theory of mind and working memory task provided through the Human Connectome Project. We discovered a large number of brain networks that dynamically synchronized to various features of the task scan, some overlapping with areas identified as \u2018active\u2019 in the top-down GLM approach. Using the results provided through this novel approach, we provide a more comprehensive description of cognitive processes whereby task-related brain activity is not restricted to dichotomous \u2018active\u2019 or \u2018non-active\u2019 inferences, but is characterized by the temporal dynamics of brain networks across time. Significance Statement This study describes the results of a novel exploratory methodological approach that allows for direct estimation of task-driven brain activity in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics, as opposed to the conventional approach of identifying task-driven brain activity with a hypothesized temporal pattern. This approach applied to three different task paradigms yielded novel insights into the brain activity associated with these tasks in terms of time-varying, low-frequency dynamics of replicable synchronization networks. We suggest that this exploratory methodological approach provides a framework in which the complexity and dynamics of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes can be captured more comprehensively.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high field (UHF) strengths (7\u2009T and above) offers unique opportunities for studying the human brain with increased spatial resolution, contrast and sensitivity. However, its reliability can be compromised by factors such as head motion, image distortion and non-neural fluctuations of the functional MRI signal. The objective of this review is to provide a critical discussion of the advantages and trade-offs associated with UHF imaging, focusing on the application to studying brain\u2013heart interactions. We describe how UHF MRI may provide contrast and resolution benefits for measuring neural activity of regions involved in the control and mediation of autonomic processes, and in delineating such regions based on anatomical MRI contrast. Limitations arising from confounding signals are discussed, including challenges with distinguishing non-neural physiological effects from the neural signals of interest that reflect cardiorespiratory function. We also consider how recently developed data analysis techniques may be applied to high-field imaging data to uncover novel information about brain\u2013heart interactions.",

            "abstract": "Recent fMRI studies have shown that analysis of the human brain's spontaneous activity may provide a powerful approach to reveal its functional organization. Dedicated methods have been proposed to investigate co-variation of signals from different brain regions, with the goal of revealing neuronal networks (NNs) that may serve specialized functions. However, these analysis methods generally do not take into account a potential non-stationary (variable) interaction between brain regions, and as a result have limited effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel analysis method that uses clustering analysis to sort and selectively average fMRI activity time frames to produce a set of co-activation patterns. Compared to the established networks extracted with conventional analysis methods, these co-activation patterns demonstrate novel network features with apparent relevance to the brain's functional organization.",
