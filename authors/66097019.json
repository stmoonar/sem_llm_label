            "abstract": "This paper presents RAPTA, a customized Representation-learning Architecture for automation of feature engineering and predicting the result of Path-based Timing-Analysis early in the physical design cycle. RAPTA offers multiple advantages compared to prior work: 1) It has superior accuracy with errors std ranges 3.9ps~16.05ps in 32nm technology. 2) RAPTA's architecture does not change with feature-set size, 3) RAPTA does not require manual input feature engineering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work, in which Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) representation learning is used to digest raw information for feature engineering, where generation of latent features and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based regression for timing prediction can be trained end-to-end.",

AVATAR\u2019s process watchdog model is trained using a limited number of test samples, collected at test time, to tightly correlate the Static Timing Analysis results (generated at design time) to the test results (generated from clock frequency sweeping test). The experimental results confirm that AVATAR detects over 98% of (small) Trojans inserted in the selected benchmarks.

The reinforcement learning agent learns how to adjust each register's clock arrival time to maximize the clock arrival's distribution. The use of reinforcement learning allows us to explore optimization opportunities in clock tree synthesis beyond the heuristic algorithms used in modern EDA tools. Our experimental results support this claim as we report over 35% drop in peak current and major reduction in IR drop (from package to transistor) in the selected benchmarks. The agent explores despite creating timing violations and receives a large negative reward for its action. The agent, however, can receive a bonus reward in the future if the timing violation was fixed later by adjusting the clock arrival time of other registers, resulting in a broader spread in clock arrival distribution.",

However, with the increase in the depth of the networks, the computational complexity is growing exponentially. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to reduce the computational complexity of convolutional neural network models used for many class image classification. Our proposed technique breaks the classification task into two steps: 1) coarse-grain classification, in which the input samples are classified among a set of hyper-classes, 2) fine-grain classification, in which the final labels are predicted among those hyper-classes detected at the first step. We illustrate that our proposed classifier can reach the level of accuracy reported by the best in class classification models with less computational complexity (Flop Count) by only activating parts of the model that are needed for the image classification.",

            "abstract": "The resource-constrained nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) edges, poses a challenge in designing a secure and high-performance communication for this family of devices. Although side-channel resistant ciphers (either block or stream) could guarantee the security of the communication, the energy intensive nature of these ciphers makes them undesirable for lightweight IoT solutions. In this paper, we introduce ExTru, an encrypted communication protocol based on stream ciphers that adds a configurable switching & toggling network (CSTN) to not only boost the performance of the communication in these devices, it also consumes far less energy than the conventional side-channel resistant ciphers. Although the overall structure of the proposed scheme is leaky against physical attacks, we introduce a dynamic encryption mechanism that removes this vulnerability. We demonstrate how each communicated message in the proposed scheme reduces the level of trust. Accordingly, since a specific number of messages, N, could break the communication and extract the key, by using the dynamic encryption mechanism, ExTru can re-initiate the level of trust periodically after $T$ messages where T < N, to protect the communication against side-channel and scan-based attacks (e.g. SAT attack). Furthermore, we demonstrate that by properly configuring the value of T, ExTru not only increases the strength of security from per \u201cdevice\u201d to per \u201cmessage\u201d, it also significantly improves energy saving as well as throughput vs. an architecture that only uses a conventional side-channel resistant block/stream cipher.",

            "abstract": "With the outsourcing of design flow, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of integrated circuits has become more challenging. Among the security threats, IC counterfeiting and recycled ICs have received a lot of attention due to their inferior quality, and in turn, their negative impact on the reliability and security of the underlying devices. Detecting recycled ICs is challenging due to the effect of process variations and process drift occurring during the chip fabrication. Moreover, relying on a golden chip as a basis for comparison is not always feasible. Accordingly, this paper presents a recycled IC detection scheme based on delay side-channel testing. The proposed method relies on the features extracted during the design flow and the sample delays extracted from the target chip to build a Neural Network model using which the target chip can be truly identified as new or recycled. The proposed method classifies the timing paths of the target chip into two groups based on their vulnerability to aging using the information collected from the design and detects the recycled ICs based on the deviation of the delay of these two sets from each other.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents IR-ATA, a novel flow for modeling the timing impact of IR drop during the physical design and timing closure of an ASIC chip. We first illustrate how the current and conventional mechanism for budgeting the IR drop and voltage noise (by using hard margins) lead to sub-optimal design. Consequently, we propose a new approach for modeling and margining against voltage noise, such that each timing path is margined based on its own topology and its own view of voltage noise. By having such a path based margining mechanism, the margins for IR drop and voltage noise for most timing paths in the design are safely relaxed. The reduction in the margin increases the available timing slack that could be used for improving the power, performance, and area of a design. Finally, we illustrate how IR-ATA could be used to track the timing impact of physical or PDN changes, allowing the physical designers to explore tradeoffs that were previously, for lack of methodology, not possible.",

            "abstract": "This book delineates a new creation process and provides an understanding of software pattern languages and true domain analysis, based on the fundamental concepts of software stability. It introduces a very well defined paradigm for creating pattern languages, software patterns, and better software development methodology that leads to highly reusable artifacts and high quality, cost-effective systems. Each chapter of the book concludes with an open research issue, review questions, exercises, and a series of projects.",
