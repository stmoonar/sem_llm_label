            "title": "Mapping Violence: Developing an Extensive Framework to Build a Bangla Sectarian Expression Dataset from Social Media Interactions",
            "abstract": "Communal violence in online forums has become extremely prevalent in South Asia, where many communities of different cultures coexist and share resources. These societies exhibit a phenomenon characterized by strong bonds within their own groups and animosity towards others, leading to conflicts that frequently escalate into violent confrontations. To address this issue, we have developed the first comprehensive framework for the automatic detection of communal violence markers in online Bangla content accompanying the largest collection (13K raw sentences) of social media interactions that fall under the definition of four major violence class and their 16 coarse expressions. Our workflow introduces a 7-step expert annotation process incorporating insights from social scientists, linguists, and psychologists. By presenting data statistics and benchmarking performance using this dataset, we have determined that, aside from the category of Non-communal violence, Religio-communal violence is particularly pervasive in Bangla text. Moreover, we have substantiated the effectiveness of fine-tuning language models in identifying violent comments by conducting preliminary benchmarking on the state-of-the-art Bangla deep learning model.",

            "abstract": "We investigate how representations of Syrian refugees (2011-2021) differ across US partisan news outlets. We analyze 47,388 articles from the online US media about Syrian refugees to detail differences in reporting between left- and right-leaning media. We use various NLP techniques to understand these differences. Our polarization and question answering results indicated that left-leaning media tended to represent refugees as child victims, welcome in the US, and right-leaning media cast refugees as Islamic terrorists. We noted similar results with our sentiment and offensive speech scores over time, which detail possibly unfavorable representations of refugees in right-leaning media. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Based on our results, we provide several recommendations. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to intervene around refugee representations, and design communications campaigns that improve the way society sees refugees and possibly aid refugee outcomes.",

            "title": "US News and Social Media Framing around Vaping",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how vaping is framed differently (2008-2021) between US news and social media. We analyze 15,711 news articles and 1,231,379 Facebook posts about vaping to study the differences in framing between media varieties. We use word embeddings to provide two-dimensional visualizations of the semantic changes around vaping for news and for social media. We detail that news media framing of vaping shifted over time in line with emergent regulatory trends, such as; flavored vaping bans, with little discussion around vaping as a smoking cessation tool. We found that social media discussions were far more varied, with transitions toward vaping both as a public health harm and as a smoking cessation tool. Our cloze test, dynamic topic model, and question answering showed similar patterns, where social media, but not news media, characterizes vaping as combustible cigarette substitute. We use n-grams to detail that social media data first centered on vaping as a smoking cessation tool, and in 2019 moved toward narratives around vaping regulation, similar to news media frames. Overall, social media tracks the evolution of vaping as a social practice, while news media reflects more risk based concerns. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to intervene around the framing of vaping, and may design communications campaigns that improve the way society sees vaping, thus possibly aiding smoking cessation; and reducing youth vaping.",
