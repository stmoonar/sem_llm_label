            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) problem, which focuses on next-item prediction for anonymous users, has received increasingly more attention from researchers. Existing graph-based SBR methods all lack the ability to differentiate between sessions with the same last item, and suffer from severe popularity bias. Inspired by nowadays emerging contrastive learning methods, this paper presents a Simple Contrastive Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation (SimCGNN). In SimCGNN, we first obtain normalized session embeddings on constructed session graphs. We next construct positive and negative samples of the sessions by two forward propagation and a novel negative sample selection strategy, and then calculate the constructive loss. Finally, session embeddings are used to give prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-word datasets show our SimCGNN achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Next-POI recommendation aims to explore from user check-in sequence to predict the next possible location to be visited. Existing methods are often difficult to model the implicit association of multi-modal data with user choices. Moreover, traditional methods struggle to fully explore the variation of user preferences at variable time intervals. To tackle these limitations, we propose a Multi-Modal Temporal Knowledge Graph-aware Sub-graph Embedding approach (Mandari). We first construct a novel Multi-Modal Temporal Knowledge Graph. Based on the proposed knowledge graph, we integrate multi-modal information and leverage the graph attention network to calculate sub-graph prediction probability. Next, we implement a temporal knowledge mining method to model the segmentation and periodicity of user check-in and obtain temporal prediction probability. Finally, we fuse temporal prediction probability with the previous sub-graph prediction probability to obtain the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict a user's next clicked item based on an anonymous yet short interaction sequence. Previous SBR models, which rely only on the limited short-term transition information without utilizing extra valuable knowledge, have suffered a lot from the problem of data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel mirror graph enhanced neural model for session-based recommendation (MGS), to exploit item attribute information over item embeddings for more accurate preference estimation. Specifically, MGS utilizes two kinds of graphs to learn item representations. One is a session graph generated from the user interaction sequence describing users' preference based on transition patterns. Another is a mirror graph built by an attribute-aware module that selects the most attribute-representative information for each session item by integrating items' attribute information. We applied an iterative dual refinement mechanism to propagate information between the session and mirror graphs. To further guide the training process of the attribute-aware module, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy that compares two mirror graphs generated for the same session by randomly sampling the attribute-same neighbors. Experiments on three real-world datasets exhibit that the performance of MGS surpasses many state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "The next-item recommendation problem has received more and more attention from researchers in recent years. Ignoring the implicit item semantic information, existing algorithms focus more on the user-item binary relationship and suffer from high data sparsity. Inspired by the fact that user's decision-making process is often influenced by both intention and preference, this paper presents a SequentiAl inTentiOn-aware Recommender based on a user Interaction graph (Satori). In Satori, we first use a novel user interaction graph to construct relationships between users, items, and categories. Then, we leverage a graph attention network to extract auxiliary features on the graph and generate the three embeddings. Next, we adopt self-attention mechanism to model user intention and preference respectively which are later combined to form a hybrid user representation. Finally, the hybrid user representation and previously obtained item representation are both sent to the prediction modul to calculate the predicted item score. Testing on real-world datasets, the results prove that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "\u2014The purpose of the Session-Based Recommendation System is to predict the user\u2019s next click according to the previous session sequence. The current studies generally learn user preferences according to the transitions of items in the user\u2019s session sequence. However, other effective information in the session sequence, such as user pro\ufb01les, are largely ignored which may lead to the model unable to learn the user\u2019s speci\ufb01c preferences. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based session recommendation method, named SR-HetGNN, which can learn session embeddings by heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN), and capture the speci\ufb01c preferences of anonymous users. Speci\ufb01cally, SR-HetGNN \ufb01rst constructs heterogeneous graphs containing various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can capture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN captures the complex transitions between items and learn the item embeddings containing user information. Finally, to consider the in\ufb02uence of users\u2019 long and short-term preferences, local and global session embeddings are combined with the attentional network to obtain the \ufb01nal session embedding. SR-HetGNN is shown to be superior to the existing state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods through extensive experiments over two real large datasets Diginetica and Tmall.",
