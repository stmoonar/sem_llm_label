            "title": "Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Using Denoising Diffusion Models",
            "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization in GNSS-denied environments aims to determine an unknown location by matching drone-view images with the correct geo-tagged satellite-view images from a large gallery. Recent research shows that learning discriminative image representations under specific weather conditions can significantly enhance performance. However, the frequent occurrence of unseen extreme weather conditions hinders progress. This paper introduces MCGF, a Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Framework designed to dynamically adapt to unseen weather conditions. MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF achieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather conditions.",

            "title": "U2UData: A Large-scale Cooperative Perception Dataset for Swarm UAVs Autonomous Flight",
            "abstract": "Modern perception systems for autonomous flight are sensitive to occlusion and have limited long-range capability, which is a key bottleneck in improving low-altitude economic task performance. Recent research has shown that the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous flight industry. However, the lack of a large-scale dataset is hindering progress in this area. This paper presents U2UData, the first large-scale cooperative perception dataset for swarm UAVs autonomous flight. The dataset was collected by three UAVs flying autonomously in the U2USim, covering a 9 km$^2$ flight area. It comprises 315K LiDAR frames, 945K RGB and depth frames, and 2.41M annotated 3D bounding boxes for 3 classes. It also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. U2USim is the first real-world mapping swarm UAVs simulation environment. It takes Yunnan Province as the prototype and includes 4 terrains, 7 weather conditions, and 8 sensor types. U2UData introduces two perception tasks: cooperative 3D object detection and cooperative 3D object tracking. This paper provides comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative perception algorithms on these tasks.",
