            "abstract": "In this short note, we give a novel algorithm for $O(1)$ round triangle counting in bounded arboricity graphs. Counting triangles in $O(1)$ rounds (exactly) is listed as one of the interesting remaining open problems in the recent survey of Im et al. [IKLMV23]. The previous paper of Biswas et al. [BELMR20], which achieved the best bounds under this setting, used $O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds in sublinear space per machine and $O(m\\alpha)$ total space where $\\alpha$ is the arboricity of the graph and $n$ and $m$ are the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. Our new algorithm is very simple, achieves the optimal $O(1)$ rounds without increasing the space per machine and the total space, and has the potential of being easily implementable in practice.",

            "title": "Covering a Graph with Dense Subgraph Families, via Triangle-Rich Sets",
            "abstract": "Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships in domains as diverse as the social sciences, bioinformatics, cybersecurity, the Internet, and more. One of the central observations in network science is that real-world graphs are globally sparse, yet contains numerous\"pockets\"of high edge density. A fundamental task in graph mining is to discover these dense subgraphs. Most common formulations of the problem involve finding a single (or a few)\"optimally\"dense subsets. But in most real applications, one does not care for the optimality. Instead, we want to find a large collection of dense subsets that covers a significant fraction of the input graph. We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families. These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size. We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set. The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering. We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets. It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes. Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets. For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges. We show an example of how the output of RTRExtractor correlates with meaningful sets of similar vertices in a citation network, demonstrating the utility of RTRExtractor for unsupervised graph discovery tasks.",

            "title": "A Dichotomy Hierarchy Characterizing Linear Time Subgraph Counting in Bounded Degeneracy Graphs",
            "abstract": "Subgraph and homomorphism counting are fundamental algorithmic problems. Given a constant-sized pattern graph $H$ and a large input graph $G$, we wish to count the number of $H$-homomorphisms/subgraphs in $G$. Given the massive sizes of real-world graphs and the practical importance of counting problems, we focus on when (near) linear time algorithms are possible. The seminal work of Chiba-Nishizeki (SICOMP 1985) shows that for bounded degeneracy graphs $G$, clique and $4$-cycle counting can be done linear time. Recent works (Bera et al, SODA 2021, JACM 2022) show a dichotomy theorem characterizing the patterns $H$ for which $H$-homomorphism counting is possible in linear time, for bounded degeneracy inputs $G$. At the other end, Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez used their deep theory of\"sparsity\"to define bounded expansion graphs. They prove that, for all $H$, $H$-homomorphism counting can be done in linear time for bounded expansion inputs. What lies between? For a specific $H$, can we characterize input classes where $H$-homomorphism counting is possible in linear time? We discover a hierarchy of dichotomy theorems that precisely answer the above questions. We show the existence of an infinite sequence of graph classes $\\mathcal{G}_0$ $\\supseteq$ $\\mathcal{G}_1$ $\\supseteq$ ... $\\supseteq$ $\\mathcal{G}_\\infty$ where $\\mathcal{G}_0$ is the class of bounded degeneracy graphs, and $\\mathcal{G}_\\infty$ is the class of bounded expansion graphs. Fix any constant sized pattern graph $H$. Let $LICL(H)$ denote the length of the longest induced cycle in $H$. We prove the following. If $LICL(H)<3(r+2)$, then $H$-homomorphisms can be counted in linear time for inputs in $\\mathcal{G}_r$. If $LICL(H) \\geq 3(r+2)$, then $H$-homomorphism counting on inputs from $\\mathcal{G}_r$ takes $\\Omega(m^{1+\\gamma})$ time. We prove similar dichotomy theorems for subgraph counting.",
