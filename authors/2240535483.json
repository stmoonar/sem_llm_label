            "title": "A Two-Stage Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm for Computing Offloading in Sustainable Edge Computing",
            "abstract": "Edge computing is an effective complementary technology to cloud computing, allowing end devices to offload tasks onto edge base stations (BSs) to satisfy the quality of experience of consumers. Due to the limitation of storage and computing resources, a single BS cannot satisfy the heavy computing tasks. In this regard, multi-BS collaboration is an effective way to alleviate this issue. Moreover, service caching and cloud-edge collaboration computing also show attractive advantages in handling the surging data traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is rarely work that consider all of the aforementioned scenarios simultaneously. To fill this research gap, this paper comprehensively considers the computing offloading problem in sustainable edge computing based on the above scenarios. Specifically, the computing offloading problem is first modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem with the purpose of minimizing the delay and energy consumption. Then, a two-stage hybrid multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm, called TH-MOEA, is designed to address the above formulated problem, which uses a novel competitive swarm optimizer to accelerate convergence in the early evolutionary stage and adopts a diversity-enhanced immune algorithm to improve diversity in the later evolutionary stage. Simulation results show that TH-MOEA outperforms several state-of-the-art peer methods.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scenario recommender systems (MSRSs) have been increasingly used in real-world industrial platforms for their excellent advantages in mitigating data sparsity and reducing maintenance costs. However, conventional MSRSs usually use all relevant features indiscriminately and ignore that different kinds of features have varying importance under different scenarios, which may cause confusion and performance degradation. In addition, existing feature selection methods for deep recommender systems may lack the exploration of scenario relations. In this paper, we propose a novel automated multi-scenario feature selection (MultiFS) framework to bridge this gap, which is able to consider scenario relations and utilize a hierarchical gating mechanism to select features for each scenario. Specifically, MultiFS first efficiently obtains feature importance across all the scenarios through a scenario-shared gate. Then, some scenario-specific gate aims to identify feature importance to individual scenarios from a subset of the former with lower importance. Subsequently, MultiFS imposes constraints on the two gates to make the learning mechanism more feasible and combines the two to select exclusive features for different scenarios. We evaluate MultiFS and demonstrate its ability to enhance the multi-scenario model performance through experiments over two public multi-scenario benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "The vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows (VRPPDTW) is applicable to a wide range of practical scenarios within the domains of transportation and logistics. When addressing this complex problem, conventional heuristic algorithms have exhibited limitations in effectiveness, primarily due to the need for expert knowledge in heuristic design, which often prioritizes immediate improvements and leads to convergence towards local optima. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep Q-network-based iterated local search algorithm (DQN-ILS). This algorithm employs a deep Q-learning network to automatically learn a policy for selecting heuristics to improve the current solution. Simultaneously, an adaptive perturbation strategy is designed to avoid becoming trapped in local optima. In this way, our algorithm can better balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation when solving VRPPDTW. Experimental studies conducted on a real test suite of large-scale VRPPDTW instances validate the superiority of the proposed DQN-ILS over several recently proposed methods.",

            "title": "Automatically Inspecting Thousands of Static Bug Warnings with Large Language Model: How Far Are We?",
            "abstract": "Static analysis tools for capturing bugs and vulnerabilities in software programs are widely employed in practice, as they have the unique advantages of high coverage and independence from the execution environment. However, existing tools for analyzing large codebases often produce a great deal of false warnings over genuine bug reports. As a result, developers are required to manually inspect and confirm each warning, a challenging, time-consuming, and automation-essential task. This article advocates a fast, general, and easily extensible approach called Llm4sa that automatically inspects a sheer volume of static warnings by harnessing (some of) the powers of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our key insight is that LLMs have advanced program understanding capabilities, enabling them to effectively act as human experts in conducting manual inspections on bug warnings with their relevant code snippets. In this spirit, we propose a static analysis to effectively extract the relevant code snippets via program dependence traversal guided by the bug warning reports themselves. Then, by formulating customized questions that are enriched with domain knowledge and representative cases to query LLMs, Llm4sa can remove a great deal of false warnings and facilitate bug discovery significantly. Our experiments demonstrate that Llm4sa is practical in automatically inspecting thousands of static warnings from Juliet benchmark programs and 11 real-world C/C++ projects, showcasing a high precision (81.13%) and a recall rate (94.64%) for a total of 9,547 bug warnings. Our research introduces new opportunities and methodologies for using the LLMs to reduce human labor costs, improve the precision of static analyzers, and ensure software trustworthiness",

            "abstract": "Although debiasing in multimedia recommendation has shown promising results, most existing work relies on the ability of the model itself to fully disentangle the biased and unbiased information and considers arbitrarily removing all the biases. However, in many business scenarios, it is usually possible to extract a subset of features associated with the biases by means of expert knowledge, i.e., the confounding proxy features. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel debiasing framework with confounding proxy priors for the accuracy-bias tradeoff learning in the multimedia recommendation, or CP2Rec for short, in which these confounding proxy features driven by the expert experience are integrated into the model as prior knowledge corresponding to the biases. Specifically, guided by these priors, we use a bias disentangling module with some orthogonal constraints to force the model to avoid encoding biased information in the feature embeddings. We then introduce an auxiliary unbiased loss to synergize with the original biased loss in an accuracy-bias tradeoff module, aiming at recovering the beneficial bias information from the above-purified feature embeddings to achieve a more reasonable accuracy-bias tradeoff recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a product dataset to verify the effectiveness of CR2Rec. In addition, CR2Rec is also deployed on a large-scale financial multimedia recommendation platform in China and achieves a sustained performance gain.",

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise intent graph embedding learning (PING) framework to efficiently integrate knowledge graphs into CARS. Specifically, our PING contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a pairwise intent graph (PIG) containing nodes for users, items, entities, and enhanced intent, where enhanced intent nodes are generated by applying user intent fusion (UIF) on relational intent and contextual intent, and two sub-intents are derived from the semantic information and contextual information, respectively; 2) a pairwise intent joint graph convolution module is used to obtain the refined embeddings of all the features by executing a customized convolution strategy on PIG, where each enhanced intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate information among different features and between all the features and knowledge graph; 3) a recommendation module with the refined embeddings is used to replace the randomly initialized embeddings of downstream recommendation models to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our PING.",
