            "title": "Contrastive Learning of Multimodal Consistency Feature Representation for Remote Sensing Image Registration",
            "abstract": "Feature representation is a crucial issue in multimodal image registration. The handcrafted features extracted by traditional methods are highly sensitive to nonlinear radiation differences, while supervised learning methods are limited by deficient labeled samples in the remote sensing field. Therefore, this article proposes a consistency feature representation learning method for multimodal image registration, which involves mapping data into a common feature space to realize the accurate alignment of remote sensing images. First, a contrastive network with a spatial attention mechanism is driven to enhance the capability to highlight high-level features of images. Second, a positive sample augmentation strategy is implemented with contrastive loss, which helps the model learn the inherent features better, and imposes constraints on the sample similarity to optimize the feature projection. Finally, a multimodal image registration framework is proposed to enhance the stability of feature matching. The proposed framework achieves accurate feature extraction and consistency feature description for multimodal images, ensuring robustness against nonlinear radiometric differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains more reliable registration results on the SEN1-2 dataset. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance on data from other modalities, indicating strong generalization ability.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) mainly consists of a large number of Internet-connected devices. The proliferation of untrusted third-party IoT applications has led to an increase in IoT-based malware attacks. In addition, it is infeasible for the IoT devices to support the sophisticated detection systems due to the restricted resources. Edge computing is considered to be promising. It provides solutions to the data security and privacy leakage brought by untrusted third-party IoT applications. In this article, an intelligent trusted and secure edge computing (ITEC) system is proposed for IoT malware detection. In this system, a signature-based preidentification mechanism is built for matching and identifying the malicious behaviors of untrusted third-party IoT applications. A delay strategy is then embedded into the risk detection engine in order to \u201cbuy time\u201d for threat analysis and rate-limit the impact of suspicious third-party IoT applications in the system. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the ITEC system and show that we can achieve accuracies of up to 98.52%.",

            "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is the transportation version of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in road scenarios. One key technology of VEC is task offloading, which allows vehicles to send their computation tasks to the surrounding Roadside Units (RSUs) or other vehicles for execution, thereby reducing computation delay and energy consumption. However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because vehicles with time-varying trajectories need to process massive data with high complexity and diversity. In this paper, a VEC-based computation offloading model is developed with consideration of data dependency of tasks. The minimization of the average response time and average energy consumption of the system is defined as a combinatorial optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobility-aware dependent task offloading (MESON) Scheme for urban VEC and develop a DRL-based algorithm to train the offloading strategy. To improve the training efficiency, a vehicle mobility detection algorithm is further designed to detect the communication time between vehicles and RSUs. In this way, MESON can avoid unreasonable decisions by lowering the size of the action space. Moreover, to improve the system stability and the offloading successful rate, we design a task priority determination scheme to prioritize the tasks in the waiting queue. The experimental results show that MESON is superior compared to other task offloading schemes in terms of the average response time, average system energy consumption, and offloading successful rate.",

With the development of machine learning, more researchers and engineers are using deep learning models for network traffic analysis. However, the rapidly growing data size and model complexity make resource scheduling a serious limitation, which is why cloud computing services are typically required for network analysis. To leverage the advantages of serverless platforms, we propose faaShark, an end-to-end network traffic analysis system based on a serverless computing platform. faaShark adapts distributed training to fully utilize the flexibility of serverless platforms. Additionally, we design a cold start optimization algorithm to reduce the hit rate of cold start when serving pretrained models to handle network analysis requests. Our extensive experiments evaluate the impact of several parameters of distributed training and confirm the effectiveness of our cold start optimization algorithm when building such a network analysis system atop serverless computing frameworks.",

            "title": "A Similarity Matrix Low-Rank Approximation and Inconsistency Separation Fusion Approach for Multiview Clustering",
            "abstract": "In recent years, multiview clustering algorithms have achieved promising performance by exploiting the complementarity and consistency of different views. However, many multiview spectral clustering methods only focus on the consistent information of views, and the time cost of feature decomposition is expensive. Moreover, these methods also require postprocessing (e.g., k-means) to obtain the final clustering results. To overcome these limitations simultaneously, we propose a novel multiview clustering algorithm. First, the method removes the inconsistent information of the views through cross-view measurement to maintain consistent information. These inconsistencies may be caused by noise, corruptions, or view-specific properties and will affect the quality of the similarity matrix. Then, we learn a consensus embedding matrix with nonnegative constraints by performing a low-rank decomposition of the consistency information. In this way, we can replace the eigendecomposition of the <italic>n</italic> <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bm {\\times }$</tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>n</italic> Laplacian matrix in spectral clustering with the singular value decomposition of a <italic>n</italic> <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bm {\\times }$</tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>c</italic> low-rank matrix to reduce the computational burden, where <italic>c</italic> <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bm {\\ll }$</tex-math></inline-formula> <italic>n</italic>. Furthermore, due to the nonnegative constraint, we can directly obtain the clustering results. Also, to consider the diversity of views, adaptive weighting is applied to different view data. Compared to state-of-the-art multiview clustering methods on five benchmark multiview datasets, we demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

            "abstract": "Due to the outstanding merits such as mobility, high maneuverability, and flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are viable mobile power transmitters that can be rapidly deployed in geographically constrained regions. They are good candidates for supplying power to energy-limited Sensor Nodes (SNs) with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-enabled WPT system that transmits power to a set of SNs at unknown positions. A key challenge is how to efficiently gather the locations of SNs and design a power transfer scheme. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize these objectives: maximization of UAV's search efficiency, maximization of total harvested energy, minimization of UAV's flight energy consumption and maximization of UAV's energy utilization efficiency. To tackle these issues, we present a two-stage strategy that includes a UAV Motion Control (UMC) algorithm for obtaining the coordinates of SNs and a Dynamic Genetic Clustering (DGC) algorithm for power transfer via grouping SNs into clusters. First, the UMC algorithm enables the UAV to autonomously control its own motion and conduct target search missions. The objective is to make the energy-restricted UAV find as many SNs as feasible without any priori known location information. Second, the DGC algorithm is used to optimize the energy consumption of the UAV by combining a genetic clustering algorithm with a dynamic clustering strategy to maximize the amount of energy harvested by SNs and the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts.",

            "abstract": "The convergence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) networks and blockchain transforms the existing mobile networking paradigm. However, in the temporary hotspot scenario for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) in UAV-aided MEC networks, deploying blockchain-based services and applications in vehicles is generally impossible due to its high computational resource and storage requirements. One possible solution is to offload part of all the computational tasks to MEC servers wherever possible. Unfortunately, due to the limited availability and high mobility of the vehicles, there is still lacking simple solutions that can support low-latency and higher reliability networking services for ICVs. In this article, we study the task offloading problem of minimizing the total system latency and the optimal task offloading scheme, subject to constraints on the hover position coordinates of the UAV, the fixed bonuses, flexible transaction fees, transaction rates, mining difficulty, costs and battery energy consumption of the UAV. The problem is confirmed to be a challenging linear integer planning problem, we formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has excellently solved sequential decision-making problems in dynamic ICVs environment, therefore, we propose a novel distributed DRL-based P-D3QN approach by using Prioritized Experience Replay strategy and the dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) algorithm to solve the optimal task offloading policy effectively. Finally, experiment results show that compared with the benchmark scheme, the P-D3QN algorithm can bring about 26.24% latency improvement and increase about 42.26% offloading utility.",

            "title": "Truthful Incentive Mechanism Design via Internalizing Externalities and LP Relaxation for Vertical Federated Learning",
            "abstract": "Although vertical federated learning (VFL) has become a new paradigm of distributed machine learning for emerging multiparty joint modeling applications, how to effectively incentivize self-conscious clients to actively and reliably contribute to collaborative learning in VFL has become a critical issue. Existing efforts are inadequate to address this issue since the training sample size needs to be unified before model training in VFL. To this end, selfish clients should unconditionally and honestly declare their private information, such as model training costs and benefits. However, such an assumption is unrealistic. In this article, we develop the first Truthful incEntive mechAnism for VFL, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbb {TEA}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, to handle both information self-disclosure and social utility maximization. Specifically, we design a transfer payment rule via internalizing externalities, which bundles the clients\u2019 utilities with the social utility, making truthful reporting by clients be a Nash equilibrium. Theoretically, we prove that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbb {TEA}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> can achieve truthfulness and social utility maximization, as well as budget balance (BB) or individual rationality (IR). On this basis, we further design a sample size decision rule via linear programming (LP) relaxation to meet the requirements of different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the theoretical properties of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbb {TEA}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and demonstrate its superiority compared with the state-of-the-art.",

            "title": "Medical Image Encryption by Content-Aware DNA Computing for Secure Healthcare",
            "abstract": "There exists a rising concern on security of healthcare data and service. Even small lost, stolen, displaced, hacked, or communicated in personal health data could bring huge damage to patients. Therefore, we propose a novel content-aware deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) computing system to encrypt medical images, thus guaranteeing privacy and promoting secure healthcare environment. The proposed system consists of sender and receiver to perform tasks of encryption and decryption, respectively, where both contain the same structure design, but perform opposite operations. In either sender or receiver, we design a randomly DNA encoding and a content-aware permutation and diffusion module. Considering introducing random mechanism to increase difficulty of cracking, the former module builds a random encryption rule selector in DNA encoding process by randomly mapping quantity of medical image pixels to outputs. Meanwhile, the latter module constructs a permutation sequence, which not only encodes information of pixel values, but also involves redundant correlation between adjacent pixels located in a patch. Such design brings awareness property of medical image content to greatly increase complexity in cracking by embedding semantical information for encryption. We demonstrate that the proposed system successfully improve cybersecurity of medical images against various attacks in robustness and effectiveness when transmitting data in wireless broadcasting scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The implementation of smart networks has made great progress due to the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). LoRa is one of the most prominent technologies in the Internet of Things industry, primarily due to its ability to achieve long-distance transmission while consuming less power. In this work, we modeled different environments and assessed the performances of networks by observing the effects of various factors and network parameters. The path loss model, the deployment area size, the transmission power, the spreading factor, the number of nodes and gateways, and the antenna gain have a significant effect on the main performance metrics such as the energy consumption and the data extraction rate of a LoRa network. In order to examine these parameters, we performed simulations in OMNeT++ using the open source framework FLoRa. The scenarios which were investigated in this work include the simulation of rural and urban environments and a parking area model. The results indicate that the optimization of the key parameters could have a huge impact on the deployment of smart networks.",
