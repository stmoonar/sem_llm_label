            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

We compare three encoding schemes of varying density: one-hot, binary, and domain wall, and test their performance against two well-known hybrid quantum-classical algorithms: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). In an attempt to obtain the best results possible, we investigate various parameters of the algorithms and test out other state-of-the-art improvements, such as dedicated QAOA mixers. Ultimately, we prove that, despite its popularity, one-hot encoding is not always the best, and using a denser encoding scheme, such as binary or domain wall, can allow for solving larger instances of workflow scheduling. Additionally, combining the above-mentioned encodings with dedicated QAOA mixers reduces the number of infeasible solutions, leading to better results.",

The models on these different scales may require significant but also heterogeneous computational resources, creating the need for distributed multiscale computing. A particularly demanding type of multiscale models, tightly coupled, brings with it a number of theoretical and practical issues. In this contribution, a tightly coupled model of in-stent restenosis is first theoretically examined for its multiscale merits using the Multiscale Modeling Language (MML); this is aided by a toolchain consisting of MAPPER Memory (MaMe), the Multiscale Application Designer (MAD), and Gridspace Experiment Workbench. It is implemented and executed with the general Multiscale Coupling Library and Environment (MUSCLE). Finally, it is scheduled amongst heterogeneous infrastructures using the QCG-Broker. This marks the first occasion that a tightly coupled application uses distributed multiscale computing in such a general way.",

            "abstract": "The grid paradigm for distributed computation provides an interesting framework for the simulation of dense stellar systems, which remains a great challenge for astrophysicists. In this work we apply a distributed simulation model to the astrophysical N-body problem: the High Level Architecture (HLA), using distributed federations on top of grid infrastructures for the communication between simulation and visualization components. To achieve this goal, we use a grid HLA Management system (G-HLAM) for HLA-based simulations running on the grid. We compare this setup with a direct parallelization of the N-body code using MPI on the grid. Our aim is to provide scientists with an interactive environment where, in contrast to traditional MPI-based parallel processing, seamless simulation process migration and rollbacks can be invoked on the fly to improve the overall computational performance. We found that MPI and HLA are complementary rather than competing technologies, as they can be used simultaneously to improve the performance of complex simulations on different fronts. On one hand, if the communication to computation ratio is small enough, the MPI parallelization proves to be a relatively easy and efficient method for taking advantage of grid technology. On the other hand, HLA provides advanced mechanisms to synchronize simulation and visualization components located on different grid nodes and can be used to add steering mechanisms to improve interaction. Finally, we found that HLA allows migration of running simulations to be easily managed, reducing overall communication times between simulation and the user, effectively improving the overall system performance.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative environments where users can interact with running simulations are an important aspect of e- Science. To achieve efficient execution of High Level Architecture (HLA)-based collaborative environments on the Grid, we introduce a Grid HLA Management System (GHLAM) for their management. This is done by introducing migration and monitoring mechanisms for such applications. In this paper we present how G-HLAM can be applied to the collaborative environment supporting surgeons with simulations of vascular reconstruction, using distributed federations on the Grid for the communication among simulation and visualization components.",

The article presents an overall architecture of a system based on experience gained from previous designs. The most important operational components of the system are presented, and actual performance issues are discussed. The design of the architecture is based on the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) concept that allows for modularity and compatibility with Grid services already being developed. The issue of migration to the recently proposed Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) is discussed as well.",

The monitoring is based on the OCM-G system [2].We show how the design concepts of the OCM-G enable easy adaptation to monitoring of HLA, C++-based applications. The solution presented in this paper is transparent to the user application and does not require any changes to the original HLA RTI code. We also describe the role of monitoring the whole system for managing execution of HLA-based applications described in [25]. We discuss implementation issues and present test results for the monitoring overhead.",
