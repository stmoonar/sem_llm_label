            "abstract": "Mutual information is commonly used as a measure of similarity between competing labelings of a given set of objects, for example to quantify performance in classification and community detection tasks. As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases, and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results.",

            "abstract": "The spatial configuration of urban amenities and the streets connecting them collectively provide the structural backbone of a city, influencing its accessibility, vitality and ultimately the well-being of its residents. Most accessibility measures focus on the proximity of amenities in space or along transportation networks, resulting in metrics largely determined by urban density alone. These measures are unable to gauge how efficiently street networks can navigate between amenities, since they neglect the circuity component of accessibility. Existing measures also often require ad hoc modelling choices, making them less flexible for different applications and difficult to apply in cross-sectional analyses. Here, we develop a simple, principled and flexible measure to characterize the circuity of accessibility among heterogeneous amenities in a city, which we call the pairwise circuity (PC). The PC quantifies the excess travel distance incurred when using the street network to route between a pair of amenity types, summarizing both spatial and topological correlations among amenities. Measures developed using our framework exhibit significant statistical associations with a variety of urban prosperity and accessibility indicators when compared with an appropriate null model, and we find a clear separation in the PC values of cities according to development level and geographical region.",

            "abstract": "Message passing (MP) is a computational technique used to find approximate solutions to a variety of problems defined on networks. MP approximations are generally accurate in locally treelike networks but require corrections to maintain their accuracy level in networks rich with short cycles. However, MP may already be computationally challenging on very large networks and additional costs incurred by correcting for cycles could be prohibitive. We show how the issue can be addressed. By allowing each node in the network to have its own level of approximation, one can focus on improving the accuracy of MP approaches in a targeted manner. We perform a systematic analysis of 109 real-world networks and show that our node-based MP approximation is able to increase both the accuracy and speed of traditional MP approaches. We find that, compared to conventional MP, a heterogeneous approach based on a simple heuristic is more accurate in 81% of tested networks, faster in 64% of cases, and both more accurate and faster in 49% of cases.",

In this paper, we argue that results returned by the normalized mutual information are biased for two reasons: first, because they ignore the information content of the contingency table and, second, because their symmetric normalization introduces spurious dependence on algorithm output. We introduce a modified version of the mutual information that remedies both of these shortcomings. As a practical demonstration of the importance of using an unbiased measure, we perform extensive numerical tests on a basket of popular algorithms for network community detection and show that one's conclusions about which algorithm is best are significantly affected by the biases in the traditional mutual information.",

            "abstract": "A range of systems across the social and natural sciences generate data sets consisting of interactions between two distinct categories of items at various instances in time. Online shopping, for example, generates purchasing events of the form (user, product, time of purchase), and mutualistic interactions in plant-pollinator systems generate pollination events of the form (insect, plant, time of pollination). These data sets can be meaningfully modeled as temporal hypergraph snapshots in which multiple items within one category (i.e., online shoppers) share a hyperedge if they interacted with a common item in the other category (i.e., purchased the same product) within a given time window, allowing for the application of hypergraph analysis techniques. However, it is often unclear how to choose the number and duration of these temporal snapshots, which have a strong influence on the final hypergraph representations. Here we propose a principled nonparametric solution to this problem by extracting temporal hypergraph snapshots that optimally capture structural regularities in temporal event data according to the minimum description length principle. We demonstrate our methods on real and synthetic data sets, finding that they can recover planted artificial hypergraph structure in the presence of considerable noise and reveal meaningful activity fluctuations in human mobility data.",

            "abstract": "The task of community detection, which aims to partition a network into clusters of nodes to summarize its large-scale structure, has spawned the development of many competing algorithms with varying objectives. Some community detection methods are inferential, explicitly deriving the clustering objective through a probabilistic generative model, while other methods are descriptive, dividing a network according to an objective motivated by a particular application, making it challenging to compare these methods on the same scale. Here we present a solution to this problem that associates any community detection objective, inferential or descriptive, with its corresponding implicit network generative model. This allows us to compute the description length of a network and its partition under arbitrary objectives, providing a principled measure to compare the performance of different algorithms without the need for \"ground-truth\" labels. Our approach also gives access to instances of the community detection problem that are optimal to any given algorithm and in this way reveals intrinsic biases in popular descriptive methods, explaining their tendency to overfit. Using our framework, we compare a number of community detection methods on artificial networks and on a corpus of over 500 structurally diverse empirical networks. We find that more expressive community detection methods exhibit consistently superior compression performance on structured data instances, without having degraded performance on a minority of situations where more specialized algorithms perform optimally. Our results undermine the implications of the \"no free lunch\" theorem for community detection, both conceptually and in practice, since it is confined to unstructured data instances, unlike relevant community detection problems which are structured by requirement.",

This need not be the case, however. People's social networks might be different on weekdays and weekends, for instance. Brain networks may differ between healthy patients and those with dementia or other conditions. Here we describe a Bayesian analysis framework for such data that allows for the fact that network measurements may be reflective of multiple possible structures. We define a finite mixture model of the measurement process and derive a Gibbs sampling procedure that samples exactly from the full posterior distribution of model parameters. The end result is a clustering of the measured networks into groups with similar structure. We demonstrate the method on both real and synthetic network populations.",

            "abstract": "The process of aggregating areal units into contiguous clusters, known as regionalization, is central to the analysis of spatial data. Regionalization provides a means to reduce the e\ufb00ect of noise or outliers in sampled data, identify socioeconomically homogeneous areas for policy development, and simplify the visualization of data in maps among many other applications. Most existing regionalization methods require a substantial amount of manual input, such as the number of desired regions or a similarity measure among regional populations, which may be desirable for some applications but does not allow us to extract the natural regions de\ufb01ned solely by the data itself. Here we view the problem of regionalization as one of data compression. We de\ufb01ne the optimal partition of spatial units with corresponding distributional data as the one that minimizes the description length required to transmit the data, and develop an e\ufb03cient, parameter-free greedy optimization algo-rithm to identify this partition. We demonstrate that our method is capable of recovering planted spatial clusters in noisy synthetic distributional data, and that it identi\ufb01es meaningful ethnoracial boundaries in real demographic data. Using our description length formulation, we \ufb01nd that the information contained in spatial ethnoracial data in metropolitan areas across the U.S. has become more di\ufb03cult to compress over the period from 1980 to 2010, which re\ufb02ects the rising complexity of urban segregation patterns of these metros. We identify the increasing overall diversity of these met-ros as a major contributor to this lower data compressibility, while the spatial scale of ethnoracial clustering does not appear to be a signi\ufb01cant factor.",

Using the Ising model as an example, we show that our solutions are asymptotically exact on certain classes of networks with short loops and offer a good approximation on more general networks, improving significantly on results derived from standard belief propagation.
