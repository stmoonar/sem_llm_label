            "title": "The MMO Economist: AI Empowers Robust, Healthy, and Sustainable P2W MMO Economies",
            "abstract": "Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs) feature intricate virtual economies that permeate various in-game activities. However, the balancing act between profitability and equality in MMO economic design proves to be a persistent conundrum, especially in nascent business models like Pay-to-Win (P2W). Conventional efforts are curtailed by two primary constraints: the inability to verify and the provision of suboptimal solutions. In light of these predicaments, this paper delves into MMO economies and explores the promising potential of integrating emerging AI methodologies into economic design. Specifically, we introduce a novel hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) solution for achieving Pareto optimality between profitability and equality in P2W economies. Leveraging our substantial industrial acumen and expertise, we establish an economic simulation environment that facilitates authentic and realistic assessments of MMO economic evolution. Building upon this foundation, we reconceptualize the P2W economic design process within the paradigm of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and tackle it as a standard RL problem. Comprehensive evaluations corroborate that our solution demonstrates consistent personality specialization in economic simulations akin to real-world MMOs and significantly outperforms other baselines in economic design. Further discussions highlight its superiority in both frontier research and practical applications within the game industry.",

            "abstract": "Matchmaking is a core task in e-sports and online games, as it contributes to player engagement and further influences the game's lifecycle. Previous methods focus on creating fair games at all times. They divide players into different tiers based on skill levels and only select players from the same tier for each game. Though this strategy can ensure fair matchmaking, it is not always good for player engagement. In this paper, we propose a novel Engagement-oriented Matchmaking (EnMatch) framework to ensure fair games and simultaneously enhance player engagement. Two main issues need to be addressed. First, it is unclear how to measure the impact of different team compositions and confrontations on player engagement during the game considering the variety of player characteristics. Second, such a detailed consideration on every single player during matchmaking will result in an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with non-linear objectives. In light of these challenges, we turn to real-world data analysis to reveal engagement-related factors. The resulting insights guide the development of engagement modeling, enabling the estimation of quantified engagement before a match is completed. To handle the combinatorial optimization problem, we formulate the problem into a reinforcement learning framework, in which a neural combinatorial optimization problem is built and solved. The performance of EnMatch is finally demonstrated through the comparison with other state-of-the-art methods based on several real-world datasets and online deployments on two games.",

            "abstract": "Cheating is widespread in online games, particularly in competitive games, such as first-person shooter (FPS) games. One of the most common types of cheating is extrasensory perception (ESP), which involves illicitly obtaining visual information to gain an unfair advantage over normal players. To protect the gaming experience of legitimate players and the interests of game companies, there is an urgent need for anticheating applications. In this article, we propose a general system for ESP anticheating in online FPS games, considering the business characteristics and industrial applications. We present a vision-based anticheating framework that incorporates both supervised and unsupervised solutions for comprehensive cheating detection. Based on this framework, we design and deploy a dual-audit human-in-the-loop system for industrial gaming anticheating applications. We evaluate our proposed framework from multiple online and offline perspectives and demonstrate its practical significance with superior performance.",

            "abstract": "Although the pre-training followed by fine-tuning paradigm is used extensively in many fields, there is still some controversy surrounding the impact of pre-training on the fine-tuning process. Currently, experimental findings based on text and image data lack consensus. To delve deeper into the unsupervised pre-training followed by fine-tuning paradigm, we have extended previous research to a new modality: time series. In this study, we conducted a thorough examination of 150 classification datasets derived from the Univariate Time Series (UTS) and Multivariate Time Series (MTS) benchmarks. Our analysis reveals several key conclusions. (i) Pre-training can only help improve the optimization process for models that fit the data poorly, rather than those that fit the data well. (ii) Pre-training does not exhibit the effect of regularization when given sufficient training time. (iii) Pre-training can only speed up convergence if the model has sufficient ability to fit the data. (iv) Adding more pre-training data does not improve generalization, but it can strengthen the advantage of pre-training on the original data volume, such as faster convergence. (v) While both the pre-training task and the model structure determine the effectiveness of the paradigm on a given dataset, the model structure plays a more significant role.",

            "abstract": "Self-attention models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommender systems by capturing the sequential dependencies among user\u2013item interactions. However, they rely on adding positional embeddings to the item sequence to retain the sequential information, which may break the semantics of item embeddings due to the heterogeneity between these two types of embeddings. In addition, most existing works assume that such dependencies exist solely in the item embeddings, but neglect their existence among the item features. In our previous study, we proposed a novel sequential recommendation model, i.e., MLP4Rec, based on the recent advances of MLP-Mixer architectures, which is naturally sensitive to the order of items in a sequence because matrix elements related to different positions of a sequence will be given different weights in training. We developed a tri-directional fusion scheme to coherently capture sequential, cross-channel, and cross-feature correlations with linear computational complexity as well as much fewer model parameters than existing self-attention methods. However, the cascading mixer structure, the large number of normalization layers between different mixer layers, and the noise generated by these operations limit the efficiency of information extraction and the effectiveness of MLP4Rec. In this extended version, we propose a novel framework \u2013 SMLP4Rec for sequential recommendation to address the aforementioned issues. The new framework changes the flawed cascading structure to a parallel mode, and integrates normalization layers to minimize their impact on the model\u2019s efficiency while maximizing their effectiveness. As a result, the training speed and prediction accuracy of SMLP4Rec are vastly improved in comparison to MLP4Rec. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "Massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) have been becoming one of the most popular and exciting online games. In recent years, a cheating phenomenon called real money trading (RMT) has arisen and damaged the fantasy world in many ways. RMT is the sale of in-game items, currency, or even characters to earn real money, breaking the balance of the game economy ecosystem and damaging the game experience. Therefore, some studies have emerged to address the problem of RMT detection. However, they cannot well handle the label uncertainty problem in practice, where there are only labeled RMT samples (positive samples) and unlabeled samples, which could either be RMT samples or normal transactions (negative samples). Meanwhile, the trading relationship between RMTers is modeled in a simple way, leading to some normal transactions being falsely classified as RMT. In this article, we propose PU-Detector, a novel framework based on PU learning (learning from positive and unlabeled data) for RMT detection, considering the fact that there are only labeled RMT samples and other unlabeled transactions. We first automatically estimate the likelihood of one transaction being RMT by developing an improved PU learning method and proposing an assessment rule. Sequentially, we use the estimated likelihood as edge weight to construct a trading graph to learn trader representation. Then, with the trader representations and basic trading features, we detect RMT samples by the improved PU learning method. PU-Detector is evaluated on a large-scale real world dataset consisting of 33,809,956 transaction logs generated by 43,217 unique players. Compared with other approaches, it achieves the state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates its advantages in detecting underlying RMT samples.",

            "title": "MHANER: A Multi-source Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network for Explainable Recommendation in Online Games",
            "abstract": "Recommender system helps address information overload problem and satisfy consumers\u2019 personalized requirement in many applications such as e-commerce, social networks and in-game store. However, existing approaches mainly focus on improving the accuracy of recommendation tasks, but usually ignore to improve the interpretability of recommendation, which is still a challenging and crucial task, especially for some complicated scenarios such as large-scale online games. Some few previous attempts on explainable recommendation mostly depend on a large amount of a priori knowledge or user-provided review corpus, which is labor-consuming as well as often suffers from data deficiency. To relieve this issue, we propose a Multi-source Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network for Explainable Recommendation (MHANER) for the case without enough a priori knowledge or corpus of user comments. Specifically, MHANER employs the attention mechanism to model players\u2019 preference to in-game store items as the support for the explanation of recommendation. Then a graph neural network based method is designed to model players\u2019 multi-source heterogeneous information, including the players\u2019 historical behavior data, historical purchase data, and attributes of the player-controlled character, which is leveraged to recommend possible items for players to buy. Finally, the multi-level subgraph pattern mining is adopted to combine the characteristics of a recommendation list to generate corresponding explanations of items. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, two collected from JD and one from NetEase game, demonstrate that the proposed model MHANER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the generated explanations are verified by human encoding comprised of hard-core game players and endorsed by experts from game developers.",
