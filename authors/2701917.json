            "abstract": "Rank K Binary Matrix Factorization (BMF) approximates a binary matrix by the product of two binary matrices of lower rank, K. Several researchers have addressed this problem, focusing on either approximations of rank 1 or higher, using either the L 1 or L 2-norms for measuring the quality of the approximation. The rank 1 problem (for which the L 1 and L 2-norms are equivalent) has been shown to be related to the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. We first show here that the alternating strategy with the L 2-norm, at the core of several methods used to solve BMF, can be reformulated as an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) problem. This reformulation allows us to use local search procedures designed for UBQP in order to improve the solutions of BMF. We then introduce a new local search dedicated to the BMF problem. We show in particular that this solution is in average faster than the previously proposed ones. We then assess its behavior on several collections and methods and show that it significantly improves methods targeting the L 2-norms on all the datasets considered; for the L 1-norm, the improvement is also significant for real, structured datasets and for the BMF problem without the binary reconstruction constraint.",

            "abstract": "The problem of summarizing a large collection of homogeneous items has been addressed extensively in particular in the case of geo-tagged datasets (e.g. Flickr photos and tags). In our work, we study the problem of summarizing large collections of heterogeneous items. For example, a user planning to spend extended periods of time in a given city would be interested in seeing a map of that city with item summaries in different geographic areas, each containing a theater, a gym, a bakery, a few restaurants and a subway station. We propose to solve that problem by building representative Composite Items (CIs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the problem of finding representative CIs for heterogeneous items. Our problem naturally arises when summarizing geo-tagged datasets but also in other datasets such as movie or music summarization. We formalize building representative CIs as an optimization problem and propose KFC, an extended fuzzy clustering algorithm to solve it. We show that KFC converges and run extensive experiments on a variety of real datasets that validate its effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "We propose in this paper a new, alternative approach for the problem of finding a set of representative objects in large datasets. To do so, we first formulate the general Instance Selection Problem (ISP) and then study three variants of that in order to select instances from different regions of the data. These variants aim at finding the objects located in three very different locations of the data: the inner frontier, the central area and the outer frontier. Solutions to these problems have been discussed and their complexities have been studied. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, we first use a small, synthetic dataset for visualization purpose. We then study them on the Reuters dataset and show that the integration of instances selected by the ISP techniques is able to provide a good representation of the data and can be considered as a complementary approach for the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we examine the quality of the selected objects by applying a topic-based analysis in order to show how well the selected documents cover the topics in the Reuters dataset.",

            "abstract": "We address in this paper the problem of efficiently finding a few number of representative frequent itemsets in transaction matrices. To do so, we propose to rely on matrix decomposition techniques, and more precisely on Constrained Binary Matrix Factorization (CBMF) which decomposes a given binary matrix into the product of two lower dimensional binary matrices, called factors. We first show, under binary constraints, that one can interpret the first factor as a transaction matrix operating on packets of items, whereas the second factor indicates which item belongs to which packet. We then formally prove that one can directly mine the CBMF factors in order to find (approximate) itemsets of a given size and support in the original transaction matrix. Then through a detailed experimental study, we show that the frequent itemsets produced by our method represent a significant portion of the set of all frequent itemsets according to existing metrics, while being up to several orders of magnitude less numerous.",

            "abstract": "\n \n A topic-independent sentiment model is commonly used to estimate sentiment in microblogs. But for movie and product reviews, domain adaptation has been shown to improve sentiment estimation performance. We examined whether topic-dependent models improve polarity estimation of microblogs. We considered both a model trained on Twitter tweets containing a target keyword and a model trained on an enlarged set of tweets containing terms related to a topic.\u00a0 Comparing the performance of the topic-dependent models to a topic-independent model trained on a general sample of\u00a0 tweets, we noted that for some topics, topic-dependent models performed better.

            "abstract": "Identification of social relationships in social networks, especially cell phone networks, has attracted a lot of attention recently. Mobile phones continue to be one of the main methods of communication. Their voice and SMS logs are accessible in network switches and/or telecommunication centers. However, relationships like friendship have been mined from several features that are hard or impossible to obtain like proximity. With this in mind, in the following study, we are analyzing the voice and SMS logs of 'Reality mining' dataset without any hard to obtain attribute to predict different relationships among the study participants with just one factor. The dataset, which encloses communication logs in addition to some other information about subjects, is focused on 90 people at MIT Media Lab from 2004 to 2005. We present an algorithm based on just one factor to infer type of friendship among study participants. The authenticity of our analysis is proven by comparing the results of our analysis with self-reported surveys subjects provided regarding their relationships. Although we performed our analysis without any prior knowledge or hard to obtain feature on 'Reality Mining' participants, we have achieved almost the same accuracy and detection rate compared to previous studies using all the features.",
