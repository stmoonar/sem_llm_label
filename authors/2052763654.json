            "title": "SOCLE: Towards a framework for data preparation in social applications",
            "abstract": "The web has evolved from a technological platform to a real social milieu thereby be- coming a continuous source of Big Social Data (BSD). BSD is characterized by a combination of factual content such as the coordinates of a restaurant, the content of a webpage or the title of a movie, behavior data such as exchanges between social relationships, as well as subjective data such as users' opinions, reviews, and tags. The goal of a social application is to analyze BSD and process it in order to understand it and transform it into valuable content to users. Building social applications requires an essential data preparation step during which raw BSD is sanitized, normalized, enriched, pruned, and transformed making it readily available for fur- ther processing. We argue for the need to formalize data preparation and develop appropriate tools to enable easy prototyping of social applications. We describe SOCLE, our framework for BSD preparation. We provide an architecture inspired from typical social applications, the state of the art of existing languages and algebras for manipulating BSD, and the scientific challenges and opportunities underlying the development of SOCLE. RESUME.Le web, initialement une plateforme technologique, est devenu un veritable eco-systeme socialetunesourcecontinuedeBigDatasociales(BSD).Nousytrouvonsdesdonneesfactuelles et objectives telles que les coordonnees d'un restaurant, des donnees comportementales telles que les echanges entre amis et enfin, des donnees subjectives comme les revues, les etiquettes, les notes ou les etoiles. Ces donnees brutes ont besoin d'etre filtrees et organisees pour en extraire des informations utiles et permettre le developpement d'applications sociales qui ap- portent une valeur ajoutee aux utilisateurs. Dans cet article, nous motivons le besoin de for- maliser l'etape de preparation des BSD et decrivons SOCLE, notre plateforme pour le faire.

            "title": "Distance-Based Trace Diagnosis for Multimedia Applications: Help Me TED!",
            "abstract": "Execution traces have become essential resources that many developers analyze to debug their applications. Ideally, a developer wants to quickly detect whether there are anomalies on his application or not. However, in practice, the size of multimedia applications trace can reach gigabytes, which makes their exploitation very complex. Usually, developers use visualization tools before stating a hypothesis. In this paper, we argue that this solution is not satisfactory and propose to automatically provide a diagnosis by comparing execution traces. We use distance-based models and conduct a user case to show how TED, our automatic trace diagnosis tool, provides semantic added-value information to the developer. Performance evaluation over real world data shows that our approach is scalable.",

            "title": "Efficiently rewriting large multimedia application execution traces with few event sequences",
            "abstract": "The analysis of multimedia application traces can reveal important information to enhance program execution comprehension. However typical size of traces can be in gigabytes, which hinders their effective exploitation by application developers. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of sequences of events that allows a reduced-size rewriting of the original trace. These sequences of events, that we call blocks, can simplify the exploration of large execution traces by allowing application developers to see an abstraction instead of low-level events. The problem of computing such set of blocks is NP-hard and naive approaches lead to prohibitive running times that prevent analysing real world traces. We propose a novel algorithm that directly mines the set of blocks. Our experiments show that our algorithm can analyse real traces of up to two hours of video. We also show experimentally the quality of the set of blocks proposed, and the interest of the rewriting to understand actual trace data.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of multimedia application traces can reveal important information to enhance program comprehension. However traces can be very large, which hinders their effective exploitation. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a k-golden set of blocks that best characterize data. Sequential pattern mining can help to automatically discover the blocks, and we called k-golden set, a set of k blocks that maximally covers the trace. These kind of blocks can simplify the exploration of large traces by allowing programmers to see an abstraction instead of low-level events. We propose an approach for mining golden blocks and finding coverage of frames. The experiments carried out on video and audio application decoding show very promising results.",
