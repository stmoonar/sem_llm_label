            "abstract": "Creating and deploying customized applications is crucial for operational success and enriching user experiences in the rapidly evolving modern business world. A prominent facet of modern user experiences is the integration of chatbots or voice assistants. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided a powerful tool to build conversational applications. We present Walert, a customized LLM-based conversational agent able to answer frequently asked questions about computer science degrees and programs at RMIT University. Our demo aims to showcase how conversational information-seeking researchers can effectively communicate the benefits of using best practices to stakeholders interested in developing and deploying LLM-based chatbots. These practices are well-known in our community but often overlooked by practitioners who may not have access to this knowledge. The methodology and resources used in this demo serve as a bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer from experts, address industry professionals\u2019 practical needs, and foster a collaborative environment. The data and code of the demo are available at https://github.com/rmit-ir/walert.",

            "abstract": "Instruments such as eye-tracking devices have contributed to understanding how users interact with screen-based search engines. However, user-system interactions in audio-only channels -- as is the case for Spoken Conversational Search (SCS) -- are harder to characterize, given the lack of instruments to effectively and precisely capture interactions. Furthermore, in this era of information overload, cognitive bias can significantly impact how we seek and consume information -- especially in the context of controversial topics or multiple viewpoints. This paper draws upon insights from multiple disciplines (including information seeking, psychology, cognitive science, and wearable sensors) to provoke novel conversations in the community. To this end, we discuss future opportunities and propose a framework including multimodal instruments and methods for experimental designs and settings. We demonstrate preliminary results as an example. We also outline the challenges and offer suggestions for adopting this multimodal approach, including ethical considerations, to assist future researchers and practitioners in exploring cognitive biases in SCS.",

            "title": "Characterizing Information Seeking Processes with Multiple Physiological Signals",
            "abstract": "Information access systems are getting complex, and our understanding of user behavior during information seeking processes is mainly drawn from qualitative methods, such as observational studies or surveys. Leveraging the advances in sensing technologies, our study aims to characterize user behaviors with physiological signals, particularly in relation to cognitive load, affective arousal, and valence. We conduct a controlled lab study with 26 participants, and collect data including Electrodermal Activities, Photoplethysmogram, Electroencephalogram, and Pupillary Responses. This study examines informational search with four stages: the realization of Information Need (IN), Query Formulation (QF), Query Submission (QS), and Relevance Judgment (RJ). We also include different interaction modalities to represent modern systems, e.g., QS by text-typing or verbalizing, and RJ with text or audio information. We analyze the physiological signals across these stages and report outcomes of pairwise non-parametric repeated-measure statistical tests. The results show that participants experience significantly higher cognitive loads at IN with a subtle increase in alertness, while QF requires higher attention. QS involves demanding cognitive loads than QF. Affective responses are more pronounced at RJ than QS or IN, suggesting greater interest and engagement as knowledge gaps are resolved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores user behaviors in a search process employing a more nuanced quantitative analysis of physiological signals. Our findings offer valuable insights into user behavior and emotional responses in information seeking processes. We believe our proposed methodology can inform the characterization of more complex processes, such as conversational information seeking.",

            "abstract": "Electric scooters (e-scooters), characterised by their small size and lightweight design, have revolutionised urban commuting experiences. Their adaptability to multiple mobility infrastructures introduces advantages for users, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of urban transit. However, this versatility also causes potential challenges, including increased interactions and conflicts with other road users. Previous research has primarily focused on historical trip data, leaving a gap in our understanding of real-time e-scooter user behaviours and interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel multi-modal data collection and integrated data analysis methodology, aimed at capturing the dynamic behaviours of e-scooter riders and their interactions with other road users in real-world settings. We present the study setup and the analysis approach we used for an in the wild study with 15 participants, each traversing a pre-determined route equipped with off-the-shelf commercially available devices (e.g., cameras, bike computers) and eye-tracking glasses.",

With explainers becoming increasingly complex and a lack of consensus on how to assess their utility, it is challenging to judge the benefit and effectiveness of different explanations. To address this gap, we take a step back from sophisticated predictive algorithms and instead look into explainability of simple decision-making models. In this setting, we aim to assess how people perceive comprehensibility of their different representations such as mathematical formulation, graphical representation and textual summarisation (of varying complexity and scope). This allows us to capture how diverse stakeholders -- engineers, researchers, consumers, regulators and the like -- judge intelligibility of fundamental concepts that more elaborate artificial intelligence explanations are built from. This position paper charts our approach to establishing appropriate evaluation methodology as well as a conceptual and practical framework to facilitate setting up and executing relevant user studies.",

            "abstract": "Crowdsourced annotation is vital to both collecting labelled data to train and test automated content moderation systems and to support human-in-the-loop review of system decisions. However, annotation tasks such as judging hate speech are subjective and thus highly sensitive to biases stemming from annotator beliefs, characteristics and demographics. We conduct two crowdsourcing studies on Mechanical Turk to examine annotator bias in labelling sexist and misogynistic hate speech. Results from 109 annotators show that annotator political inclination, moral integrity, personality traits, and sexist attitudes significantly impact annotation accuracy and the tendency to tag content as hate speech. In addition, semi-structured interviews with nine crowd workers provide further insights regarding the influence of subjectivity on annotations. In exploring how workers interpret a task \u2014 shaped by complex negotiations between platform structures, task instructions, subjective motivations, and external contextual factors \u2014 we see annotations not only impacted by worker factors but also simultaneously shaped by the structures under which they labour.",

The collected signals include Electrodermal Activities, Blood Volume Pulse, gaze, and head motion. We observed consistent trends across participants, and ten features with statistically significant differences across the four IPAs. Our results provide preliminary quantitative evidence of differences in physiological responses when users encounter IPAs, revealing the necessity to inspect the signals separately according to the IPAs.

            "abstract": "Micro-mobility services (e.g., e-bikes, e-scooters) are increasingly popular among urban communities, being a flexible transport option that brings both opportunities and challenges. As a growing mode of transportation, insights gained from micro-mobility usage data are valuable in policy formulation and improving the quality of services. Existing research analyses patterns and features associated with usage distributions in different localities, and focuses on either temporal or spatial aspects. In this paper, we employ a combination of methods that analyse both spatial and temporal characteristics related to e-scooter trips in a more granular level, enabling observations at different time frames and local geographical zones that prior analysis wasn\u2019t able to do. The insights obtained from anonymised, restricted data on shared e-scooter rides show the applicability of the employed method on regulated, privacy preserving micro-mobility trip data. Our results showed population density is the topmost important feature, and it associates with e-scooter usage positively. Population owning motor vehicles is negatively associated with shared e-scooter trips, suggesting a reduction in e-scooter usage among motor vehicle owners. Furthermore, we found that the effect of humidity is more important than precipitation in predicting hourly e-scooter trip count. Buffer analysis showed, nearly 29% trips were stopped, and 27% trips were started on the footpath, revealing higher utilisation of footpaths for parking e-scooters in Melbourne.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth of online misinformation, it is crucial to have reliable fact-checking methods. Recent research on finding check-worthy claims and automated fact-checking have made significant advancements. However, limited guidance exists regarding the presentation of fact-checked content to effectively convey verified information to users. We address this research gap by exploring the critical design elements in fact-checking reports and investigating whether credibility and presentation-based design improvements can enhance users' ability to interpret the report accurately. We co-developed potential content presentation strategies through a workshop involving fact-checking professionals, communication experts, and researchers. The workshop examined the significance and utility of elements such as veracity indicators and explored the feasibility of incorporating interactive components for enhanced information disclosure. Building on the workshop outcomes, we conducted an online experiment involving 76 crowd workers to assess the efficacy of different design strategies. The results indicate that proposed strategies significantly improve users' ability to accurately interpret the verdict of fact-checking articles. Our findings underscore the critical role of effective presentation of fact reports in addressing the spread of misinformation. By adopting appropriate design enhancements, the effectiveness of fact-checking reports can be maximized, enabling users to make informed judgments.",

            "abstract": "Crowdworkers silently enable much of today\u2019s AI-based products, with several online platforms offering a myriad of data labelling and content moderation tasks through convenient labour marketplaces. The HCI community has been increasingly interested in investigating the worker-centric issues inherent in the current model and seeking for potential improvements that could be implemented in the future. This workshop explores how a reimagined perspective on crowdsourcing platforms could provide a more equitable, fair, and rewarding experience. This includes not only the workers but also the platforms, who could benefit e.g. from better processes for worker onboarding, skills-development, and growth. We invite visionary takes in various formats on this topic to spread awareness of worker-centric research and developments to the CHI community. As a result of interactive ideation work in the workshop, we articulate a future direction roadmap for research centred around crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, as a specific interest area, the workshop seeks to study crowdwork from the context of the Global South, which has been arising as an important but critically understudied crowdsourcing market in recent years.",
