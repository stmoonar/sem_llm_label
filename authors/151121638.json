            "abstract": "Given a node-attributed graph, and a graph task (link prediction or node classification), can we tell if a graph neural network (GNN) will perform well? More specifically, do the graph structure and the node features carry enough usable information for the task? Our goals are (1) to develop a fast tool to measure how much information is in the graph structure and in the node features, and (2) to exploit the information to solve the task, if there is enough. We propose NetInfoF, a framework including NetInfoF_Probe and NetInfoF_Act, for the measurement and the exploitation of network usable information (NUI), respectively. Given a graph data, NetInfoF_Probe measures NUI without any model training, and NetInfoF_Act solves link prediction and node classification, while two modules share the same backbone. In summary, NetInfoF has following notable advantages: (a) General, handling both link prediction and node classification; (b) Principled, with theoretical guarantee and closed-form solution; (c) Effective, thanks to the proposed adjustment to node similarity; (d) Scalable, scaling linearly with the input size. In our carefully designed synthetic datasets, NetInfoF correctly identifies the ground truth of NUI and is the only method being robust to all graph scenarios. Applied on real-world datasets, NetInfoF wins in 11 out of 12 times on link prediction compared to general GNN baselines.",

            "abstract": "Given a million escort advertisements, how can we spot near-duplicates? Such micro-clusters of ads are usually signals of human trafficking (HT). How can we summarize them to convince law enforcement to act? Spotting micro-clusters of near-duplicate documents is useful in multiple, additional settings, including spam-bot detection in Twitter ads, plagiarism, and more. We present InfoShield, which makes the following contributions: practical, being scalable and effective on real data; parameter-free and principled, requiring no user-defined parameters; interpretable, finding a document to be the cluster representative, highlighting all the common phrases, and automatically detecting \u201cslots\u201d (i.e., phrases that differ in every document); and generalizable, beating or matching domain-specific methods in Twitter bot detection and HT detection, respectively, as well as being language independent. Interpretability is particularly important for the anti-HT domain, where law enforcement must visually inspect ads. Our experiments on real data show that InfoShield correctly identifies Twitter bots with an F1 score over 90% and detects HT ads with 84% precision. Moreover, it is scalable, requiring about 8 hours for 4 million documents on a stock laptop. Our incremental version, DeltaShield, allows for fast, incremental updates, with minor loss of accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Given a large graph with few node labels, how can we (a) identify the mixed network-effect of the graph and (b) predict the unknown labels accurately and efficiently? This work proposes Network Effect Analysis (NEA) and U LTRA P ROP , which are based on two insights: (a) the network-effect (NE) insight: a graph can exhibit not only one of homophily and heterophily, but also both or none in a label-wise manner, and (b) the neighbor-differentiation (ND) insight: neighbors have different degrees of influence on the target node based on the strength of connections. NEA provides a statistical test to check whether a graph exhibits network-effect or not, and surprisingly discovers the absence of NE in many real-world graphs known to have heterophily. U LTRA P ROP solves the node classification problem with notable advantages: (a) Accurate , thanks to the network-effect (NE) and neighbor-differentiation (ND) insights; (b) Explainable , precisely estimating the compatibility matrix; (c) Scalable , being linear with the input size and handling graphs with millions of nodes; and (d) Principled , with closed-form formula and theoretical guarantee. Applied on eight real-world graph datasets, U LTRA P ROP outperforms top competitors in terms of accuracy and run time, requiring only stock CPU servers. On a large real-world graph with 1 . 6 M nodes and 22 . 3 M edges , U LTRA P ROP achieves \u2265 9 \u00d7 speedup (12 minutes vs. 2 hours) compared to most competitors.",

            "abstract": "How can we solve semi-supervised node classification in various graphs possibly with noisy features and structures? Graph neural networks (GNNs) have succeeded in many graph mining tasks, but their generalizability to various graph scenarios is limited due to the difficulty of training, hyperparameter tuning, and the selection of a model itself. Einstein said that we should\"make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.\"We rephrase it into the careful simplicity principle: a carefully-designed simple model can surpass sophisticated ones in real-world graphs. Based on the principle, we propose SlimG for semi-supervised node classification, which exhibits four desirable properties: It is (a) accurate, winning or tying on 10 out of 13 real-world datasets; (b) robust, being the only one that handles all scenarios of graph data (homophily, heterophily, random structure, noisy features, etc.); (c) fast and scalable, showing up to 18 times faster training in million-scale graphs; and (d) interpretable, thanks to the linearity and sparsity. We explain the success of SlimG through a systematic study of the designs of existing GNNs, sanity checks, and comprehensive ablation studies.",

This task is complex as it requires finding patterns and linked meta-data across micro-clusters such as the geographical spread of ads, cluster sizes, etc. Additionally, drawing insights from the data is challenging without visualizing these micro-clusters. To address this, in close-collaboration with domain experts, we built VisPaD, a novel interactive way for characterizing and visualizing micro-clusters and their associated meta-data, all in one place. VisPaD helps discover underlying patterns in the data by projecting micro-clusters in a lower dimensional space. It also allows the user to select micro-clusters involved in suspicious patterns and interactively examine them leading to faster detection and identification of trends in the data. A demo of VisPaD is also released1.",

            "abstract": "Law enforcement and domain experts can detect human trafficking (HT) in online escort websites by analyzing suspicious clusters of connected ads. How can we explain clustering results intuitively and interactively, visualizing potential evidence for experts to analyze? We present TrafficVis, the first interface for cluster-level HT detection and labeling. Developed through months of participatory design with domain experts, TrafficVis provides coordinated views in conjunction with carefully chosen backend algorithms to effectively show spatio-temporal and text patterns to a wide variety of anti-HT stakeholders. We build upon state-of-the-art text clustering algorithms by incorporating shared metadata as a signal of connected and possibly suspicious activity, then visualize the results. Domain experts can use TrafficVis to label clusters as HT, or other, suspicious, but non-HT activity such as spam and scam, quickly creating labeled datasets to enable further HT research. Through domain expert feedback and a usage scenario, we demonstrate TRAFFICVIS's efficacy. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with repeated high praises for the usability and explainability of our tool, the latter being vital for indicting possible criminals.",

We provide TgraphSpot, which carefully extracts features that are often related to fraud; and which provides informative, interactive plots that help analysts zoom down to the few strange nodes. We present the architecture and design decisions of TgraphSpot. Thanks to our careful feature-extraction algorithms, it scales linearly, taking 2.5 hours on a stock laptop, to process 29 million phone calls. More importantly, when applied on a real dataset of millions of phone calls, it discovered suspicious nodes; experts confirmed that those nodes are fraudsters that had been undetected so far.",
