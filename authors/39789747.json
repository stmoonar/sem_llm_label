            "abstract": "Recommender systems play a crucial role in addressing the issue of information overload by delivering personalized recommendations to users. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) for recommender systems, capitalizing on advancements in graph representation learning. These GNN-based models primarily focus on analyzing users' positive feedback while overlooking the valuable insights provided by their negative feedback. In this paper, we propose PANE-GNN, an innovative recommendation model that unifies Positive And Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks for recommendation. By incorporating user preferences and dispreferences, our approach enhances the capability of recommender systems to offer personalized suggestions. PANE-GNN first partitions the raw rating graph into two distinct bipartite graphs based on positive and negative feedback. Subsequently, we employ two separate embeddings, the interest embedding and the disinterest embedding, to capture users' likes and dislikes, respectively. To facilitate effective information propagation, we design distinct message-passing mechanisms for positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, we introduce a distortion to the negative graph, which exclusively consists of negative feedback edges, for contrastive training. This distortion plays a crucial role in effectively denoising the negative feedback. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that PANE-GNN surpasses the existing state-of-the-art benchmark methods across four real-world datasets. These datasets include three commonly used recommender system datasets and one open-source short video recommendation dataset.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained great prevalence in tackling various analytical tasks on graph-structured data (i.e., networks). Typical GNNs and their variants adopt a message-passing principle that obtains network representations by the attribute propagates along network topology, which however ignores the rich textual semantics (e.g., local word-sequence) that exist in numerous real-world networks. Existing methods for text-rich networks integrate textual semantics by mainly using internal information such as topics or phrases/words, which often suffer from an inability to comprehensively mine the textual semantics, limiting the reciprocal guidance between network structure and textual semantics. To address these problems, we present a novel text-rich GNN with external knowledge (TeKo), in order to make full use of both structural and textual information within text-rich networks. Specifically, we first present a flexible heterogeneous semantic network that integrates high-quality entities as well as interactions among documents and entities. We then introduce two types of external knowledge, that is, structured triplets and unstructured entity descriptions, to gain a deeper insight into textual semantics. Furthermore, we devise a reciprocal convolutional mechanism for the constructed heterogeneous semantic network, enabling network structure and textual semantics to collaboratively enhance each other and learn high-level network representations. Extensive experiments illustrate that TeKo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of text-rich networks as well as a large-scale e-commerce searching dataset.",

            "abstract": "Key Information Extraction (KIE) is aimed at extracting structured information (e.g. key-value pairs) from form-style documents (e.g. invoices), which makes an important step towards intelligent document understanding. Previous approaches generally tackle KIE by sequence tagging, which faces difficulty to process non-flatten sequences, especially for table-text mixed documents. These approaches also suffer from the trouble of pre-defining a fixed set of labels for each type of documents, as well as the label imbalance issue. In this work, we assume Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been applied to input documents, and reformulate the KIE task as a region prediction problem in the two-dimensional (2D) space given a target field. Following this new setup, we develop a new KIE model named Region-based Document Understanding (RDU) that takes as input the text content and corresponding coordinates of a document, and tries to predict the result by localizing a bounding-box-like region. Our RDU first applies a layout-aware BERT equipped with a soft layout attention masking and bias mechanism to incorporate layout information into the representations. Then, a list of candidate regions is generated from the representations via a Region Proposal Module inspired by computer vision models widely applied for object detection. Finally, a Region Categorization Module and a Region Selection Module are adopted to judge whether a proposed region is valid and select the one with the largest probability from all proposed regions respectively. Experiments on four types of form-style documents show that our proposed method can achieve impressive results. In addition, our RDU model can be trained with different document types seamlessly, which is especially helpful over low-resource documents.",

In this paper, we design an efficient knowledge distillation framework for e-commerce relevance matching to integrate the respective advantages of Transformer-style models and classical relevance matching models.

            "abstract": "Result relevance prediction is an essential task of e-commerce search engines to boost the utility of search engines and ensure smooth user experience. The last few years eyewitnessed a flurry of research on the use of Transformer-style models and deep text-match models to improve relevance. However, these two types of models ignored the inherent bipartite network structures that are ubiquitous in e-commerce search logs, making these models ineffective. We propose in this paper a novel Second-order Relevance, which is fundamentally different from the previous First-order Relevance, to improve result relevance prediction. We design, for the first time, an end-to-end First-and-Second-order Relevance prediction model for e-commerce item relevance. The model is augmented by the neighborhood structures of bipartite networks that are built using the information of user behavioral feedback, including clicks and purchases. To ensure that edges accurately encode relevance information, we introduce external knowledge generated from BERT to refine the network of user behaviors. This allows the new model to integrate information from neighboring items and queries, which are highly relevant to the focus query-item pair under consideration. Results of offline experiments showed that the new model significantly improved the prediction accuracy in terms of human relevance judgment. An ablation study showed that the First-and-Second-order model gained a 4.3% average gain over the First-order model. Results of an online A/B test revealed that the new model derived more commercial benefits compared to the base model.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great power in many network analytical tasks. However, graphs (i.e., networks) in the real world are usually text-rich, implying that valuable semantic information needs to be carefully considered. Existing GNNs for text-rich networks typically treat text as attribute words alone, which inevitably leads to the loss of important semantic structures, limiting the representation capability of GNNs. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end adaptive semantic architecture of graph convolutional networks, namely AS-GCN, which unifies neural topic model and graph convolutional networks, for text-rich network representation. Specifically, we utilize a neural topic model to extract the global topic semantics, and accordingly augment the original text-rich network into a tri-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the local word-sequence semantic structure and the global topic semantic structure from text. We then design an effective semantic-aware propagation of information by introducing a discriminative convolution mechanism. We further propose two strategies, that is, distribution sharing and joint training, to adaptively generate a proper network structure based on the learning objective to improve network representation. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks illustrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant improvement. Meanwhile, this architecture can also be applied to e-commerce search scenes, and experiments on a real e-commerce problem from JD further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture over the baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), aiming to obtain node embeddings by integrating high-order neighborhood information through stacked graph convolution layers, have demonstrated great power in many network analysis tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, a fundamental weakness of GCNs, that is, topological limitations, including over-smoothing and local homophily of topology, limits their ability to represent networks. Existing studies for solving these topological limitations typically focus only on the convolution of features on network topology, which inevitably relies heavily on network structure. Moreover, most networks are text-rich, so it is important to integrate not only document-level information, but also the local text information which is particularly significant while often ignored by the existing methods. To solve these limitations, we propose BiTe-GCN, a novel GCN architecture modeling via bidirectional convolution of topology and features on text-rich networks. Specifically, we first transform the original text-rich network into an augmented bi-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the global document-level information and the local text-sequence information from texts. We then introduce discriminative convolution mechanisms, which performs convolution on this augmented bi-typed network, realizing the convolutions of topology and features altogether in the same system, and learning different contributions of these two parts (i.e., network part and text part), automatically for the given learning objectives. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks demonstrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a breakout improvement. Moreover, this architecture can also be applied to several e-commerce search scenes such as JD searching, and experiments on JD dataset show the superiority of the proposed architecture over the related methods.",

            "abstract": "Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.",

            "abstract": "Network embedding (NE), aiming to embed a network into a low dimensional latent representation while preserving the inherent structural properties of the network, has attracted considerable attention recently. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been widely studied for NE. Existing VAE based methods let the network follow a unimodal distribution, that is, they typically use some fixed distribution as the prior, e.g. Gaussian distribution. However, in reality networks often contain many complicated structural properties [5], [6] (such as the first/second order proximity, the motif or community structures, power-law, etc). The latent representation from unimodal and fixed distribution is not capable of describing such multi-modal characteristic of networks. To address this issue, we develop a new VAE method for NE, named Normalizing Flow Variational Graph Autoencoder (NF-VGA). We design a prior-generative module based on normalizing flows to generate flexible, multi-modal distribution as the prior of the latent representation. To make the generated prior better describe the coupling relationship between nodes, we further utilize network local structures to guide the prior generation. Extensive experiments on some real-world networks show a superior performance of the new approach over some state-of-the-art methods on some popular network embedding tasks.",

Among the existing approaches are the latest methods based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and on statistical modeling of Markov Random Fields (MRF).

Our new method takes advantage of salient features of GNN and MRF and exploits both network topology and node semantic information in a complete end-to-end deep network architecture.
