            "abstract": "We describe our approach and experiments to tackle Task A of the second edition of HaSpeeDe, within the Evalita 2020 evaluation campaign. The proposed model consists in an ensemble of classifiers built from three variants of a common neural architecture. Each classifier uses contextual representations from transformers trained on Italian texts, fine tuned on the training set of the challenge. We tested the proposed model on the two official test sets, the in-domain test set containing just tweets and the out-of-domain one including also news headlines. Our submissions ranked 4th on the tweets test set and 17th on the second test set.",

Container technology allows to further lower the overhead of virtualization making it possible to run more components per server. Designing and deploying a cloud platform requires significant effort and it should be possibly dealt with automation tools. Automation can be dealt through either an imperative or declarative approach. We present how we designed and deployed a cloud container platform using declarative modeling. A model of the architecture of the service is described through a declarative specification and then passed to an orchestration tool that generates the actual plan of steps to be performed in the deployment.",

            "abstract": "The paper illustrates how we built a federated cloud computing platform dedicated to the Italian research community. Building a cloud platform is a daunting task, that requires coordinating the deployment of many services, interrelated and dependent on each other. Provisioning, servicing and maintaining the platform must be automated. For our deployment, we chose a declarative modeling tool, that allows describing the parts that compose the system and their relations of supplier/consumer of specific interfaces. The tool arranges the steps to bring the deployment to convergence by transforming the state of the system until it reaches a configuration that satisfies all constraints. We chose a declarative service modeling approach for orchestrating both the deployment of the platform by the administrators and the deployment of applications by users. The cloud platform has been designed so that it can be managed by this kind of automation, facilitating the deployment of federated regions by anyone wishing to join and to contribute resources to the federation. Federated resources are integrated into a single cloud platform available to any user of the federation. The federation can also seamlessly include public clouds. We describe the architectural choices, how we adapted the OpenStack basic facilities to the needs of a federation of multiple independent organizations, how we control resource allocation according to committed plans and correspondingly how we handle accounting and billing of resource usage. Besides providing traditional IaaS services, the cloud supports self-service deployment of cloud applications. The cloud thus addresses the long tail of science, allowing researchers of any discipline, without expertise in system or cloud administration, to deploy applications readily available for their perusal.",

The strategies for upgrading TANL to the use of Universal Dependencies range from a minimalistic approach consisting of introducing pre/post-processing steps into the native pipeline to revising the whole pipeline. We explore the issue in the context of the Italian Treebank, considering both the efforts involved, how to avoid losing linguistically relevant information and the loss of accuracy in the process. In particular we compare different strategies for parsing and discuss the implications of simplifying the pipeline when detailed part-of-speech and morphological annotations are not available, as it is the case for less resourceful languages. The experiments are relative to the Italian linguistic pipeline, but the use of different parsers in our evaluations and the avoidance of language specific tagging make the results general enough to be useful in helping the transition to UD for other languages.",
