While there are potentially many aspects to consider when optimizing such queries, we focus on three aspects: cardinality estimation, locality awareness, and data fragmentation.

Hence, in this paper, we propose StarBench, a benchmark for testing SPARQL-star support and runtime performance. We ran StarBench on a number of state-of-the-art triplestores with RDF-star and SPARQL-star support and share our findings.

            "abstract": "One of the major obstacles that currently prevents the Semantic Web from exploiting its full potential is that the data it provides access to is sometimes not available or outdated. The reason is rooted deep within its architecture that relies on data providers to keep the data available, queryable, and up-to-date at all times \u2013 an expectation that many data providers in reality cannot live up to for an extended (or infinite) period of time. Hence, decentralized architectures have recently been proposed that use replication to keep the data available in case the data provider fails. Although this increases availability, it does not help keeping the data up-to-date or allow users to query and access previous versions of a dataset. In this paper, we therefore propose ColChain (COLlaborative knowledge CHAINs), a novel decentralized architecture based on blockchains that not only lowers the burden for the data providers but at the same time also allows users to propose updates to faulty or outdated data, trace updates back to their origin, and query older versions of the data. Our extensive experiments show that ColChain reaches these goals while achieving query processing performance comparable to the state of the art.",

            "abstract": "SPARQL query services that balance processing between clients and servers become more and more essential to handle the increasing load for open and decentralized knowledge graphs on the Web. To this end, Linked Data Fragments (LDF) have introduced a foundational framework that has sparked research exploring a spectrum of potential Web querying interfaces in between server-side query processing via SPARQL endpoints and client-side query processing of data dumps. Current proposals in between typically suffer from imbalanced load on either the client or the server. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first work that combines both client-side and server-side query optimization techniques in a truly dynamic fashion: we introduce WiseKG, a system that employs a cost model that dynamically delegates the load between servers and clients by combining client-side processing of shipped partitions with efficient server-side processing of star-shaped sub-queries, based on current server workload and client capabilities. Our experiments show that WiseKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of average total query execution time per client, while at the same time decreasing network traffic and increasing server-side availability.",

            "abstract": "The Semantic Web offers access to a vast Web of interlinked information accessible via SPARQL endpoints. Such endpoints offer a well-defined interface to retrieve results for complex SPARQL queries. The computational load for processing such queries, however, lies entirely with the server hosting the SPARQL endpoint, which can easily become overloaded and in the worst case not only become slow in responding but even crash so that the data becomes temporarily unavailable. Recently proposed interfaces, such as Triple Pattern Fragments, have therefore shifted the query processing load from the server to the client. For queries involving triple patterns with low selectivity, this can easily result in high network traffic and slow execution times. In this paper, we therefore present a novel interface, Star Pattern Fragments (SPF), which decomposes SPARQL queries into star-shaped subqueries and can combine a lower network load with a higher query throughput and a comparatively low server load. Our experimental results show that our approach does not only significantly reduce network traffic but is also at least an order of magnitude faster in comparison to the state-of-the-art interfaces under high query processing load.",

To close this gap of functionality, we present J\n edi\n , a system that extends a popular SPARQL engine, Jena, with the ability to compute paths connecting entities in a KG. J\n edi\n shows the\n k\n most relevant results to the user where relevance is assessed as a trade-off between path length and diversification of the intermediate nodes in the path. Furthermore, our solution is not limited to a single property path pattern but supports queries containing multiple property path patterns.

            "abstract": ". Since the proposal of RDF as a standard for representing statements about entities, diverse interfaces to publish and strategies to query RDF data have been proposed. Although some recent proposals are aware of the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art approaches, no work has yet tried to integrate them into a hybrid system that exploits their, in many cases, complementary strengths to process queries more e\ufb03ciently than each of these approaches could do individually. In this paper, we present hybridSE , an approach that exploits the diverse characteristics of queryable RDF interfaces to e\ufb03ciently process SPARQL queries. We present a brief study of the characteristics of some of the most popular RDF interfaces (brTPF and SPARQL endpoints), a method to estimate the impact of using a particular interface on query evaluation, and a method to use multiple interfaces to e\ufb03ciently process a query. Our experiments, using a well-known benchmark dataset and a large number of queries, with result sizes varying from 1 up to 1 million, show that hybridSE processes queries up to three orders of magnitude faster and transfers up to four orders of magnitude less data.",
