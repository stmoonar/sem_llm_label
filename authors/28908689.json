            "abstract": "The previously introduced Modular Ontology Modeling methodology (MOMo) attempts to mimic the human analogical process by using modular patterns to assemble more complex concepts. To support this, MOMo organizes organizes ontology design patterns into design libraries, which are programmatically queryable, to support accelerated ontology development, for both human and automated processes. However, a major bottleneck to large-scale deployment of MOMo is the (to-date) limited availability of ready-to-use ontology design patterns. At the same time, Large Language Models have quickly become a source of common knowledge and, in some cases, replacing search engines for questions. In this paper, we thus present a collection of 104 ontology design patterns representing often occurring nouns, curated from the common-sense knowledge available in LLMs, organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library ready for use with MOMo.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we propose a sustainable path-finding application for grain transportation during the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine. This application is to build a suite of algorithms to find possible optimal paths for transporting grain that remains in Ukraine. The application uses the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology(KNARM) and the KnowWhereGraph to achieve this goal. Currently, we are working towards creating an ontology that will allow for a more effective heuristic approach by incorporating the lessons learned from the KnowWhereGraph. The aim is to enhance the path-finding process and provide more accurate and efficient results. In the future, we will continue exploring and implementing new techniques that can further improve the sustainability of the path-finding applications with a knowledge graph backend for grain transportation through hazardous and adversarial environments. The code is available upon reviewer\u2019s request. It can not be made public due to the sensitive nature of the data.",

            "abstract": "Disaster risk properties (or disaster variables) such as intensity, exposure, severity, vulnerability, resilience, and capacity are significant because they provide essential information for understanding and managing disaster risk and cascading effects. While there are an increasing number of datasets that record these properties based on different criteria, such as regional levels (e.g., community resilience at counties vs. census tracts), thematic levels (e.g., social vulnerability based on race vs. socioeconomic status), or even for different hazard types (e.g., disaster risk for earthquakes vs. hurricanes), we lack a formal model that captures the semantics of these properties, i.e., their interactions with one another, and their context. Context is described through relations that constrain each property specific to an entity or as a property of an entity with respect to another entity. For example, intensity is exclusively the property of a disaster event, whereas vulnerability is a property of an element-at-risk concerning a specific hazard type. Here, we propose the Disaster Properties Ontology (DPO) that formalizes seven core properties in the disaster domain. It is built by re-using existing standard ontologies such as OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL, SOSA, and PROV-O. Additionally, DPO is developed as a sub-module of a more comprehensive Disaster Management reference Domain Ontology (DMDO).",

Its authoritative version is given as an XML schema based on an XML mindset which means that it has significant limitations for use in a knowledge graphs context. We have therefore developed the Modular MODS Ontology (MMODS-O) which incorporates all elements and attributes of the MODS XML schema. In designing the ontology, we adopt the recent Modular Ontology Design Methodology (MOMo) with the intention to strike a balance between modularity and quality ontology design on the one hand, and conservative backward compatibility with MODS on the other.",

            "abstract": "It is crucial for emergency management organizations to have rapid access to relevant experts who can advise and assist following a disaster. To improve expert-mining and recommendation capabilities, creating a knowledge graph that links experts to their corresponding topics of expertise and other sources of relevant information is a natural choice to capture an integrated network of people and a rich taxonomy of expertise. In this paper, we present an ontology for modeling experts, their expertise topics and relations between them, and their spatiotemporal scoping. We go on to discuss the primary conceptual components and how they can be instantiated, then present overarching examples related to emergency management operations. The ontology synthesizes three different ways to characterize an expert, based on a) identifiable academic expertise; b) voluntary engagements, work-related responsibilities or experience; and c) organization specializations or affiliations.",

            "abstract": "Reusing ontologies for new purposes, or adapting them to new use-cases, is frequently difficult. In our experiences, we have found this to be the case for several reasons: (i) differing representational granularity in ontologies and in use-cases, (ii)\u00a0lacking conceptual clarity in potentially reusable ontologies, (iii) lack and difficulty of adherence to good modeling principles, and (iv) a lack of reuse emphasis and process support available in ontology engineering tooling. In order to address these concerns, we have developed the Modular Ontology Modeling (MOMo) methodology, and its supporting tooling infrastructure, CoModIDE (the Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE \u2013 \u201ccommodity\u201d). MOMo builds on the established eXtreme Design methodology, and like it emphasizes modular development and design pattern reuse; but crucially adds the extensive use of graphical schema diagrams, and tooling that support them, as vehicles for knowledge elicitation from experts. In this paper, we present the MOMo workflow in detail, and describe several useful resources for executing it. In particular, we provide a thorough and rigorous evaluation of CoModIDE in its role of supporting the MOMo methodology\u2019s graphical modeling paradigm. We find that CoModIDE significantly improves approachability of such a paradigm, and that it displays a high usability.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

For data integration and interoperability needs within Knowledge Graphs (KGs), these taxonomies must be translated into formal ontologies. In this paper we present an ontology design pattern for modeling a scientific taxonomy as an ontology. The focus of the pattern is to 1) capture temporal dynamics of concepts as taxonomies evolve, 2) model the provenance of concepts to add context and enable governance, 3) assist the translation of taxonomic relations to ontological relations appropriately that will empower their use within KGs, and 4) tag provenance and other metadata information to mappings or alignments of uncertainty between concepts in different ontologies.",
