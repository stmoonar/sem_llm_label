            "title": "Welcome to Big AI",
            "abstract": "My college office in Oxford overlooks a narrow, ancient street called New College Lane; directly opposite my office window is a handsome 17th-century house that was the home of Edmond Halley\u2014he of the comet fame\u2014who became Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford in 1703. On top of the house is an odd shed-like structure: it was Halley's observatory. It serves as a daily reminder to me that, 300 years ago, world-changing science could be done in your own home, with facilities no fancier than a garden shed. Fast forward to April 2019, and the first-ever pictures of a black hole, which made front-page headlines across the globe. The Event Horizon Telescope that generated the astonishing images is as far from Halley's modest observatory as one could imagine: a global network of radio telescopes, in a collaboration involving 13 core partners and dozens of affiliates\u2014supported by a lot of very advanced computer technology, and a big budget. You can still discover a comet from your garden shed, but for the most part, astronomy today is Big Science.",

            "abstract": "In the first two parts of this short series, we learned how mechanism design can be used in theory to engineer systems that achieve desirable properties by anticipating how rational agents will act, and then designing the rules accordingly. In particular, we focused on the Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves (VCG) mechanism that results in a welfare maximizing outcome by incentivizing agents to tell the truth about how much they prefer each outcome. Now, let's explore how the VCG mechanisms may be used to solve real-world problems.",

            "title": "Ten Years after ImageNet: A 360{\\deg} Perspective on AI",
            "abstract": "It is ten years since neural networks made their spectacular comeback. Prompted by this anniversary, we take a holistic perspective on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Supervised Learning for cognitive tasks is effectively solved - provided we have enough high-quality labeled data. However, deep neural network models are not easily interpretable, and thus the debate between blackbox and whitebox modeling has come to the fore. The rise of attention networks, self-supervised learning, generative modeling, and graph neural networks has widened the application space of AI. Deep Learning has also propelled the return of reinforcement learning as a core building block of autonomous decision making systems. The possible harms made possible by new AI technologies have raised socio-technical issues such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. The dominance of AI by Big-Tech who control talent, computing resources, and most importantly, data may lead to an extreme AI divide. Failure to meet high expectations in high profile, and much heralded flagship projects like self-driving vehicles could trigger another AI winter.",
