            "abstract": "Chronic disease management and follow-up are vital for realizing sustained patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Recent advancements in wearable sensing technologies, particularly wrist-worn devices, offer promising solutions for longitudinal patient follow-up by shifting from subjective, intermittent self-reporting to objective, continuous monitoring. However, collecting and analyzing wearable data presents unique challenges, such as data entry errors, non-wear periods, missing wearable data, and wearable artifacts. We therefore present an in-depth exploration of data analysis challenges tied to wrist-worn wearables and ambulatory label acquisition, using two real-world datasets (i.e., mBrain21 and ETRI lifelog2020). We introduce novel practical countermeasures, including participant compliance visualizations, interaction-triggered questionnaires to assess personal bias, and an optimized wearable non-wear detection pipeline. Further, we propose a visual analytics approach to validate processing pipelines using scalable tools such as tsflex and Plotly-Resampler. Lastly, we investigate the impact of missing wearable data on\"window-of-interest\"analysis methodologies. Prioritizing transparency and reproducibility, we offer open access to our detailed code examples, facilitating adaptation in future wearable research. In conclusion, our contributions provide actionable approaches for wearable data collection and analysis in chronic disease management.",

            "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) algorithms today are designed and evaluated on data collected in controlled settings, providing limited insights into their performance in real-world situations with noisy and missing sensor data and natural human activities. We present a real-world HAR open dataset compiled from a wristband equipped with a triaxial accelerometer. During data collection, participants had autonomy in their daily life activities, and the process remained unobserved and uncontrolled. A general convolutional neural network model was trained on this dataset, achieving a mean balanced accuracy (MBA) of 80%. Personalizing the general model through transfer learning can yield comparable and even superior results using fewer data, with the MBA improving to 85%. To emphasize the issue of insufficient real-world training data, we conducted training of the model using the public MHEALTH dataset, resulting in 100% MBA. However, upon evaluating the MHEALTH-trained model on our real-world dataset, the MBA drops to 62%. After personalizing the model with real-world data, an improvement of 17% in the MBA is achieved. This paper showcases the potential of transfer learning to make HAR models trained in different contexts (lab vs. real-world) and on different participants perform well for new individuals with limited real-world labeled data available.",

            "abstract": "Headache disorders are experienced by many people around the world. In current clinical practice, the follow-up and diagnosis of headache disorder patients only happens intermittently, based on subjective data self-reported by the patient. The mBrain system tries to make this process more continuous, autonomous and objective by additionally collecting contextual and physiological data via a wearable, mobile app and machine learning algorithms. To support the monitoring of headache symptoms during attacks for headache classification and the detection of headache triggers, much knowledge and contextual data is available from heterogeneous sources, which can be consolidated with semantics. This paper presents a demonstrator of knowledge-driven services that perform these tasks using Semantic Web technologies. These services are deployed in a distributed cascading architecture that includes DIVIDE to derive and manage the RDF stream processing queries that perform the contextually relevant filtering in an intelligent and efficient way.",

            "abstract": "In healthcare, the aging of the population is resulting in a gradual shift from residential care to home care, requiring reliable follow-up of elderly people by a whole network of care providers. The environment of these patients is increasingly being equipped with different monitoring devices, which allow to obtain insight into the current condition of patient & environment. However, current monitoring platforms that support care providers are centralized and not personalized, reducing performance, scalability, autonomy and privacy. Because the available data is only exposed through custom APIs, profile knowledge cannot be efficiently exchanged, which is required to provide optimal care. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed data-driven platform, built on Semantic Web technologies, that enables the integration of all profile knowledge in order to deliver personalized continuous home care. It provides a distributed smart monitoring service, which allows to locally monitor only the relevant sensors according to the patient\u2019s profile, and infer personalized decisions when analyzing events. Moreover, it provides a medical treatment planning service, which composes treatment plans tailored to each patient, including personalized quality of service parameters allowing a doctor to select the optimal plan. To illustrate how the platform delivers these services, the paper also presents a demonstrator using a realistic home care scenario.",

            "abstract": ", Abstract In the Internet of Things, it is a challenging task to integrate & analyze high velocity sensor data with domain knowledge & context information in real-time. Semantic IoT platforms typically consist of stream processing components that use Semantic Web technologies to run a set of \ufb01xed queries processing the IoT data streams. Con\ufb01gur-ing these queries is still a manual task. To deal with changes in context information, which happen regularly in IoT domains, queries typically require reasoning on all sensor data in real-time to derive relevant sensors & events. This can be an issue in real-time, as expressive reasoning is required to deal with the complexity of many IoT domains. To solve these issues, this paper presents DIVIDE. DIVIDE automatically derives queries for stream processing components in an adaptive, context-aware way. When the context changes, it derives through reasoning which sensors & observations to \ufb01lter, given the context & a use case goal, without requiring any more reasoning in real-time. This paper presents the details of DIVIDE, and performs evaluations on a healthcare example showing how it can reduce real-time processing times, scale better when there are more sensors & observations, and can run e\ufb03ciently on low-end devices.",

Semantic Web technologies enable intelligent consolidation of all available context and sensor data. Stream reasoning techniques allow to perform advanced processing tasks by correlating the consolidated data to enable personalized and context-aware real-time feedback. In this paper, these technologies are leveraged and evaluated to design a Proof-of-Concept application of a personalized real-time feedback platform for amateur cyclists. Real-time feedback about the user's heart rate and heart rate training zones is given through a web application. The performance and scalability of the platform is evaluated on a Raspberry Pi.

            "title": "Towards a Cascading Reasoning Framework to Support Responsive Ambient-Intelligent Healthcare Interventions",
            "abstract": "In hospitals and smart nursing homes, ambient-intelligent care rooms are equipped with many sensors. They can monitor environmental and body parameters, and detect wearable devices of patients and nurses. Hence, they continuously produce data streams. This offers the opportunity to collect, integrate and interpret this data in a context-aware manner, with a focus on reactivity and autonomy. However, doing this in real time on huge data streams is a challenging task. In this context, cascading reasoning is an emerging research approach that exploits the trade-off between reasoning complexity and data velocity by constructing a processing hierarchy of reasoners. Therefore, a cascading reasoning framework is proposed in this paper. A generic architecture is presented allowing to create a pipeline of reasoning components hosted locally, in the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The architecture is implemented on a pervasive health use case, where medically diagnosed patients are constantly monitored, and alarming situations can be detected and reacted upon in a context-aware manner. A performance evaluation shows that the total system latency is mostly lower than 5 s, allowing for responsive intervention by a nurse in alarming situations. Using the evaluation results, the benefits of cascading reasoning for healthcare are analyzed.",
