            "title": "Offline Policy Evaluation in Large Action Spaces via Outcome-Oriented Action Grouping",
            "abstract": "Offline policy evaluation (OPE) aims to accurately estimate the performance of a hypothetical policy using only historical data, which has drawn increasing attention in a wide range of applications including recommender systems and personalized medicine. With the presence of rising granularity of consumer data, many industries started exploring larger action candidate spaces to support more precise personalized action. While inverse propensity score (IPS) is a standard OPE estimator, it suffers from more severe variance issues with increasing action spaces. To address this issue, we theoretically prove that the estimation variance can be reduced by merging actions into groups while the distinction among these action effects on the outcome can induce extra bias. Motivated by these, we propose a novel IPS estimator with outcome-oriented action Grouping (GroupIPS), which leverages a Lipschitz regularized network to measure the distance of action effects in the embedding space and merges nearest action neighbors. This strategy enables more robust estimation by achieving smaller variances while inducing minor additional bias. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

            "title": "Syncretic-NMS: A Merging Non-Maximum Suppression Algorithm for Instance Segmentation",
            "abstract": "Instance segmentation is typically based on an object detection framework. Semantic segmentation is conducted on the bounding boxes that are returned by detectors. NMS (non-maximum suppression) is a common post-processing operation in instance segmentation and object detection tasks. It is typically used after bounding box regression to eliminate redundant bounding boxes. The evaluation criteria for object detection require that the bounding box be as close as possible to the ground truth, but they do not emphasize the integrity of the included object. However, sometimes the bounding boxes cannot contain the complete objects, and the parts beyond the bounding boxes cannot be correctly predicted in the subsequent semantic segmentation. To solve this problem, we propose the Syncretic-NMS algorithm. The algorithm takes traditional NMS as the first step and processes the bounding boxes obtained by traditional NMS, judges the neighboring bounding boxes of each bounding box, and combines the neighboring boxes that are strongly correlated with the corresponding bounding boxes. The coordinates of the merged box are the four coordinate extremes of the bounding box and the highly relevant neighboring box. The neighboring box with strong correlation is merged with the corresponding bounding box. Based on an analysis of the influences of corresponding factors, the criteria for correlation judgment are specified. Experimental results on the MS COCO dataset demonstrate that Syncretic-NMS can steadily increase the accuracy of instance segmentation, while experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset prove that the algorithm can adapt to application scenario changes. The computational complexity of Syncretic-NMS is the same as that of traditional NMS. Syncretic-NMS is easy to implement, requires no additional training, and can be easily integrated into the available instance segmentation framework.",

            "title": "Robust Visual Tracking With Occlusion Judgment and Re-Detection",
            "abstract": "A detection algorithm is often used to remedy tracking failures in a typical single-target visual tracking algorithm. In practice, when a target is occluded for a long time, neither the tracking module nor the detection module can accurately predict the position of the target. To accurately locate the target, we first introduce the $\\ell _{1}\\ell _{2}$ loss function to reduce the sensitivity of correlation filter-based method to local occlusion. To solve the instability of algorithms based on the single feature in complex scene, we use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features and color names (CN) features to train a filter respectively, and the fusion weights are calculated according to the difference between the response value of each filter and the expected response value. At the same time, we adaptively update the model online by calculating the sensitivity of different filters. We follow the re-detection idea in long-term tracking, the peak to sidelobe ratio (PSR) is used to judge the serious occlusion, and we use support vector machine (SVM) for re-detection after severe occlusion or target out-of-view. In this paper, 34 sets of sequences are selected to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The sufficient experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has strong anti-occlusion ability and robustness performance. We compare our proposal with several state-of-the-art algorithms under all the sequences of OTB100, and our algorithm yields highly competitive performance for tracking.",
