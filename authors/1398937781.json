            "abstract": "Internet users constantly make searches to find objects or results of their interest, generally through terms or phrases. Traditional search offers only solutions that take into account just the individual characteristics of the results, and not the relations they have with the rest of the universe. Typically, we are given an ordered list of the results related to the search criterion, which implies the need of changing several times the terms of the query to get to a solution that is more adequate to the intended search goal. As a solution to this problem, Composite Retrieval proposes that the results to a query may be grouped in sets of items (bundles), related through some similarity criterion, but at the same time are complementary. In this work we propose heuristic algorithms for Composite Retrieval which are evaluated experimentally, showing performance improvements over the previous results presented in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Users are often faced with the problem of finding complementary items that together achieve a single common goal (e.g., a starter kit for a novice astronomer, a collection of question/answers related to low-carb nutrition, a set of places to visit on holidays). In this paper, we argue that for some application scenarios returning item bundles is more appropriate than ranked lists. Thus we define composite retrieval as the problem of finding k bundles of complementary items. Beyond complementarity of items, the bundles must be valid w.r.t. a given budget, and the answer set of k bundles must exhibit diversity. We formally define the problem and show that in its general form is NP-hard and that also the special cases in which each bundle is formed by only one item, or only one bundle is sought, are hard. Our characterization however suggests how to adopt a two-phase approach (Produce-and-Choose, or PAC) in which we first produce many valid bundles, and then we choose k among them. For the first phase we devise two ad-hoc clustering algorithms, while for the second phase we adapt heuristics with approximation guarantees for a related problem. We also devise another approach which is based on first finding a k-clustering and then selecting a valid bundle from each of the produced clusters (Cluster-and-Pick, or CAP). We compare experimentally the proposed methods on two real-world data sets: the first data set is given by a sample of touristic attractions in 10 large European cities, while the second is a large database of user-generated restaurant reviews from Yahoo! Local. Our experiments show that when diversity is highly important, CAP is the best option, while when diversity is less important, a PAC approach constructing bundles around randomly chosen pivots, is better.",

            "abstract": "Online search has become a daily activity and a source of a variety of valuable information, from the finest granularity such as finding the address of a specific restaurant, to more complex tasks like looking for accessories compatible with an iPhone or planning a trip. The latter typically involves running multiple search queries to gather information about different places, reading online reviews to find out about hotels, and checking geographic proximity of places to visit. We refer to this information seeking activity as composite retrieval and propose to organize results into item bundles that together constitute an improved exploratory experience over ranked lists. As a first step towards composite retrieval definition, we need to formalize intuitive desirable properties of item bundles. We distinguish between properties of each bundle in the answer and properties of the answer as a whole. Consider the case of a user selecting the restaurants to try during a visit to a new city. The user has a limited budget which might be either financial, or simply the number of nights spent in the city. The user prefers suggested restaurants to serve different cuisines. The validity of a bundle of restaurants is given by the budget constraint and the complementarity of the restaurants in the bundle w.r.t. the cuisine they serve. Other restaurant attributes could be used for defining valid bundles. For example, instead of cuisines, different dress codes could be required to every restaurant in a single bundle. Moreover, in order to provide meaningful bundles, restaurants forming each bundle must be compatible, e.g., close geographically, or liked by similar reviewers. The degree of compatibility of the items forming a bundle defines the quality of the bundle. Intuitively, in the case geographic distance is used, the closer restaurants are from each other, the higher the quality of the bundle they belong to. Similarly, when common reviewers are used as the",

            "abstract": "During the past few years, there has been a trend to enrich traditional revenue management models built upon the independent demand paradigm by accounting for customer choice behavior. This extension involves both modeling and computational challenges. One way to describe choice behavior is to assume that each customer belongs to a segment, which is characterized by a consideration set, i.e., a subset of the products provided by the firm that a customer views as options. Customers choose a particular product according to a multinomial-logit criterion, a model widely used in the marketing literature. \n \nIn this paper, we consider the choice-based, deterministic, linear programming model (CDLP) of Gallego et al. (2004) [Gallego, G., G. Iyengar, R. Phillips, A. Dubey. 2004. Managing flexible products on a network. Technical Report CORC TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York], and the follow-up dynamic programming decomposition heuristic of van Ryzin and Liu (2008) [van Ryzin, G. J., Q. Liu. 2008. On the choice-based linear programming model for network revenue management. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management10(2) 288--310]. We focus on the more general version of these models, where customers belong to overlapping segments. To solve the CDLP for real-size networks, we need to develop a column generation algorithm. We prove that the associated column generation subproblem is indeed NP-hard and propose a simple, greedy heuristic to overcome the complexity of an exact algorithm. Our computational results show that the heuristic is quite effective and that the overall approach leads to high-quality, practical solutions.",
