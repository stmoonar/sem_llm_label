            "abstract": "Given a million escort advertisements, how can we spot near-duplicates? Such micro-clusters of ads are usually signals of human trafficking (HT). How can we summarize them to convince law enforcement to act? Spotting micro-clusters of near-duplicate documents is useful in multiple, additional settings, including spam-bot detection in Twitter ads, plagiarism, and more. We present InfoShield, which makes the following contributions: practical, being scalable and effective on real data; parameter-free and principled, requiring no user-defined parameters; interpretable, finding a document to be the cluster representative, highlighting all the common phrases, and automatically detecting \u201cslots\u201d (i.e., phrases that differ in every document); and generalizable, beating or matching domain-specific methods in Twitter bot detection and HT detection, respectively, as well as being language independent. Interpretability is particularly important for the anti-HT domain, where law enforcement must visually inspect ads. Our experiments on real data show that InfoShield correctly identifies Twitter bots with an F1 score over 90% and detects HT ads with 84% precision. Moreover, it is scalable, requiring about 8 hours for 4 million documents on a stock laptop. Our incremental version, DeltaShield, allows for fast, incremental updates, with minor loss of accuracy.",

These platforms are easy to manipulate for the purpose of distorting information space to confuse and distract voters. Past works to identify disruptive patterns are mostly focused on analyzing the content of tweets. In this study, we jointly embed the information from both user posted content as well as a user's follower network, to detect groups of densely connected users in an unsupervised fashion. We then investigate these dense sub-blocks of users to flag anomalous behavior. In our experiments, we study the tweets related to the upcoming 2019 Canadian Elections, and observe a set of densely-connected users engaging in local politics in different provinces, and exhibiting troll-like behavior.",

            "abstract": "Social media sites are becoming a key factor in politics. These platforms are easy to manipulate for the purpose of distorting information space to confuse and distract voters. It is of paramount importance for social media platforms, users engaged with online political discussions, as well as government agencies to understand the dynamics on social media, and identify malicious groups engaging in misinformation campaigns and thus polluting the general discourse around a topic of interest. Past works to identify such disruptive patterns are mostly focused on analyzing user-generated content such as tweets. In this study, we take a holistic approach and propose SGP to provide an informative birds eye view of all the activities in these social media sites around a broad topic and detect coordinated groups suspicious of engaging in misinformation campaigns. To show the effectiveness of SGP, we deploy it to provide a concise overview of polluting activity on Twitter around the upcoming 2019 Canadian Federal Elections, by analyzing over 60 thousand user accounts connected through 3.4 million connections and 1.3 million hashtags. Users in the polluting groups detected by SGP-flag are over 4x more likely to become suspended while majority of these highly suspicious users detected by SGP-flag escaped Twitter's suspending algorithm. Moreover, while few of the polluting hashtags detected are linked to misinformation campaigns, SGP-sig also flags others that have not been picked up on. More importantly, we also show that a large coordinated set of right-winged conservative groups based in the US are heavily engaged in Canadian politics.",

The resulting algorithms are based on layered tree tensor networks and scale linearly with both the dimension of the input and the training set size. Computing most of the layers with an unsupervised algorithm, then optimizing just the top layer for supervised classification of the MNIST and fashion MNIST data sets gives very good results. We also discuss mixing a prior guess for supervised weights together with an unsupervised representation of the data, yielding a smaller number of features nevertheless able to give good performance.",
