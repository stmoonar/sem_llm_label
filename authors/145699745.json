            "abstract": "Future spectrum sharing rules very likely will be based on device environment: indoors or outdoors. For example, the 6 GHz rules created different power regimes for unlicensed devices to protect incumbents: \u201cindoor\u201d devices, subject to lower transmit powers but not required to access an Automatic Frequency Control database to obtain permission to use a channel, and \u201coutdoor\u201d devices, allowed to transmit at higher power but required to do so to determine channel availability. However, since there are no reliable means of determining if a wireless device is indoors or outdoors, other restrictions were mandated: reduced power for client devices and indoor access points that cannot be battery powered, have detachable antennas or be weatherized. These constraints lead to sub-optimal spectrum usage and potential for misuse. Hence, there is a need for robust identification of device environments to enable spectrum sharing. In this paper we study automatic indoor/outdoor classification based on the radio frequency (RF) environment experienced by a device. Using a custom Android app, we first create a labeled data set of a number of parameters of Wi-Fi and cellular signals in various indoor and outdoor environments, and then evaluate the classification performance of various machine learning (ML) models on this data set. We find that tree-based ensemble ML models can achieve greater than 99% test accuracy and F1-Score, thus allowing devices to self-identify their environment and adapt their transmit power accordingly.",

            "abstract": "The appropriate choice of locations for the deployment of web services is of significant importance. The placement of a web service closer to user centers minimizes the response time, however deployment cost may increase. The placement becomes more challenging when multiple web services are involved. In this paper, we address the problem of placing multiple web services with the aim of simultaneously minimizing conflicting objectives of total deployment cost and network latency. We solve the location allocation problem for each web service independently and combine the resulting solutions using a novel merge algorithm. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and simulations that the proposed approach is not only computationally efficient but also produces good quality solutions. Further, the proposed merge algorithm is generic and could be easily adapted to tackle any bi-objective optimization problem that can be decomposed into non-overlapping sub-problems.",

Workflow applications are becoming increasingly computation-intensive or data-intensive, with resource allocation being maintained in terms of pay per usage. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization study for scientific workflow in a cloud environment is proposed. The aim is to minimize execution time and purchasing cost simultaneously while satisfying the demand requirements of customers. The uncertainties present in the model are identified and handled using a well-known technique called Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) for real-world implementation. The model is solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm \u2013 II (NSGA-II). This comprehensive study shows that the solutions obtained on considering uncertainties vary from the deterministic case. Based on the probability of constraint satisfaction, the objective functions improve but at the cost of reliability of the solution.",

            "abstract": "With the evolving data regulations and residency laws, it is becoming challenging for enterprises to serve all the geographically distributed users. To abide with the regulations and to leverage the benefits, such as good quality of service at a low cost, and avoid vendor lock-in, enterprises are seeking multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for hosting their web applications. The selection of CSPs in a multi-cloud environment is a challenging problem as it depends on multiple criteria such as security, service cost, manageability and so on.In this paper, we address the CSP selection problem for multiple applications in a multi-cloud environment comprising of multiple criteria. We provide a holistic solution methodology that ranks the CSP combinations for each web application using a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique. The solution methodology takes virtual machine and cloud center selection into consideration for ranking the CSP combinations. However, selecting the top ranked CSP combinations for all applications may not be a viable option from the manageability and budget perspectives. Hence, we propose an optimization model to select CSPs for multiple applications of an enterprise considering budget and rank. We demonstrate our methodology through numerical experiments and provide various insights.",

            "abstract": "Increase in voice and data traffic has recently prompted cellular operators to consider deploying LTE-like systems in the unlicensed spectrum as an option to meet their customer requirements. This has led to industry-proposed specifications for unlicensed band access, namely LTE enhanced Licensed Assisted Access (LTE-eLAA), LTE Unlicensed (LTEU)/MulteFire (MF). In this paper we focus on MF, which is an extension to the LTE specification that operates entirely in the unlicensed band. It employs a flexible frame format that enables adaptive allocation of subframes for uplink and downlink resources, unlike the rigid (or) fixed frame format used in eLAA. We study and evaluate the potential of a MF network in terms of its flexible resource allocation to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to users. Exploiting MF\u2019s flexible allocation, we propose a scheduling model that utilizes a satisfaction function which guarantees transmission opportunities to users that are close to their deadline (i.e., reward to users transmitting closer to their deadlines and penalty to users transmitting after their deadlines). Compared to eLAA our proposed MF scheduling algorithm achieves better performance for a dense user deployment. We corroborate the analysis by performing system level simulations in ns-3 and demonstrate good agreement between analysis and simulation with respect to latency and packet-drop metrics.",

We formulate the optimal user selection and power control as a non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem to get the optimal user scheduling and transmission power in a given TTI. Our numerical results show that using DPA gives better overall throughput performance than full power transmission algorithm (FPA).

            "abstract": "While it is easier to quench the demand for higher data rates outdoors, it is still a significant challenge when it comes to attaining similar data rates for indoor User Equipments (UEs). Femto cells were introduced for this purpose and also to minimize the traffic load on macro Base Stations (BSs) in 4G/LTE cellular networks. Indoor UEs can achieve good throughput if they get high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), but the inherent problem of path loss due to obstacles prevents UEs from receiving good signals. So, the efficient placement of Femtos in enterprise buildings is crucial. For the optimal placement of Femtos, we developed a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and solved it using the GAMS tool. Once the network planning is done, the next problem that has to be addressed is the downlink traffic imbalance which happens due to non-uniform UE traffic distribution. Traditionally load imbalance is addressed by transferring some of the UEs from the highly loaded cell to a less loaded neighboring cell but this could increase the UE uplink transmission power as it now connected to a cell which is not the closest one. To improve UE battery life and to boost the downlink throughput, we decouple the uplink and downlink (DuD) access to UEs by connecting the uplink to the shortest pathloss Femto, and the downlink to one of less loaded neighboring Femtos. Our extensive experimentation in MATLAB shows that on average, the decoupled access system achieves 70% energy savings (i.e., uplink power) when compared to coupled access system.

            "abstract": "In order to offload base station (BS) traffic and to enhance efficiency of spectrum, operators can activate many Device-to-Device (D2D) pairs or links in LTE networks. This increases the overall spectral efficiency because the same Resource Blocks (RBs) are used across cellular UEs (CUEs) (i.e., all UEs connected to BS for both C-Plane and D-plane communication) and D2D links (i.e., where the UEs are connected to BS only for C-plane communication). However, significant interference problems can be caused by D2D communications as the same RBs are being shared. In our work, we address this problem by proposing a novel scheduling algorithm, Efficient Scheduling and Power control Algorithm for D2Ds (ESPAD), which reuses the same RBs and tries to maximize the overall network throughput without affecting the CUEs throughput. ESPAD algorithm also ensures that Signal to Noise plus Interference Ratio (SINR) for each of the D2D links is maintained above a certain predefined threshold. The aforementioned properties of ESPAD algorithm makes sure that the CUEs do not experience very high interference from the D2Ds. It is observed that even when the SINRdrop (i.e., maximum permissible drop in SINR of CUEs) is as high as 10 dB, there is no drastic decrease in CUEs throughput (only 3.78%). We also compare our algorithm against other algorithms and show that D2D throughput improves drastically without undermining CUEs throughput.",
