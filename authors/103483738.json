            "abstract": "In an edge-cloud cooperative computing network, the task offloading performance can be further improved by the edge-cloud and edge-edge cooperation, in which the tasks can be offloaded from an edge server to the cloud server or another edge server. Such edge-cloud cooperative task offloading can jointly utilize the resources of all the edge servers and the cloud server. This paper proposes a collaborative service placement, task scheduling, computing resource allocation, and transmission rate allocation scheme for a multi-task and multi-service scenario with edge-cloud cooperation. The objective of our optimization problem is to minimize the total task processing delay while guaranteeing long-term task queuing stability. Considering the high complexity of the original optimization problem, we transform the problem into a deterministic problem for each time slot based on the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we design an iterative algorithm to obtain the whole solution to the problem efficiently based on a hybrid method using multiple numerical techniques. Further, considering the inherent difference in the optimization periods of the service placement, resource allocation, and task scheduling sub-problems, we design a multi-timescale algorithm to solve the sub-problems with different optimization periods. The complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, and extensive simulations are conducted by varying multiple crucial parameters. The superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparison with 4 other schemes.",

            "abstract": "Hierarchical edge-cloud systems collaboratively utilize the resources of both the edge server and central cloud, enabling deep neural network (DNN) partition between the edge and cloud to accelerate the inference. However, the limited energy budgets of both the edge server and central cloud restrict them from providing optimal DNN inference services. Moreover, considering the high dynamics in stochastic environments, the long-term system performance should be optimized under long-term energy constraints. How to improve the long-term DNN inference performance in such energy-constrained hierarchical edge-cloud systems is less studied by existing related works. In this paper, we aim to jointly optimize DNN partition and computing resource allocation to minimize the long-term average end-to-end delay of multiple types of deep learning (DL) tasks while guaranteeing the energy consumption of the edge server and central cloud within their energy budgets. Based on the Lyapunov optimization technique and reinforcement learning, we design a novel deep deterministic policy gradient based DNN partition and resource allocation (DDPRA) algorithm to train policy to decide DNN partition dynamically by observing the environment. Moreover, the DDPRA algorithm is embedded with a heuristic computing resource allocation (HCRA) algorithm, which effectively reduces the complexity of policy training by decoupling and optimizing the computing resource allocation separately. We analyze the complexity of our algorithms and conduct extensive simulations. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in comparison with 5 other schemes in multiple scenarios.",

The directional coupler is consisted of two simple coupled lines and two three-folded-coupled (TFC) lines, which realizes advantages of broadband, tight coupling, and high directivity. The TFC line is simplified as two-level coupled lines. Electrical lengths of coupled lines and precise mathematical equations for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${S}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-parameters of the proposed TFC-structure coupler are calculated based on the method of even- and odd-mode analysis. The gap between the simplified two-level coupled lines is also considered and discussed. For demonstrative purposes, a broadband coupler using TFC lines is designed and fabricated at about 2 GHz with a power-dividing coefficient of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${k} = 0.6$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. The measured fractional bandwidth (FBW) of the proposed coupler is about 54.0% as the return loss <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(|S_{11}|)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and the isolation <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(|S_{41}|)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> are both higher than 20 dB.

            "abstract": "Linear companding transform (LCT) is one of the most attractive schemes to deal with the inherent problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, due to its effectiveness and low complexity. In this paper, a generalized continuous piecewise linear companding (CPLC) transform is proposed. The companding and decompanding functions of the proposed scheme consist of multiple continuous linear segments, and the total number of segments is generalized to be any integer not less than four. These linear segments can provide much adaptability for function shaping, leading to high flexibility for performance tradeoffs among PAPR reduction, bit error rate (BER), out-of-band (OOB) rejection and algorithmic complexity. The continuity of the companding function helps to reduce OOB radiations. Several optimization problems with different targets under the constraint condition of constant average power are constructed. Permissible ranges of key parameters, relationships among these parameters and their influence on algorithmic performance are analyzed. Parameter selecting strategies are also provided. In addition, an iterative receiving method is designed to reduce system BER effectively at the receiver. Simulation results validate the performance superiorities of the proposed scheme to that of other typical companding schemes.",

However, the issue of sharing bikes imbalance in various bike-sharing stations (BSS) constantly exists. Therefore, planning an effective route for rebalancing the bike-sharing system becomes a crucial task. In this article, based on a novel rebalancing problem of bike-sharing systems, which is to maximize the total allocated bikes at different stations under the constrained scheduling resources, we propose a meta-learning algorithm named ALRL to effectively allocate the sharing bikes under realistic constraints. Experimental results on real data sets and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach which is better than the traditional methods.",

            "abstract": "In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, vehicles are equipped with computing resources to support vehicle-oriented IoV applications. Meanwhile, these computing resources can be also leveraged to enhance the task processing performance for the devices in Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) scenarios, and alleviate the load of edge servers. Existing research works rarely consider the resource utilization of moving vehicles, which can be an important complement to the MEC schemes with the assistance of parked vehicles. In this paper, a joint task offloading and resource allocation scheme is proposed for a parked-and-moving-vehicles-assisted MEC scenario consisting of multiple devices, parked vehicles, and moving vehicles covered by a Base Station (BS) equipped with an edge server. The tasks of the devices can be either offloaded to the BS or further offloaded from the BS to the vehicles. The service time that a moving vehicle can provide its task offloading service before it moves out of the coverage of the BS, are taken into account of our system model. The aim of our scheme it to minimize the total priority-weighted task processing delay for all the devices through offloading the tasks to the edge server or to the vehicles, allocating the wireless channels of the BS, and allocating the computing resource of the edge server and the vehicles. A generalized benders decomposition and reformulation linearization-based iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solution to the optimization problem, and a two-stage heuristic algorithm is also given to provide near-optimal solutions with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme in seven different scenarios by comparing it with three other schemes.",

            "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is considered as a critical technique in 5 G New Radio (NR), due to its capability to significantly improve data rate and link reliability for the radio link. To make it a reality, it is essential to evaluate massive MIMO performance in realistic spatial fading channel conditions. Specifically, dynamic spatial channel emulation is crucial to evaluate the massive MIMO beam operations. Due to the high cost associated with both the traditional conduced testing method and the standardized multi-probe anechoic chamber (MPAC) based Over-the-Air (OTA) testing setup for massive MIMO performance testing, fading channel emulation for massive MIMO testing using a conductive phase matrix setup has been proposed in the literature. However, it is still a challenging problem to emulate dynamic spatial channels in a cost-effective and efficient manner for the conductive phase matrix setup, since traditional algorithms suffer from high computational complexity and system cost. This paper proposes a fast and accurate framework to emulate dynamic spatial channels in the phase matrix setup, where the basic idea is to mimic a virtual MPAC setup. By doing so, we can mimic MPAC setup with flexible probe configurations. Furthermore, a novel successive cancellation strategy and a closed-form algorithm are proposed to determine the probe locations and probe weights, respectively, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity associated with dynamic channel emulation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is highly accurate and computationally efficient, compared to state-of-art solutions. Further, we apply our developed algorithm to emulate measured non-stationary channels and excellent emulation accuracy can be achieved. The proposed method can be employed for emulating dynamic spatial channels, which is of great importance for massive MIMO performance testing.",

Particularly, we consider the fully-access HP structure and the subarray HP structure, respectively. For these two structures, the finite resolution analog precoder is realized through a low-power switches and inverters (SI) network. In the NOMA system, multiple users are first paired according to their channel correlation and gain difference. Following this, we propose hybrid precoding schemes for the low-power SI-based HP structures. Then, a power allocation (PA) problem is formulated to maximize the energy efficiency of the system, subject to per-cluster\u2019 power constraints and per-user\u2019 quality of service constraints. To solve the non-convex PA optimization problem, we devise a suboptimal solution with two-stage PA strategies. Furthermore, the PA problem aiming at conditionally maximizing the spectrum efficiency is also analyzed.

            "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) tasks in Internet of Things (IoT) are sensitive to task inference accuracy. In this letter, an ML task offloading scheme is proposed to minimize the total delay of task processing in an edge-intelligence-enabled IoT scenario, while guaranteeing the accuracy requirements of tasks, and taking into account the multiple attributes of tasks, task inference accuracy, and impact of error inference on task processing delay. The problem of wireless channel allocation, and computing resource allocation is modeled along with the task offloading. Considering the high complexity of the optimization problem, we design an algorithm which decomposes the problem into a computing resource allocation sub-problem and a task offloading and channel allocation sub-problem, and then solves them separately. In extensive simulations, the superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparisons with 4 other schemes.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a dual circularly polarized IFA antenna array and a circularly polarized microstrip antenna are introduced. The IFA array is composed of four designed Inverted-F shape antennas. The response frequency range of the IFA array is 840MHz-925MHz, which can be applied to RFID applications in UHF band. The two feeding ports correspond to two states of left-handed circular polarization and right-handed circular polarization respectively. The circularly polarized microstrip antenna is located in the middle of the antenna, and the response frequency range is 2.4-2.45ghz, which can be used to design multi-functional applications.",
