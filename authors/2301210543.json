            "title": "Cornac-AB: An Open-Source Recommendation Framework with Native A/B Testing Integration",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems significantly impact user experience across diverse domains, yet existing frameworks often prioritize offline evaluation metrics, neglecting the crucial integration of A/B testing for forward-looking assessments. In response, this paper introduces a new framework seamlessly incorporating A/B testing into the Cornac recommendation library. Leveraging a diverse collection of model implementations in Cornac, our framework enables effortless A/B testing experiment setup from offline trained models. We introduce a carefully designed dashboard and a robust backend for efficient logging and analysis of user feedback. This not only streamlines the A/B testing process but also enhances the evaluation of recommendation models in an online environment. Demonstrating the simplicity of on-demand online model evaluations, our work contributes to advancing recommender system evaluation methodologies, underscoring the significance of A/B testing and providing a practical framework for implementation. The framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/PreferredAI/cornac-ab.",
