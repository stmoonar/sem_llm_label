            "abstract": "The rise in eating disorders, a condition with serious health complications, has been linked to the proliferation of idealized body images on social media platforms. However, the relationship between social media and eating disorders is more complex, with online platforms potentially enabling harmful behaviors by linking people to \u201cpro-ana\u201d communities that promote eating disorders. We conceptualize the growth of harmful pro-ana communities as a process of online radical-ization. We show that a model of radicalization explains how individuals are driven to conversations about extreme behaviors, like fasting, to achieve the \u201cthin body\u201d goal, and how these conversations are validated by pro-ana communities. By facilitating social connections to like-minded others, a shared group identity and emotional support, social media platforms can trap individuals within toxic echo chambers that normalize extreme disordered eating behaviors and other forms of self-harm. Characterizing and quantifying the role of online communities in amplifying harmful conversations will support the development of strategies to mitigate their impact and promote better mental health.",

In particular, big data in genetics, neuroimaging, mobile health, and other subfields of biomedical science, promises new insights, but also poses challenges. To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, including a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with developing a resource for personalized data science training for biomedical researchers. The BD2K TCC web portal is powered by ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index, which collects training resources for data science, including online courses, videos of tutorials and research talks, textbooks, and other web-based materials. While the availability of so many potential learning resources is exciting, they are highly heterogeneous in quality, difficulty, format, and topic, making the field intimidating to enter and difficult to navigate. Moreover, data science is rapidly evolving, so there is a constant influx of new materials and concepts. We leverage data science techniques to build ERuDIte itself, using data extraction, data integration, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing to automatically collect, integrate, describe, and organize existing online resources for learning data science.",

Our analysis of road networks in more than 850 US cities and rural counties since 1900 reveals significant variations in the structure of roads both within cities and across the conterminous US. Despite differences in the evolution of these networks, there are commonalities: newer roads tend to become less grid-like. These results persist across the rural-urban continuum and are therefore not just a product of urban growth. These findings illuminate the need for policies for urban and rural planning including the critical assessment of new development trends.",

This model has three mechanisms: (i) researchers are preferentially hired by large institutions, (ii) new institutions trigger more potential institutions, and (iii) researchers collaborate with friends-of-friends. We show agreement between these assumptions and empirical data, through analysis of co-authorship networks spanning two centuries. We then develop a theoretical understanding of this model, which reveals emergent heterogeneous scaling such that the number of collaborations between institutions scale with an institution\u2019s size.",

            "abstract": "Structural inequalities persist in society, conferring systematic advantages to some people at the expense of others, for example, by giving them substantially more influence and opportunities. Using bibliometric data about authors of scientific publications, we identify two types of structural inequalities in scientific citations. First, female authors, who represent a minority of researchers, receive less recognition for their work (through citations) relative to male authors; second, authors affiliated with top-ranked institutions, who are also a minority, receive substantially more recognition compared to other authors. We present a model for the growth of directed citation networks and show that citations disparities arise from individual preferences to cite authors from the same group (homophily), highly cited or active authors (preferential attachment), as well as the size of the group and how frequently new authors join. We analyze the model and show that its predictions align well with real-world observations. Our theoretical and empirical analysis also suggests potential strategies to mitigate structural inequalities in science. In particular, we find that merely increasing the minority group size does little to narrow the disparities. Instead, reducing the homophily of each group, frequently adding new authors to a research field while providing them an accessible platform among existing, established authors, together with balanced group sizes can have the largest impact on reducing inequality. Our work highlights additional complexities of mitigating structural disparities stemming from asymmetric relations (e.g., directed citations) compared to symmetric relations (e.g., collaborations).",

            "abstract": "Preferential attachment, homophily and, their consequences such as the glass ceiling effect have been well-studied in the context of undirected networks. However, the lack of an intuitive, theoretically tractable model of a directed, bi-populated~(i.e.,~containing two groups) network with variable levels of preferential attachment, homophily and growth dynamics~(e.g.,~the rate at which new nodes join, whether the new nodes mostly follow existing nodes or the existing nodes follow them, etc.) has largely prevented such consequences from being explored in the context of directed networks, where they more naturally occur due to the asymmetry of links. To this end, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of the \\emph{Directed Mixed Preferential Attachment} model and, use it to analyze the glass ceiling effect in directed networks. More specifically, we derive the closed-form expressions for the power-law exponents of the in- and out- degree distributions of each group~(minority and majority) and, compare them with each other to obtain insights. In particular, our results yield answers to questions such as: \\emph{when does the minority group have a heavier out-degree (or in-degree) distribution compared to the majority group? what effect does frequent addition of edges between existing nodes have on the in- and out- degree distributions of the majority and minority groups?}. Such insights shed light on the interplay between the structure~(i.e., the in- and out- degree distributions of the two groups) and dynamics~(characterized collectively by the homophily, preferential attachment, group sizes and growth dynamics) of various real-world networks. Finally, we utilize the obtained analytical results to characterize the conditions under which the glass ceiling effect emerge in a directed network. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical results.",

Existing approaches to DA classification model utterances without incorporating the turn changes among speakers throughout the dialogue, therefore treating it no different than non-interactive written text. In this paper, we propose to integrate the turn changes in conversations among speakers when modeling DAs. Specifically, we learn conversation-invariant speaker turn embeddings to represent the speaker turns in a conversation; the learned speaker turn embeddings are then merged with the utterance embeddings for the downstream task of DA classification. With this simple yet effective mechanism, our model is able to capture the semantics from the dialogue content while accounting for different speaker turns in a conversation. Validation on three benchmark public datasets demonstrates superior performance of our model.",

Ability to analyze this data offers new opportunities for real-time health monitoring and forecasting.

Most methods proposed for time series analysis and classification do not handle datasets with these characteristics nor do they offer interpretability and explainability, a critical requirement in the health domain. We propose an unsupervised method for learning representations of time series based on common patterns identified within them. The patterns are, interpretable, variable in length, and extracted using Byte Pair Encoding compression technique. In this way the method can capture both long-term and short-term dependencies present in the data. We show that this method applies to both univariate and multivariate time series and beats state-of-the-art approaches on a real world dataset collected from wearable sensors.",

            "abstract": "Tagging facilitates information retrieval in social media and other online communities by allowing users to organize and describe online content. Researchers found that the efficiency of tagging systems steadily decreases over time, because tags become less precise in identifying specific documents, i.e., they lose their descriptiveness. However, previous works did not answer how or even whether community managers can improve the efficiency of tags. In this work, we use information-theoretic measures to track the descriptive and retrieval efficiency of tags on Stack Overflow, a question-answering system that strictly limits the number of tags users can specify per question. We observe that tagging efficiency stabilizes over time, while tag content and descriptiveness both increase. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that limiting the number of tags fosters novelty and diversity in tag usage, two properties which are both beneficial for tagging efficiency. To provide qualitative evidence supporting our hypothesis, we present a statistical model of tagging that demonstrates how novelty and diversity lead to greater tag efficiency in the long run. Our work offers insights into policies to improve information organization and retrieval in online communities.",
