            "title": "Question Decomposition Tree for Answering Complex Questions over Knowledge Bases",
            "abstract": "Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) has attracted a lot of interest in recent years, especially for complex questions which require multiple facts to answer. Question decomposition is a promising way to answer complex questions. Existing decomposition methods split the question into sub-questions according to a single compositionality type, which is not sufficient for questions involving multiple compositionality types. In this paper, we propose Question Decomposition Tree (QDT) to represent the structure of complex questions. Inspired by recent advances in natural language generation (NLG), we present a two-staged method called Clue-Decipher to generate QDT. It can leverage the strong ability of NLG model and simultaneously preserve the original questions. To verify that QDT can enhance KBQA task, we design a decomposition-based KBQA system called QDTQA. Extensive experiments show that QDTQA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on ComplexWebQuestions dataset. Besides, our decomposition method improves an existing KBQA system by 12% and sets a new state-of-the-art on LC-QuAD 1.0.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability.",

            "abstract": "Opinion question machine reading comprehension (MRC) requires a machine to answer questions by analyzing corresponding passages. Compared with traditional MRC tasks where the answer to every question is a segment of text in corresponding passages, opinion question MRC is more challenging because the answer to an opinion question may not appear in corresponding passages but needs to be deduced from multiple sentences. In this study, a novel framework based on neural networks is proposed to address such problems, in which a new hybrid embedding training method combining text features is used. Furthermore, extra attention and output layers which generate auxiliary losses are introduced to jointly train the stacked recurrent neural networks. To deal with imbalance of the dataset, irrelevancy of question and passage is used for data augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We are the biweekly champion in the opinion question MRC task in Artificial Intelligence Challenger 2018 (AIC2018).",

In the medical domain, there have been a number of studies on text classification in modern medicine clinical notes written in English. However, very limited text classification research has been conducted on clinical notes written in Chinese, especially traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical records. The goal of this study was to investigate features and machine learning classification algorithms for TCM clinical text classification. We collected 7,037 TCM clinical records of famous TCM doctors as our dataset, and investigated the effects of different types of features and classification algorithms.

The contribution of this paper is threefold: Firstly, we introduce a novel approach for word segmentation over Chinese questions. We employ a TF-IDF model on the dataset to generate domain-specific dictionary with weight factor and tags, which are computed to select the best result of segmentation. Secondly, we present a novel method for constructing queries to retrieve answers. We compute the entity-attribute distance over a set of tagged words to construct incomplete ontology instances, which are used as the intermediary to generate queries. Lastly, we propose a method to integrate web data extraction with question answering, which allows us to extract answers from online encyclopedia website (i.e. Wikipedia).
