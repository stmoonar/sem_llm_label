            "abstract": "The third iteration of the half-day workshop on Cryptoasset Analytics continues to offer a forum for researchers from diverse fields to share their latest discoveries in the domain of cryptoassets. This workshop retains its importance to the Web research community, motivated by how fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are progressively melding with Web technologies on a technical level, and through the observation that the evolution of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems are intricately linked to the Web. The program features a mix of of invited talks alongside a carefully curated selection of peer-reviewed contributions. Workshop topics encompass a variety of themes, including empirical analyses, statistical methodologies, privacy measures, architectural and regulatory insights.",

            "abstract": "This half-day workshop on Cryptoasset Analytics allows researchers from different disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets. This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program will feature a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program features a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Workshop topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

Chartalist contains ML-ready datasets from unspent transaction output (UTXO) (e.g., Bitcoin) and account-based blockchains (e.g., Ethereum).

            "abstract": "Cryptoassets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens are increasingly traded on decentralized exchanges. The advantage for users is that the funds are not in custody of a centralized external entity. However, these exchanges are prone to manipulative behavior. In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity can be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta. We identify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal definitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash trading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and two-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify these activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30% of all traded tokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the tokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for future research. Our findings underpin the need for countermeasures that are applicable in decentralized systems.",

            "abstract": "Core decomposition in networks has proven useful for evaluating the importance of nodes and communities in a variety of application domains, ranging from biology to social networks and finance. However, existing core decomposition algorithms have limitations in simultaneously handling multiple node and edge attributes. We propose a novel unsupervised core decomposition method that can be easily applied to directed and weighted networks. Our algorithm, AlphaCore, allows us to systematically and mathematically rigorously combine multiple node properties by using the notion of data depth. In addition, it can be used as a mixture of centrality measure and core decomposition. Compared to existing approaches, AlphaCore avoids the need to specify numerous thresholds or coefficients and yields meaningful quantitative and qualitative insights into the network structural organization. We evaluate AlphaCore's performance with a focus on financial, blockchain-based token networks, the social network Reddit and a transportation network of international flight routes. We compare our results with existing core decomposition and centrality algorithms. Using ground truth about node importance, we show that AlphaCore yields the best precision and recall results among core decomposition methods using the same input features. An implementation is available at https://github.com/friedhelmvictor/alphacore.",

            "abstract": "We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks \u2014 and, thereby, DeFi protocols \u2014 would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.",

            "abstract": "In the past years, cryptocurrencies have received a lot of attention in popular media. Having attracted significant speculation, prices have soared in 2017, fell in 2018 and are generally known to be very volatile. However, some of the price changes have been due to organized manipulation. Traditionally known in the world of penny stocks and made illegal in most countries, pump and dump schemes are frequent in cryptocurrencies, and mostly unregulated. In this paper, we perform quantification and detection of pump and dump schemes that are coordinated through Telegram chats and executed on Binance \u2013 one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. We detail how pumps are organized on Telegram, and quantify the properties of 149 confirmed events with respect to market capitalization, trading volume, price impact and profitability. Based on this ground truth, and regular trading intervals obtained from twitter timestamps, we optimize a binary classifier in order to be able to detect additional suspicious trading activity. Our results indicate that pump and dump schemes occur frequently in cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations below $50 million, that scheme operators often organize their actions across multiple channels, that such activity tends to lead to inflated prices over longer time periods and machine learning can help to identify activity that is similar to known pump and dump schemes.",
