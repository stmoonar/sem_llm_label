            "abstract": "The EU-funded PALANTIR project proposes a cybersecurity framework combining privacy assurance, data protection, incident detection and recovery aspects under the same platform. The project main focus is on cyber-resilience of SMEs and compliance with the relevant data privacy and protection regulations. The outcomes of the project will be validated in diverse application areas (eHealth, eCommerce, 5G-MEC) and will provide enterprises with security tools that will boost their resilience at a reasonable cost to protect their assets in the ever evolving cyber threat range.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things and the proliferation of easily compromisable IoT devices has led to a drastic increase in the occurrence of IoT-based botnet attacks. Hackers are keen on exploiting the vulnerabilities of smart devices, which are seen as easy targets often lacking robust security mechanisms. Identifying botnet activity is an active research topic and remains a challenging task due to the continuous evolution of botnet families that employ a large number of attack vectors. Traditional rule-based approaches which rely on signature matching, heuristics and behavioral profiling are always lagging one step behind the attacker, leading researchers to the development of machine and deep learning methods for the detection of compromised IoT device behaviour. In this paper, we model botnet traffic identification as an anomaly detection task, aiming at establishing a baseline of benign traffic, in order to detect unusual behavior using Netflow data. We propose a feature engineering and deep learning-based detection framework based on two Autoencoder architectures: (i) a vanilla implementation of a deep Autoencoder and (ii) GANomaly which has never been used in the context of network traffic analysis before. We validate the performance of the proposed methodology on the CICIDS2017 dataset which has been widely used for cybersecurity benchmarks and show that it is possible to induce highly accurate unsupervised learning models to detect previously unseen botnet behaviour.",

Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "The usefulness of automated information extraction tools in generating structured knowledge from unstructured and semi-structured machine-readable documents is limited by challenges related to the variety and intricacy of the targeted entities, the complex linguistic features of heterogeneous corpora, and the computational availability for readily scaling to large amounts of text. In this paper, we argue that the redundancy and ambiguity of subject\u2013predicate\u2013object (SPO) triples in open information extraction systems has to be treated as an equally important step in order to ensure the quality and preciseness of generated triples. To this end, we propose a pipeline approach for information extraction from large corpora, encompassing a series of natural language processing tasks. Our methodology consists of four steps: i. in-place coreference resolution, ii. extractive text summarization, iii. parallel triple extraction, and iv. entity enrichment and graph representation. We manifest our methodology on a large medical dataset (CORD-19), relying on state-of-the-art tools to fulfil the aforementioned steps and extract triples that are subsequently mapped to a comprehensive ontology of biomedical concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our information extraction method by comparing it in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score with state-of-the-art OIE engines and demonstrate its capabilities on a set of data exploration tasks.",

            "abstract": "Collection of information of the events taking place in local neighborhoods along with the emotional statuses of the people involved can enable us to realize an \u201caffective smart city map\u201d, with which, for example, the local authority can review the measures adopted for the local areas and whether their these measure have actually contributed to the quality of life (QoL) and well-being of the people. To realize such an information system having easy-deployability, real-time and secure protection of user's sensitive data, we propose SmileCityReport, a smartphone app-based participatory sensing that can easily capture both the city events and the reporter's emotion-related status based on a novel technique that uses two cameras simultaneously. For our evaluation, we evaluated 15 users over one week and confirmed that the proposed methodology contributes to more activity and (estimated) more positive emotional status of the users, and also that the emotion-related facial expression values constitute valuable data that can be publicly shared.",

Their ultimate goal is to improve the Quality of Life of the elderly and to help them to live more independently. The technology service platform is integration of systems from Hewlett Packard (Italy), Alcatel-Lucent (Italy), Converge ICT Solutions (Greece), Eltronic A/S (Denmark) and Socrate Medical (Italy). The service platform has been tested, validated and evaluated in four different European pilot sites (Frederikshavn in Denmark, Lappeenranta in Finland, Trikala in Greece and Belfast in UK) for a duration of more than one year and based on the outcome from the real-life operations and user feedback, it has been optimised, improved and adapted for diverse regional conditions. This has been a very challenging process because the user and functional requirements are very high w.r.t. intuitive user interface with minimum user interaction, diverse needs of the main user groups, personalisation needs, requirements for stable operation despite of the fact that it is a pilot system, but working in real-life conditions and exposed to interruptions in connectivity, hardware failures, human errors, etc.",

The services will improve the elderly ability for self-care by support for their basic daily activities in way that prevents health risks in their homes. The services will also strengthen the daily interaction with their social sphere partners and relatives, friends and care -givers, giving them the feeling of safety and preventing their social isolation. Last but not least, their cognitive training and activation will be strengthened. To prove wide applicability in Europe, the pilot will be validated and tested in realistic conditions for 12-month period in four Member States regions which Project name: Intelligent System for Independent living and SElfcare of seniors with cognitive problems or Mild Dementia",
