            "title": "Multi-Relational Structural Entropy",
            "abstract": "Structural Entropy (SE) measures the structural information contained in a graph. Minimizing or maximizing SE helps to reveal or obscure the intrinsic structural patterns underlying graphs in an interpretable manner, finding applications in various tasks driven by networked data. However, SE ignores the heterogeneity inherent in the graph relations, which is ubiquitous in modern networks. In this work, we extend SE to consider heterogeneous relations and propose the first metric for multi-relational graph structural information, namely, Multi-relational Structural Entropy (MrSE). To this end, we first cast SE through the novel lens of the stationary distribution from random surfing, which readily extends to multi-relational networks by considering the choices of both nodes and relation types simultaneously at each step. The resulting MrSE is then optimized by a new greedy algorithm to reveal the essential structures within a multi-relational network. Experimental results highlight that the proposed MrSE offers a more insightful interpretation of the structure of multi-relational graphs compared to SE. Additionally, it enhances the performance of two tasks that involve real-world multi-relational graphs, including node clustering and social event detection.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems (RecSys) aim to predict users\u2019 preferences based on historical interactions and content profiles, and they are vital components of many online services. However, the strict cold-start (SCS) issue, i.e., users/items have no prior interactions, poses significant challenges for RecSys. The existing methods seek to transfer content knowledge, collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge, or combine the two from the warm-start scenario towards the (strict) cold-start scenarios. However, these approaches either ignore the available information or model the information in rough manners such that the two types of knowledge interfere with each other, leading to ineffective and uncontrolled knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel dual-teacher knowledge distillation (DTKD) framework that simultaneously and effectively transfers both content and CF knowledge. The proposed DTKD framework contains two teachers, one for each knowledge type, that is specifically designed according to the characteristics of the content and CF data to distill the knowledge fully. Soft scoring is calculated during the distillation to denoise and augment the original hard-labeled interactions. A knowledge fusion module is then proposed to collect the consensus of the two teachers\u2019 opinions. Finally, DTKD transfers both content and CF knowledge into a student module that learns the shared viewpoints of the teachers. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets under the warm-start as well as three different SCS settings (i.e., strict cold users, strict cold items, and strict cold users & items). Experimental results show that DTKD outperforms strong baselines by large margins under all settings, especially the SCS ones.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has significantly advanced NLP tasks by enhancing the capabilities of conversational models. However, the application of LLMs in the recommendation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. To bridge this gap, we propose LLMRec, a LLM-based recommender system designed for benchmarking LLMs on various recommendation tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several popular off-the-shelf LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, ChatGLM, on five recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, direct recommendation, explanation generation, and review summarization. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of supervised finetuning to improve LLMs' instruction compliance ability. The benchmark results indicate that LLMs displayed only moderate proficiency in accuracy-based tasks such as sequential and direct recommendation. However, they demonstrated comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in explainability-based tasks. We also conduct qualitative evaluations to further evaluate the quality of contents generated by different models, and the results show that LLMs can truly understand the provided information and generate clearer and more reasonable results. We aspire that this benchmark will serve as an inspiration for researchers to delve deeper into the potential of LLMs in enhancing recommendation performance.

            "abstract": "Recommendation systems suffer in the strict cold-start (SCS) scenario, where the user-item interactions are entirely unavailable. The well-established, dominating identity (ID)-based approaches completely fail to work. Cold-start recommenders, on the other hand, leverage item contents (brand, title, descriptions, etc.) to map the new items to the existing ones. However, the existing SCS recommenders explore item contents in coarse-grained manners that introduce noise or information loss. Moreover, informative data sources other than item contents, such as users\u2019 purchase sequences and review texts, are largely ignored. In this work, we explore the role of the fine-grained item attributes in bridging the gaps between the existing and the SCS items and pre-train a knowledgeable item-attribute graph for SCS item recommendation. Our proposed framework, ColdGPT, models item-attribute correlations into an item-attribute graph by extracting fine-grained attributes from item contents. ColdGPT then transfers knowledge into the item-attribute graph from various available data sources, i.e., item contents, historical purchase sequences, and review texts of the existing items, via multi-task learning. To facilitate the positive transfer, ColdGPT designs specific submodules according to the natural forms of the data sources and proposes to coordinate the multiple pre-training tasks via unified alignment-and-uniformity losses. Our pre-trained item-attribute graph acts as an implicit, extendable item embedding matrix, which enables the SCS item embeddings to be easily acquired by inserting these items into the item-attribute graph and propagating their attributes\u2019 embeddings. We carefully process three public datasets, i.e., Yelp, Amazon-home, and Amazon-sports, to guarantee the SCS setting for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ColdGPT consistently outperforms the existing SCS recommenders by large margins and even surpasses models that are pre-trained on 75 - 224 times more, cross-domain data on two out of four datasets. Our code and pre-processed datasets for SCS evaluations are publicly available to help future SCS studies.",

            "abstract": "As a trending approach for social event detection, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods enable a fusion of natural language semantics and the complex social network structural information, thus showing SOTA performance. However, GNN-based methods can miss useful message correlations. Moreover, they require manual labeling for training and predetermining the number of events for prediction. In this work, we address social event detection via graph structural entropy (SE) minimization. While keeping the merits of the GNN-based methods, the proposed framework, HISEvent, constructs more informative message graphs, is unsupervised, and does not require the number of events given a priori. Specifically, we incrementally explore the graph neighborhoods using 1-dimensional (1D) SE minimization to supplement the existing message graph with edges between semantically related messages. We then detect events from the message graph by hierarchically minimizing 2-dimensional (2D) SE. Our proposed 1D and 2D SE minimization algorithms are customized for social event detection and effectively tackle the efficiency problem of the existing SE minimization algorithms. Extensive experiments show that HISEvent consistently outperforms GNN-based methods and achieves the new SOTA for social event detection under both closed- and open-set settings while being efficient and robust.",

            "abstract": "Detecting hot social events (e.g., political scandal, momentous meetings, natural hazards, etc.) from social messages is crucial as it highlights significant happenings to help people understand the real world. On account of the streaming nature of social messages, incremental social event detection models in acquiring, preserving, and updating messages over time have attracted great attention. However, the challenge is that the existing event detection methods towards streaming social messages are generally confronted with ambiguous events features, dispersive text contents, and multiple languages, and hence result in low accuracy and generalization ability. In this paper, we present a novel reinForced, incremental and cross-lingual social Event detection architecture, namely FinEvent, from streaming social messages. Concretely, we first model social messages into heterogeneous graphs integrating both rich meta-semantics and diverse meta-relations, and convert them to weighted multi-relational message graphs. Second, we propose a new reinforced weighted multi-relational graph neural network framework by using a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to select optimal aggregation thresholds across different relations/edges to learn social message embeddings. To solve the long-tail problem in social event detection, a balanced sampling strategy guided Contrastive Learning mechanism is designed for incremental social message representation learning. Third, a new Deep Reinforcement Learning guided density-based spatial clustering model is designed to select the optimal minimum number of samples required to form a cluster and optimal minimum distance between two clusters in social event detection tasks. Finally, we implement incremental social message representation learning based on knowledge preservation on the graph neural network and achieve the transferring cross-lingual social event detection. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the FinEvent on Twitter streams, demonstrating a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with 14%\u2013118%, 8%\u2013170%, and 2%\u201321% increases in performance on offline, online, and cross-lingual social event detection tasks.",

XLTime works on top of pre-trained language models and leverages multi-task learning to prompt cross-language knowledge transfer both from English and within the non-English languages. XLTime alleviates problems caused by a shortage of data in the target language. We apply XLTime with different language models and show that it outperforms the previous automatic SOTA methods on French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Basque, by large margins. XLTime also closes the gap considerably on the handcrafted HeidelTime method.",

            "title": "From Known to Unknown: Quality-aware Self-improving Graph Neural Network For Open Set Social Event Detection",
            "abstract": "State-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in social event detection tasks when restricted to a closed set of events. However, considering the large amount of data needed for training and the limited ability of a neural network in handling previously unknown data, it is hard for existing GNN-based methods to operate in an open set setting. To address this problem, we design a Quality-aware Self-improving Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) which extends the knowledge from known to unknown by leveraging the best of known samples and reliable knowledge transfer. Specifically, to fully exploit the labeled data, we propose a novel supervised pairwise loss with an additional orthogonal inter-class relation constraint to train the backbone GNN encoder. The learnt, already-known events further serve as strong reference bases for the unknown ones, which greatly prompts knowledge acquisition and transfer. When the model is generalized to unknown data, to ensure the effectiveness and reliability, we further leverage the reference similarity distribution vectors for pseudo pairwise label generation, selection and quality assessment. Following the diversity principle of active learning, our method selects diverse pair samples with the generated pseudo labels to fine-tune the GNN encoder. Besides, we propose a novel quality-guided optimization in which the contributions of pseudo labels are weighted based on consistency. Experimental results validate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results and extends well to unknown events.",

            "title": "Knowledge-Preserving Incremental Social Event Detection via Heterogeneous GNNs",
            "abstract": "Social events provide valuable insights into group social behaviors and public concerns and therefore have many applications in fields such as product recommendation and crisis management. The complexity and streaming nature of social messages make it appealing to address social event detection in an incremental learning setting, where acquiring, preserving, and extending knowledge are major concerns. Most existing methods, including those based on incremental clustering and community detection, learn limited amounts of knowledge as they ignore the rich semantics and structural information contained in social data. Moreover, they cannot memorize previously acquired knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-Preserving Incremental Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (KPGNN) for incremental social event detection. To acquire more knowledge, KPGNN models complex social messages into unified social graphs to facilitate data utilization and explores the expressive power of GNNs for knowledge extraction. To continuously adapt to the incoming data, KPGNN adopts contrastive loss terms that cope with a changing number of event classes. It also leverages the inductive learning ability of GNNs to efficiently detect events and extends its knowledge from previously unseen data. To deal with large social streams, KPGNN adopts a mini-batch subgraph sampling strategy for scalable training, and periodically removes obsolete data to maintain a dynamic embedding space. KPGNN requires no feature engineering and has few hyperparameters to tune. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superiority of KPGNN over various baselines.",

            "title": "Higher-Order Attribute-Enhancing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in deep learning on graphs. They can learn effective node representations that achieve superior performances in graph analysis tasks such as node classification and node clustering. However, most methods ignore the heterogeneity in real-world graphs. Methods designed for heterogeneous graphs, on the other hand, fail to learn complex semantic representations because they only use meta-paths instead of meta-graphs. Furthermore, they cannot fully capture the content-based correlations between nodes, as they either do not use the self-attention mechanism or only use it to consider the immediate neighbors of each node, ignoring the higher-order neighbors. We propose a novel Higher-order Attribute-Enhancing (HAE) framework that enhances node embedding in a layer-by-layer manner. Under the HAE framework, we propose a Higher-order Attribute-Enhancing Graph Neural Network (HAEGNN) for heterogeneous network representation learning. HAEGNN simultaneously incorporates meta-paths and meta-graphs for rich, heterogeneous semantics, and leverages the self-attention mechanism to explore content-based nodes\u2019 interactions. The unique higher-order architecture of HAEGNN allows examining the first-order as well as higher-order neighborhoods. Moreover, HAEGNN shows good explainability as it learns the importances of different meta-paths and meta-graphs. HAEGNN is also memory-efficient, for it avoids per meta-path based matrix calculation. Experimental results not only show HAEGNN's superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods in node classification, node clustering, and visualization, but also demonstrate its superiorities in terms of memory efficiency and explainability.",
