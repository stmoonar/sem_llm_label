            "title": "Generative artificial intelligence in topic-sentiment classification for Arabic text: a comparative study with possible future directions",
            "abstract": "Social media platforms have become essential for disseminating news and expressing individual sentiments on various life topics. Arabic, widely used in the Middle East, presents unique challenges for sentiment analysis due to its complexity and multiple dialects. Motivated by the need to address these challenges, this article develops methods to overcome the lack of topic-based labeling techniques, compares different approaches for preparing extensive, annotated datasets, and analyzes the efficacy of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language models (LLMs) in classifying Arabic textual data. Our research utilizes the topic-modeling technique to build a topic-based sentiment dataset of Arabic texts aimed at enhancing our understanding and processing capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation of dataset balancing techniques, including under-sampling, over-sampling, and using imbalanced datasets, providing insights into how these approaches impact classification outcomes. Additionally, we explore the influence of dataset sizes on the performance of various ML models, highlighting the importance of dataset scale in developing effective Arabic NLP applications. A further focus of our study is the comparative analysis of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, including the emerging ChatGPT LLM, assessing their effectiveness in managing the complexities of Arabic language classification tasks. Our results show that support vector machines (SVM) achieved the highest performance, with F1-scores of 0.97 and 0.96 in classifying sentiment and topic, respectively, in Arabic tweets. This research not only benchmarks existing methodologies but also paves the way for more nuanced and robust models in the future, enhancing the application of generative AI in Arabic topic-based sentiment analysis.",

            "abstract": "The growing use of media has led to the development of several machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) tools to process the unprecedented amount of social media content to make actionable decisions. However, these ML and NLP algorithms have been widely shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities allow adversaries to launch a diversified set of adversarial attacks on these algorithms in different applications of social media text processing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main approaches for adversarial attacks and defenses in the context of social media applications with a particular focus on key challenges and future research directions. In detail, we cover literature on six key applications: 1) rumors detection; 2) satires detection; 3) clickbaits and spams identification; 4) hate speech detection; 5) misinformation detection; and 6) sentiment analysis. We then highlight the concurrent and anticipated future research questions and provide recommendations and directions for future work.",

            "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) can analyze and classify the growing number of expressed opinions and feelings of online texts and quickly get the required feedback. The technique of automatically labeling a textual document with the most appropriate collection of labels is known as text classification, whereas supervised text classifiers require extensive human expertise and labeling efforts. This paper seeks to build a multi-labeled Arabic dataset by labeling an Arabic Covid-19 Tweet to two groups based on their lexical features: related topic and associated sentiment. An extensive dataset was created from Twitter posts to achieve this purpose. There are over 32k multi-labeled tweets in the dataset. The dataset will be made freely available to the Arabic computational linguistics research community. This work used both traditional machine learning approaches and a deep-learning approach to investigate this dataset\u2019s performance. This paper demonstrates that traditional ML approaches provide higher accuracy with almost stable performance when experienced on the Twitter dataset for sentiment analysis and topic classification.",

            "title": "Adversarial Machine Learning in Text Processing: A Literature Survey",
            "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms represent the intelligence that controls many information systems and applications around us. As such, they are targeted by attackers to impact their decisions. Text created by machine learning algorithms has many types of applications, some of which can be considered malicious especially if there is an intention to present machine-generated text as human-generated. In this paper, we surveyed major subjects in adversarial machine learning for text processing applications. Unlike adversarial machine learning in images, text problems and applications are heterogeneous. Thus, each problem can have its own challenges. We focused on some of the evolving research areas such as: malicious versus genuine text generation metrics, defense against adversarial attacks, and text generation models and algorithms. Our study showed that as applications of text generation will continue to grow in the near future, the type and nature of attacks on those applications and their machine learning algorithms will continue to grow as well. Literature survey indicated an increasing trend in using pre-trained models in machine learning. Word/sentence embedding models and transformers are examples of those pre-trained models. Adversarial models may utilize same or similar pre-trained models as well. In another trend related to text generation models, literature showed effort to develop universal text perturbations to be used in both black-and white-box attack settings. Literature showed also using conditional GANs to create latent representation for writing types. This usage will allow for a seamless lexical and grammatical transition between various writing styles. In text generation metrics, research trends showed developing successful automated or semi-automated assessment metrics that may include human judgement. Literature showed also research trends of designing and developing new memory models that increase performance and memory utilization efficiency without validating real-time constraints. Many research efforts evaluate different defense model approaches and algorithms. Researchers evaluated different types of targeted attacks, and methods to distinguish human versus machine generated text.",

            "abstract": "Despite the promising success of federated learning in various application areas, its inherent vulnerability to adversarial attacks hinders its applicability in security-critical areas. This calls for developing viable defense measures against such attacks. A prerequisite for this development, however, is the understanding of what creates, promotes, and aggravates this vulnerability. To date, developing this understanding remains an outstanding gap in the literature. Accordingly, this paper presents an attempt at developing such an understanding. Primarily, this is achieved from two main perspectives. The first perspective concerns addressing the factors, elements, and parameters contributing to the vulnerability of federated learning models to adversarial attacks, their degrees of severity, and combined effects. This includes addressing diverse operating conditions, attack types and scenarios, and collaborations between attacking agents. The second perspective regards analyzing the appearance of the adversarial property of a model in how it updates its coefficients and exploiting this for defense purposes. These analyses are conducted through extensive experiments on image and text classification tasks. Simulation results reveal the importance of specific parameters and factors on the severity of this vulnerability. Besides, the proposed defense strategy is shown able to provide promising performances.",

Although several researchers have used current state-of-the-art approaches and have produced impressive chest-related clinical outcomes, specific techniques may not contribute many advantages if one type of disease is detected without the rest being identified. Those who tried to identify multiple chest-related diseases were ineffective due to insufficient data and the available data not being balanced. This research provides a significant contribution to the healthcare industry and the research community by proposing a synthetic data augmentation in three deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures for the detection of 14 chest-related diseases. The employed models are DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet152V2; after training and validation, an average ROC-AUC score of 0.80 was obtained competitive as compared to the previous models that were trained for multi-class classification to detect anomalies in x-ray images. This research illustrates how the proposed model practices state-of-the-art deep neural networks to classify 14 chest-related diseases with better accuracy.",

If this gap is not filled with effective chest disease detection automation, the healthcare industry may face unfavorable consequences. There are only several studies that targeted X-ray images of cardiothoracic diseases. Most of the studies only targeted a single disease, which is inadequate. Although some related studies have provided an identification framework for all classes, the results are not encouraging due to a lack of data and imbalanced data issues. This research provides a significant contribution to Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based synthetic data and four different types of deep learning-based models that provided comparable results. The models include a ResNet-152 model with image augmentation with an accuracy of 67%, a ResNet-152 model without image augmentation with an accuracy of 62%, transfer learning with Inception-V3 with an accuracy of 68%, and finally ResNet-152 model with image augmentation but targeted only six classes with an accuracy of 83%.",

            "abstract": "Social media platforms have become one of the most powerful tools for organizations and individuals to publish news and express thoughts or feelings. With the increasingly enormous number of internet users in Saudi Arabia, the need raised to analyze Arabic posts. Since the emergence of COVID-19 in the latest 2019, it lefts economies and businesses counting the cost while governments fight the spread of the virus with new compartmentalization measures. Keeping in view the importance of quick and timely data analysis and sharing for policy actions, Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in facilitating the exchange of views and information between scientists and decision-makers during the Coronavirus pandemic, and they continue to do so. This work mined to these content-related tweets to see how people\u2019s feelings and expressions are changing. The results of this analysis can be used with integration with several IoT technologies to reduce the impact of covid-19 and drive new decisions in this field. For this goal, we proposed a Machine Learning (ML) models that can classify both of the sentiment and topic of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) tweets and achieve high accuracy results.",

            "title": "Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Social Network Text Processing Applications: Techniques, Challenges and Future Research Directions",
            "abstract": "The growing use of social media has led to the development of several Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) tools to process the unprecedented amount of social media content to make actionable decisions. However, these MLand NLP algorithms have been widely shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities allow adversaries to launch a diversified set of adversarial attacks on these algorithms in different applications of social media text processing. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the main approaches for adversarial attacks and defenses in the context of social media applications with a particular focus on key challenges and future research directions. In detail, we cover literature on six key applications, namely (i) rumors detection, (ii) satires detection, (iii) clickbait&spams identification, (iv) hate speech detection, (v)misinformation detection, and (vi) sentiment analysis. We then highlight the concurrent and anticipated future research questions and provide recommendations and directions for future work.",

            "abstract": "From recent research work, it has been shown that neural network (NN) classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples which contain special perturbations that are ignored by human eyes while can mislead NN classifiers. In this paper, we propose a practical black-box adversarial example generator, dubbed ManiGen. ManiGen does not require any knowledge of the inner state of the target classifier. It generates adversarial examples by searching along the manifold, which is a concise representation of input data. Through extensive set of experiments on different datasets, we show that (1) adversarial examples generated by ManiGen can mislead standalone classifiers by being as successful as the state-of-the-art white-box generator, Carlini, and (2) adversarial examples generated by ManiGen can more effectively attack classifiers with state-of-the-art defenses.",
