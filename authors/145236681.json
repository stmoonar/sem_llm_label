            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nSuicide presents a major public health challenge worldwide, affecting people across the lifespan. While previous studies revealed strong associations between Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and suicide deaths, existing evidence is limited by the reliance on structured data. To resolve this, we aim to adapt a suicide-specific SDoH ontology (Suicide-SDoHO) and use natural language processing (NLP) to effectively identify individual-level SDoH-related social risks from death investigation narratives.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe used the latest National Violent Death Report System (NVDRS), which contains 267\u200a804 victim suicide data from 2003 to 2019. After adapting the Suicide-SDoHO, we developed a transformer-based model to identify SDoH-related circumstances and crises in death investigation narratives. We applied our model retrospectively to annotate narratives whose crisis variables were not coded in NVDRS. The crisis rates were calculated as the percentage of the group's total suicide population with the crisis present.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Suicide-SDoHO contains 57 fine-grained circumstances in a hierarchical structure. Our classifier achieves AUCs of 0.966 and 0.942 for classifying circumstances and crises, respectively. Through the crisis trend analysis, we observed that not everyone is equally affected by SDoH-related social risks. For the economic stability crisis, our result showed a significant increase in crisis rate in 2007-2009, parallel with the Great Recession.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first study curating a Suicide-SDoHO using death investigation narratives. We showcased that our model can effectively classify SDoH-related social risks through NLP approaches. We hope our study will facilitate the understanding of suicide crises and inform effective prevention strategies.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to analyze a publicly available sample of rule-based phenotype definitions to characterize and evaluate the variability of logical constructs used.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA sample of 33 preexisting phenotype definitions used in research that are represented using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) was analyzed using automated analysis of the computable representation of the CQL libraries.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost of the phenotype definitions include narrative descriptions and flowcharts, while few provide pseudocode or executable artifacts. Most use 4 or fewer medical terminologies. The number of codes used ranges from 5 to 6865, and value sets from 1 to 19. We found that the most common expressions used were literal, data, and logical expressions. Aggregate and arithmetic expressions are the least common. Expression depth ranges from 4 to 27.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nDespite the range of conditions, we found that all of the phenotype definitions consisted of logical criteria, representing both clinical and operational logic, and tabular data, consisting of codes from standard terminologies and keywords for natural language processing. The total number and variety of expressions are low, which may be to simplify implementation, or authors may limit complexity due to data availability constraints.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe phenotype definitions analyzed show significant variation in specific logical, arithmetic, and other operators but are all composed of the same high-level components, namely tabular data and logical expressions. A standard representation for phenotype definitions should support these formats and be modular to support localization and shared logic.",

            "abstract": "Objective: We develop a deep learning framework based on the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model using unstructured clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict the risk of disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Materials and Methods: We identified 3657 patients diagnosed with MCI together with their progress notes from Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) between 2000-2020. The progress notes no later than the first MCI diagnosis were used for the prediction. We first preprocessed the notes by deidentification, cleaning and splitting, and then pretrained a BERT model for AD (AD-BERT) based on the publicly available Bio+Clinical BERT on the preprocessed notes. The embeddings of all the sections of a patient's notes processed by AD-BERT were combined by MaxPooling to compute the probability of MCI-to-AD progression. For replication, we conducted a similar set of experiments on 2563 MCI patients identified at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) during the same timeframe. Results: Compared with the 7 baseline models, the AD-BERT model achieved the best performance on both datasets, with Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.8170 and F1 score of 0.4178 on NMEDW dataset and AUC of 0.8830 and F1 score of 0.6836 on WCM dataset. Conclusion: We developed a deep learning framework using BERT models which provide an effective solution for prediction of MCI-to-AD progression using clinical note analysis.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo develop and validate a standards-based phenotyping tool to author electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotype definitions and demonstrate execution of the definitions against heterogeneous clinical research data platforms.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe developed an open-source, standards-compliant phenotyping tool known as the PhEMA Workbench that enables a phenotype representation using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) standards. We then demonstrated how this tool can be used to conduct EHR-based phenotyping, including phenotype authoring, execution, and validation. We validated the performance of the tool by executing a thrombotic event phenotype definition at 3 sites, Mayo Clinic (MC), Northwestern Medicine (NM), and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), and used manual review to determine precision and recall.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn initial version of the PhEMA Workbench has been released, which supports phenotype authoring, execution, and publishing to a shared phenotype definition repository. The resulting thrombotic event phenotype definition consisted of 11 CQL statements, and 24 value sets containing a total of 834 codes. Technical validation showed satisfactory performance (both NM and MC had 100% precision and recall and WCM had a precision of 95% and a recall of 84%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrate that the PhEMA Workbench can facilitate EHR-driven phenotype definition, execution, and phenotype sharing in heterogeneous clinical research data environments. A phenotype definition that integrates with existing standards-compliant systems, and the use of a formal representation facilitates automation and can decrease potential for human error.",

            "abstract": "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S (1999-2019). However, predicting when someone will attempt suicide has been nearly impossible. In the modern world, many individuals suffering from mental illness seek emotional support and advice on well-known and easily-accessible social media platforms such as Reddit. While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated the ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and temporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have enormous clinical potential\u2014most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to employ timely and targeted interventions (i.e., voluntary and involuntary psychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this knowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in terms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep learning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level suicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a clinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the C-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the time-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and supportive behaviors (AUC:0.78), while the time-invariant model performed better in predicting suicide-related behaviors and suicide attempt (AUC:0.64). The proposed approach can be integrated with clinical diagnostic interviews for improving suicide risk assessments.",

Despite the international need, the development of these NLP approaches in EHRs has been largely local and not shared across healthcare systems. In this study, we developed a process to share NLP approaches that were individually developed at King\u2019s College London (KCL), UK and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), US - two academic medical centers based in different countries with vastly different healthcare systems. After a successful technical porting of the NLP approaches, our quantitative evaluation determined that independently developed NLP approaches can detect suicidality at another healthcare organization with a different EHR system, clinical documentation processes, and culture, yet do not achieve the same level of success as at the institution where the NLP algorithm was developed (KCL approach: F1-score 0.85 vs. 0.68, WCM approach: F1-score 0.87 vs. 0.72). Shared use of these NLP approaches is a critical step forward towards improving data-driven algorithms for early suicide risk identification and timely prevention.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Objective Social determinants of health (SDoH) are nonclinical dispositions that impact patient health risks and clinical outcomes. Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs. Materials and Methods A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review. Results Smoking status (n\u2009=\u200927), substance use (n\u2009=\u200921), homelessness (n\u2009=\u200920), and alcohol use (n\u2009=\u200915) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n\u2009=\u20097) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n\u2009=\u200913), substance use (n\u2009=\u20099), and alcohol use (n\u2009=\u20099). Conclusion NLP offers significant potential to extract SDoH data from narrative clinical notes, which in turn can aid in the development of screening tools, risk prediction models, and clinical decision support systems.",

            "abstract": "Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in shaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864 patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of patients' SBDoH factors.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Objective Deep significance clustering (DICE) is a self-supervised learning framework. DICE identifies clinically similar and risk-stratified subgroups that neither unsupervised clustering algorithms nor supervised risk prediction algorithms alone are guaranteed to generate. Materials and Methods Enabled by an optimization process that enforces statistical significance between the outcome and subgroup membership, DICE jointly trains 3 components, representation learning, clustering, and outcome prediction while providing interpretability to the deep representations. DICE also allows unseen patients to be predicted into trained subgroups for population-level risk stratification. We evaluated DICE using electronic health record datasets derived from 2 urban hospitals. Outcomes and patient cohorts used include discharge disposition to home among heart failure (HF) patients and acute kidney injury among COVID-19 (Cov-AKI) patients, respectively. Results Compared to baseline approaches including principal component analysis, DICE demonstrated superior performance in the cluster purity metrics: Silhouette score (0.48 for HF, 0.51 for Cov-AKI), Calinski-Harabasz index (212 for HF, 254 for Cov-AKI), and Davies-Bouldin index (0.86 for HF, 0.66 for Cov-AKI), and prediction metric: area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.83 for HF, 0.78 for Cov-AKI). Clinical evaluation of DICE-generated subgroups revealed more meaningful distributions of member characteristics across subgroups, and higher risk ratios between subgroups. Furthermore, DICE-generated subgroup membership alone was moderately predictive of outcomes. Discussion DICE addresses a gap in current machine learning approaches where predicted risk may not lead directly to actionable clinical steps. Conclusion DICE demonstrated the potential to apply in heterogeneous populations, where having the same quantitative risk does not equate with having a similar clinical profile.",
