            "title": "Efficient Use of DALICC in Data Processing Pipelines with Fuzzy License Information",
            "abstract": "Integration of huge amounts of data from various sources forms the basis for many of today\u2019s (web) applications and use cases. In order to be able to reuse, transform, process, analyze, aggregate and re-publish such data, terms of use and license information are particularly important. DALICC provides a very comprehensive database for licenses and offers viable services for license handling that have been made available as open source. In this paper, we outline how DALICC can be used in (web) applications (represented by the project COYPU) in which heterogeneous data from various data sources with different usage conditions are processed. The paper aims to provide feedback on DALICC, to discuss necessary adjustments and present extensions that have been made by us. The overarching objective is to further activate and cooperatively develop the DALICC ecosystem.",

            "title": "Dynamic Representations of Global Crises: Creation and Analysis of a Temporal Knowledge Graph for Conflicts, Trade and Value Networks",
            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to understanding global crises and trade patterns through the creation and analysis of a temporal Knowledge Graph (tKG). Combining data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Global Trade Alerts (GTA), the tKG provides a comprehensive view of the intersection between worldwide crises and global trade over time. The paper details the process of creating the tKG, including the aggregation and merging of information from multiple sources. Additionally, the paper offers insights into the analysis of the tKG and its potential applicability to data-driven Resilience Research. As an initial application, the tKG can be used to predict global trade events, such as trade sanctions across various categories and countries, based on global conflict events, to identify potential trade disruptions and anticipate the economic impact of global conflicts.",

            "abstract": "As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) evolves at an accelerated pace, the critical need to assess and monitor their performance emerges. We introduce a benchmarking framework focused on knowledge graph engineering (KGE) accompanied by three challenges addressing syntax and error correction, facts extraction and dataset generation. We show that while being a useful tool, LLMs are yet unfit to assist in knowledge graph generation with zero-shot prompting. Consequently, our LLM-KG-Bench framework provides automatic evaluation and storage of LLM responses as well as statistical data and visualization tools to support tracking of prompt engineering and model performance.",

            "title": "Semantification of Geospatial Information for Enriched Knowledge Representation in Context of Crisis Informatics",
            "abstract": "In the context of crisis informatics, the integration and exploitation of high volumes of heterogeneous data from multiple sources is one of the big chances as well as challenges up to now. Semantic Web technologies have proven a valuable means to integrate and represent knowledge on the basis of domain concepts which improves interoperability and interpretability of information resources and allows deriving more knowledge via semantic relations and reasoning. In this paper, we investigate the potential of representing and processing geospatial information within the semantic paradigm. We show, on the technical level, how existing open source means can be used and supplemented as to efficiently handle geographic information and to convey exemplary results highly relevant in context of crisis management applications. When given semantic resources get enriched with geospatial information, new information can be retrieved combining the concepts of multi-polygons and geo-coordinates and using the power of GeoSPARQL queries. Custom SPARQL extension functions and data types for JSON, XML and CSV as well as for dialects such as GeoJSON and GML allow for succinct integration of heterogeneous data. We implemented these features for the Apache Jena Semantic Web framework by leveraging its plugin systems. Furthermore, significant improvements w.r.t. GeoSPARQL query performance have been contributed to the framework.",
