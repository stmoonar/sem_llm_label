            "abstract": "The study of community detection in networks has drawn great attention in recent years. To find communities and to understand community semantics, both network topology and network content are utilized. Unfortunately, none of them can explain the driving factors of generating community structure with semantics, which is significant for understanding the mechanisms of community generation. Our observations on a large number of networks show that specific user social behaviors are underlying factors for the generation of community structure. We exploit four types of social behaviors that widely exist in networks, i.e., reciprocity of interactions, posting preference, multitopic preference, and temporal variation of topics. We investigate their impacts on the formation process of links and content in networks, during which communities with topics form. Our analysis shows that they are highly related to community structure. Consequently, a generative community detection model SBCD (social behavior-based community detection) is proposed by combining network topology and content, in which the above social behaviors play a core role. The model is evaluated on two real datasets. The experimental results show that SBCD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, a case study illustrates several significant observations with respect to the proposed social behaviors.",

            "abstract": "The complete semantic representation of a Tibetan sentence is mainly determined by the addition of a specific functional word. The choice of Tibetan functional words is mainly influenced (both explicitly and implicitly) by the sequence of Tibetan suffixes. In this article, we propose an RNN-based Tibetan radical suffix unit (TRSU) to consider this relationship. Specifically, for the Tibetan radical suffix unit-explicit (TRSU-E) method, the fixed suffix in Tibetan is used to determine the virtual functional words. For the Tibetan radical suffix unit-implicit (TRSU-I) method, the decision is assisted by adding a specific suffix. To test the method, we design a standard Tibetan corpus, which consists of different genres. Our experimental results show that the complexity of our method is reduced by up to 22.2% relative to the best baseline. Furthermore, with the hidden semantic information and implicit suffix, TRSU-I outperforms TRSU-E by reducing the perplexity (PPL) by 3%. Moreover, good results are achieved on the English Penn Treebank data set.",

            "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely applied in various fields due to their significant power on processing graph-structured data. Typical GCN and its variants work under a homophily assumption (i.e., nodes with same class are prone to connect to each other), while ignoring the heterophily which exists in many real-world networks (i.e., nodes with different classes tend to form edges). Existing methods deal with heterophily by mainly aggregating higher-order neighborhoods or combing the immediate representations, which leads to noise and irrelevant information in the result. But these methods did not change the propagation mechanism which works under homophily assumption (that is a fundamental part of GCNs). This makes it difficult to distinguish the representation of nodes from different classes. To address this problem, in this paper we design a novel propagation mechanism, which can automatically change the propagation and aggregation process according to homophily or heterophily between node pairs. To adaptively learn the propagation process, we introduce two measurements of homophily degree between node pairs, which is learned based on topological and attribute information, respectively. Then we incorporate the learnable homophily degree into the graph convolution framework, which is trained in an end-to-end schema, enabling it to go beyond the assumption of homophily. More importantly, we theoretically prove that our model can constrain the similarity of representations between nodes according to their homophily degree. Experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that this new approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under heterophily or low homophily, and gains competitive performance under homophily.",

            "abstract": "While most network embedding techniques model the proximity between nodes in a network, recently there has been significant interest in structural embeddings that are based on node equivalences, a notion rooted in sociology: equivalences or positions are collections of nodes that have similar roles\u2014i.e., similar functions, ties or interactions with nodes in other positions\u2014irrespective of their distance or reachability in the network. Unlike the proximity-based methods that are rigorously evaluated in the literature, the evaluation of structural embeddings is less mature. It relies on small synthetic or real networks with labels that are not perfectly defined, and its connection to sociological equivalences has hitherto been vague and tenuous. With new node embedding methods being developed at a breakneck pace, proper evaluation, and systematic characterization of existing approaches will be essential to progress. To fill in this gap, we set out to understand what types of equivalences structural embeddings capture. We are the first to contribute rigorous intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methodology for structural embeddings, along with carefully-designed, diverse datasets of varying sizes. We observe a number of different evaluation variables that can lead to different results (e.g., choice of similarity measure, classifier, and label definitions). We find that degree distributions within nodes\u2019 local neighborhoods can lead to simple yet effective baselines in their own right and guide the future development of structural embedding. We hope that our findings can influence the design of further node embedding methods and also pave the way for more comprehensive and fair evaluation of structural embedding methods.",

            "abstract": "Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research.",

            "abstract": "Community detection has been extensively studied for various applications. Recent research has started to explore node contents to identify semantically meaningful communities. However, links in real networks typically have semantic descriptions and communities of links can better characterize community behaviors than communities of nodes. The second issue in community finding is that the most existing methods assume network topologies and descriptive contents carry the same or compatible information of node group membership, restricting them to one topic per community, which is generally violated in real networks. The third issue is that the existing methods use top ranked words or phrases to label topics when interpreting communities, which is often inadequate for comprehension. To address these issues altogether, we propose a new Bayesian probabilistic approach for modeling real networks and developing an efficient variational algorithm for model inference. Our new method explores the intrinsic correlation between communities and topics to discover link communities and extract semantically meaningful community summaries at the same time. If desired, it is able to derive more than one topical summary per community to provide rich explanations. We present experimental results to show the effectiveness of our new approach and evaluate the method by a case study.",

However, the freshness or timeliness of news has been largely ignored by current news recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach dubbed HyperNews which explicitly models the effect of timeliness on news recommendation. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task of predicting the so-called \"active-time\" that users spend on each news article. Our key finding is that it is beneficial to address the problem of news recommendation together with the related problem of active-time prediction in a multi-task learning framework. Specifically, we train a double-task deep neural network (with a built-in timeliness module) to carry out news recommendation and active-time prediction simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such a \"kill-two-birds-with-one-stone\" solution has seldom been tried in the field of news recommendation before. Our extensive experiments on real-life news datasets have not only confirmed the mutual reinforcement of news recommendation and active-time prediction but also demonstrated significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art news recommendation techniques.",

Second, proper thresholding of the communication range is essential to its superior performance. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed GNN based method outperforms all state-of-the-art benchmarks by far. Such inspiring results are theoretically justified in terms of data aggregation, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) noise removal and low-pass filtering effect, all affected by the threshold for neighbor selection.

However, they typically assume that communities are assortative (i.e. vertices are mostly connected to others within the group), thus they cannot find the generalized community structures, which includes assortative communities, disassortative communities (i.e. most connections are from two groups), or a combination. In addition, they often assume that each group membership corresponds to a single topic, thus they cannot perform well when the contents are not consistent with community structures. To address these two issues, we propose a new Bayesian model and develop an efficient variational inference algorithm for model inference. This model describes the generalized communities and the topical clusters separately, and explores their latent correlation simultaneously to make the two parts mutually reinforcing. Our model is not only robust to the above problems, but also can interpret each community using more than one topic. We validate the robustness of this approach on an artificial benchmark, and analyze its interpretability by a case study. We finally show its superior community detection performance by comparing with eight state-of-the-art algorithms on eight real networks.",

            "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), aiming to obtain node embeddings by integrating high-order neighborhood information through stacked graph convolution layers, have demonstrated great power in many network analysis tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, a fundamental weakness of GCNs, that is, topological limitations, including over-smoothing and local homophily of topology, limits their ability to represent networks. Existing studies for solving these topological limitations typically focus only on the convolution of features on network topology, which inevitably relies heavily on network structure. Moreover, most networks are text-rich, so it is important to integrate not only document-level information, but also the local text information which is particularly significant while often ignored by the existing methods. To solve these limitations, we propose BiTe-GCN, a novel GCN architecture modeling via bidirectional convolution of topology and features on text-rich networks. Specifically, we first transform the original text-rich network into an augmented bi-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the global document-level information and the local text-sequence information from texts. We then introduce discriminative convolution mechanisms, which performs convolution on this augmented bi-typed network, realizing the convolutions of topology and features altogether in the same system, and learning different contributions of these two parts (i.e., network part and text part), automatically for the given learning objectives. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks demonstrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a breakout improvement. Moreover, this architecture can also be applied to several e-commerce search scenes such as JD searching, and experiments on JD dataset show the superiority of the proposed architecture over the related methods.",
