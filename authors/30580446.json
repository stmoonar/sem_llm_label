            "title": "Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models (LLMs)in Learning on Graphs",
            "abstract": "Learning on Graphs has attracted immense attention due to its wide real-world applications. The most popular pipeline for learning on graphs with textual node attributes primarily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and utilizes shallow text embedding as initial node representations, which has limitations in general knowledge and profound semantic understanding. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to possess extensive common knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities that have revolutionized existing workflows to handle text data. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LLMs in graph machine learning, especially the node classification task, and investigate two possible pipelines: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. The former leverages LLMs to enhance nodes' text attributes with their massive knowledge and then generate predictions through GNNs. The latter attempts to directly employ LLMs as standalone predictors. We conduct comprehensive and systematical studies on these two pipelines under various settings. From comprehensive empirical results, we make original observations and find new insights that open new possibilities and suggest promising directions to leverage LLMs for learning on graphs.

            "abstract": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics brings exciting breakthroughs to single-cell analysis by providing physical locations along with gene expression. However, as a cost of the extremely high spatial resolution, the cellular level spatial transcriptomic data suffer significantly from missing values. While a standard solution is to perform imputation on the missing values, most existing methods either overlook spatial information or only incorporate localized spatial context without the ability to capture long-range spatial information. Using multi-head self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding, transformer models can readily grasp the relationship between tokens and encode location information. In this paper, by treating single cells as spatial tokens, we study how to leverage transformers to facilitate spatial tanscriptomics imputation. In particular, investigate the following two key questions: (1) $\\textit{how to encode spatial information of cells in transformers}$, and (2) $\\textit{ how to train a transformer for transcriptomic imputation}$. By answering these two questions, we present a transformer-based imputation framework, SpaFormer, for cellular-level spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms on three large-scale datasets while maintaining superior computational efficiency.",

            "abstract": "A dual motors system, driven by a five-leg voltage source inverter (FLVSI), is considered as a feasible option for low-cost and fault tolerance applications. This article analyzes the effect of angle regulation for a FLVSI driving dual motors combined with an improved predictive control scheme. Firstly, a deadbeat-based model predictive control (DB-MPC) scheme is proposed to realize duty cycle allocation for FLVSI. It coordinates the conflicting switching-states demands of common leg from dual motors and improves the voltage utilization of whole system. Moreover, a broad discussion of angle controller is conducted, which can be employed to regulate the phase angle difference between two motors for minimizing the common leg current or expanding speed range depending on the different control aims. Finally, a simulation model is established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The test results indicate that the proposed DB-MPC scheme has higher output capacity and yields smaller current ripple. The regulation of phase angle can minimize the common leg current or expend the speed range effectively.",

            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

At first, the key features of TTDI, such as voltage vector distribution and common-mode voltage (CMV), are analyzed as the foundation. Accordingly, the basic SVM strategy for TTDI is presented referred to the conventional SVM for the three-phase two-level inverter with star-connected loads. Subsequently, to reduce the CMV during the operation, a CMV reduction-based SVM (RCMVSVM) is proposed for TTDI. In different modulation range, different voltage vectors are selected to modulate, and their sequences are well designed to reduce the CMV. From the simulation verification, it can be found that the amplitude of CMV will be suppressed to one-sixth of the dc-link voltage by the proposed RCMV-SVM. While the counterpart in basic SVM is half of the dc-link voltage, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed RCMV-SVM strategy.",

            "abstract": "Matrix converters (MC) enable direct AC-to-AC power conversion without large DC-link electrolytic capacitors and have been applied to various wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. However, traditional MC-based WPT systems suffer from commutation problems, requiring additional switching strategies to ensure safe operation, which increases the control complexity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel three-phase wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging system based on MC. First, the three-phase AC voltage generated by the MC is directly used to drive the three-phase LCC-compensated WPT circuit, which eliminates the bulky short-life DC-bus capacitor and provides a compact rotational magnetic field. Furthermore, a dedicated modulation method is proposed to realize the frequency coordination of the MC stage and the WPT stage. Accordingly, the system can operate safely without additional commutation strategy. Finally, finite element simulations and circuit simulations are used to verify the analysis and prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

            "abstract": "The recent development of multimodal single-cell technology has made the possibility of acquiring multiple omics data from individual cells, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of cellular states and dynamics. Nevertheless, the proliferation of multimodal single-cell data also introduces tremendous challenges in modeling the complex interactions among different modalities. The recently advanced methods focus on constructing static interaction graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn from multimodal data. However, such static graphs can be suboptimal as they do not take advantage of the downstream task information; meanwhile GNNs also have some inherent limitations when deeply stacking GNN layers. To tackle these issues, in this work, we investigate how to leverage transformers for multimodal single-cell data in an end-to-end manner while exploiting downstream task information. In particular, we propose a scMoFormer framework which can readily incorporate external domain knowledge and model the interactions within each modality and cross modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMoFormer achieves superior performance on various benchmark datasets. Remarkably, scMoFormer won a Kaggle silver medal with the rank of 24/1221 (Top 2%) without ensemble in a NeurIPS 2022 competition1. Our implementation is publicly available at Github2.",

The large volumes of data generated by single-cell technologies are high dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous and have complicated dependency structures, making analyses using conventional machine learning approaches challenging and impractical. In tackling these challenges, deep learning often demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey on deep learning in single-cell analysis. We first introduce background on single-cell technologies and their development, as well as fundamental concepts of deep learning including the most popular deep architectures. We present an overview of the single-cell analytic pipeline pursued in research applications while noting divergences due to data sources or specific applications. We then review seven popular tasks spanning different stages of the single-cell analysis pipeline, including multimodal integration, imputation, clustering, spatial domain identification, cell-type deconvolution, cell segmentation, and cell-type annotation. Under each task, we describe the most recent developments in classical and deep learning methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Deep learning tools and benchmark datasets are also summarized for each task. Finally, we discuss the future directions and the most recent challenges. This survey will serve as a reference for biologists and computer scientists, encouraging collaborations.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal single-cell technologies have enabled simultaneous acquisitions of multiple omics data from the same cell, providing deeper insights into cellular states and dynamics. However, it is challenging to learn the joint representations from the multimodal data, model the relationship between modalities, and, more importantly, incorporate the vast amount of single-modality datasets into the downstream analyses. To address these challenges and correspondingly facilitate multimodal single-cell data analyses, three key tasks have been introduced: Modality prediction, Modality matching andJoint embedding. In this work, we present a general Graph Neural Network framework scMoGNN to tackle these three tasks and show that scMoGNN demonstrates superior results in all three tasks compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches. Our method is an official winner in the overall ranking ofModality prediction from NeurIPS 2021 Competition (https://openproblems.bio/neurips_2021/), and all implementations of our methods have been integrated into DANCE package (https://github.com/OmicsML/dance).",

            "abstract": "Solar forecasting is one of the most promising approaches to address the intermittent photovoltaic (PV) power generation by providing predictions before upcoming ramp events. In this article, a novel multistep forecasting (MSF) scheme is proposed for PV power ramp-rate control (PRRC). This method utilizes an ensemble of deep ConvNets without additional time series models (e.g., recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory) and exogenous variables, thus more suitable for industrial applications. The MSF strategy can make multiple predictions in comparison with a single forecasting point produced by a conventional method while maintaining the same high temporal resolution. Besides, stacked sky images that integrate temporal\u2013spatial information of cloud motions are used to further improve the forecasting performance. The results demonstrate a favorable forecasting accuracy in comparison to the existing forecasting models with the highest skill score of 17.7%. In the PRRC application, the MSF-based PRRC can detect more ramp-rates violations with a higher control rate of 98.9% compared with the conventional forecasting-based control. Thus, the PV generation can be effectively smoothed with less energy curtailment on both clear and cloudy days using the proposed approach.",
