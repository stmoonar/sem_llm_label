            "abstract": "As more and more knowledge graphs (KGs) are published on the Web, there is a need for tools that show their content. This implies showing the schema-level patterns instantiated in the graph, but also the terms used to qualify its entities. In this article, we present a new profiling tool that we call TTprofiler. It shows the predicates that relate types in the KG, and also the terms present in this KG, because of their paramount importance in most KGs, especially in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. We recall the role of terminologies and how they are implemented and used on the Web, we give the algorithm for building a TT profile from an online KG\u2019s endpoint, and we report on experiments performed over a set of Cultural Heritage Web KGs. A tool for visualizing TT profiles is also provided.",

            "abstract": "Large knowledge graphs combine human knowledge garnered from projects ranging from academia and institutions to enterprises and crowdsourcing. Within such graphs, each relationship between two nodes represents a basic fact involving these two entities. The diversity of the semantics of relationships constitutes the richness of knowledge graphs, leading to the emergence of singular topologies, sometimes chaotic in appearance. However, this complex characteristic can be modeled in a simple way by introducing the concept of superficiality, which controls the overlap between relationships whose facts are generated independently. With this model, superficiality also regulates the balance of the global distribution of knowledge by determining the proportion of misdescribed entities. This is the first model for the structure and dynamics of knowledge graphs. It leads to a better understanding of formal knowledge acquisition and organization.",

Utility changes need quick repreprocessing when sampling patterns from large databases. In this context, existing sampling techniques require storing all data in memory, which is costly. To tackle these issues, this work enriches D. Knuth\u2019s trie structure, avoiding 1) the need to access the database to sample since patterns are drawn directly from the enriched trie and 2) the necessity to reprocess the whole dataset when utility changes. We define the trie of occurrences that our first algorithm TPSpace (Trie-based Pattern Space) uses to materialize all of the database patterns. Factorizing transaction prefixes compresses the transactional database. TPSampling (Trie-based Pattern Sampling), our second algorithm, draws patterns from a trie of occurrences under a length-based utility measure. Experiments show that TPSampling produces thousands of patterns in seconds.",

For this purpose, it introduces the contextual reference level to evaluate whether a feature is relevant to compare a set of entities. This measure relies on contexts that are sets of entities similar to the compared entities. Its principle is to favor the features whose values for the compared entities are reference (or frequent) in these contexts. The proposal efficiently evaluates the contextual reference level from a public SPARQL endpoint limited by a fair-use policy. Using a new benchmark based on Wikidata, the experiments show the interest of the contextual reference level for identifying the features deemed relevant by users with high precision and recall. In addition, the proposed optimizations significantly reduce the number of required queries for properties as well as for inverse relations. Interestingly, this experimental study also show that the inverse relations bring out a large number of numerical comparison features.",

            "title": "Sequential Pattern Sampling with Norm Constraints",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the field of pattern mining has shifted to user-centered methods. In such a context, it is necessary to have a tight coupling between the system and the user where mining techniques provide results at any time or within a short response time of only few seconds. Pattern sampling is a non-exhaustive method for instantly discovering relevant patterns that ensures a good interactivity while providing strong statistical guarantees due to its random nature. Curiously, such an approach investigated for itemsets and subgraphs has not yet been applied to sequential patterns, which are useful for a wide range of mining tasks and application fields. In this paper, we propose the first method for sequential pattern sampling. In addition to address sequential data, the originality of our approach is to introduce a constraint on the norm to control the length of the drawn patterns and to avoid the pitfall of the \"long tail\" where the rarest patterns flood the user. We propose a new constrained two-step random procedure, named CSSampling, that randomly draws sequential patterns according to frequency with an interval constraint on the norm. We demonstrate that this method performs an exact sampling. Moreover, despite the use of rejection sampling, the experimental study shows that CSSampling remains efficient and the constraint helps to draw general patterns of the \"head\". We also illustrate how to benefit from these sampled patterns to instantly build an associative classifier dedicated to sequences. This classification approach rivals state of the art proposals showing the interest of constrained sequential pattern sampling.",

            "abstract": "In 1993, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imielinski and Arun N. Swami published one of the founding papers of Pattern Mining: \"Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\". Beyond the introduction to a new problem, it introduced a new methodology in terms of resolution and evaluation. For two decades, Pattern Mining has been one of the most active fields in Knowledge Discovery in Databases. This paper provides a bibliometric survey of the literature relying on 1,087 publications from five major international conferences: KDD, PKDD, PAKDD, ICDM and SDM. We first measured a slowdown of research dedicated to Pattern Mining while the KDD field continues to grow. Then, we quantified the main contributions with respect to languages, constraints and condensed representations to outline the current directions. We observe a sophistication of languages over the last 20 years, although association rules and itemsets are so far the most studied ones. As expected, the minimal support constraint predominates the extraction of patterns with approximately 50% of the publications. Finally, condensed representations used in 10% of the papers had relative success particularly between 2005 and 2008.",

            "abstract": "OncoDoc2 is a guideline-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for breast cancer management. It has been used as an intervention in a randomized controlled trial carried out to evaluate the impact of using a CDSS upon the compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) of multidisciplinary staff meeting decisions. Data mining was used to discover multi-criteria regularities as \"emerging patterns\" (EPs) associated with compliance and non-compliance with CPGs when using and not using OncoDoc2 and to assess which patients may benefit from the use of the CDSS. Decision data was collected from all participating centers. The number of EPs associated with non-compliance is smaller in the intervention arm, which suggests a practice harmonization effect of OncoDoc2. EPs associated with compliant decisions in both arms of the trial correspond to situations well identified in CPGs. EPs associated with non-compliant decisions when the system is not used are associated with compliance when the system is used except in clinical situations where evidence is lacking.",

OncoDoc2 has been routinely used during multidisciplinary staff meetings at the Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) for nearly 3 years. Despite the use of the CDSS that reminds physicians of the recommended treatments, the compliance rate of decisions is not 100%. We have used pattern mining techniques in order to elicit patient clinical profiles associated with non-compliance. We quantified each extracted pattern by three measures (support, growth rate, and unexpected rate) and we introduced a score to prune relevant emerging patterns. Non-compliance has concerned elderly patients in pre-surgery decisions, patients with micro invasive tumor in re-excision decisions, and patients HR+ and Her2+ in adjuvant decisions. In all cases, physician non-compliance with guidelines occurs when scientific evidence is lacking.",

From symbolic / knowledge-based to data-driven / machine-learning systems, many approaches have been experimented. Our work may be viewed as an attempt to bridge the gap from the data-driven perspective back to the knowledge-based one. We use a knowledge-based system, based on manually implemented transducers, that reaches satisfactory performances. It has the undisputable advantage of being modular. However, such a hand-crafted system requires substantial efforts to cope with dedicated tasks. In this context, we implemented a pattern extractor that extracts symbolic knowledge, using hierarchical sequential pattern mining over annotated corpora. To assess the accuracy of mined patterns, we designed a module that recognizes Named Entities in texts by determining their most probable boundaries. Instead of considering Named Entity Recognition as a labeling task, it relies on complex context-aware features provided by lower-level systems and considers the tagging task as a markovian process. Using thos systems, coupling knowledge-based system with extracted patterns is straightforward and leads to a competitive hybrid NE-tagger. We report experiments using this system and compare it to other hybridization strategies along with a baseline CRF model.",

Nevertheless, the extremely large collection of generated patterns hampers the end-user interpretation and the deep understanding of the knowledge revealed by the whole collection of patterns. The key idea of this paper is to summarize the contrasts of a dataset in order to provide understandable characterizations of data classes. We first introduce a novel framework, called recursive pattern mining, for only discovering few as well as relevant patterns. We demonstrate that this approach encompasses usual pattern mining framework and we study its key properties. Then, we use recursive pattern mining for extracting k recursive emerging patterns. Taken together, these patterns form a REP k-summary which summarizes the contrasts of the dataset. Finally, we validate our approach on benchmarks and real-world applications on the biological domain, showing the efficiency and the usefulness of the approach.",

            "abstract": "Pattern discovery is at the core of numerous data mining tasks. Although many methods focus on efficiency in pattern mining, they still suffer from the problem of choosing a threshold that influences the final extraction result. The goal of our study is to make the results of pattern mining useful from a user-preference point of view. To this end, we integrate into the pattern discovery process the idea of skyline queries in order to mine skyline patterns in a threshold-free manner. Because the skyline patterns satisfy a formal property of dominations, they not only have a global interest but also have semantics that are easily understood by the user. In this work, we first establish theoretical relationships between pattern condensed representations and skyline pattern mining. We also show that it is possible to compute automatically a subset of measures involved in the user query which allows the patterns to be condensed and thus facilitates the computation of the skyline patterns. This forms the basis for a novel approach to mining skyline patterns. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach over several data sets including a use case from chemo informatics and show that small sets of dominant patterns are produced under various measures.",

The limitations of the task lies in languages being limited to describe the mined patterns and the ability to express varied constraints. In practice, current approaches focus on a language and the most generic frameworks mine individually or simultaneously a monotone and an anti-monotone constraints. In this paper, we propose a generic framework dealing with any partially ordered language and a large set of constraints. We prove that this set of constraints called primitive-based constraints not only is a superclass of both kinds of monotone ones and their boolean combinations but also other classes such as convertible and succinct constraints. We show that the primitive-based constraints can be efficiently mined thanks to a relaxation method based on virtual patterns which summarize the specificities of the search space. Indeed, this approach automatically deduces pruning conditions having suitable monotone properties and thus these conditions can be pushed into usual constraint mining algorithms. We study the optimal relaxations. Finally, we provide an experimental illustration of the efficiency of our proposal by experimenting it on several contexts.",

            "abstract": "Classification is an important field of data mining problems. Given a set of labeled training examples the classification task constructs a classifier. A classifier is a global model which is used to predict the class label for data objects that are unlabeled. Many approaches have been proposed for the classification problem. Among them, rule-induction, associative and instance-centric approaches have been closely integrated with constraint-based data mining. There also exist several classification methods based on each of these approaches, e.g. AQ, CBA and HAR-MONY respectively. Moreover, each classification method may provide one or more algorithms that exploit particular local pattern extraction techniques to construct a classifier. In this paper, we proposed a generic classification framework that encompasses all the mentioned approaches. Based on our framework we present a formal context to define basic concepts, operators for classifier construction, composition of classifiers, and class prediction. Moreover, we proposed a generic classifier construction algorithm (ICCA) that incrementally constructs a classifier using the proposed operators. This algorithm is generic in the sense that it can uniformly represent a large class of existing classification algorithms. We also present the properties under which different optimization possibilities are provided in the generic algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Current analyses of co-expressed genes are often based on global approaches such as clustering or bi-clustering. An alternative way is to employ local methods and search for patterns--sets of genes displaying specific expression properties in a set of situations. The main bottleneck of this type of analysis is twofold--computational costs and an overwhelming number of candidate patterns which can hardly be further exploited. A timely application of background knowledge available in literature databases, biological ontologies and other sources can help to focus on the most plausible patterns only. The paper proposes, implements and tests a flexible constraint-based framework that enables the effective mining and representation of meaningful over-expression patterns representing intrinsic associations among genes and biological situations. The framework can be simultaneously applied to a wide spectrum of genomic data and we demonstrate that it allows to generate new biological hypotheses with clinical implications.",

            "abstract": "The discovery of biologically interpretable knowledge from gene expression data is one of the largest contemporary genomic challenges. As large volumes of expression data are being generated, there is a great need for automated tools that provide the means to analyze them. However, the same tools can provide an overwhelming number of candidate hypotheses which can hardly be manually exploited by an expert. An additional knowledge helping to focus automatically on the most plausible candidates only can up-value the experiment significantly. Background knowledge available in literature databases, biological ontologies and other sources can be used for this purpose. In this paper we propose and verify a methodology that enables to effectively mine and represent meaningful over-expression patterns. Each pattern represents a bi-set of a gene group over-expressed in a set of biological situations. The originality of the framework consists in its constraint-based nature and an effective cross-fertilization of constraints based on expression data and background knowledge. The result is a limited set of candidate patterns that are most likely interpretable by biologists. Supplemental automatic interpretations serve to ease this process. Various constraints can generate plausible pattern sets of different characteristics",

Their mining is known to be dif\ufb01cult, because of the huge size of the search space, exponentially growing with the number of attributes. Unfortunately, most studies about pattern mining do not address the dif\ufb01culty of the task, and provide their own algorithm. In this paper, we propose some new results about the average number of frequent patterns, by using probabilistic techniques and we extend these results to the number of closed patterns. In a \ufb01rst step, the probabilistic model is simple and far from the real life since the attributes and the objects are considered independent. Nevertheless according to this model, frequency threshold phenomena observed in practice are explained. We also prove that, for a \ufb01xed threshold, the number of frequent patterns is asymptotically exponential in the number of attributes and polynomial in the number of objects whereas, for a frequency threshold proportional to the number of objects, the number of frequent and closed patterns is asymptotically polynomial in the number of attributes without depending on the number of objects.",

The number of these patterns represents a great interest. The lower bound is known to be constant whereas the upper bound is exponential, but both situations correspond to pathological cases. For the first time, we give an average analysis of the number of frequent or closed patterns. Average analysis is often closer to real situations and gives more information about the role of the parameters. In this paper, two probabilistic models are studied: a Bernoulli and a Markovian. In both models and for large databases, we prove that the number of frequent patterns, for a fixed frequency threshold, is exponential in the number of items and polynomial in the number of transactions. On the other hand, for a proportional frequency threshold, the number of frequent patterns is polynomial in the number of items and does not involve the number of transactions. Finally, we prove in the Bernoulli model that the number of closed patterns, for a proportional frequency threshold, is polynomial in the number of items.",
