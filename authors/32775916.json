            "abstract": "Since it is difficult to obtain the number of sources accurately in practical situations, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods without the number of sources are very much needed for noncooperative targets and maritime attack-defense pairings. In this article, a DOA estimation method using acoustic vector sensors (AVSs) without a known number of sources is proposed. First, a reference matrix is introduced, and the eigenvalues corresponding to the noise of this matrix converge to 0. Next, a scanning matrix containing the scanning sources is created, and the analysis of noise power invariance is used to determine the power selection method of the scanning sources. The ordering law of the eigenvalues of the source matrix scanned at different angles is applied, and the purpose of estimating DOA without the number of sources is accomplished. The proposed algorithm is capable of performing DOA estimation in situations where the number of sources is uncertain and it does not rely on the array structure, which means it can be used for arbitrary arrays. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified by simulation and experiment.",

            "title": "A Novel Method to Design Steerable Differential Beamformer Using Linear Acoustics Vector Sensor Array",
            "abstract": "Differential beamforming techniques have gained significant attention due to their frequency-independent beampatterns, applicability for small apertures, and super-directivity. It is commonly known that the main lobe of a beam pattern based on a linear array is typically aligned with the end-fire direction. However, in some application scenarios, aligning the main lobe in the end-fire direction may not meet the actual requirements. This article focuses on studying the steering problem of differential beamformers based on linear acoustics vector sensor arrays (LAVSs). We propose a steerable differential beamformer for LAVSs, which addresses the problem of non-steerable beam patterns of linear arrays. Our approach involves approximating the beam pattern using a series expansion of the weighted steering vector to achieve frequency-independent differential directivity. The major contributions of this article include, but are not limited to, the following: First, we derive the first-order to third-order differential directivity based on the acoustics vector sensor (AVS) signal model, and obtain the weights of the corresponding channels using the least squares method. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of the steering differential beamformer, demonstrating that the maximum directivity factor (DF) is a function of the steering angle. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Although traditional subspace direction of arrival (DOA) algorithms enable super-resolution, the algorithm performance declines sharply when the number of sources is incorrectly estimated. This article proposes a new DOA estimation method as an optimization problem similar to the conventional minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) that fully considers the eigenvalues ranking problem. After a mathematical derivation, a concise DOA estimation expression is given based on the mapping between eigenvalues. As the algorithm considers the relative ranking of eigenvalues, the number of sources is not required for DOA estimations. Therefore, the performance of the algorithm does not degrade due to incorrect estimations in the number of sources. To enhance the algorithm performance, this article analyzes the reasons for the formation of pseudo peaks based on the eigenvalues and gives the corresponding boundary conditions. Based on the analysis of white noise, in order to overcome the influence of color noise, this article gives a way to deal with color noise. Finally, the theory of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulation experiments, and its performance is demonstrated through comparative experiments with MUSIC under white and color noise.",

The proposed method is utilized through ranking the eigenvalue of specific covariance matrix to get the smallest eigenvalue and construct a new spatial spectrum.

However, in this method, matrix decomposition is required for each search angle. Therefore, in this paper, real-valued processing is used to reduce the scanning range by half, which is less effective in algorithm complexity. The super-resolution algorithm mainly uses the conservation of energy. By exploring the relationship between the covariance matrix and its complex conjugate, we constructed the real-valued matrix and introduced a real-valued searching source to make the operation of the matrix real-valued. Finally, the simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only reduces the spectral search range by half but also has a higher angular resolution than the traditional algorithm.",
