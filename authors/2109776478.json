            "title": "Learning Economic Indicators by Aggregating Multi-Level Geospatial Information",
            "abstract": "High-resolution daytime satellite imagery has become a promising source to study economic activities. These images display detailed terrain over large areas and allow zooming into smaller neighborhoods. Existing methods, however, have utilized images only in a single-level geographical unit. This research presents a deep learning model to predict economic indicators via aggregating traits observed from multiple levels of geographical units. The model first measures hyperlocal economy over small communities via ordinal regression. The next step extracts district-level features by summarizing interconnection among hyperlocal economies. In the final step, the model estimates economic indicators of districts via aggregating the hyperlocal and district information. Our new multi-level learning model substantially outperforms strong baselines in predicting key indicators such as population, purchasing power, and energy consumption. The model is also robust against data shortage; the trained features from one country can generalize to other countries when evaluated with data gathered from Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. We discuss the multi-level model's implications for measuring inequality, which is the essential first step in policy and social science research on inequality and poverty.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection aims at identifying deviant instances from the normal data distribution. Many advances have been made in the field, including the innovative use of unsupervised contrastive learning. However, existing methods generally assume clean training data and are limited when the data contain unknown anomalies. This paper presents Elsa, a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection approach that unifies the concept of energy-based models with unsupervised contrastive learning. Elsa instills robustness against any data contamination by a carefully designed fine-tuning step based on the new energy function that forces the normal data to be divided into classes of prototypes. Experiments on multiple contamination scenarios show the proposed model achieves SOTA performance. Extensive analyses also verify the contribution of each component in the proposed model. Beyond the experiments, we also offer a theoretical interpretation of why contrastive learning alone cannot detect anomalies under data contamination.",

            "abstract": "COVID-19 has become one of the most widely talked about topics on social media. This research characterizes risk communication patterns by analyzing the public discourse on the novel coronavirus from four Asian countries: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India, which suffered the outbreak to different degrees. The temporal analysis shows that the official epidemic phases issued by governments do not match well with the online attention on COVID-19. This finding calls for a need to analyze the public discourse by new measures, such as topical dynamics. Here, we propose an automatic method to detect topical phase transitions and compare similarities in major topics across these countries over time. We examine the time lag difference between social media attention and confirmed patient counts. For dynamics, we find an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topical diversity.",

This study presents a computational framework for predicting sleep efficiency of insomnia sufferers. A smart band experiment is conducted to collect heterogeneous data, including sleep records, daily activities, and demographics, whose missing values are imputed via Improved Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (Imp-GAIN). Equipped with the imputed data, we predict sleep efficiency of individual users with a proposed interpretable LSTM-Attention (LA Block) neural network model. We also propose a model, Pairwise Learning-based Ranking Generation (PLRG), to rank users with high insomnia potential in the next day. We discuss implications of our findings from the perspective of a psychiatric practitioner. Our computational framework can be used for other applications that analyze and handle noisy and incomplete time-series human activity data in the domain of precision psychiatry.",
