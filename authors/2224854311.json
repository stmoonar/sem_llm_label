            "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), selecting high-quality data for fine-tuning is essential. This paper focuses on task-specific data pruning and selection to enhance fine-tuning. We introduce an innovative framework, termed P3, which improves LLM performance through a dynamic, adaptive training strategy. Specifically, P3 comprises the following components: (1) Policy-driven Difficulty Measurement: we begin by measuring the difficulty of data based on the model's real-time performance, transitioning from static, predefined metrics to more dynamic and adaptable ones. (2) Pace-adaptive Selection: we employ self-paced learning (SPL) to gradually select increasingly challenging data, thereby progressively enhancing the model's performance. (3) Diversity Promotion: we integrate Determinantal Point Process (DPP) into the selection process to promote the diversity within and between samples, enriching the learning process. We have validated our method on two well-known LLM datasets, APPS and MATH, designed for logical reasoning scenarios. The results show that our P3 framework significantly improves training outcomes compared to traditional methods. By fundamentally refining data selection and utilization strategies, P3 not only advances theoretical understanding of dynamic training approaches but also provides a versatile framework that can revolutionize model training in natural language processing.",

            "title": "TRAD: Enhancing LLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned Decision",
            "abstract": "Numerous large language model (LLM) agents have been built for different tasks like web navigation and online shopping due to LLM's wide knowledge and text-understanding ability. Among these works, many of them utilize in-context examples to achieve generalization without the need for fine-tuning, while few of them have considered the problem of how to select and effectively utilize these examples. Recently, methods based on trajectory-level retrieval with task meta-data and using trajectories as in-context examples have been proposed to improve the agent's overall performance in some sequential decision making tasks. However, these methods can be problematic due to plausible examples retrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input with plenty of irrelevant context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (TRAD) to address these issues. TRAD first conducts Thought Retrieval, achieving step-level demonstration selection via thought matching, leading to more helpful demonstrations and less irrelevant input noise. Then, TRAD introduces Aligned Decision, complementing retrieved demonstration steps with their previous or subsequent steps, which enables tolerance for imperfect thought and provides a choice for balance between more context and less noise. Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks show that TRAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art models but also effectively helps in reducing noise and promoting generalization. Furthermore, TRAD has been deployed in real-world scenarios of a global business insurance company and improves the success rate of robotic process automation.",

            "abstract": "Real-Time Bidding (RTB) has shown remarkable success in display advertising and has been employed in other advertising scenarios, e.g., sponsored search advertising with multiple ad slots. Many current RTB techniques built for single-slot display advertising are thus no longer applicable, especially in the bid landscape forecasting. Landscape forecasting predicts market competition, including the highest bid price and winning probability, which is preliminary and crucial for the subsequent bidding strategy design. In the multi-slot advertising, predicting the winning prices for each position requires a more precise differentiation of bids among top advertisers. Furthermore, defining the winning probability and addressing censorship issues are not as straightforward as in the case of a single slot. In view of these challenges, how to forecast the bidding landscape in the multi-slot environment remains open. In this work, we are the first to study the landscape forecasting problem in multi-slot RTB, considering the correlation between ad slots in the same pageview. Specifically, we formulate the research topic into two subproblems: predicting the distribution of the winning price and predicting the winning probability of the bid price for each position. Based on the observation from the production data and survival analysis techniques, we propose a deep recurrent model to predict the distribution of the winning price as well as the winning probability for each position. A comprehensive loss function is proposed to learn from the censoring data. Experiments on two public semi-synthetic datasets and one private industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Multi-tenancy in public clouds may lead to co-location interference on shared resources, which possibly results in performance degradation of cloud applications. Cloud providers want to know when such events happen and how serious the degradation is, to perform interference-aware migrations and alleviate the problem. However, virtual machines (VM) in Infrastructure-as-a-Service public clouds are black boxes to providers, where application-level performance information cannot be acquired. This makes performance monitoring intensely challenging as cloud providers can only rely on low-level metrics such as CPU usage and hardware counters.We propose a novel machine learning framework, Alioth, to monitor the performance degradation of cloud applications. To feed the data-hungry models, we first elaborate interference generators and conduct comprehensive co-location experiments on a testbed to build Alioth-dataset which reflects the complexity and dynamicity in real-world scenarios. Then we construct Alioth by (1) augmenting features via recovering low-level metrics under no interference using denoising auto-encoders, (2) devising a transfer learning model based on domain adaptation neural network to make models generalize on test cases unseen in offline training, and (3) developing a SHAP explainer to automate feature selection and enhance model interpretability. Experiments show that Alioth achieves an average mean absolute error of 5.29% offline and 10.8% when testing on applications unseen in the training stage, outperforming the baseline methods. Alioth is also robust in signaling quality-of-service violation under dynamicity. Finally, we demonstrate a possible application of Alioth\u2019s interpretability, providing insights to benefit the decision-making of cloud operators. The dataset and code of Alioth have been released on GitHub.",
