            "title": "Bidirectional Gated Mamba for Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In various domains, Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) have become essential due to their superior capability to discern intricate user preferences. Typically, SRS utilize transformer-based architectures to forecast the subsequent item within a sequence. Nevertheless, the quadratic computational complexity inherent in these models often leads to inefficiencies, hindering the achievement of real-time recommendations. Mamba, a recent advancement, has exhibited exceptional performance in time series prediction, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. However, integrating Mamba directly into SRS poses several challenges. Its inherently unidirectional nature may constrain the model's capacity to capture the full context of user-item interactions, while its instability in state estimation can compromise its ability to detect short-term patterns within interaction sequences. To overcome these issues, we introduce a new framework named Selective Gated Mamba (SIGMA) for Sequential Recommendation. This framework leverages a Partially Flipped Mamba (PF-Mamba) to construct a bidirectional architecture specifically tailored to improve contextual modeling. Additionally, an input-sensitive Dense Selective Gate (DS Gate) is employed to optimize directional weights and enhance the processing of sequential information in PF-Mamba. For short sequence modeling, we have also developed a Feature Extract GRU (FE-GRU) to efficiently capture short-term dependencies. Empirical results indicate that SIGMA outperforms current models on five real-world datasets. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/ziwliu-cityu/SIMGA to ease reproducibility.",

            "title": "MultiFS: Automated Multi-Scenario Feature Selection in Deep Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Multi-scenario recommender systems (MSRSs) have been increasingly used in real-world industrial platforms for their excellent advantages in mitigating data sparsity and reducing maintenance costs. However, conventional MSRSs usually use all relevant features indiscriminately and ignore that different kinds of features have varying importance under different scenarios, which may cause confusion and performance degradation. In addition, existing feature selection methods for deep recommender systems may lack the exploration of scenario relations. In this paper, we propose a novel automated multi-scenario feature selection (MultiFS) framework to bridge this gap, which is able to consider scenario relations and utilize a hierarchical gating mechanism to select features for each scenario. Specifically, MultiFS first efficiently obtains feature importance across all the scenarios through a scenario-shared gate. Then, some scenario-specific gate aims to identify feature importance to individual scenarios from a subset of the former with lower importance. Subsequently, MultiFS imposes constraints on the two gates to make the learning mechanism more feasible and combines the two to select exclusive features for different scenarios. We evaluate MultiFS and demonstrate its ability to enhance the multi-scenario model performance through experiments over two public multi-scenario benchmarks.",

            "title": "Large Language Models Enhanced Sequential Recommendation for Long-tail User and Item",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation systems (SRS) serve the purpose of predicting users' subsequent preferences based on their past interactions and have been applied across various domains such as e-commerce and social networking platforms. However, practical SRS encounters challenges due to the fact that most users engage with only a limited number of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. These challenges, termed as the long-tail user and long-tail item dilemmas, often create obstacles for traditional SRS methods. Mitigating these challenges is crucial as they can significantly impact user satisfaction and business profitability. While some research endeavors have alleviated these issues, they still grapple with issues such as seesaw or noise stemming from the scarcity of interactions. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue to address these challenges from a semantic standpoint. In this study, we introduce the Large Language Models Enhancement framework for Sequential Recommendation (LLM-ESR), which leverages semantic embeddings from LLMs to enhance SRS performance without increasing computational overhead. To combat the long-tail item challenge, we propose a dual-view modeling approach that fuses semantic information from LLMs with collaborative signals from traditional SRS. To address the long-tail user challenge, we introduce a retrieval augmented self-distillation technique to refine user preference representations by incorporating richer interaction data from similar users. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on three authentic datasets using three widely used SRS models, our proposed enhancement framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methodologies.",

            "abstract": "Deep Recommender Systems (DRS) are increasingly dependent on a large number of feature fields for more precise recommendations. Effective feature selection methods are consequently becoming critical for further enhancing the accuracy and optimizing storage efficiencies to align with the deployment demands. This research area, particularly in the context of DRS, is nascent and faces three core challenges. Firstly, variant experimental setups across research papers often yield unfair comparisons, obscuring practical insights. Secondly, the existing literature's lack of detailed analysis on selection attributes, based on large-scale datasets and a thorough comparison among selection techniques and DRS backbones, restricts the generalizability of findings and impedes deployment on DRS. Lastly, research often focuses on comparing the peak performance achievable by feature selection methods, an approach that is typically computationally infeasible for identifying the optimal hyperparameters and overlooks evaluating the robustness and stability of these methods. To bridge these gaps, this paper presents ERASE, a comprehensive bEnchmaRk for feAture SElection for DRS. ERASE comprises a thorough evaluation of eleven feature selection methods, covering both traditional and deep learning approaches, across four public datasets, private industrial datasets, and a real-world commercial platform, achieving significant enhancement.

            "abstract": "Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) are extensively applied across various domains to predict users' next interaction by modeling their interaction sequences. However, these systems typically grapple with the long-tail problem, where they struggle to recommend items that are less popular. This challenge results in a decline in user discovery and reduced earnings for vendors, negatively impacting the system as a whole. Large Language Model (LLM) has the potential to understand the semantic connections between items, regardless of their popularity, positioning them as a viable solution to this dilemma. In our paper, we present LLMEmb, an innovative technique that harnesses LLM to create item embeddings that bolster the performance of SRS. To align the capabilities of general-purpose LLM with the needs of the recommendation domain, we introduce a method called Supervised Contrastive Fine-Tuning (SCFT). This method involves attribute-level data augmentation and a custom contrastive loss designed to tailor LLM for enhanced recommendation performance. Moreover, we highlight the necessity of incorporating collaborative filtering signals into LLM-generated embeddings and propose Recommendation Adaptation Training (RAT) for this purpose. RAT refines the embeddings to be optimally suited for SRS. The embeddings derived from LLMEmb can be easily integrated with any SRS model, showcasing its practical utility. Extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets has shown that LLMEmb significantly improves upon current methods when applied across different SRS models.",

However, most existing transformer-based SRS frameworks retain the vanilla attention mechanism, which calculates the attention scores between all item-item pairs. With this setting, redundant item interactions can harm the model performance and consume much computation time and memory. In this paper, we identify the sparse attention phenomenon in transformer-based SRS models and propose Sparse Transformer for sequential Recommendation tasks (STRec) to achieve the efficient computation and improved performance. Specifically, we replace self-attention with cross-attention, making the model concentrate on the most relevant item interactions. To determine these necessary interactions, we design a novel sampling strategy to detect relevant items based on temporal information. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of STRec, which achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing 54% inference time and 70% memory cost. We also provide massive extended experiments to further investigate the property of our framework.",

            "abstract": "Historical user-item interaction datasets are essential in training modern recommender systems for predicting user preferences. However, the arbitrary user behaviors in most recommendation scenarios lead to a large volume of noisy data instances being recorded, which cannot fully represent their true interests. While a large number of denoising studies are emerging in the recommender system community, all of them suffer from highly dynamic data distributions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework, AutoDenoise, with an Instance Denoising Policy Network, for denoising data instances with an instance selection manner in deep recommender systems. To be specific, AutoDenoise serves as an agent in DRL to adaptively select noise-free and predictive data instances, which can then be utilized directly in training representative recommendation models. In addition, we design an alternate two-phase optimization strategy to train and validate the AutoDenoise properly. In the searching phase, we aim to train the policy network with the capacity of instance denoising; in the validation phase, we find out and evaluate the denoised subset of data instances selected by the trained policy network, so as to validate its denoising ability. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of AutoDenoise combined with multiple representative recommender system models.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become increasingly important in our daily lives since they play an important role in mitigating the information overload problem, especially in many user-oriented online services. Recommender systems aim to identify a set of items that best match users' explicit or implicit preferences, by utilizing the user and item interactions to improve the accuracy. With the fast advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the past few decades, recommendation techniques have achieved promising performance. However, we still meet three inherent challenges to design deep recommender systems (DRS): 1) the majority of existing DRS are developed based on hand-crafted components, which requires ample expert knowledge recommender systems; 2) human error and bias can lead to suboptimal components, which reduces the recommendation effectiveness; 3) non-trivial time and engineering efforts are usually required to design the task-specific components in different recommendation scenarios. In this tutorial, we aim to give a comprehensive survey on the recent progress of advanced Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques for solving the above problems in deep recommender systems. More specifically, we will present feature selection, feature embedding search, feature interaction search, and whole DRS pipeline model training and comprehensive search for deep recommender systems. In this way, we expect academic researchers and industrial practitioners in related fields can get deep understanding and accurate insight into the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of technologies in recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Multi-task Recommender Systems (MTRSs) has become increasingly prevalent in a variety of real-world applications due to their exceptional training efficiency and recommendation quality. However, conventional MTRSs often input all relevant feature fields without distinguishing their contributions to different tasks, which can lead to confusion and a decline in performance. Existing feature selection methods may neglect task relations or require significant computation during model training in multi-task setting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Single-shot Feature Selection framework for MTRSs, referred to as MultiSFS, which is capable of selecting feature fields for each task while considering task relations in a single-shot manner. Specifically, MultiSFS first efficiently obtains task-specific feature importance through a single forward-backward pass. Then, a data-task bipartite graph is constructed to learn field-level task relations. Subsequently, MultiSFS merges the feature importance according to task relations and selects feature fields for different tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness and properties of MultiSFS, we integrate it with representative MTRS models and evaluate on three real-world datasets. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.",
