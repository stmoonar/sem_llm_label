            "title": "Named Entity Location Prediction Combining Twitter and Web",
            "abstract": "Knowledge bases are critical to many applications. However, they are greatly incomplete. Enriching knowledge bases with new entities and new location attributes becomes increasingly important. Given a named entity with tweets and Web documents where the entity appears, we aim to predict the entity city-level location combining the geographical location knowledge embedded in both Twitter and Web. This task is helpful for knowledge base enrichment and tweet location prediction. In this paper we propose NELPTW, the first unsupervised framework for <underline><bold>N</bold></underline>amed <underline><bold>E</bold></underline>ntity <underline><bold>L</bold></underline>ocation <underline><bold>P</bold></underline>rediction by leveraging the knowledge from <underline><bold>T</bold></underline>witter and <underline><bold>W</bold></underline>eb. Based on each data source, NELPTW utilizes a linear function ranking model to generate several rankings to the candidate location set for each entity. To combine the knowledge from two sources which have different reliability and importance for the location prediction, an unsupervised rank aggregation algorithm is developed to aggregate multiple rankings for each entity to obtain a better ranking. A learning algorithm based on the EM method is proposed to automatically learn the parameters of the ranking model without requiring any training labels. The experimental results over a real world Twitter and Web data set show that our framework significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of accuracy.",

            "title": "Entity Linking Meets Deep Learning: Techniques and Solutions",
            "abstract": "Entity linking (EL) is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in web text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. EL plays an important role in the fields of knowledge engineering and data mining, underlying a variety of downstream applications such as knowledge base population, content analysis, relation extraction, and question answering. In recent years, deep learning (DL), which has achieved tremendous success in various domains, has also been leveraged in EL methods to surpass traditional machine learning based methods and yield the state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing DL based EL methods. First of all, we propose a new taxonomy, which organizes existing DL based EL methods using three axes: embedding, feature, and algorithm. Then we systematically survey the representative EL methods along the three axes of the taxonomy. Later, we introduce ten commonly used EL data sets and give a quantitative performance analysis of DL based EL methods over these data sets. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing methods and highlight some promising future directions.",
