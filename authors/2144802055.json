            "abstract": "Due to the challenging conditions of underwater environments, such as node mobility and large-scale networks, achieving localization in large-scale mobile underwater sensor networks (UWSN) is a difficult task. This paper introduces a scheme known as the Flexible Localization Method with Mobility Estimation (FLMME) for UWSNs by utilizing the expected mobility patterns of underwater objects. FLMME performs localization hierarchically by splitting the process into anchor and ordinary node localization. Each node estimates its next mobility pattern based on previous location information, enabling estimates about its next location. Anchor nodes, holding known locations, manage the localization process to balance accuracy and error trade-offs. Extensive simulations demonstrate that FLMME reduces localization errors and hence increases localization accuracy.",

            "title": "RBEER: Rule-Based Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol for Large-Scale UWSNs",
            "abstract": "Recently, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have seen increasing popularity owing to their extensive applications in aquatic environments, including monitoring underwater pipelines, detecting pollution and disasters, researching marine life, underwater surveillance, and facilitating military surveillance. In fact, the task of devising an adequate routing algorithm is particularly challenging because of the unique underwater environmental conditions. These challenges include energy constraints, dynamic topology, long propagation delays, bandwidth limitations, mobility, and 3-D deployments. Therefore, this study addresses the aforementioned challenges and proposes RBEER, a rule-based energy-efficient routing protocol for large-scale UWSNs. RBEER works in three steps: the first is the network initialization and network clustering, in which a Fuzzy C-means is utilized to perform the clustering and determine the cluster centers. The second step is using the RISE rule-based classifier to select the optimal cluster head (CH) based on five input parameters to generate the set of rules. The last step is data forwarding, in which data is forwarded through a single-hop intra-cluster path from member nodes to CH nodes, then through a multi-hop inter-cluster path from CH nodes to sink nodes. Extensive simulations and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RBEER protocol. The results demonstrate that the RBEER protocol outperforms benchmarks regarding packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption.",

            "abstract": "Breakthroughs in Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) technologies have revitalized Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs). However, how to schedule mobile chargers rationally has been quite a tricky problem. Most of the current work does not consider the variability of scenarios and how many mobile chargers should be scheduled as the most appropriate for each dispatch. At the same time, the focus of most work on the mobile charger scheduling problem has always been on reducing the number of dead nodes, and the most critical metric of network performance, packet arrival rate, is relatively neglected. In this paper, we develop a DRL-based Partial Charging (DPC) algorithm. Based on the number and urgency of charging requests, we classify charging requests into four scenarios. And for each scenario, we design a corresponding request allocation algorithm. Then, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train a decision model using environmental information to select which request allocation algorithm is optimal for the current scenario. After the allocation of charging requests is confirmed, to improve the Quality of Service (QoS), i.e., the packet arrival rate of the entire network, a partial charging scheduling algorithm is designed to maximize the total charging duration of nodes in the ideal state while ensuring that all charging requests are completed. In addition, we analyze the traffic information of the nodes and use the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the importance of the nodes to compensate for the inaccurate estimation of the node\u2019s remaining lifetime in realistic scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms regarding the number of alive nodes and packet arrival rate.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "abstract": "Control- and User-Plane Separation (CUPS) and Space Cellular Networks (SCNs) are promising solutions for delivering ubiquitous connectivity and high-traffic wireless services on a global scale. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of CUPS in the separation networks' coverage and data service functions has not been fully leveraged in enabling reliable connectivity. In this paper, we propose a CUPS-enabled Integrated Space-Ground Cellular Network (CUPS-ISGCN). Specifically, Control Base Stations (CBSs) are optimized by deploying them on the space layer to form the Control Plane (CP) and increase coverage for more users over a wide area. Meanwhile, Traffic Base Stations (TBSs) located on the ground layer form the User Plane (UP) and deliver high bit rates within the coverage area of the CP. To maximize CP coverage and improve UP efficiency, we introduce CUPS-enabled SCN into the CP and provide the analytical models to analyze the performance of the CUPS-ISGCN in terms of CP coverage and UP efficiency. By using stochastic geometry, we derive the general closed-form expressions for CP coverage. Then, we thoroughly study UP's performance as a function of the channel parameters between 2-planes, CP and UP. Based on the analysis results, it's proved that the proposed CUPS-ISGCN structure improved the CP coverage performance and UP efficiency.",

            "title": "New Array Designs for DoA Estimation of Non-Circular Signals With Reduced Mutual Coupling",
            "abstract": "Recently, many sparse arrays are proposed to achieve increased uniform degrees of freedom (uDoFs) for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of non-circular sources. In light of this recent attention, the high number of uDoFs is the primary motivation for designing those sparse array structures. Although both the number of uDoF and mutual coupling can influence the DoA estimation performance. However, mutual coupling is not considered in many of those sparse array configurations. In this article, two optimized shifted coprime arrays with sum-difference coarrays, called OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II, are proposed to reduce mutual coupling. The OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II are obtained by rearranging actual sensors of the augmented coprime array. The proposed array designs have closed-form expressions for their sensor locations and achievable uDoFs. Additionally, it is proven that the first three weights of OSCAwSDCa-II are independent of the array size. Moreover, the number of virtual sensors co-locating at the same lag is reduced. Consequently, smaller weight values are obtained, resulting in more robustness against mutual coupling. Finally, extensive simulations show that OSCAwSDCa-I and OSCAwSDCa-II can achieve comparable uDoFs concerning the existing array structures. In the presence of strong mutual coupling, simulation results demonstrate the robustness of OSCAwSDCa-II more than other compared configurations.",

            "title": "TBDD: Territory-Bound Data Delivery for Large-Scale Mobile Sink Wireless Sensor Networks",
            "abstract": "The hierarchical structure-based data dissemination is the most popular technique in mobile sink wireless sensor networks (MS-WSNs). An ingenious virtual structure design combined with a precise routing management strategy is significant to attaining efficient data dissemination in hierarchical approaches. This article proposes a hierarchical protocol called territory-bound data delivery (TBDD) that divides the network into multiple partitions called Regions, and spots the location of the mobile sink (MS) according to these partitions. TBDD dynamically assigns a defined role to each division by adopting the mobility of the sink. Thus, the protocol takes advantage of the sink\u2019s movement and the Regions\u2019 flexible role in balancing energy consumption (EC) throughout the network. A Region is designated as active if it contains the sink node or passive otherwise. By using the territory of the active region as a temporal location of the MS, the proposed protocol hides the local movements (i.e., moves inside the active region) of the sink from the rest of the network. In such a way, regardless of the exact position of the sink, sensed data flows from different network ends to the sink\u2019s temporal location. Therefore, TBDD reduces the query request and response burden employed to get the position of the sink. Besides, TBDD implements a spanning tree to report the location information of the MS. Last, we applied an opportunistic routing technique that captures multiple network criteria to elect packet forwarder nodes. The proposed protocol is mathematically analyzed and experimentally evaluated and shows outstanding performance in terms of the number of hops, EC, delay, network lifetime, and success ratio.",
