            "title": "How to Peel a Million: Validating and Expanding Bitcoin Clusters",
            "abstract": "One of the defining features of Bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have been derived from it is a globally visible transaction ledger. While Bitcoin uses pseudonyms as a way to hide the identity of its participants, a long line of research has demonstrated that Bitcoin is not anonymous. This has been perhaps best exemplified by the development of clustering heuristics, which have in turn given rise to the ability to track the flow of bitcoins as they are sent from one entity to another. In this paper, we design a new heuristic that is designed to track a certain type of flow, called a peel chain, that represents many transactions performed by the same entity; in doing this, we implicitly cluster these transactions and their associated pseudonyms together. We then use this heuristic to both validate and expand the results of existing clustering heuristics. We also develop a machine learning-based validation method and, using a ground-truth dataset, evaluate all our approaches and compare them with the state of the art. Ultimately, our goal is to not only enable more powerful tracking techniques but also call attention to the limits of anonymity in these systems.",

            "abstract": "There is currently an increasing demand for cryptoasset analysis tools among cryptoasset service providers, the financial industry in general, as well as across academic fields. At the moment, one can choose between commercial services or low-level open-source tools providing programmatic access. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of another option: the GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics Platform, which can be used for interactive investigations of monetary flows and, more importantly, for executing advanced analytics tasks using a standard data science tool stack. By providing a growing set of open-source components, GraphSense could ultimately become an instrument for scientific investigations in academia and a possible response to emerging compliance and regulation challenges for businesses and organizations dealing with cryptoassets.",

            "abstract": "We present a first measurement study on the adoption and actual privacy of two popular decentralized CoinJoin implementations, Wasabi and Samourai, in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. By applying highly accurate (\u00bf 99%) algorithms we can effectively detect 30,251 Wasabi and 223,597 Samourai transactions within the block range 530,500 to 725,348 (2018-07-05 to 2022-02-28). We also found a steady adoption of these services with a total value of mixed coins of ca. 4.74 B USD and average monthly mixing amounts of ca. 172.93 M USD) for Wasabi and ca. 41.72 M USD for Samourai. Furthermore, we could trace ca. 322 M USD directly received by cryptoasset exchanges and ca. 1.16 B USD indirectly received via two hops. Our analysis further shows that the traceability of addresses during the pre-mixing and post-mixing narrows down the anonymity set provided by these coin mixing services. It also shows that the selection of addresses for the CoinJoin transaction can harm anonymity. Overall, this is the first paper to provide a comprehensive picture of the adoption and privacy of distributed CoinJoin transactions. Understanding this picture is particularly interesting in the light of ongoing regulatory efforts that will, on the one hand, affect compliance measures implemented in cryptocurrency exchanges and, on the other hand, the privacy of end-users.",

            "abstract": "Blockchains are typically managed by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks providing the support and substrate to the so-called distributed ledger (DLT), a replicated, shared, and syn-chronized data structure, geographically spread across multiple nodes. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain is by far the most well-known DLT, used to record transactions among peers, based on the BTC digital currency. In this paper we focus on the network side of the BTC P2P network, analyzing its nodes from a purely network measurements-based approach. We present a BTC crawler able to discover and track the BTC P2P network through active measurements, and use it to analyze its main properties. Through the combined analysis of multiple snapshots of the BTC network as well as by using other publicly available data sources on the BTC network and DLT, we unveil the BTC P2P network, locate its active nodes, study their performance, and track the evolution of the network over the past two years. Among other relevant findings, we show that (i) the size of the BTC network has remained almost constant during the last 12 months \u2013 since the major BTC price drop in early 2018, (ii) most of the BTC P2P network resides in US and EU countries, and (iii) despite this western network locality, most of the mining activity and corresponding revenue is controlled by major mining pools located in China. By additionally analyzing the distribution of BTC coins among independent BTC entities (i.e., single BTC addresses or groups of BTC addresses controlled by the same actor), we also conclude that (iv) BTC is very far from being the decentralized and uncontrolled system it is so much advertised to be, with only 4.5% of all the BTC entities holding about 85% of all circulating BTC coins.",

            "abstract": "AbstractThe roughness of a road pavement affects safety, ride comfort, and road durability. A useful indicator for evaluating roughness is the weighted longitudinal profile (wLP). In this paper, three machine learning models are compared for estimating the wLP when vehicle response information, i.e.,\u00a0accelerometer and wheel speed data is collected from common in-vehicle sensors. A multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest were applied for testing their effectiveness in estimating the key indices of wLP, namely, range and standard deviation. These models were trained from a set of features extracted from vehicle response simulations on accurate replications of roads with various roughness problems. In contrast to other research, the authors validated models with measurements collected with a probe vehicle. The results show that roughness phenomena can be accurately detected. The SVM produced the best results, although the models achieved rather similar performance. However, diff...",
