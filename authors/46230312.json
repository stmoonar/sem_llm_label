            "title": "Algorithms and Regulation",
            "abstract": "Algorithms \u2013 generally understood as sequences of precise instruction unambiguously specifying how to execute a task or solve a problem \u2013 are such a natural ingredient of regulation that some may wonder whether regulation could even be understood without recognising its algorithmic features, and without realising algorithms as a prime subject for regulation. In terms of the algorithmic features of regulation, somewhat simplistically and without suggesting in any way that the algorithmic language captures regulation in its entirety \u2013 far from it \u2013 algorithms are relevant to the three dimensions of regulation: the regulatory process, the modalities of regulation, and the regulatory approaches (or attitudes). By the regulatory process, we refer to the process that, stylistically, commences with political and economic pressures to find a solution to a certain problem and continues with the formation of policy goals, data gathering, and the mapping of possible regulatory responses to achieve these goals (which ought to include the sub-processes of regulatory impact assessment upon choosing the preferred measure). The chosen measures are translated into regulatory norms and implemented (or enforced), resulting, if all went well, with some improvement of the conditions related to the initial social problem (as can be analysed by a back-end regulatory impact assessment). By regulatory modalities, we mean the set of regulatory measures available to the state (or, more accurately, to state agencies acting as regulators): regulation through (and of) information, permits and licensing, civil, administrative and criminal liability, taxes and subsidies, or insurance schemes. By regulatory approaches, or attitudes, we mean the top-down command and control attitude, performance-based regulation, and themanagerial approach, with the latter two also including co-regulation or private regulation. Algorithms are relevant to all three dimensions of regulation, as they may assist most, if not all, stages of the regulatory process, may inform or even be a component of the regulatory modalities, and may similarly inform and be integrated into the regulatory attitudes. Conversely, algorithms may be the subject matter of regulation.",

            "title": "COVID-19 Datathon Based on Deidentified Governmental Data as an Approach for Solving Policy Challenges, Increasing Trust, and Building a Community: Case Study",
            "abstract": "Triggered by the COVID-19 crisis, Israel's Ministry of Health (MoH) held a virtual Datathon based on deidentified governmental data. Organized by a multidisciplinary committee, Israel's research community was invited to offer insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1) develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy challenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry, and government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies, special needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance with COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable, up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80 participants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent all sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18 multidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5 presentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future projects. Detailed feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the structure and organization of future government-led datathons.",
