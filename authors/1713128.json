            "title": "TEAM: A Layered-Cooperation Topology Evolution Algorithm for Multi-Sink Internet of Things",
            "abstract": "Numerous sensor nodes deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) can form a large heterogeneous network. The increased energy consumption of sensor nodes and the unbalanced communication load on multiple sink nodes reduce the energy efficiency of the network. Moreover, frequent network attacks also pose severe challenges to topology robustness. Optimizing the network topology to achieve the balance between energy efficiency and robustness is a complex problem. Multi-objective heuristic algorithms based on genetic evolution are commonly used to solve joint optimization problems. However, due to the lack of global search ability caused by the loss of genetic diversity, genetic operations are prone to premature convergence during multi-objective evolution. Therefore, this paper introduces multi-population cooperation into the multi-objective evolution process and proposes a novel layered-cooperation Topology Evolution Algorithm for Multi-sink IoT (TEAM). In TEAM, information entropy is used to measure the effectiveness of load balancing on multiple sink nodes. The crossover and mutation probabilities of different populations are dynamically adjusted to ensure genetic diversity. A layered-cooperation mechanism is designed to avoid premature convergence. Extensive experiments confirm that TEAM can effectively improve the energy efficiency and robustness of network topology while balancing the communication load on multi-sink nodes.",

            "abstract": "Sensor-cloud originates from extensive recent applications of wireless sensor networks and cloud computing. To draw a roadmap of the current research activities of the sensor-cloud community, we first investigate the state-of-the-art sensor-cloud literature reviews published since the late 2010s and discovered that these surveys have primarily studied the sensor-cloud in specific aspects, security-enabled solutions, efficient management mechanisms, and architectural challenges. While the existing surveys have reviewed the sensor-cloud from various perspectives, they are inadequate for the three key issues that require urgent attention in the sensor-cloud: reliability, energy, and heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by examining the origins of the sensor-cloud and providing an in-depth and comprehensive discussion of these three key challenges. We summarize initial designs of the new edge-based schemes to address these challenges and identify several open issues and promising future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Citations in scholarly work serve the essential purpose of acknowledging and crediting the original sources of knowledge that have been incorporated or referenced. Depending on their surrounding textual context, these citations are used for different motivations and purposes. Large Language Models (LLMs) could be helpful in capturing these fine-grained citation information via the corresponding textual context, thereby enabling a better understanding towards the literature. Furthermore, these citations also establish connections among scientific papers, providing high-quality inter-document relationships and human-constructed knowledge. Such information could be incorporated into LLMs pre-training and improve the text representation in LLMs. Therefore, in this paper, we offer a preliminary review of the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and citation analysis. Specifically, we review the application of LLMs for in-text citation analysis tasks, including citation classification, citation-based summarization, and citation recommendation. We then summarize the research pertinent to leveraging citation linkage knowledge to improve text representations of LLMs via citation prediction, network structure information, and inter-document relationship. We finally provide an overview of these contemporary methods and put forth potential promising avenues in combining LLMs and citation analysis for further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Users\u2019 purchase behaviors are complex and dynamic, which are usually driven by various personal demands evolving with time. According to psychology and economic theories, user demands can be satisfied with a sequence of purchase behaviors, resulting in a basket of items. However, most of the existing works simply predict the next basket from a shallow perspective of (purchase) sequence data modeling without deep insight into the underlying factors which drive user purchase behaviors. In fact, filling a basket with multiple items is a process to incrementally satisfy a user's demand. Therefore, the key challenges to predict a user's next basket lie in (1) how to track the changes of the user's demand, and (2) how to satisfy her demand at a given moment. To this end, we propose an Evolving DEmand SAtisfaction (EvoDESA) model to model a user's demand evolution for next-basket prediction. In EvoDESA, a demand evolution module learns the dynamics of user demand over a sequence of basket-purchase behaviors. Then, a next-basket planning module effectively packs an optimal combination of items to best satisfy the user's current demand. Extensive experiments on three real-world transaction datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of EvoDESA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Recent considerable state-of-the-art advancements within the automotive sector, coupled with an evolution of the promising paradigms of vehicle-to-everything communication and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), have facilitated vehicles to generate and, accordingly, disseminate an enormous amount of safety-critical and non-safety infotainment data in a bid to guarantee a highly safe, convenient, and congestion-aware road transport. These dynamic networks require intelligent security measures to ensure that the malicious messages, along with the vehicles that disseminate them, are identified and subsequently eliminated in a timely manner so that they are not in a position to harm other vehicles. Failing to do so could jeopardize the entire network, leading to fatalities and injuries amongst road users. Several researchers, over the years, have envisaged conventional cryptographic-based solutions employing certificates and the public key infrastructure for enhancing the security of vehicular networks. Nevertheless, cryptographic-based solutions are not optimum for an IoV network primarily, since the cryptographic schemes could be susceptible to compromised trust authorities and insider attacks that are highly deceptive in nature and cannot be noticed immediately and are, therefore, capable of causing catastrophic damage. Accordingly, in this article, a distributed trust management system has been proposed that ascertains the trust of all the reputation segments within an IoV network. The envisaged system takes into consideration the salient characteristics of familiarity, i.e., assessed via a subjective logic approach, similarity, and timeliness to ascertain the weights of all the reputation segments. Furthermore, an intelligent trust threshold mechanism has been developed for the identification and eviction of the misbehaving vehicles. The experimental results suggest the advantages of our proposed IoV-based trust management system in terms of optimizing the misbehavior detection and its resilience to various sorts of attacks.",

These trust values are often ascertained by taking into consideration trust parameters to determine the honesty and reliability of a vehicle and evaluating a weighted sum of the said parameters. To achieve precision and to reflect a reasonable impact of these parameters, rational weight values are imperative. Accordingly, this research primarily emphasizes on the quantification of weights associated with the contributing trust attributes by proposing a novel trust management mechanism that utilizes contextual information in addition to employing relevant impacting quantities as weights to formulate trust evaluations. Moreover, the envisaged trust management model incorporates 1) attack resilience while constituting certain parameters and 2) an adaptive and flexible threshold to mitigate malevolent behaviors. The simulation results depict that the devised parameters and the formulated trust aggregation cater to the dynamic nature of vehicular networks demonstrating the rationality of the weights\u2019 quantification, and the introduction of the adaptive threshold for misbehavior detection aligns well with the requirements of the ever-changing vehicular networks.",

            "abstract": "Having an intelligent dialogue agent that can engage in conversational question answering (ConvQA) is now no longer limited to Sci-Fi movies only and has, in fact, turned into a reality. These intelligent agents are required to understand and correctly interpret the sequential turns provided as the context of the given question. However, these sequential questions are sometimes left implicit and thus require the resolution of some natural language phenomena such as anaphora and ellipsis. The task of question rewriting has the potential to address the challenges of resolving dependencies amongst the contextual turns by transforming them into intent-explicit questions. Nonetheless, the solution of rewriting the implicit questions comes with some potential challenges such as resulting in verbose questions and taking conversational aspect out of the scenario by generating the self-contained questions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, CONVSR (CONVQA using Structured Representations) for capturing and generating intermediate representations as conversational cues to enhance the capability of the QA model to better interpret the incomplete questions. We also deliberate how the strengths of this task could be leveraged in a bid to design more engaging and more eloquent conversational agents. We test our model on the QuAC and CANARD data sets and illustrate by experimental results that our proposed framework achieves a better Fl score than the standard question rewriting model.",

            "abstract": "The increasing demand for the web-based digital assistants has given a rapid rise in the interest of the Information Retrieval (IR) community towards the field of conversational question answering (ConvQA). However, one of the critical aspects of ConvQA is the effective selection of conversational history turns to answer the question at hand. The dependency between relevant history selection and correct answer prediction is an intriguing but under-explored area. The selected relevant context can better guide the system so as to where exactly in the passage to look for an answer. Irrelevant context, on the other hand, brings noise to the system, thereby resulting in a decline in the model's performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, DHS-ConvQA (Dynamic History Selection in Conversational Question Answering), that first generates the context and question entities for all the history turns, which are then pruned on the basis of similarity they share in common with the question at hand. We also propose an attention-based mechanism to re-rank the pruned terms based on their calculated weights of how useful they are in answering the question. In the end, we further aid the model by highlighting the terms in the re-ranked conversational history using a binary classification task and keeping the useful terms (predicted as 1) and ignoring the irrelevant terms (predicted as 0). We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework with extensive experimental results on CANARD and QuAC -- the two popularly utilized datasets in ConvQA. We demonstrate that selecting relevant turns works better than rewriting the original question. We also investigate how adding the irrelevant history turns negatively impacts the model's performance and discuss the research challenges that demand more attention from the IR community.",

            "abstract": "Smooth Inter-organization or cross-domain data flows are increasingly demanded when more organizations are becoming data-driven, which will eventually lead to the rise of a new form of the world economy, that is, data economy (DE). Through exploring relevant concepts, technologies, issues and challenges facing DE, this paper discusses the operational concepts of DE ecosystem and its key elements, particularly data products and data marketplaces, and the trends of their developments. It then presents directions for research and development of DE ecosystem and its key elements, in order to help organizations and industry to prepare for the arrival of DE and identify areas for innovations and disruptive technologies. The paper also discusses the requirements of the data product design in the enterprise data ecosystem (EDE) for the rising data economy and the gaps that exist in the current data engineering and technologies, particularly examining the role of service technology in the development and practice of data economy ecosystems.",
