            "abstract": "The 2-\u03bcm optical window has recently become an area of great interest for imaging and LIDAR applications due to improved ranging capability and eye safety compared to common telecommunications wavelengths. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operating in this spectrum are highly desirable, as their intrinsic gain offers increased sensitivity over traditional photodiodes, further improving receiver sensitivity. HgCdTe, InAs, and InSb, as well as various superlattice materials have been used for this purpose, however, the combination of high electric field and narrow-bandgap absorber yields high dark current. As a result, these APDs are operated at cryogenic temperatures to suppress recombination mechanisms. At the high electric fields required for impact ionization, narrow bandgap materials are also susceptible to band-to-band tunneling, which cannot be suppressed by cooling. The separate absorption, charge, and multiplication (SACM) APD was designed to address this challenge by reducing the electric field in the absorber while maintaining sufficiently high enough field in the multiplication region for impact ionization [1] . This design spatially separates the absorption and multiplication layers, controlling the electric field in the absorber and multiplication layers through an intermediate charge layer. SACM APDs have been widely deployed in the InGaAs/InP and InGaAs/InAlAs materials systems for use in near-infrared telecommunications applications.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 40+ years, III-V materials have been intensively studied for avalanche photodetectors, driven by applications including optical communications, imaging, quantum information processing, and autonomous vehicle navigation. Unfortunately, impact ionization is a stochastic process that introduces noise, thereby limiting sensitivity and achievable bandwidths, leading to intense effort to mitigate this noise through the identification of different materials and device structures. Exploration of these materials has seen limited success as it has proceeded in a largely ad hoc fashion due to little consensus regarding which fundamental properties are important. Here, we report an exciting step toward deterministic design of low-noise avalanche photodetector materials by alternating the composition at the monolayer scale; this represents a dramatic departure from previous approaches, which have concentrated on either unconventional compounds/alloys or nanoscale band-engineering. In particular, we demonstrate how to substantially improve upon the noise characteristics of the current state-of-the art telecom avalanche multipliers, In0.52Al0.48As grown on InP substrates, by growing the structure as a strain-balanced digital alloy of InAs and AlAs layers, each only a few atomic layers thick. The effective k-factor, which has historically been considered a fundamental material property, was reduced by 6\u20137\u00d7 from k\u2009=\u20090.2 for bulk In0.52Al0.48As to k\u2009=\u20090.05 by using the digital alloy technique. We also demonstrate that these \u201cdigital alloys\u201d can significantly extend the photodetector cutoff wavelength well beyond those of their random alloy counterparts.Over the past 40+ years, III-V materials have been intensively studied for avalanche photodetectors, driven by applications including optical communications, imaging, quantum information processing, and autonomous vehicle navigation.

            "abstract": "Conventional large-core multimode fibers (MMFs) are preferred for use in short to medium haul optical fiber links, owing to their tolerance to misalignment and low deployment costs; however, data rates through MMFs are limited by modal dispersion. Digital signal processing with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques has offered promising solutions to overcome the dispersion limitations of MMFs, but the impact of the geometry of laser and detector arrays on the achievable data rate is not established. To this end, we use a field-propagation-based model to gauge the impact the geometry of lasers and detectors can have on the achievable ergodic and outage rates of incoherent MIMO-MMF links. Laser and detector array geometries were investigated using a grid-based method to optimize the positions of lasers and detectors for a 1 km MIMO-MMF link. Simulations reveal that systems with appropriately designed laser/detector geometries could improve the achievable rate over the fiber by more than 200% over random laser/detector arrays. The grid-based search technique, however, is limited due to high computational requirements for fine grids. As an alternative, we developed a suboptimal \u201cgreedy\u201d selection approach to design detector geometries, which produces detector geometries that attain more than 90% of the rate obtained with an exhaustive search, while requiring less than 0.2% of the computation. The low computation requirements and high performance of the greedy selection approach also motivate the use of dynamically reconfigurable detector arrays to achieve high data rates with reduced signal processing complexity. Methods are also presented for clustering detector elements to obtain more consolidated segmented detectors with better fill factors, while still offering significant data rate benefits. The achievable ergodic rate using these systems is verified to be close to the link's ergodic capacity.",

            "abstract": "Multimode fibers (MMF) are generally used in short and medium haul optical networks owing to the availability of low cost devices and inexpensive packaging solutions. However, the performance of conventional multimode fibers is limited primarily by the presence of high modal dispersion owing to large core diameters. While electronic dispersion compensation methods improve the bandwidth-distance product of MMFs, they do not utilize the fundamental diversity present in the different modes of the multimode fiber. In this paper, we draw from developments in wireless communication theory and signal processing to motivate the use of vector intensity modulation and signal processing to enable high-data rates over MMFs. Further, we discuss the implementation of a closed-loop system with limited channel state feedback to enable the use of precoding at the transmitter, and show that this technique enhances the performance in a 10 Gb/s MMF link, consisting of 3 km of conventional multimode fiber. Experimental results indicate that vector intensity modulation and direct detection with with two modulators and detectors, along with the use of limited feedback results in a 50% increase over the single laser and detector case.",

However, their large core diameter simplifies alignment and packaging, and makes them attractive for short and medium length links. Recent research has shown that the use of signal processing and techniques such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can greatly improve the data rate capabilities of multimode fibers. In this paper, we review recent experimental work using MIMO and signal processing for multimode fibers, and the improvements in data rates achievable with these techniques. We then present models to design as well as simulate the performance benefits obtainable with arrays of lasers and detectors in conjunction with MIMO, using channel capacity as the metric to optimize. We also discuss some aspects related to complexity of the algorithms needed for signal processing and discuss techniques for low complexity implementation.",
