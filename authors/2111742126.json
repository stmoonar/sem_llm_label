            "abstract": "The world is facing more energy crises due to extreme weather and the rapidly growing demand for electricity. Siting new substations and optimizing the location of existing ones are necessary to address the energy crisis. The current site selection lacks consideration of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban power demand, which results in unreasonable energy transfer and waste, leading to power outages in some areas. Aiming to maximize the grid coverage and transformer utilization, we propose a multi\u2010scene micro\u2010scale urban substation siting framework (UrbanPS): (1) The framework uses multi\u2010source big data and the machine learning model to estimate fine\u2010scale power consumption for different scenarios; (2) the region growing algorithm is used to divide the power supply area of substations; and the (3) location set coverage problem and genetic algorithm are introduced to optimize the substation location. The UrbanPS was used to perform siting optimization of 110\u2009kV terminal substations in Pingxiang City, Jiangxi Province. Results show that the coverage and utilization rate of the optimization results under different power consumption scenarios are close to 99%. We also found that the power can be saved by dynamic regulation of substation operation.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The explanation of spatial errors in geospatial modelling has long been a challenge. This study introduces an index that captures the complexity of local spatial distribution, which can partially provide insight into spatial errors. While previous studies have explored the complexity of geographical data from various perspectives, there is limited knowledge on assessing the complexity while taking spatial dependence into account. This study proposes a measure of geocomplexity, i.e. the spatial local complexity indicator, which characterizes the complexity of local spatial patterns while considering spatial neighbor dependence. We used both aspatial and spatial models to estimate the economic inequality in Australia, and applied the spatial local complexity indicator to explain spatial errors in these models. Results show that the developed geocomplexity indicator, using a binary spatial matrix, can effectively explain spatial errors arising from models, including 17%-47% of errors in aspatial models and 14% in a spatial model. The experiments in this study support our hypothesis that geocomplexity is an essential component in explaining spatial errors. The proposed geocomplexity indicator, along with our hypothesis, has the potential for advancing the understanding complex geospatial systems and enabling applications in various fields related to spatial data analysis.",

            "title": "Sensing overlapping geospatial communities from human movements using graph affiliation generation models",
            "abstract": "Geographical units densely connected by human movements can be treated as a geospatial community. Detecting geospatial communities in a mobility network reveals key characteristics of human movements and urban structures. Recent studies have found communities can be overlapping in that one location may belong to multiple communities, posing great challenges to classic disjoint community detection methods that only identify single-affiliation relationships. In this work, we propose a Geospatial Overlapping Community Detection (GOCD) framework based on graph generation models and graph-based deep learning. GOCD aims to detect geographically overlapped communities regarding the multiplex connections underlying human movements, including weak and long-range ties. The detection process is formalized as deriving the optimized probability distribution of geographic units' community affiliations in order to generate the spatial network, i.e., the most reasonable community affiliation matrix given the observed network structure. Further, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is introduced to approach the affiliation probabilities via a deep learning strategy. The GOCD framework outperformed existing baselines on non-spatial benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy and speed. A case study of mobile positioning data in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA), Minnesota, was presented to validate our model on real-world human mobility networks. Our empirical results unveiled the overlapping spatial structures of communities, the overlapping intensity for each CBG, and the spatial heterogeneous structure of community affiliations in the Twin Cities.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Spatial heterogeneity refers to uneven distributions of geographical variables. Spatial interpolation methods that utilize spatial heterogeneity are sensitive to the way in which spatial heterogeneity is characterized. This study developed a Generalized Heterogeneity Model (GHM) for characterizing local and stratified heterogeneity within variables and to improve interpolation accuracy. GHM first divides a study area into multiple spatial strata according to the sample values and locations of a variable. Then, GHM estimates simultaneously the spatial variations of the variable within and between the spatial strata. Finally, GHM interpolates unbiased estimates and uncertainty at unsampled locations. We demonstrated the GHM by predicting the spatial distributions of marine chlorophyll in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Results show that GHM improved both the overall interpolation accuracy across the study area and along strata boundaries compared with previous interpolation models. GHM also avoided bull\u2019s eye patterns and abrupt changes along strata boundaries. In future studies, GHM has the potential to be integrated with machine learning and advanced algorithms to improve spatial prediction accuracy for studies in broader fields.",

            "abstract": "Vector-based cellular automata (CA) based on real land-parcel has become an important trend in current urban development simulation studies. Compared with raster-based and parcel-based CA models, vector CA models are difficult to be widely used because of their complex data structures and technical difficulties. The UrbanVCA, a brand-new vector CA-based urban development simulation framework was proposed in this study, which supports multiple machine-learning models. To measure the simulation accuracy better, this study also first proposes a vector-based landscape index (VecLI) model based on the real land-parcels. Using Shunde, Guangdong as the study area, the UrbanVCA simulates multiple types of urban land-use changes at the land-parcel level have achieved a high accuracy (FoM=0.243) and the landscape index similarity reaches 87.3%. The simulation results in 2030 show that the eco-protection scenario can promote urban agglomeration and reduce ecological aggression and loss of arable land by at least 60%. Besides, we have developed and released UrbanVCA software for urban planners and researchers.",
