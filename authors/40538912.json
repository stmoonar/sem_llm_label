            "title": "Routing Optimization with Vehicle-Customer Coordination",
            "abstract": "In several transportation systems, vehicles can choose where to meet customers rather than stopping in fixed locations. This added flexibility, however, requires coordination between vehicles and customers that adds complexity to routing operations. This paper develops scalable algorithms to optimize these operations. First, we solve the one-stop subproblem in the [Formula: see text] space and the [Formula: see text] space by leveraging the geometric structure of operations. Second, to solve a multistop problem, we embed the single-stop optimization into a tailored coordinate descent scheme, which we prove converges to a global optimum. Third, we develop a new algorithm for dial-a-ride problems based on a subpath-based time\u2013space network optimization combining set partitioning and time\u2013space principles. Finally, we propose an online routing algorithm to support real-world ride-sharing operations with vehicle\u2013customer coordination. Computational results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, yielding far superior solutions in shorter computational times and can support real-time operations in very large-scale systems. From a practical standpoint, most of the benefits of vehicle\u2013customer coordination stem from comprehensively reoptimizing \u201cupstream\u201d operations as opposed to merely adjusting \u201cdownstream\u201d stopping locations. Ultimately, vehicle\u2013customer coordination provides win\u2013win\u2013win outcomes: higher profits, better customer service, and smaller environmental footprint.

            "title": "PUGAN: Physical Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement Using GAN With Dual-Discriminators",
            "abstract": "Due to the light absorption and scattering induced by the water medium, underwater images usually suffer from some degradation problems, such as low contrast, color distortion, and blurring details, which aggravate the difficulty of downstream underwater understanding tasks. Therefore, how to obtain clear and visually pleasant images has become a common concern of people, and the task of underwater image enhancement (UIE) has also emerged as the times require. Among existing UIE methods, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based methods perform well in visual aesthetics, while the physical model-based methods have better scene adaptability. Inheriting the advantages of the above two types of models, we propose a physical model-guided GAN model for UIE in this paper, referred to as PUGAN. The entire network is under the GAN architecture. On the one hand, we design a Parameters Estimation subnetwork (Par-subnet) to learn the parameters for physical model inversion, and use the generated color enhancement image as auxiliary information for the Two-Stream Interaction Enhancement sub-network (TSIE-subnet). Meanwhile, we design a Degradation Quantization (DQ) module in TSIE-subnet to quantize scene degradation, thereby achieving reinforcing enhancement of key regions. On the other hand, we design the Dual-Discriminators for the style-content adversarial constraint, promoting the authenticity and visual aesthetics of the results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PUGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

            "title": "Infrared Image Target Detection Algorithm for Hardware Fittings at Tension Clamp of Qishao UHV Transmission Line",
            "abstract": "The infrared thermal imager is a common method for electric inspection to detect the abnormal heat of the gold tool at the tensioning wire clamp. Because the Gansu section of Qishao High voltage line accounts for about 52.4% of the total length, through a lot of complex geographical environment, even once a quarter manual inspection will cost time and effort, subjectivity is big, and real-time performance is poor. Aiming at the above, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv4 multi-target recognition algorithm for infrared images. Firstly, the backbone feature extraction network CSPDaeknet53 is replaced by Mobilenetv1. Secondly, the training dataset is increased by the base hjs image expansion technology. Finally, Mosaic data enhancement and cosine annealing attenuation technology are introduced to construct an effective infrared image detection model to realize the classification and recognition of the hardware. The experimental results are compared with SSD, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 target detection algorithms, and it is found that the average recognition accuracy of the proposed method is 93.84%, and the model size is only 55.53MB. Under the condition of ensuring accuracy, the model is smaller and has practical reference value.",

            "abstract": "Proteins maintain the functional order of cell in life by interacting with other proteins. Determination of protein complex structural information gives biological insights for the research of diseases and drugs. Recently, a breakthrough has been made in protein monomer structure prediction. However, due to the limited number of the known protein structure and homologous sequences of complexes, the prediction of residue-residue contacts on hetero-dimer interfaces is still a challenge. In this study, we have developed a deep learning framework for inferring inter-protein residue contacts from sequential information, called HDIContact. We utilized transfer learning strategy to produce Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) two-dimensional (2D) embedding based on patterns of concatenated MSA, which could reduce the influence of noise on MSA caused by mismatched sequences or less homology. For MSA 2D embedding, HDIContact took advantage of Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with two-channel to capture 2D context of residue pairs. Our comprehensive assessment on the Escherichia coli (E. coli) test dataset showed that HDIContact outperformed other state-of-the-art methods, with top precision of 65.96%, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 83.08% and the Area Under the Precision Recall curve (AUPR) of 25.02%. In addition, we analyzed the potential of HDIContact for human-virus protein-protein complexes, by achieving top five precision of 80% on O75475-P04584 related to Human Immunodeficiency Virus. All experiments indicated that our method was a valuable technical tool for predicting inter-protein residue contacts, which would be helpful for understanding protein-protein interaction mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Recommender System (RS) is ubiquitous on today\u2019s Internet to provide multifaceted personalized information services. While an enormous success has been made in pushing forward high-accuracy recommendations, the other side of the coin \u2014 the recommendation explainability \u2014 needs to be better handled for pursuing persuasiveness, especially for the era of deep learning based recommendation. A few research efforts investigate interpretable recommendation from the feature and result levels. Compared with them, model-level explanation, which unfolds the reasoning process of recommendation through transparent models, still remains underexplored and deserves more attention. In this paper, we propose a model-based explainable recommendation approach, i.e., NS-ICF, which stands for Neuro-Symbolic Interpretable Collaborative Filtering. Thanks to the recent advance on neuro-symbolic computation for automatic rule learning, NS-ICF learns interpretable recommendation rules (consisting of user and item attributes) based on neural networks with two innovations: (1) a three-tower architecture tailored for the user and item sides in the RS domain; (2) fusing the powerful personalized representations of users and items to achieve adaptive rule weights and without sacrificing interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate NS-ICF is comparable to state-of-the-art deep recommendation models and is transparent for its unique neuro-symbolic architecture.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning and deep learning are currently widely used to predict data information. The purpose of this paper is to present our contribution to this field by discussing a common event data prediction problem-bicycle sharing demand prediction. The Bicycle Sharing Project has significantly reduced resource consumption and air pollution, but it suffers from the inability of the responsible authorities to predict the demand for bicycles at each station based on spatial and temporal data from the stations, which could result in the use of unnecessary human resources to dynamically balance the number of bicycles at each station. In our work, we propose a GRU-Stacking based model to predict the demand for shared bicycles to solve the above problems. The first level of the prediction model is built using the stacking ensemble learning strategy, the second level is built using the two-layer GRU model, and finally the results of the two levels are fused by weighted average fusion to deeply integrate the two models in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. The results demonstrated that our model outperforms popular prediction models like XGBoost, LightGBM, LCE and BiLSTM on three evaluation metrics, R2, RMSLE and MAPE. This shows that our model is well suited to the task of prediction the demand for shared bicycles and can be used to solve other problems involving data information prediction.",

            "abstract": "This paper aims to measure the operating efficiency of 22 Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies from 2013 to 2017 and outline the path to achieve high-quality development. The DEA-Malmquist was used to evaluate the total factor productivity on the sample of 22 Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was also used to analyze the configuration of determinants affecting technical efficiency. The results show that the overall operating efficiency of life insurance companies in China is relatively satisfying. The changes in total factor productivity are mainly caused by changes in technical efficiency and changes in efficiency. However, changes in scale efficiency have little effect on Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies. There is a significant difference in the operating efficiency between Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies. In contrast, the operating efficiency is slightly higher than that of foreign-funded life insurance companies, which is mainly reflected in the difference in pure technical efficiency. The realization path of a life insurance company\u2019s operating efficiency is primarily composed of high employee education and low overclosing ratio, high employee education and low reinsurance ratio, and all-factor positive investment. The weak employee quality and excessive overclosing are the main reasons for the low operating efficiency of some enterprises. This paper systematically analyzes the impact of the organization\u2019s internal structure on the operating efficiency of life insurance companies. Finally, based on the configuration perspective, we explain the internal logic and path of achieving better operating efficiency. In the end, we also provide decision-making references for further improving the efficient operation of life insurance companies in China.",

            "abstract": "The early diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) has always been a difficult problem to be solved clinically. At present, there is no clinical auxiliary diagnostic index for reference. We attempted to extract potential biomarkers for early PD from the currently used scalp EEG detection methods in clinical practice. We calculated the phase synchronization index to quantify the synchrony of EEG channels in various frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta bands) of early PD. The results showed that the synchronization of early PD in the delta band was significantly lower than the healthy level, and the brain region reflecting the lower synchronization was located in the temporal lobe, the posterior temporal lobe, the parietal lobe (the posterior center) and the occipital lobe. Moreover, this lower synchronicity is consistent with weaker brain functional connections. Besides, by constructing functional brain network, the graph theoretic topological features of each frequency band of early PD are presented. We have found that early PD has characteristics of small world network in the delta and beta bands, and the efficiency of brain functional networks in early PD has significantly increased in the delta, alpha and beta bands. These results indicate that early PD has significant pathological changes from the perspective of brain function network analysis, and its characteristics can be described by multiple features, which may provide auxiliary guidance for the clinical diagnosis of early PD, and also provide theoretical support for the brain function changes of early PD.",

            "abstract": "Click-through rate prediction is a critical task for computational advertising and recommendation systems, where the key challenge is to model feature interactions between different feature domains. At present, the main click-through rate prediction models model feature interactions in an implicit way, which leads to poor interpretation of the model, and the interaction between each pair of features may introduce noise into the model, thus limiting the predictive ability of the model. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a click-through rate prediction model (GAIAN) based on the graph attention interactive aggregation network, which explicitly obtains cross features on the graph structure. Our specific method is to design a feature interactive selection mechanism to select cross features that are beneficial to model prediction, reducing model noise and reducing the risk of model overfitting. On this basis, the bilinear interaction function is integrated into the aggregation strategy of the graph neural network, and the fine-grained intersection features are extracted in a flexible and explicit way, which makes graph neural networks more suitable for modeling feature interactions and enhances the interpretability of the model. Compared with several other state-of-the-art models on the Criteo and Avazu datasets, the experimental results show the superiority of the model.",

            "title": "Fall Detection System on Smart Walker Based on Multisensor Data Fusion and SPRT Method",
            "abstract": "Traditional walkers are commonly used for the elderly in social life, which solves the basic problem of walking, but it is difficult to ensure safety when a fall occurs, and the human-computer interaction is poor. The image recognition method or the IMU sensor method fixed on the user, such as a wearable watch, is used by most of the current fall detection methods. Wearable sensors require the user\u2019s wearing operation, which is a little troublesome, and the detection accuracy is related to the way of wearing. The image recognition method requires a high-priced camera and a fixed installation position, which is unable to adapt to outdoor activities. We investigated a low-cost method of mounting the sensor on the body of the walker. We propose in this paper an improved fall detection method, namely Precondition and Limit Threshold SPRT (PLT-SPRT), and a novel fall detection system on the smart walker based on PLT-SPRT. The signals of the upper and lower limb sensors are fused based on the Kalman filter algorithm, and the admittance control parameters are obtained through the system identification method. In this study, the improved sequential probability ratio test algorithm is used to set the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, construct the likelihood ratio and optimize the decision function, which is used to judge whether falls occur. The system is simulated by Matlab software, the user intention after fusion is more accurate, and the optimized decision function is judged accurately. Verified by the embedded system based on STM32 of the smart walker equipment in the real world, it can accurately identify the fallen state, with low detection delay, and the fallen state is detected about 160ms earlier than the traditional threshold-based detection algorithm, at the same time, the accuracy is higher than 94.9%, which meets the high real-time requirements of fall detection and is the ideal solution for smart walkers.",
