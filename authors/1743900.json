            "title": "Joint Optimization of Service Migration and Resource Management for Vehicular Edge Computing",
            "abstract": "The integration of edge computing and vehicle networks with future communications (e.g., 5G/6G networks) enables computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving. However, the mobility of end devices and vehicles with context switching brings a considerable Quality of Service (QoS) degradation and interruptions in edge services provisioning. Predicting the end-user mobility and context switching enable edge nodes to migrate services proactively to guarantee the QoS. But the cost maybe significant if the prediction is wrong. Service migration seems to be an effective way to minimize service disruptions and maintain service continuity. Service migration can be performed in two ways: proactive and reactive. Most of existing works focus on either reactive or proactive service migration models without considering resource usage efficiency. In this paper, we consider the combination of reactive and proactive service migration and propose a novel framework for joint optimization of service migration and resource management for vehicular edge computing by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) as an emerging technique. We construct an optimization problem to reduce migration costs in terms of latency and energy usage. Finally, we present Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) methods for solving the optimization issue. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations, combining both testbed and numerical simulation, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed intelligent service migration framework in vehicular edge computing environments.",

            "abstract": "Explainability of AI models is an important topic that can have a significant impact in all domains and applications from autonomous driving to healthcare. The existing approaches to explainable AI (XAI) are mainly limited to simple machine learning algorithms, and the research regarding the explainability-accuracy tradeoff is still in its infancy especially when we are concerned about complex machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep learning (DL). In this work, we introduce a new approach for complex models based on the co-relation impact which enhances the explainability considerably while also ensuring the accuracy at a high level. We propose approaches for both scenarios of independent features and dependent features. In addition, we study the uncertainty associated with features and output. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound of the computation complexity of our proposed approach for the dependent features. The complexity bound depends on the order of logarithmic of the number of observations which provides a reliable result considering the higher dimension of dependent feature space with a smaller number of observations.",

            "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) poses a significant challenge for the power grid operator in terms of increasing peak load and power quality reduction. Moreover, there is a growing demand for fast charging services in smart grids. Addressing the growing demand from fast charging services is challenging. To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose a new computational architecture combining energy trading and demand responses based on cloud computing for managing virtual power plants (VPPs) in smart grids. In the proposed system, EVs can be charged at high charging rates without affecting the operation of the power grid by purchasing energy through the energy trading platform in the cloud. In addition, users with storage devices can sell energy surplus to the market. On the one hand, the energy trading platform can be regarded as an internal market of the VPP that aims to maximize its revenue. The interest of the EV owners, on the other hand, is to minimize the cost for charging. Therefore, we model the interactions between the EV owners and the VPP as a non-cooperative game. To search for the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game, we design an algorithm and then analyze its computational complexity and communication overhead. We utilize real data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Our results illustrate that the users with only storage devices can obtain nearly <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$200\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>200</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"chung-ieq1-3118563.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> higher revenue on average by participating in the proposed internal market.

            "abstract": "Running computer vision applications, such as 3-D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), on mobile devices requires low-latency responses and a massive amount of computation. Edge computing has been introduced to move Cloud features closer to end users, providing necessary computing and network resources for end devices. The heterogeneous edge devices, with different hardware architectures (e.g., CPUs and GPUs) and runtime environments, provide diverse resources to support processing tasks from end devices, resulting in different costs and quality of services. How to partition these computing tasks and distribute them over these heterogeneous hardware nodes is still an open research question. Considering these inherently heterogeneous hardware architectures, new approaches for service orchestration and task scheduling are required to meet the service-level agreement and reduce the overall cost of the system (e.g., facility utilization cost). This article presents a system framework, EDGE VISION, for computer vision applications partitioning and orchestration on heterogeneous edge computing platforms considering both CPUs and GPUs. EDGE VISION abstracts the heterogeneous hardware resources and the task runtime environments and divides the application into separate tasks to be orchestrated and deployed into the heterogeneous edge nodes. We also propose two scheduling algorithms in our framework, minimum latency task scheduling and minimum cost task scheduling, aiming to minimize the processing latency and the overall system cost. We evaluate our framework by implementing the edge-based 3-D SLAM application in our real testbed with ten heterogeneous edge devices. Evaluations show that EdgeVision can efficiently minimize the processing latency and the system overall cost and achieve up to 30% decrease in task processing latency and 15% more cost saving compared to the State-of-the-Art baselines.",

            "abstract": "In smart grids, the large-scale integration of distributed renewable energy resources has enabled the provisioning of alternative sources of supply. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among local households is becoming an emerging technique that benefits both energy prosumers and operators. Since conventional energy supply is still needed to help fill the gap between local demand and supply when the local solar generation is not sufficient, demand\u2013response management will keep playing an important role in the future P2P energy market. Blockchain and smart contract technology has gained increasing attention in P2P trading for its secure operation. The performance of blockchain-based P2P energy trading still remains to be improved, in terms of latency and cost of computation resources. This article studies the challenges of demand\u2013response management in P2P energy trading and proposes a blockchain-empowered energy trading system for a community-based P2P market. The proposed demand\u2013response mechanism is developed using two noncooperative games, in which dynamic pricing is applied for suppliers. The proposed energy trading system is prototyped on a cluster network, with a coordinator running as a smart contract in a Hyperledger blockchain. We implemented both on-chain and off-chain processing modes to study the system performance. The results from experiments with our prototype indicate that our proposed demand\u2013response games have a great effect on reducing the net peak load, and at the same time, the off-chain processing mode provides lower latency and overhead compared to the on-chain mode while still keeping the same system integrity as the on-chain mode.",

How to effectively address diverse user requirements and guarantee everyone\u2019s Quality of Experience (QoE) remains an open problem. The Sixth Generation (6G) mobile systems will solve this problem by utilizing heterogenous network resources and pervasive intelligence to support everyone-centric customized services anywhere and anytime. In this article, we first coin the concept of Service Requirement Zone (SRZ) on the user side to characterize and visualize the integrated service requirements and preferences of specific tasks of individual users. On the system side, we further introduce the concept of User Satisfaction Ratio (USR) to evaluate the system\u2019s overall service ability of satisfying a variety of tasks with different SRZs. Then, we propose a network Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture with integrated network resources and pervasive AI capabilities for supporting customized services with guaranteed QoEs. Finally, extensive simulations show that the proposed network AI architecture can consistently offer a higher USR performance than the cloud AI and edge AI architectures with respect to different task scheduling algorithms, random service requirements, and dynamic network conditions.",

            "abstract": "In peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, the incorporation of distributed energy resources with unprotected data, originating from sources such as home energy management systems that are connected through the Internet, provokes vulnerabilities that can manifest security breaches. In this article, two threat scenarios based on a novel false data injection attack (FDIA) model in a local P2P energy trading system are explored. In these scenarios, an attacker gains free energy by manipulating prosumers\u2019 consumption and demand. Precise and fast attack detection is needed to guarantee suitable countermeasures to prevent potential risks. We propose a novel instance-based machine learning (ML) classifier for detecting FDIAs. In contrast to black-box ML models, our algorithm provides a transparent decision-making procedure with significant predictive performance. We apply our detection model to a real-world dataset from Austin, Texas. Our experimental results show superior performance as compared to several popular interpretable and non-interpretable ML methods. On average, we achieve a 96.10 percent detection rate, a 96.18 percent accuracy rate, and a false negative rate of 1.97 percent with our approach.",

            "title": "A Survey and Future Directions on Clustering: From WSNs to IoT and Modern Networking Paradigms",
            "abstract": "Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks are created as an overlay over traditional ad-hoc networks such as Zigbee. Moreover, IoT networks can resemble ad-hoc networks over networks that support device-to-device (D2D) communication, e.g., D2D-enabled cellular networks and WiFi-Direct. In these ad-hoc types of IoT networks, efficient topology management is a crucial requirement, and in particular in massive scale deployments. Traditionally, clustering has been recognized as a common approach for topology management in ad-hoc networks, e.g., in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Topology management in WSNs and ad-hoc IoT networks has many design commonalities as both need to transfer data to the destination hop by hop. Thus, WSN clustering techniques can presumably be applied for topology management in ad-hoc IoT networks. This requires a comprehensive study on WSN clustering techniques and investigating their applicability to ad-hoc IoT networks. In this article, we conduct a survey of this field based on the objectives for clustering, such as reducing energy consumption and load balancing, as well as the network properties relevant for efficient clustering in IoT, such as network heterogeneity and mobility. Beyond that, we investigate the advantages and challenges of clustering when IoT is integrated with modern computing and communication technologies such as Blockchain, Fog/Edge computing, and 5G. This survey provides useful insights into research on IoT clustering, allows broader understanding of its design challenges for IoT networks, and sheds light on its future applications in modern technologies integrated with IoT.",

            "abstract": "The fog computing paradigm has been proposed to alleviate the pressures on cloud platforms for data processing and enable computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in smart cities. However, state-of-the-art approaches mainly advocate either cloud-or fog-based data processing solutions, and they also lack a common framework for programming over the fog-cloud continuum. In this paper, we propose a distributed, fog-cloud data processing and orchestration framework, which is capable of exploiting the semantics of both fog platforms and the Cloud. Our framework can create on-demand process engine data flow (PEDF) spanning multiple device layers with various resource constraints. This will considerably help the developers rapidly develop and deploy data processing applications over the fog-cloud continuum. Our proposed framework is validated in a real-world scenario---IoT data streaming analytics for the smart green wall in a smart city---which demonstrates efficient resource usage and latency reduction.",
