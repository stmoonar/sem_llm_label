            "title": "Multi-Task Recommendations with Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "In recent years, Multi-task Learning (MTL) has yielded immense success in Recommender System (RS) applications [40]. However, current MTL-based recommendation models tend to disregard the session-wise patterns of user-item interactions because they are predominantly constructed based on item-wise datasets. Moreover, balancing multiple objectives has always been a challenge in this field, which is typically avoided via linear estimations in existing works. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhanced MTL framework, namely RMTL, to combine the losses of different recommendation tasks using dynamic weights. To be specific, the RMTL structure can address the two aforementioned issues by (i) constructing an MTL environment from session-wise interactions and (ii) training multi-task actor-critic network structure, which is compatible with most existing MTL-based recommendation models, and (iii) optimizing and fine-tuning the MTL loss function using the weights generated by critic networks. Experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RMTL with a higher AUC against state-of-the-art MTL-based recommendation models. Additionally, we evaluate and validate RMTL\u2019s compatibility and transferability across various MTL models.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate video summarization in the supervised setting. Since video summarization is subjective to the preference of the end-user, the design of a unique model is limited. In this work, we propose a model that provides personalized video summaries by conditioning the summarization process with predefined categorical user labels referred to as preferences. The underlying method is based on multiple pairwise rankers (called Multi-ranker), where the rankers are trained jointly to provide local summaries as well as a global summarization of a given video. In order to demonstrate the relevance and applications of our method in contrast with a classical global summarizer, we conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, notably through a user study and comparisons with the state-of-art methods in the global video summarization task.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing of online social networks, people always form the friendship networks among their social neighborhood, and also associate themselves with circles or communities due to their common interest. Thus there are two related networks: the friendship network among users as well as the affiliation network between users and circles. In this paper, we address the problem of collaborative recommendation for friendships and affiliations in online social networks. For that we propose the Collective Latent Factor BlockModel (CLFBM) to collectively discover globally predictive intrinsic properties of users and capture the interpretable latent block structure corresponding to the circle information. The proposed model is exploited in a transfer learning framework that extracts knowledge from the two related networks and generates recommendations for friendships and affiliations. The extensive experiments on the real world datasets suggest that our proposed CLFBM model outperforms the other state of the art approaches in the recommendation tasks.",

            "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often characterized as smart systems, which intelligently interact with other systems across information and physical interfaces. An increased dependence on CPS led to the collection of a vast amount of human-centric data, which brings the information overload problem across multiple domains. Recommender systems in CPS, which always provide information recommendations for users based on historical ratings collected from a single domain only, suffer from the data sparsity problem. Recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge across multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assumes that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern. However, real-world related domains do not necessarily share such a rating pattern, and diversity across domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which results in performance degradations. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation model, which not only learn the common rating pattern across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific rating patterns in each domain involving discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. Extensive experiments on real world data sets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain recommendation task in CPS.",
