            "abstract": "Recently, using a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to guide robots in a source location problem has attracted widespread interest. While being navigated by PSO, robots are easily trapped into U-shape-like concave obstacles such that they move back and forth cyclically and fail to locate a correct source. Existing obstacle avoidance strategies perform well when robots have information about all obstacles. Yet in many real scenes, robots have no prior information. This work proposes a novel PSO based on Tabu Search (PSO-TS) for robots to locate multiple sources. Instead of traditionally setting obstacles as tabu objects, PSO-TS innovatively sets trapping areas as tabu objects such that robots do not need prior knowledge or expensive hardware and much time to obtain obstacle information. The weighted average velocity of a robot is employed to determine if it is stuck inside an obstacle-induced area. If so, a rectangular tabu area is set to push robots out of the area and prevents robots from searching the same area again. The proposed method can be embedded into various source location algorithms to improve their performance. Its obstacle avoidance capability is proved. Finally, experimental results show the algorithmic compatibility, environmental adaptability and obstacle avoidance performance of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "This work studies perishable products\u2019 distribution using electric commercial vehicles (ECVs). Extra energy is consumed for refrigeration to keep such products from deteriorating, which shortens the limited driving range of ECVs. Besides charging at public recharging stations, their travel speed can be adjusted to improve their driving range and decrease distribution cost. We propose an Electric Vehicle Routing problem with variable vehicle speed and soft time windows for perishable products (EVRP-VS). An energy consumption rate function of refrigerated ECVs during driving is introduced into the problem. The function considers refrigeration and has a nonlinear relationship with ECV speed and weight. As long as the carriage is not empty, the vehicle needs refrigeration during driving and during its stay at customers and stations. A mathematical programming model is developed for EVRP-VS, to minimize total distribution cost, including vehicle cost, power cost, refrigeration cost, and penalty cost due to delayed delivery. An adaptive hybrid ant colony optimization (AHACO) with a two-stage speed optimization strategy is proposed to solve EVRP-VS. In the first stage, local speed optimization is used to optimize the speed of each ant (ECV) in each transfer step. In the second one, global speed optimization further optimizes the speed for each fixed route constructed by ants. AHACO is applied to many problem instances. Experimental results show that it can effectively solve EVRP-VS in comparison with CPLEX and other meta-heuristics.",

            "abstract": "Lane reservation optimization is important in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing studies are carried out under deterministic road conditions by assuming constant road travel time. However, road conditions vary due to various factors, resulting in uncertain road travel time. This work addresses a new reliability-based lane reservation and route design problem by considering uncertain road travel time with its known mean and covariance matrix. It aims to decide which road segments in a network should implement reserved lanes and to design routes for special time-crucial transportation tasks. The objective is to maximize transportation service reliability (i.e., the probability of completing the special tasks on time). For this problem, a novel distributionally robust optimization model is first established. To solve it, this work proposes i) an adapted sample average approximation-based approach and ii) a two-stage hierarchical heuristic algorithm based on second-order cone programming. Experimental results on an illustrative example and a real-world case demonstrate that the latter is more effective and efficient than the former. In addition, we conduct a series of parameter sensitivity analysis experiments to reveal the factors affecting lane reservation and provide optimal solutions given different parameter settings.",

            "abstract": "A non-negative latent factor (NLF) model with a single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) algorithm is frequently adopted to extract useful knowledge from non-negative data represented by high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices arising from various service-oriented applications. However, its convergence rate is slow. To address this issue, this study proposes a <underline>G</underline>eneralized Nesterov's acceleration-incorporated, <underline>N</underline>on-negative and <underline>A</underline>daptive <underline>L</underline>atent <underline>F</underline>actor (GNALF) model.

Empirical studies on six large sparse matrices from different recommendation service applications show that a GNALF model achieves very high convergence rate without the need of hyper-parameter tuning, making its computational efficiency significantly higher than state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, such efficiency gain does not result in accuracy loss, since its prediction accuracy is comparable with its peers. Hence, it can better serve practical service applications with real-time demands.",

            "abstract": "Feature selection (FS) has received significant attention since the use of a well-selected subset of features may achieve better classification performance than that of full features in many real-world applications. It can be considered as a multiobjective optimization consisting of two objectives: 1) minimizing the number of selected features and 2) maximizing classification performance. Ant colony optimization (ACO) has shown its effectiveness in FS due to its problem-guided search operator and flexible graph representation. However, there lacks an effective ACO-based approach for multiobjective FS to handle the problematic characteristics originated from the feature interactions and highly discontinuous Pareto fronts. This article presents an Information-theory-based Nondominated Sorting ACO (called INSA) to solve the aforementioned difficulties. First, the probabilistic function in ACO is modified based on the information theory to identify the importance of features; second, a new ACO strategy is designed to construct solutions; and third, a novel pheromone updating strategy is devised to ensure the high diversity of tradeoff solutions. INSA\u2019s performance is compared with four machine-learning-based methods, four representative single-objective evolutionary algorithms, and six state-of-the-art multiobjective ones on 13 benchmark classification datasets, which consist of both low and high-dimensional samples. The empirical results verify that INSA is able to obtain solutions with better classification performance using features whose count is similar to or less than those obtained by its peers.",

Commonly-used deep reinforcement learning-based methods rely on pre-training and become intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. To develop effective attack strategies, inspired by a particle swarm optimizer (PSO), this work proposes a PSO-based strategy for a robot swarm for the first time. During the moving of a robot swarm, each robot obtains situation information through perceiving its nearby peers and enemies and uses such information to construct its fitness function. Then, each robot uses PSO to optimize its fitness function and searches for its optimal attack position, which guides it to move in the next time slot. The experimental analyses show that the PSO-based attack strategy has more potential in solving large-scale confrontational problems than the deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic relationships are frequently encountered in big data and services computing-related applications, like dynamic data of user-side QoS in Web services. They are modeled into a high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) tensor, which contain rich knowledge regarding temporal patterns.

However, it commonly suffers from overfitting with improper regularization schemes. To address this issue, this article investigates NLFT models with diversified regularization schemes. Six regularized NLFT models, i.e., <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L_{2}, L_{1}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zhou-ieq1-2988760.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, elastic net, log, dropout, and swish-regularized ones, are proposed and carefully investigated. Moreover, owing to their diversified regularization designs, they possess strong model diversity to achieve an effective ensemble. Empirical studies on HiDS QoS tensors from real applications demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art models, the proposed ones better describe the temporal patterns hidden in an HiDS tensor, thereby achieving significantly higher prediction accuracy for missing data. Moreover, their ensemble further outperforms each of them in terms of prediction accuracy for missing QoS data.",

A non-linear integer mathematical program is constructed. A Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm with a direct-route encoding and random initialization is then presented to solve it. To increase the convergence rate and population diversity of VNS, it is further combined with two-stage greedy initialization and an appropriate population immigrant scheme to perform the population search in a dynamic environment. Then, off-line performance evaluation and Wilcoxon test of the proposed algorithms are performed. The results show that their solution quality is improved by 30% ~ 60% over the basic VNS\u2019s. They can track the environmental changes of CTSP-VEW more rapidly and effectively. In the end, a case study with a practical scenario is conducted.",

            "title": "Online Scheduling and Route Planning for Shared Buses in Urban Traffic Networks",
            "abstract": "It is critical to reduce the operating cost of shared buses for bus companies and improve the user experience of passengers. However, existing studies focus on either bus scheduling or route planning, which cannot accomplish the above mentioned goals concurrently. In this paper, we construct a joint bus scheduling and route planning framework to maximize the number of passengers, minimize the total length of routes and the number of required buses, as well as guarantee good user experience of passengers. First, we establish a system model based on a real-world scenario and formulate a multi-objective combinational optimization problem. Then, based on the extracted traffic topology of urban traffic networks and the generated candidate line set, we propose an offline algorithm to cope with the similar passenger flow distributions, e.g., morning or evening peak of every day. In order to cope with dynamic real-time passenger flows, an online algorithm is designed. Experiments are carried out based on real-word scenarios. The results show that the proposed algorithms can greatly reduce the operating cost of bus companies and guarantee good user experience based on real-world scheduling data in comparison with several existing methods.",
