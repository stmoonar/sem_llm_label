            "abstract": "Scientific discovery increasingly requires executing heterogeneous scientific workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. Heterogeneous workflows contain different types of tasks (e.g., simulation, analysis, and learning) that need to be mapped, scheduled, and launched on different computing. That requires a software stack that enables users to code their workflows and automate resource management and workflow execution. Currently, there are many workflow technologies with diverse levels of robustness and capabilities, and users face difficult choices of software that can effectively and efficiently support their use cases on HPC machines, especially when considering the latest exascale platforms. We contributed to addressing this issue by developing the ExaWorks Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK is a curated collection of workflow technologies engineered following current best practices and specifically designed to work on HPC platforms. We present our experience with (1) curating those technologies, (2) integrating them to provide users with new capabilities, (3) developing a continuous integration platform to test the SDK on DOE HPC platforms, (4) designing a dashboard to publish the results of those tests, and (5) devising an innovative documentation platform to help users to use those technologies. Our experience details the requirements and the best practices needed to curate workflow technologies, and it also serves as a blueprint for the capabilities and services that DOE will have to offer to support a variety of scientific heterogeneous workflows on the newly available exascale HPC platforms.",

            "abstract": "Workflows are critical for scientific discovery. However, the sophistication, heterogeneity, and scale of workflows make building, testing, and optimizing them increasingly challenging. Furthermore, their complexity and heterogeneity make performance reproducibility hard. In this paper, we propose workflow mini-apps as a tool to address the challenges in building and testing workflows while controlling the fidelity of representing real-world workflows. Workflow mini-apps are deployed and run on various HPC systems and architectures without workflow-specific constraints. We offer insight into their design and implementation, providing an analysis of their performance and reproducibility. Workflow mini-apps thus advance the science of workflows by providing simple, portable, and managed (fidelity) representations of otherwise complex and difficult-to-control real workflows.",

            "abstract": "Managing and preparing complex data for deep learning, a prevalent approach in large-scale data science can be challenging. Data transfer for model training also presents difficulties, impacting scientific fields like genomics, climate modeling, and astronomy. A large-scale solution like Google Pathways with a distributed execution environment for deep learning models exists but is proprietary. Integrating existing open-source, scalable runtime tools and data frameworks on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms is crucial to address these challenges. Our objective is to establish a smooth and unified method of combining data engineering and deep learning frameworks with diverse execution capabilities that can be deployed on various high-performance computing platforms, including cloud and supercomputers. We aim to support heterogeneous systems with accelerators, where Cylon and other data engineering and deep learning frameworks can utilize heterogeneous execution. To achieve this, we propose Radical-Cylon, a heterogeneous runtime system with a parallel and distributed data framework to execute Cylon as a task of Radical Pilot. We thoroughly explain Radical-Cylon's design and development and the execution process of Cylon tasks using Radical Pilot. This approach enables the use of heterogeneous MPI-communicators across multiple nodes. Radical-Cylon achieves better performance than Bare-Metal Cylon with minimal and constant overhead. Radical-Cylon achieves (4~15)% faster execution time than batch execution while performing similar join and sort operations with 35 million and 3.5 billion rows with the same resources. The approach aims to excel in both scientific and engineering research HPC systems while demonstrating robust performance on cloud infrastructures. This dual capability fosters collaboration and innovation within the open-source scientific research community.",

            "abstract": "It is generally desirable for high-performance computing (HPC) applications to be portable between HPC systems, for example to make use of more performant hardware, make effective use of allocations, and to co-locate compute jobs with large datasets. Unfortunately, moving scientific applications between HPC systems is challenging for various reasons, most notably that HPC systems have different HPC schedulers. We introduce PSI/J, a job management abstraction API intended to simplify the construction of software components and applications that are portable over various HPC scheduler implementations. We argue that such a system is both necessary and that no viable alternative currently exists. We analyze similar notable APIs and attempt to determine the factors that influenced their evolution and adoption by the HPC community. We base the design of PSI/J on that analysis. We describe how PSI/J has been integrated in three workflow systems and one application, and also show via experiments that PSI/J imposes minimal overhead.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Scientific computing communities increasingly run their experiments using complex data- and compute-intensive workflows that utilize distributed and heterogeneous architectures targeting numerical simulations and machine learning, often executed on the Department of Energy Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs). We argue that a principled, systematic approach to implementing FAIR principles at scale, including fine-grained metadata extraction and organization, can help with the numerous challenges to performance reproducibility posed by such workflows. We extract workflow patterns, propose a set of tools to manage the entire life cycle of performance metadata, and aggregate them in an HPC-ready framework for reproducibility (RECUP). We describe the challenges in making these tools interoperable, preliminary work, and lessons learned from this experiment.",

            "abstract": "Increasingly, scientific discovery requires sophisticated and scalable workflows. Workflows have become the ``new applications,'' wherein multi-scale computing campaigns comprise multiple and heterogeneous executable tasks. In particular, the introduction of AI/ML models into the traditional HPC workflows has been an enabler of highly accurate modeling, typically reducing computational needs compared to traditional methods. This chapter discusses various modes of integrating AI/ML models to HPC computations, resulting in diverse types of AI-coupled HPC workflows. The increasing need of coupling AI/ML and HPC across scientific domains is motivated, and then exemplified by a number of production-grade use cases for each mode. We additionally discuss the primary challenges of extreme-scale AI-coupled HPC campaigns -- task heterogeneity, adaptivity, performance -- and several framework and middleware solutions which aim to address them. While both HPC workflow and AI/ML computing paradigms are independently effective, we highlight how their integration, and ultimate convergence, is leading to significant improvements in scientific performance across a range of domains, ultimately resulting in scientific explorations otherwise unattainable.",

            "title": "RAPTOR: Ravenous Throughput Computing",
            "abstract": "We describe the design, implementation and performance of the RADICAL-Pilot task overlay (RAPTOR). RAPTOR enables the execution of heterogeneous tasks-i.e., functions and executables with arbitrary duration-on HPC platforms, pro-viding high throughput and high resource utilization. RAPTOR supports the high throughput virtual screening requirements of DOE's National Virtual Biotechnology Laboratory effort to find therapeutic solutions for COVID-19. RAPTOR has been used on 8300 compute nodes to sustain 144M/hour docking hits, and to screen 1011 ligands. To the best of our knowledge, both the throughput rate and aggregated number of executed tasks are a factor of two greater than previously reported in literature. RAPTOR represents important progress towards improvement of computational drug discovery, in terms of size of libraries screened, and for the possibility of generating training data fast enough to serve the last generation of docking surrogate models.",
