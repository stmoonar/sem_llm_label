            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a scene frame prediction system based on digital twin technology. The system is mainly composed of an unmanned perception module, a communication link module, a command center module that provides intelligent computing services, and an interaction and visualization module for human operators. These modules together constitute a system for predicting and recovery the time-series matrix composed of scene frames and object frames. At the same time, in view of the current problems of lack of real-time information and long response time in the maritime search and rescue (SAR) field, this paper instantiates the above system to improve the existing SAR system. Satellites and unmanned vehicles perceive part of the scene data of the real cyber-physical system in real-time and divide them into multiple frames according to the timestamps. In addition, this paper also proposes an environmental graph-attention network (Env-GAT) to achieve efficient and reliable frame predicting. Finally, this paper verifies that the performance of the spatiotemporal attention graph network model has reached the optimal level through computational experiments.",

            "abstract": "Satellite ground system is the interface between a satellite and its users. It has two main functions: (1) resource management and (2) service provisioning. It is difficult to efficiently carry out these two goals with traditional system because a satellite ground system contains a variety of elements and users' service demands are increasing as well. In this paper, we propose a new satellite ground system with an \"edge-cloud-terminal\" structure. Cloud computing and edge computing are used to efficiently manage system resources and improve service quality, respectively. A user's request is responded by the edge data center which is close to the user to lower service latency. Moreover, the information flow and the task management strategy of the ground system are described.",
