            "title": "A Blueprint Architecture of Compound AI Systems for Enterprise",
            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities surpassing conventional NLP challenges, creating opportunities for use in production use cases. Towards this goal, there is a notable shift to building compound AI systems, wherein LLMs are integrated into an expansive software infrastructure with many components like models, retrievers, databases and tools. In this paper, we introduce a blueprint architecture for compound AI systems to operate in enterprise settings cost-effectively and feasibly. Our proposed architecture aims for seamless integration with existing compute and data infrastructure, with ``stream'' serving as the key orchestration concept to coordinate data and instructions among agents and other components. Task and data planners, respectively, break down, map, and optimize tasks and data to available agents and data sources defined in respective registries, given production constraints such as accuracy and latency.",

Kyurem provides a seamless environment within computational notebooks where data scientists explore a KG to identify opportunities for acquiring new knowledge and verify recommendations provided by AI agents for integrating the acquired knowledge in the KG. We refined Kyurem through participatory design and conducted case studies in a real-world setting for evaluation. The case-studies show that introduction of Kyurem within an existing HR knowledge graph construction and serving platform improved the user experience of the experts and helped eradicate inefficiencies related to knowledge acquisition and integration tasks",

Despite their prowess, LLMs may fall short in understanding of complex, sociocultural, or domain-specific context, potentially leading to incorrect annotations. Therefore, we advocate a collaborative approach where humans and LLMs work together to produce reliable and high-quality labels. We present MEGAnno+, a human-LLM collaborative annotation system that offers effective LLM agent and annotation management, convenient and robust LLM annotation, and exploratory verification of LLM labels by humans.",
