            "abstract": "Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real world time series, i.e., large-scale irregular or sparse and intermittent time series, raise significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing attention to large vision-language models such as CLIP, there has been a significant amount of effort dedicated to building efficient prompts. Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data. Extensive experiments are conducted on the few-shot recognition task and the improvement demonstrates the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/CHENGY12/PLOT.",

            "abstract": "Taxonomies are fundamental to many real-world applications in various domains, serving as structural representations of knowledge. To deal with the increasing volume of new concepts needed to be organized as taxonomies, researchers turn to automatically completion of an existing taxonomy with new concepts. In this paper, we propose TaxoEnrich, a new taxonomy completion framework, which effectively leverages both semantic features and structural information in the existing taxonomy and offers a better representation of candidate position to boost the performance of taxonomy completion. Specifically, TaxoEnrichconsists of four components: (1) taxonomy-contextualized embedding which incorporates both semantic meanings of concept and taxonomic relations based on powerful pretrained language models; (2) a taxonomy-aware sequential encoder which learns candidate position representations by encoding the structural information of taxonomy; (3) a query-aware sibling encoder which adaptively aggregates candidate siblings to augment candidate position representations based on their importance to the query-position matching; (4) a query-position matching model which extends existing work with our new candidate position representations. Extensive experiments on four large real-world datasets from different domains show that TaxoEnrichachieves the best performance among all evaluation metrics and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

            "abstract": "With the emerging unlicensed spectrum sharing and Machine-to-Machine communications, the coexistence performance of multiple devices with different access schemes operating at the same unlicensed bands has received significant research interests. As the two most representative random-access schemes, Aloha and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) both found wide applications in unlicensed bands. Yet most of the studies have focused on the coexistence of CSMA-based networks, leaving the coexistence of Aloha-based and CSMA-based networks largely unexplored. The challenge originates from the lack of a coexistence model of slotted Aloha and CSMA. In this paper, the throughput performance of coexisting Aloha and CSMA networks is characterized and optimized by extending a unified analytical framework proposed for random-access networks. The analysis shows that different from the single-network case where the maximum throughput of CSMA is much higher thanks to carrier sensing, when Aloha and CSMA coexist, Aloha would significantly outperform CSMA if each network optimizes its own throughput performance without cooperation, leading to poor throughput performance for CSMA and severe unfairness. To achieve fair coexistence, inter-network cooperation is crucial. The optimal transmission probabilities of Aloha and CSMA for maximizing the total network throughput under a given throughput ratio are further derived, and applied to coexisting LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks to optimize their coexistence performance.",

            "abstract": "Taxonomies have been widely used in various machine learning and text mining systems to organize knowledge and facilitate downstream tasks. One critical challenge is that, as data and business scope grow in real applications, existing taxonomies need to be expanded to incorporate new concepts. Previous works on taxonomy expansion process the new concepts independently and simultaneously, ignoring the potential relationships among them and the appropriate order of inserting operations. However, in reality, the new concepts tend to be mutually correlated and form local hypernym-hyponym structures. In such a scenario, ignoring the dependencies of new concepts and the order of insertion may trigger error propagation. For example, existing taxonomy expansion systems may insert hyponyms to existing taxonomies before their hypernym, leading to sub-optimal expanded taxonomies. To complement existing taxonomy expansion systems, we propose TaxoOrder, a novel self-supervised framework that simultaneously discovers the local hypernym-hyponym structure among new concepts and decides the order of insertion. TaxoOrder can be directly plugged into any taxonomy expansion system and improve the quality of expanded taxonomies. Experiments on the real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of TaxoOrder to enhance taxonomy expansion systems, leading to better-resulting taxonomies with comparison to baselines under various evaluation metrics.",

            "title": "Learning Multi-granularity Consecutive User Intent Unit for Session-based Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next action based on previous actions in the current session. The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph (MIHSG) which captures the interactions between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking (IFR) module to compose the recommendation results from various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods, we achieve as large as 10.21% gain on HR@20 and 15.53% gain on MRR@20.",

            "title": "Taxonomy Completion via Triplet Matching Network",
            "abstract": "Automatically constructing taxonomy finds many applications in e-commerce and web search. One critical challenge is as data and business scope grow in real applications, new concepts are emerging and needed to be added to the existing taxonomy. Previous approaches focus on the taxonomy expansion, i.e. finding an appropriate hypernym concept from the taxonomy for a new query concept. In this paper, we formulate a new task, \u201ctaxonomy completion\u201d, by discovering both the hypernym and hyponym concepts for a query. We propose Triplet Matching Network (TMN), to find the appropriate pairs for a given query concept. TMN consists of one primal scorer and multiple auxiliary scorers. These auxiliary scorers capture various fine-grained signals (e.g., query to hypernym or query to hyponym semantics), and the primal scorer makes a holistic prediction on triplet based on the internal feature representations of all auxiliary scorers. Also, an innovative channel-wise gating mechanism that retains task-specific information in concept representations is introduced to further boost model performance. Experiments on four real-world large-scale datasets show that TMN achieves the best performance on both taxonomy completion task and the previous taxonomy expansion task, outperforming existing methods.",

            "title": "Attentive Knowledge-aware Graph Convolutional Networks with Collaborative Guidance for Personalized Recommendation",
            "abstract": "To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional recommender systems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary information has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users. In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR). CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e., Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by 1.4-27.0% in terms of Recall metric on Top-K recommendation.",
