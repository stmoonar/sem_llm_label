            "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel paradigm for facial privacy protection that unifies multiple characteristics including anonymity, diversity, reversibility and security within a single lightweight framework. We name it PRO-Face S, short for Privacy-preserving Reversible Obfuscation of Face images via Secure flow-based model. In the framework, an Invertible Neural Network (INN) is utilized to process the input image along with its pre-obfuscated form, and generate the privacy protected image that visually approximates to the pre-obfuscated one, thus ensuring privacy. The pre-obfuscation applied can be in diversified form with different strengths and styles specified by users. Along protection, a secret key is injected into the network such that the original image can only be recovered from the protection image via the same model given the correct key provided. Two modes of image recovery are devised to deal with malicious recovery attempts in different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three public image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over multiple state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": ". Image blur is a key distortion that in\ufb02uences the image quality. In this paper, a no-reference image blur assessment method is proposed based on the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and the sum of squared AC coe\ufb03cients of discrete cosine transform (DCT) ,namely (SSAD). Firstly, to obtain the interested blocks in blurred image, the SIFT points are detected in its gray image. Meantime, the gradient map is also computed from gray image to obtain shape information of blurred image. Secondly, the gray image and the gradient map are both divided into equally sized blocks. The blocks in gray image containing one or more SIFT points are selected as interested blocks. The corresponding blocks in gradient map are selected to compute SSAD in DCT domain. Finally, blur score is de\ufb01ned as the normalized sum of SSAD by the weighted sum of cubic power entropy and variance of interested blocks, in which the weight comes from a function with the number of SIFT point as parameter.In order to verify our algorithm\u2019s performance, four public image quality databases are tested. Experimental results show that the method indeed outperforms others and the blur scores are highly consistent with subjective evaluations.",

            "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) based imaging (CSI) method can recover N pixel information from only M measurements with N \u226b M, if the source information is sparse in some domain. With help of CSI mechanism an imaging system could capture information directly, meanwhile, the confidentiality could be also supported with some configuration due to the random projection, i.e., CSI method integrates sensing, compression and encryption in one step. However, image should be also protected against tampering and forgery, which could be realized by providing the origin and integrity. Since CSI method captures measurements instead of pixel information, the authenticity should be provided in an unconventional but semantic way. This paper introduces an Authenticated Encrypted Compressive Sensing based Imaging (AE-CSI) mechanism, which is constructed by the existed CSMAC and improved CSI mechanism, such that the system provides the origin, integrity and confidentiality of the target image while the sensing process.",

            "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a hot topic in mathematics, computer science and electronics area in recent years. Imaging system takes fully advantage of this novel theory, i.e., Compressive Sensing based Imaging (CSI) cameras couldconstruct N pixel image with only M measurements with M << N and the sampling bandwidth of sensors would be no more limited. As we known, image should be authenticated, in order to be transmitted through insecure channel. However, CSI method senses and compresses directly scene information into measurement, which cannot be protected by conventional image authentication mechanisms. In 2017, Wu and Ruland have proposed an authenticated CSI system, which can solve this issue and support content-based (semantic) authentication. This paper follows Wu's work, and bases on the shortcomings, such as training method, tag extraction and verification etc., to improve the authenticated CSI method. Afterwards, the improved system illustrates a good performance of security and robustness.",

            "abstract": "Image compression has highly developed in recent decades. The common way is to transform the sensed image into an appropriate basis, then encode the important coefficients to reduce the data size. The Compressive Sensing based imaging (CSI) system can combine sensing and source coding process in one step. It is clear that the CSI system has the compression property, but compression of the CSI does not have the conventional meaning. Sometimes CSI measurements even require a larger memory size than the recovered image. In order to improve the data compression property of the CSI system, a lossy quantization mechanism for CSI method is proposed instead of employing the uniform quantizer with a fixed precision. The mechanism is easy to implement and has small distortion. In terms of recovery quality the improvement presents good data compression.",

            "abstract": "Compressive Sensing is practical and implemented into many areas. For these applications the conventional sensing noise (e.g. AWGN) with low energy on measurements could be reduced by the robustness of Compressive Sensing. Parallel, there exist some errors, which would strongly noise or remove some parts of measurements. In this case, the recovered information would contain much noise, since the robustness is broken. In order to reduce the influence of those errors, we propose an optimization mechanism with help of the sensed redundancy in measurements, instead of employing denoising methods or increasing extra measurements. This method can target the error locations, then contribute a better recovery quality in an acceptable range.",

When the received measurements were proven to be contently acceptable, the adversary has almost no influence on the content integrity and authenticity.

Radon transform is applied to extract the efficient acoustic features from the matrix, and then discrete cosine transform was applied on several random Radon projections to yield low dimensional feature vector and conduct hash sequence.
