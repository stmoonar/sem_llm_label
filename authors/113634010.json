            "title": "How to Peel a Million: Validating and Expanding Bitcoin Clusters",
            "abstract": "One of the defining features of Bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have been derived from it is a globally visible transaction ledger. While Bitcoin uses pseudonyms as a way to hide the identity of its participants, a long line of research has demonstrated that Bitcoin is not anonymous. This has been perhaps best exemplified by the development of clustering heuristics, which have in turn given rise to the ability to track the flow of bitcoins as they are sent from one entity to another. In this paper, we design a new heuristic that is designed to track a certain type of flow, called a peel chain, that represents many transactions performed by the same entity; in doing this, we implicitly cluster these transactions and their associated pseudonyms together. We then use this heuristic to both validate and expand the results of existing clustering heuristics. We also develop a machine learning-based validation method and, using a ground-truth dataset, evaluate all our approaches and compare them with the state of the art. Ultimately, our goal is to not only enable more powerful tracking techniques but also call attention to the limits of anonymity in these systems.",

            "abstract": "AVIDOS is a computer code used for the dose assessment of aircraft crew exposed to cosmic radiation. The code employs a multiparameter model built upon simulations of cosmic radiation exposure done using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. AVIDOS calculates both ambient dose equivalent H*(10) and effective dose E for flight routes over the whole world at typically used altitudes and for the full range of solar activity. The dose assessment procedure using AVIDOS is accredited by the Austrian office for accreditation according to European regulations and is valid in the whole Europe. AVIDOS took part in an international comparison of different codes assessing radiation exposure of aircraft crew where a fully satisfactory agreement between codes has been found. An online version of AVIDOS with user friendly interface is accessible to public under the internet address: http://avidos.healthphysics.at.",
