            "abstract": "Scatterplots are commonly used in various contexts, from scientific publications to infographics for the general public. However, not everyone is able to read them, and even experts may struggle to notice some important information such as overlapping clusters or temporal changes. To address these issues, a computational approach for annotating scatterplots has been developed. This approach involves various forms of annotation, including drawing lines to show correlations, circling areas to show clusters, and indicating movement with arrows. The approach is based on a study that identified common annotation strategies used by people to annotate scatterplots. These strategies are distilled into an automated method for generating graphical annotations on scatterplots. The method involves a problem formulation using a Markov Decision Process and a model for making annotation decisions. The model generates step-by-step graphical annotations by analyzing data insights and observing the chart. The final result conveys a narrative that is easy to understand and allows for the conveyance of temporal changes in the data. The study results suggest that the method can generate understandable and functional annotations that are comparable to those created by human experts. This approach can potentially reduce the time and effort required to read scatterplots, making it a useful tool for data visualization novices.",

            "abstract": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential yet tedious process for examining a new dataset. To facilitate it, natural language interfaces (NLIs) can help people intuitively explore the dataset via data-oriented questions. However, existing NLIs primarily focus on providing accurate answers to questions, with few offering explanations or presentations of the data analysis pipeline used to uncover the answer. Such presentations are crucial for EDA as they enhance the interpretability and reliability of the answer, while also helping users understand the analysis process and derive insights. To fill this gap, we introduce Urania, a natural language interactive system that is able to visualize the data analysis pipelines used to resolve input questions. It integrates a natural language interface that allows users to explore data via questions, and a novel data-aware question decomposition algorithm that resolves each input question into a data analysis pipeline. This pipeline is visualized in the form of a datamation, with animated presentations of analysis operations and their corresponding data changes. Through two quantitative experiments and expert interviews, we demonstrated that our data-aware question decomposition algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of execution accuracy, and that Urania can help people explore datasets better. In the end, we discuss the observations from the studies and the potential future works.",

            "abstract": "Datamation is designed to animate an analysis pipeline step by step, which is an intuitive and effective way to interpret the results from data analysis. However, creating a datamation is not easy. A qualified datamation needs to not only provide a correct analysis result but also ensure that the data flow and animation are coherent. Existing animation authoring tools focus on either leveraging algorithms to automatically generate an animation based on user-provided charts or building graphical user interfaces to provide a programming-free authoring environment for users. None of them are able to help users translate an analysis task into a series of data operations to form an analysis pipeline and visualize them as a datamation. To fill this gap, we introduce Datamator, an intelligent authoring tool developed to support datamation design and generation. It leverages a novel data query decomposition model to allow users to generate an initial datamation by simply inputting a data query in natural language. The initial datamation can be refined via rich interactions and a feedback mechanism is utilized to update the decomposition model based on user knowledge and preferences. Our system produces an animated sequence of visualizations driven by a set of low-level data actions. It supports unit visualizations, which provide a mapping from each data item to a unique visual mark. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Datamator via a series of evaluations including case studies, performance validation, and a controlled user study.",

This process greatly improves user experience and lowers the technical barriers of data analysis. Existing techniques focus on generating a visualization from a concrete question. However, complex questions, requiring multiple data queries and visualizations to answer, are frequently asked in data exploration and analysis, which cannot be easily solved with the existing techniques. To address this issue, in this article, we introduce Talk2Data, a natural language interface for exploratory visual analysis that supports answering complex questions. It leverages an advanced deep-learning model to resolve complex questions into a series of simple questions that could gradually elaborate on the users\u2019 requirements. To present answers, we design a set of annotated and captioned visualizations to represent the answers in a form that supports interpretation and narration. We conducted an ablation study and a controlled user study to evaluate the Talk2Data\u2019s effectiveness and usefulness.",

            "abstract": "Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such as a poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented storytelling to facilitate the understanding and memorization of the story content. Although useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difficult. Existing authoring tools rely on users' skills and experiences, which are usually inefficient and still difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation.",

We present a novel chart sequencing method based on reinforcement learning to capture the connections between charts in the context of three major analysis tasks, including correlation analysis, anomaly detection, and cluster analysis. The proposed method formulates a chart sequencing procedure as an optimization problem, which seeks an optimal policy to sequencing charts for the specific analysis task. In our method, a novel reward function is introduced, which takes both the analysis task and the factor of human cognition into consideration. We conducted one case study and two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our method under the application scenarios of visualization recommendation, sequencing charts for reasoning analysis results, and making a chart design choice.
