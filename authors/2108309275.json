            "title": "Learning Decomposed Spatial Relations for Multi-Variate Time-Series Modeling",
            "abstract": "Modeling multi-variate time-series (MVTS) data is a long-standing research subject and has found wide applications. Recently, there is a surge of interest in modeling spatial relations between variables as graphs, i.e., first learning one static graph for each dataset and then exploiting the graph structure via graph neural networks. However, as spatial relations may differ substantially across samples, building one static graph for all the samples inherently limits flexibility and severely degrades the performance in practice. To address this issue, we propose a framework for fine-grained modeling and utilization of spatial correlation between variables. By analyzing the statistical properties of real-world datasets, a universal decomposition of spatial correlation graphs is first identified. Specifically, the hidden spatial relations can be decomposed into a prior part, which applies across all the samples, and a dynamic part, which varies between samples, and building different graphs is necessary to model these relations. To better coordinate the learning of the two relational graphs, we propose a min-max learning paradigm that not only regulates the common part of different dynamic graphs but also guarantees spatial distinguishability among samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on both time-series forecasting and time-series point prediction tasks.",

            "title": "ReLoop2: Building Self-Adaptive Recommendation Models via Responsive Error Compensation Loop",
            "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems face the challenge of operating in non-stationary environments, where data distribution shifts arise from evolving user behaviors over time. To tackle this challenge, a common approach is to periodically re-train or incrementally update deployed deep models with newly observed data, resulting in a continual learning process. However, the conventional learning paradigm of neural networks relies on iterative gradient-based updates with a small learning rate, making it slow for large recommendation models to adapt. In this paper, we introduce ReLoop2, a self-correcting learning loop that facilitates fast model adaptation in online recommender systems through responsive error compensation. Inspired by the slow-fast complementary learning system observed in human brains, we propose an error memory module that directly stores error samples from incoming data streams. These stored samples are subsequently leveraged to compensate for model prediction errors during testing, particularly under distribution shifts. The error memory module is designed with fast access capabilities and undergoes continual refreshing with newly observed data samples during the model serving phase to support fast model adaptation. We evaluate the effectiveness of ReLoop2 on three open benchmark datasets as well as a real-world production dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of ReLoop2 in enhancing the responsiveness and adaptiveness of recommender systems operating in non-stationary environments.",

            "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in NLP domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM).",

            "abstract": "Order execution is a fundamental task in quantitative finance, aiming at finishing acquisition or liquidation for a number of trading orders of the specific assets. Recent advance in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) provides a data-driven solution to the order execution problem. However, the existing works always optimize execution for an individual order, overlooking the practice that multiple orders are specified to execute simultaneously, resulting in suboptimality and bias. In this paper, we first present a multi-agent RL (MARL) method for multi-order execution considering practical constraints. Specifically, we treat every agent as an individual operator to trade one specific order, while keeping communicating with each other and collaborating for maximizing the overall profits. Nevertheless, the existing MARL algorithms often incorporate communication among agents by exchanging only the information of their partial observations, which is inefficient in complicated financial market. To improve collaboration, we then propose a learnable multi-round communication protocol, for the agents communicating the intended actions with each other and refining accordingly. It is optimized through a novel action value attribution method which is provably consistent with the original learning objective yet more efficient. The experiments on the data from two real-world markets have illustrated superior performance with significantly better collaboration effectiveness achieved by our method.",

            "abstract": "User-tag profiling is an effective way of mining user attributes in modern recommender systems. However, prior researches fail to extract users' precise preferences for tags in the items due to their incomplete feature-input patterns. To convert user-item interactions to user-tag preferences, we propose a novel feature-based framework named Coalition Tag Multi-View Mapping (CTMVM), which identifies and investigates two special features, Coalition Feature and Privileged Feature. The former indicates decisive tags in each click where relationships between tags in one item are treated as a coalition game. The latter represents highly informative features that only occur during training. For the coalition feature, we adopt Shapley Value based Empowerment (SVE) to model the tags in items with a game-theoretic paradigm and charge the network to straight master user preferences for essential tags. For the privileged feature, we present Privileged Knowledge Mapping (PKM) to explicitly distill privileged feature knowledge for each tag into one single embedding, which assists the model in predicting user-tag preferences at a more fine-grained level. However, the barren capacity of single embeddings limits the diverse relations between each tag and different privileged features. Therefore, we further propose Adaptive Multi-View Mapping (AMVM) model to enhance effect by handling multiple mapping networks. Excellent offline experiment results on two public and one private datasets show the out-standing performance of CTMVM. After the deployment on Alibaba large-scale recommendation systems, CTMVM achieved improvement by 10.81% and 6.74% in terms of Theme-CTR and Item-CTR respectively, which validates the effectiveness of taking in the two particular features for training.",

            "abstract": "Re-ranking, as the final stage of the multi-stage recommender systems (MRS), aims at modeling the listwise context and the cross-item interactions between the candidate items. The objective is usually the overall utility (e.g., total clicks or revenue) of the re-ranked list, which is determined not only by the relevance, but also by the diversity of the list. However, existing methods equally promote diversity for all users and often compromise the relevance ranking. In reality, users have different diversity preferences and we should diversify the list tailored to individual users\u2019 interests and needs. Users\u2019 behavior history contains rich information which may be used for inferring their diversity preferences, but has rarely been explored in existing work. In this work, we propose a novel neural re-ranking with personalized diversification method (dubbed RAPID) to address the above challenge. RAPID explicitly models each user\u2019s preference distribution over different topics by exploiting the intra- and inter-topic interactions from the user\u2019s behavior history. The personalized diversity gain brought by each candidate item is then measured by the item\u2019s marginal diversity and the learned personalized preference. The relevance and the personalized diversity are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner to automatically manage the relevance-diversity tradeoff. Experimental results on two public datasets and a proprietary dataset show that RAPID outperforms the state-of-the-art with the highest utility and the best relevance-diversity tradeoff. We further prove that RAPID has a regret bound of $\\tilde O(\\sqrt n )$ on utility, which provides theoretical guarantee that its performance is near-optimal.",

            "abstract": "With the widespread application of online advertising systems, click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume (e.g., billions of user click logs). The large capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to its full potential, since click signals are not sufficient enough for the model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs and learn more robust and effective representations. However, current works on this line are still preliminary and rudimentary, leaving self-supervised learning for CTR prediction still an open question. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic Pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection (RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking and predicting a small portion of input features, and we also introduce Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world million-level datasets (i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods over several strong baselines, and achieve new state-of-the-art in terms of both performance and efficiency for CTR prediction.",

            "title": "Improving Robustness of Intent Detection Under Adversarial Attacks: A Geometric Constraint Perspective",
            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs)-based natural language processing (NLP) systems are vulnerable to being fooled by adversarial examples presented in recent studies. Intent detection tasks in dialog systems are no exception, however, relatively few works have been attempted on the defense side. The combination of linear classifier and softmax is widely used in most defense methods for other NLP tasks. Unfortunately, it does not encourage the model to learn well-separated feature representations. Thus, it is easy to induce adversarial examples. In this article, we propose a simple, yet efficient defense method from the geometric constraint perspective. Specifically, we first propose an M-similarity metric to shrink variances of intraclass features. Intuitively, better geometric conditions of feature space can bring lower misclassification probability (MP). Therefore, we derive the optimal geometric constraints of anchors within each category from the overall MP (OMP) with theoretical guarantees. Due to the nonconvex characteristic of the optimal geometric condition, it is hard to satisfy the traditional optimization process. To this end, we regard such geometric constraints as manifold optimization processes in the Stiefel manifold, thus naturally avoiding the above challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve robustness compared with baselines, while retaining the excellent performance on normal examples.",

We notice that the key insight of STARec is to use the feature and labels to augment the representations, and thus the effectiveness of STARec relies on the acquisition of rich browsing records of the target user and powerful representation of each browsed item and thus its performance could heavily drop regarding long-tail users and items. To this end, we extend STARec by constructing a graph upon the user-item interactions and leveraging the graph structure to enhance the representation learning. We call this extended version Search-based Time-Aware Graph-Enhanced Recommendation (STAGE). We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and STARec achieves consistent superiority. We further compare STAGE against STARec long-tail users and our results demonstrate that STAGE could outperform STARec at most cases. Results of online A/B tests show that STARec and STAGE achieve an average CTR improvement of around 6% and 1.5% in the two main item recommendation scenarios respectively.",
