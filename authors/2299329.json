            "title": "Accelerated Learning and Assessment in Engineering Mechanics: Designing an Interactive Tool to Support Students' Learning",
            "abstract": "Repeated deliberate practice in problem-solving practices is known to be beneficial in increasing students\u2019 overall understanding of targeted concepts. Additionally, when students receive frequent formative feedback, they are able to identify problematic areas of their reasoning and can correct their underlying cognitive frames of reference. However, many undergraduate engineering courses are not designed to provide students with repeated practice and targeted feedback by use of educational interventions. This project was designed to: 1) iteratively develop the innovative problem delivery and assessment system and evaluate its effectiveness in meeting specific learning and assessment goals in engineering mechanics, 2) systematically study how this technology-rich problem-solving interface can enhance the learning, teaching, and assessment of complex knowledge, and 3) critically evaluate opportunities and barriers to scaling and transferring the innovation across educational contexts. By focusing on the development of strong analytical problem-solving skills characterized by rich conceptual knowledge, this project directly responds to demands from both industry and the federal government for colleges and universities to develop complex problem solvers for the workforce. Overall, this project aims to assist engineering faculty and students through the development of an open-access problem-solving interface that will accelerate learning and enhance assessment, which along with a growing body of practice exercises, could be widely adopted in engineering mechanics education. The project seeks to develop an interactive online system for solving problems in introductory engineering mechanics courses for an undergraduate degree program. Our system aims to provide a feedback-based, exploratory environment for students to work on different problem instances and variations to explore key concepts of mathematical problem solving through developing equations for a target solution. This poster will present the current implementation of our system and discuss the different features for problem solving, feedback, and tracking of student activity and progress.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Scan statistics is one of the most popular approaches for anomaly detection in spatial and network data. In practice, there are numerous sources of uncertainty in the observed data. However, most prior works have overlooked such uncertainty, which can affect the accuracy and inferences of such methods. In this paper, we develop the first systematic approach to incorporating uncertainty in scan statistics. We study two formulations for robust scan statistics, one based on the sample average approximation and the other using a max-min objective. We show that uncertainty significantly increases the computational complexity of these problems. Rigorous algorithms and efficient heuristics for both formulations are developed with justification of theoretical bounds. We evaluate our proposed methods on synthetic and real datasets, and we observe that our methods give significant improvement in the detection power as well as optimization objective, relative to a baseline.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Recently, every enterprise generates large volumes of high dimensional data on a regular basis. Complex data mining and analysis techniques are used to feasibly analyse this data. Feature selection aids in this by providing a reduced representation of this data while maintaining integrity. We propose a graph-based feature selection algorithm utilizing feature intercorrelation to construct a weighted attribute graph, from which irrelevant attributes are iteratively removed to select only the most important features called reduct based on a scoring scheme. Disconnectivity of the graph serves as the point of termination for our algorithm. The performance of our algorithm on real valued and discretized datasets is evaluated statistically by generating the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve and by measuring accuracies of various classifiers for each reduced dataset.",

            "abstract": "In Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) the nodes are subjected to hostile environment for sensing critical data. Due to the unattended nature of the network the sink is not always present. Hence, the nodes in the network are required to function in a distributed way in order to ensure Data Survivability and Data Confidentiality. In this work we address these two issues. We have proposed algorithm (s) to ensure Data Survivability by encryption and data replication. We propose a simple scheme for key management which ensures confidentiality by sharing the key among various nodes in the network so that the adversary cannot read the data by compromising a node in the network. We have compared our scheme with the existing ones, both mathematically and by simulations. Analysis shows that our scheme performs better in terms of overheads and efficiency.",
