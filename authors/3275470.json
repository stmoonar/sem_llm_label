To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts.

(2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EF001273) recommended a numerically bounded linguistic probability (NBLP) scheme for communicating probabilistic information in extreme event attribution studies. We provide a critique of NBLP schemes in general and of Lewis et al.'s in particular, noting two key points. First, evidence from voluminous behavioral science research on the interpretation of linguistic probabilities indicates that NBLP schemes are an ineffective means of communicating uncertainty to others. Second, where the motivation to implement such schemes nevertheless persists, the schemes should be developed through an evidence\u2010based approach that seeks to optimize interpretational agreement between the scheme and users.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting of geopolitical events is a notoriously difficult task, with experts failing to significantly outperform a random baseline across many types of forecasting events. One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

            "abstract": "People often rely on forecasts from multiple experts to make decisions about uncertain events in diverse domains such as health and finance. Research has differentiated between perceptions of conflicting forecasts and those of imprecise forecasts, finding more conflict aversion for gains and more imprecision aversion for losses (Baillon, Cabantous, & Wakker, 2012; Smithson, 1999, 2013). However, conflict and imprecision are rarely well differentiated and are often correlated. We examine the joint and distinct effects of conflict and imprecision by modeling subjective estimates focusing on the effect of key attributes of forecast sets: (a) the structure of overlap and (b) level of asymmetry. Participants (N = 358 recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk) saw a series of triplets of interval forecasts of financial market volatility (e.g., forecast A: 0\u201320% improvement; forecast B: 5\u201395% improvement; and forecast C: 10\u2013100% improvement) varied in structure of overlap (intersecting, disjoint, or mixed) and level of asymmetry. Participants estimated the most likely value and range of possible values for each forecast set. We used various measures of central tendency and agreement to model the estimates using the pairwise technique developed by Broomell, Budescu, and Por (2014). The ratio of unique predictions that deviate from the estimates less for one model compared to another indicates which model is more accurate. The geometric mean of accuracy ratios between a given model and all others, weighted by the number of distinct predictions, summarizes the relative accuracy of a model. Models were first compared across all sets and then by the major factors. Results",

            "abstract": "Statistical aggregation is often used to combine multiple opinions within a group. Such aggregates outperform individuals, including experts, in various prediction and estimation tasks. This result is attributed to the \u201cwisdom of crowds.\u201d We seek to improve the quality of such aggregates by eliminating poorly performing individuals from the crowd. We propose a new measure of contribution to assess the judges' performance relative to the group and use positive contributors to build a weighting model for aggregating forecasts. In Study 1, we analyze 1,233 judges forecasting almost 200 current events to illustrate the superiority of our model over unweighted models and models weighted by measures of absolute performance. In Study 2, we replicate our findings by using economic forecasts from the European Central Bank and show how the method can be used to identify smaller crowds of the top positive contributors. We show that the model derives its power from identifying experts who consistently outperform the crowd. \n \nData, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1909 . \n \nThis paper was accepted by James Smith, decision analysis.",

Our approach accounts for group members that may be biased in their forecasts and/or have errors that correlate with the criterion values being forecast.

            "title": "When is a crowd wise?",
            "abstract": "Numerous studies and anecdotes demonstrate the \"wisdom of the crowd,\" the surprising accuracy of a group's aggregated judgments. Less is known, however, about the generality of crowd wisdom. For example, are crowds wise even if their members have systematic judgmental biases, or can influence each other before members render their judgments? If so, are there situations in which we can expect a crowd to be less accurate than skilled individuals? We provide a precise but general definition of crowd wisdom: A crowd is wise if a linear aggregate, for example a mean, of its members' judgments is closer to the target value than a randomly, but not necessarily uniformly, sampled member of the crowd. Building on this definition, we develop a theoretical framework for examining, a priori, when and to what degree a crowd will be wise. We systematically investigate the boundary conditions for crowd wisdom within this framework and determine conditions under which the accuracy advantage for crowds is maximized. Our results demonstrate that crowd wisdom is highly robust: Even if judgments are biased and correlated, one would need to nearly deterministically select only a highly skilled judge before an individual's judgment could be expected to be more accurate than a simple averaging of the crowd. Our results also provide an accuracy rationale behind the need for diversity of judgments among group members. Contrary to folk explanations of crowd wisdom which hold that judgments should ideally be independent so that errors cancel out, we find that crowd wisdom is maximized when judgments systematically differ as much as possible. We re-analyze data from two published studies that confirm our theoretical results.",
