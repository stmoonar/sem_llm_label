            "abstract": "We consider a variant of the densest subgraph problem in networks with single or multiple edge attributes. For example, in a social network, the edge attributes may describe the type of relationship between users, such as friends, family, or acquaintances, or different types of communication. For conceptual simplicity, we view the attributes as edge colors. The new problem we address is to find a diverse densest subgraph that fulfills given requirements on the numbers of edges of specific colors. When searching for a dense social network community, our problem will enforce the requirement that the community is diverse according to criteria specified by the edge attributes. We show that the decision versions for finding exactly, at most, and at least h colored edges densest subgraph, where h is a vector of color requirements, are NP-complete, for already two colors. For the problem of finding a densest subgraph with at least h colored edges, we provide a linear-time constant-factor approximation algorithm when the input graph is sparse. On the way, we introduce the related at least h (non-colored) edges densest subgraph problem, show its hardness, and also provide a linear-time constant-factor approximation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our new algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Finding dense subnetworks, with density based on edges or more complex structures, such as subgraphs or $k$-cliques, is a fundamental algorithmic problem with many applications. While the problem has been studied extensively in static networks, much remains to be explored for temporal networks. In this work we introduce the novel problem of identifying the temporal motif densest subnetwork, i.e., the densest subnetwork with respect to temporal motifs, which are high-order patterns characterizing temporal networks. This problem significantly differs from analogous formulations for dense temporal (or static) subnetworks as these do not account for temporal motifs. Identifying temporal motifs is an extremely challenging task, and thus, efficient methods are required. To this end, we design two novel randomized approximation algorithms with rigorous probabilistic guarantees that provide high-quality solutions. We perform extensive experiments showing that our methods outperform baselines. Furthermore, our algorithms scale on networks with up to billions of temporal edges, while baselines cannot handle such large networks. We use our techniques to analyze a financial network and show that our formulation reveals important network structures, such as bursty temporal events and communities of users with similar interests.",

            "abstract": "Timeline algorithms are key parts of online social networks, but during recent years they have been blamed for increasing polarization and disagreement in our society. Opinion-dynamics models have been used to study a variety of phenomena in online social networks, but an open question remains on how thesemodels can be augmented to take into account the fine-grained impact of user-level timeline algorithms. We make progress on this question by providing a way to model the impact of timeline algorithms on opinion dynamics. Specifically, we show how the popular Friedkin--Johnsen opinion-formation model can be augmented based on aggregate information, extracted from timeline data. We use our model to study the problem of minimizing the polarization and disagreement; we assume that we are allowed to make small changes to the users' timeline compositions by strengthening some topics of discussion and penalizing some others. We present a gradient descent-based algorithm for this problem, and show that under realistic parameter settings, our algorithm computes a (1+\\varepsilon)-approximate solution in time~\\tO(m\\sqrtn \u0142g(1/\\varepsilon)), where m~is the number of edges in the graph and n~is the number of vertices. We also present an algorithm that provably computes an \\varepsilon-approximation of our model in near-linear time. We evaluate our method on real-world data and show that it effectively reduces the polarization and disagreement in the network. Finally, we release an anonymized graph dataset with ground-truth opinions and more than 27\\,000~nodes (the previously largest publicly available dataset contains less than 550~nodes).",

            "abstract": "In World Wide Web (WWW) systems, networks (or graphs) serve as a fundamental tool for representing, analyzing, and understanding linked data, providing significant insights into the underlying systems. Naturally, most real-world systems have inherent temporal information, e.g., interactions in social networks occur at specific moments in time and last for a certain period. Temporal networks, i.e., network data modeling temporal information, enable novel and fundamental discoveries about the underlying systems they model, otherwise not captured by static networks that ignore such temporal information. In this tutorial, we present state-of-the-art models and algorithmic techniques for mining temporal networks that can provide precious insights into a plethora of web-related applications. We present how temporal networks can be used to extract novel information, especially in web-related network data, and highlight the challenges that arise when modeling temporal information compared to traditional static network-based approaches. We first overview different temporal network models. We then show how such powerful models can be leveraged to extract novel insights through suitable mining primitives. In particular, we present recent advances addressing most foundational problems for temporal network mining---ranging from the computation of temporal centrality measures, temporal motif counting, and temporal communities to bursty events and anomaly detection.",

            "abstract": "Today, as increasingly complex predictive models are developed, simple rule sets remain a crucial tool to obtain interpretable predictions and drive high-stakes decision making. However, a single rule set provides a partial representation of a learning task. An emerging paradigm in interpretable machine learning aims at exploring the Rashomon set of all models exhibiting near-optimal performance. Existing work on Rashomon-set exploration focuses on exhaustive search of the Rashomon set for particular classes of models, which can be a computationally challenging task. On the other hand, exhaustive enumeration leads to redundancy that often is not necessary, and a representative sample or an estimate of the size of the Rashomon set is sufficient for many applications. In this work, we propose, for the first time, efficient methods to explore the Rashomon set of rule set models with or without exhaustive search. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a variety of scenarios.",

            "abstract": "We introduce Polaris, a network null model for colored multi-graphs that preserves the Joint Color Matrix. Polaris is specifically designed for studying network polarization, where vertices belong to a side in a debate or a partisan group, represented by a vertex color, and relations have different strengths, represented by an integer-valued edge multiplicity. The key feature of Polaris is preserving the Joint Color Matrix (JCM) of the multigraph, which specifies the number of edges connecting vertices of any two given colors. The JCM is the basic property that determines color assortativity, a fundamental aspect in studying homophily and segregation in polarized networks. By using Polaris, network scientists can test whether a phenomenon is entirely explained by the JCM of the observed network or whether other phenomena might be at play. Technically, our null model is an extension of the configuration model: an ensemble of colored multigraphs characterized by the same degree sequence and the same JCM. To sample from this ensemble, we develop a suite of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, collectively named Polaris-*. It includes Polaris-B, an adaptation of a generic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and Polaris-C, a faster, specialized algorithm with higher acceptance probabilities. This new null model and the associated algorithms provide a more nuanced toolset for examining polarization in social networks, thus enabling statistically sound conclusions.",

            "abstract": "Providing recommendations that are both relevant and diverse is a key consideration of modern recommender systems. Optimizing both of these measures presents a fundamental trade-off, as higher diversity typically comes at the cost of relevance, resulting in lower user engagement. Existing recommendation algorithms try to resolve this trade-off by combining the two measures, relevance and diversity, into one aim and then seeking recommendations that optimize the combined objective, for a given number of items to recommend. Traditional approaches, however, do not consider the user interaction with the recommended items. In this paper, we put the user at the central stage, and build on the interplay between relevance, diversity, and user behavior. In contrast to applications where the goal is solely to maximize engagement, we focus on scenarios aiming at maximizing the total amount of knowledge encountered by the user. We use diversity as a surrogate of the amount of knowledge obtained by the user while interacting with the system, and we seek to maximize diversity. We propose a probabilistic user-behavior model in which users keep interacting with the recommender system as long as they receive relevant recommendations, but they may stop if the relevance of the recommended items drops. Thus, for a recommender system to achieve a high-diversity measure, it will need to produce recommendations that are both relevant and diverse. Finally, we propose a novel recommendation strategy that combines relevance and diversity by a copula function. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed methodology over multiple datasets, and we show that our strategy outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.

            "abstract": "Maximizing submodular functions have been studied extensively for a wide range of subset-selection problems. However, much less attention has been given to the role of submodularity in sequence-selection and ranking problems. A recently-introduced framework, named \\emph{maximum submodular ranking} (MSR), tackles a family of ranking problems that arise naturally when resources are shared among multiple demands with different budgets. For example, the MSR framework can be used to rank web pages for multiple user intents. In this paper, we extend the MSR framework in the streaming setting. In particular, we consider two different streaming models and we propose practical approximation algorithms. In the first streaming model, called \\emph{function arriving}, we assume that submodular functions (demands) arrive continuously in a stream, while in the second model, called \\emph{item arriving}, we assume that items (resources) arrive continuously. Furthermore, we study the MSR problem with additional constraints on the output sequence, such as a matroid constraint that can ensure fair exposure among items from different groups. These extensions significantly broaden the range of problems that can be captured by the MSR framework. On the practical side, we develop several novel applications based on the MSR formulation, and empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed~methods.",
