            "abstract": "Random Walk is a basic algorithm to explore the structure of networks, which can be used in many tasks, such as local community detection and network embedding. Existing random walk methods are based on single networks that contain limited information. In contrast, real data often contain entities with different types or/and from different sources, which are comprehensive and can be better modeled by multiple networks. To take the advantage of rich information in multiple networks and make better inferences on entities, in this study, we propose random walk on multiple networks, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {RWM}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">RWM</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"luo-ieq1-3221668.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {RWM}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">RWM</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"luo-ieq2-3221668.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is flexible and supports both multiplex networks and general multiple networks, which may form many-to-many node mappings between networks. <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {RWM}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">RWM</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"luo-ieq3-3221668.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> sends a random walker on each network to obtain the local proximity (i.e., node visiting probabilities) w.r.t. the starting nodes.

            "title": "Training Large-scale Foundation Models on Emerging AI Chips",
            "abstract": "Foundation models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have garnered significant interest from both academia and industry due to their emergent capabilities, such as few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, instruction following, and model calibration. Such capabilities were previously only attainable with specially designed models, such as those using knowledge graphs, but can now be achieved on a much larger scale with foundation models. As the capabilities of foundation models have increased, so too have their sizes at a rate much faster than Moore's law. For example, the BERT large model was initially released as a 334M model in 2018, and by 2023, the largest GPT-4 models are estimated to range between 200-300B, representing an increase of three orders of magnitude in just five years. The training of foundation models requires massive computing power. For instance, training a BERT model on a single state-of-the-art GPU machine with multi-A100 chips can take several days, while training GPT-3 models on a large multi-instance GPU cluster can take several months to complete the estimated 3 X 1023 flops. This tutorial provides an overview of the latest progress in supporting foundation model training and inference with new AI chips. It reviews progress on the modeling side, with an emphasis on the transformer architecture, and presents the system architecture supporting training and serving foundation models. This includes programming language frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, graph compilers, 3D parallelisms, and accelerators such as the GPU H100, TPU, and Trainium. Finally, the tutorial presents our experience of training foundation models using different systems.",

            "abstract": "Time series data has become pervasive across domains such as finance, transportation, retail, entertainment, and healthcare. This shift towards continuous monitoring and recording, fueled by advancements in sensing technologies, necessitates the development of new tools and solutions. Despite extensive study, the importance of time series analysis continues to increase. However, modern time series data present challenges to existing techniques, including irregular sampling and spatiotemporal structures. Time series mining research is both challenging and rewarding as it connects diverse disciplines and requires interdisciplinary solutions. The goals of this workshop are to (1) highlight the significant challenges that underpin learning and mining from time series data (e.g., irregular sampling, spatiotemporal structure, uncertainty quantification), (2) discuss recent algorithmic, theoretical, statistical, or systems-based developments for tackling these problems, and (3) to synergize the research activities and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. In summary, our workshop will focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of time series data analysis and will provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss potential research directions and critical technical issues and present solutions to tackle related issues in practical applications. We will invite researchers and practitioners from the related areas of AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, and many others to contribute to this workshop.",

            "abstract": "This work studies the threats of adversarial attack on multivariate probabilistic forecasting models and viable defense mechanisms. Our studies discover a new attack pattern that negatively impact the forecasting of a target time series via making strategic, sparse (imperceptible) modifications to the past observations of a small number of other time series. To mitigate the impact of such attack, we have developed two defense strategies. First, we extend a previously developed randomized smoothing technique in classification to multivariate forecasting scenarios. Second, we develop an adversarial training algorithm that learns to create adversarial examples and at the same time optimizes the forecasting model to improve its robustness against such adversarial simulation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our attack schemes are powerful and our defense algorithms are more effective compared with baseline defense mechanisms.",
