            "abstract": "Attention mechanism has been used as an important component across Vision-and-Language(VL) tasks in order to bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual features. While attention has been widely used in VL tasks, it has not been examined the capability of different attention alignment calculation in bridging the semantic gap between visual and textual clues. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on understanding the role of attention alignment by looking into the attention score calculation methods and check how it actually represents the visual region\u2019s and textual token\u2019s significance for the global assessment. We also analyse the conditions which attention score calculation mechanism would be more (or less) interpretable, and which may impact the model performance on three different VL tasks, including visual question answering, text-to-image generation, text-and-image matching (both sentence and image retrieval). Our analysis is the first of its kind and provides useful insights of the importance of each attention alignment score calculation when applied at the training phase of VL tasks, commonly ignored in attention-based cross modal models, and/or pretrained models.

            "title": "Integration of Automatic Sentence Segmentation and Lexical Analysis of Ancient Chinese based on BiLSTM-CRF Model",
            "abstract": "The basic tasks of ancient Chinese information processing include automatic sentence segmentation, word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. Tasks such as lexical analysis need to be based on sentence segmentation because of the reason that a plenty of ancient books are not punctuated. However, step-by-step processing is prone to cause multi-level diffusion of errors. This paper designs and implements an integrated annotation system of sentence segmentation and lexical analysis. The BiLSTM-CRF neural network model is used to verify the generalization ability and the effect of sentence segmentation and lexical analysis on different label levels on four cross-age test sets. Research shows that the integration method adopted in ancient Chinese improves the F1-score of sentence segmentation, word segmentation and part of speech tagging. Based on the experimental results of each test set, the F1-score of sentence segmentation reached 78.95, with an average increase of 3.5%; the F1-score of word segmentation reached 85.73%, with an average increase of 0.18%; and the F1-score of part-of-speech tagging reached 72.65, with an average increase of 0.35%.",

            "title": "Variation of Suspended Particles in the Bottom Layer of the East China Sea with Data from Seafloor Observatory",
            "abstract": "The in situ scattering and transmissometry laser (LISST-100X), equipped with an acoustic wave and current (AWAC) meter and conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) instruments over the seabed in the East China Sea, was used to monitor the variation in suspended particles in the bottom sea layer, including particle size distribution (PSD) and volume concentration. The power law approximation was tested to describe the variability in PSD based on the field data. The results show that the power law was robust in processing continuous data, accompanied with the same optimal reference particle size (~63 \u03bcm) and little change in the corresponding exponent (~3.4) in both periods. Suspended particles were divided into three types: macroflocs (>133 \u03bcm), microflocs (36\u2013133 \u03bcm), and single grains (<36 \u03bcm). Particle sizes were coarse during the two seasons, with macroflocs representing more than 60% of all the suspended particles, especially in February, when the particle size spectra were usually open-ended. Results from the harmonic analysis method indicate that tidal-induced resuspension and advection are the major reasons for the diurnal dynamics of sediments. Due to the tidal asymmetry in the region, we only found one mode in volume concentration at the moment of maximum velocity. However, the ratios of macroflocs were bimodal, with maximum floods and ebbs in one tidal cycle in February, when the higher mode at the maximum ebbs may be contributed to by the flocculation of finer particles considering the decreasing ratios of finer particles. Due to the enhanced stratification and the clean barrier built up by the Taiwan Warm Current in the southeast corner, the significant daily variation in suspended particles observed in February weakened in September. The influence of waves was uncertain, although the correlation coefficient between significant wave height and volume concentration was about 64% in February.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor observatories enable real-time, continuous and long-term observations that promise major breakthroughs in ocean sciences. The effort to dynamically control in situ sensor systems performing individual and cooperative observation tasks is both a challenge and a guarantee for the stable operations of functional observatories. However, current sensor control systems for seafloor observatories are application-oriented and focus on specific engineering requirements rather than general model research. In this paper, a sensor control model was proposed to provide a theoretical specification for designing, developing and deploying a sensor control system for cabled seafloor observatories. The model abstracted the sensor control as a standardized bidirectional information flow process and accordingly structured the control system into the application layer, the service layer, the networking layer, and the sensing layer. The layered functions and interactions between adjacent layers in return realized this information process. A prototype control system was designed and developed, the monitoring architecture of which was derived from one of the deployment scenarios of the sensor control model. The prototype system was tested for its plug-and-play enablement through a series of trials such as tank tests and shallow sea trials. It was put into service for the operational Xiaoqushan Seafloor Observatory and was consistently functioning and presenting satisfactory practical performance in accordance with all the requirements laid for the project.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor observatories enable long term, continuous and multidisciplinary observations, promising major breakthroughs in marine environment research. The effort to remotely control in situ multidisciplinary equipment performing individual and cooperative tasks is both a challenge and a guarantee for the stable operations of functional observatories. With China starting to establish ocean observatory sensor networks, in this study we describe a monitoring system for cabled observatories in the East China Sea (ESOMS) that enables this effort in a plug and play way. An information oriented monitoring architecture for ESOMS was first introduced, derived from a layered control model for ocean observatory sensor network. The architecture contained three components and enabled bidirectional information flow of observation data and commands, based on which architecture components were designed to enable plug-and-play control within related model layers. A control method enabled by general junction box (GJB) and ocean sensor markup language (OSML) was thus proposed as the plug-and-play solution for implementing ESOMS. The GJB-OSML enabled control method (GOE Control Method) mainly actualized two processes, one of which was that the in situ GJB interfaced and represented every attached sensor as a Sensing Endpoint in the cabled observatory network. The other process was that the remote ESOMS utilized the same IP/Port related information modeled by OSML to create/operate a Function Node acted as agent of the in situ sensor. A case study for using ESOMS in the Xiaoqushan Seafloor Observatory was finally presented to prove its performance and applicability. Given this successful engineering trial, the ESOMS design and implementation could be applicable and beneficial for similar efforts in future construction of seafloor observatory network both at home and abroad.",

However, these complex functions also bring risks to the smart meters, and they become susceptible to vulnerabilities and attacks. We present the rat-group attack in this paper, which exploits the vulnerabilities of smart meters in the cyber world, but spreads in the physical world due to the direct economic benefits. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic work has been conducted on this attack. Game theory is then applied to analyze this attack, and two game models are proposed and compared under different assumptions. The analysis results suggest that the power company shall follow an open defense policy: disclosing the defense parameters to all users (i.e., the potential attackers), results in less loss in the attack.",
