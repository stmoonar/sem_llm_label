How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields? \u2022How should standard AI courses evolve? \u2022How could we leverage AI education to promote diversity in the field?

            "abstract": "Enrollment numbers in computer science courses are higher than ever and keep growing. This renders communication and interaction of instructors with individual students extremely challenging, leading to an increase in anonymity (anonymity gap). Especially when students struggle in computing courses, personalized help is crucial for them to overcome their problems and frustration and eventually succeed in their studies. At the same time detecting students' misconceptions and gathering feedback at scale is time consuming, resulting in a lack of unbiased feedback available to course instructors (feedback gap). Real-time student feedback is a crucial source for instructors to adapt their teaching pace, teaching materials, or course content during the course of the semester to cater to an increasingly diverse student population. In this paper, we investigate a scalable approach to collect and analyze student feedback and emotions. We find that sentiment analysis can efficiently capture student emotions, bearing the potential to lessen both the anonymity and feedback gaps.",

            "abstract": "We are happy to present the annual activity report of the ACM Special Interest Group on AI (ACM SIGAI), covering the period from July 2018 to June 2019.\n The scope of ACM SIGAI consists of the study of intelligence and its realization in computer systems (see also its web-site at sigai.acm.org). This includes areas such as\n autonomous agents, cognitive modeling, computer vision, constraint programming, human language technologies, intelligent user interfaces, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, planning and search, problem solving and robotics.\n Members come from academia, industry and government agencies worldwide. ACM SIGAI recently added two new ACM SIGAI chapters, namely one professional chapter in Laguna Nigel (USA) and one student chapter at the SRM Institute of Science & Technology in Chennai.\n ACM SIGAI also added two new officers this year to be able to serve its membership better, namely Iolanda Leite from the Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) as second newsletter editor-in-chief and Marion Neumann from Washington University in St. Louis (USA) as diversity officer, thus increasing diversity in the ACM SIGAI leadership committee by increasing both the number of international officers and the number of female officers and also furthering the internationalization of the ACM SIGAI newsletter. Marion will be covering diversity also as part of the ACM SIGAI newsletter. ACM SIGAI started officers meetings at major AI conferences already in 2018 and continued the new practice in 2019 (so far at the AAAI Conference), in addition to all-officers teleconferences and a monthly ACM SIGAI leadership teleconference.",

            "title": "AI education matters: a first introduction to modeling and learning using the data science workflow",
            "abstract": "Traditionally artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses are taught at the senior and graduate level in higher-education computer science curricula following the mastery learning strategy, cf. Figure 1. This makes sense, since most AI and ML models and the theory behind them require a substantial understanding of probability and statistics, as well as advanced calculus and matrix algebra. To understand Logistic Regression as a probabilistic classifier performing maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation, for example, students need to understand joint and conditional probability distributions. In order to derive the back propagation algorithm to train Neural Networks students need to understand partial derivatives and inner and outer tensor products. These are just two of many examples where substantial mathematical background - typically taught at the junior level in a computer science major program - is required. With AI and ML algorithms being used more widely by enterprises across domains, as well as, in applications and services we use in our daily lives, it makes sense to raise awareness about what AI is, what it can and cannot do, and how it is used to solve problems to a broader audience. Very much in the same spirit as the \"CS for all\" idea (https://www.csforall.org), we have to extend our curricula to include introductory courses to AI and ML on the early undergraduate level (or even in high-school) to expose students to the ideas and working principles of AI technology. One way to achieve this is to introduce the principles of working with data, modeling, and learning through the data science workflow.",
