            "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a novel 4-DOF two-limb gripper mechanism with a simple design that offers high adaptability for different objects. The mechanism integrates a three-finger end effector and employs a 2-DOF driving system in both serial kinematic chains mounted on the base, addressing performance problems caused by moving actuators. First, the architecture of the gripper mechanism is described, and its mobility is verified. Next, the inverse and forward kinematic problems are solved, and the Jacobian matrix is derived to analyze the singularity conditions. The inverse and forward singularity surfaces are plotted. The workspace is investigated using a search method, and two indices, manipulability and dexterity, are studied. The proposed manipulator\u2019s parameters are optimized for improved dexterity. The novel gripper mechanism has high potential for grasping different types of parts within a large workspace, making it a valuable addition to the field of robotics.",
