            "title": "Dynamic Recommendation Based on Graph Diffusion and Ebbinghaus Curve",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, many dynamic recommendations still suffer from the insufficiency of finding user online interest evolving patterns because of those complicated interactions. In general, each interaction is usually impacted by multiple underlying reasons, which needs us to open the \u201cbox\u201d of each interaction instance instead of simply treating them as a pair-wise link. Besides, different users usually perform differently for their long-term and short-term tastes, leaving traditional sequential models far from personalized. In this article, we propose a novel recommendation model based on Graph Diffusion and Ebbinghaus Curve. Specifically, to explore the underline reasons for different interactions, we explore an underlying sub-graph for each interaction and find important reasoning paths within the sub-graph via a well-designed graph diffusion method. To capture users\u2019 personalized strategies on long-term and short-term tastes, we are inspired by the Ebbinghaus Curve, which can naturally describe users\u2019 memory patterns, and design an effective neural network to process users\u2019 evolving behaviors. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and the results further confirm the superiority of our model compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Aesthetic attributes are crucial for aesthetics because they explicitly present some photo quality cues that a human expert might use to evaluate a photo\u2019s aesthetic quality. However, annotating aesthetic attributes is a time-consuming, costly, and error-prone task, which leads to the issue that photos available are partially annotated with attributes. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel semi-supervised adversarial learning method for photo aesthetic assessment from partially attribute-annotated photos, which can greatly reduce the reliance on manual attribute annotation. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a score-attributes generator <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R$</tex-math></inline-formula>, a photo generator <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$G$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and a discriminator <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$D$</tex-math></inline-formula>. The score-attributes generator learns the aesthetic score and attributes simultaneously to capture their dependencies and construct better feature representations. The photo generator reconstructs the photo by feeding aesthetic attributes, score, and informative feature representation. A discriminator is used to force the convergence of the features-attributes-score tuples generated from the score-attributes generator, the photo generator, and the ground-truth distribution in labeled data for training data. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state of the art, increasing the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC) from the existing best reported of 0.726 to 0.761 on <italic>Aesthetic and attributes database</italic> and 0.756 to 0.774 on <italic>Aesthetic visual analysis database</italic>, respectively.",

            "abstract": "As an indispensable personalized service in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), the next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to help people discover attractive and interesting places. Currently, most POI recommenders are based on the conventional centralized paradigm that heavily relies on the cloud to train the recommendation models with large volumes of collected users' sensitive check-in data. Although a few recent works have explored on-device frameworks for resilient and privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they invariably hold the assumption of model homogeneity for parameters/gradients aggregation and collaboration. However, users' mobile devices in the real world have various hardware configurations (e.g., compute resources), leading to heterogeneous on-device models with different architectures and sizes. In light of this, We propose a novel on-device POI recommendation framework, namely Model-Agnostic Collaborative learning for on-device POI recommendation (MAC), allowing users to customize their own model structures (e.g., dimension & number of hidden layers). To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data, we propose to pre-select neighbors for collaboration based on physical distances, category-level preferences, and social networks. To assimilate knowledge from the above-selected neighbors in an efficient and secure way, we adopt the knowledge distillation framework with mutual information maximization. Instead of sharing sensitive models/gradients, clients in MAC only share their soft decisions on a preloaded reference dataset. To filter out low-quality neighbors, we propose two sampling strategies, performance-triggered sampling and similarity-based sampling, to speed up the training process and obtain optimal recommenders. In addition, we design two novel approaches to generate more effective reference datasets while protecting users' privacy. Extensive experiments on two datasets have shown the superiority of MAC over advanced baselines.",

In this article, we develop a novel graph-based model, namely, graph-aware deep fusion networks (GDFNs) that use information from relevant metadata (review text, features of users, and items) and relational data (network) to capture the semantic information from their complex heterogeneous interactions via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Besides, GDFN also uses a novel fusion technique to synthesize low- and high-order interactions with propagated information across multiple review-related subgraphs.

            "abstract": "Counterfactual fairness alleviates the discrimination between the model prediction toward an individual in the actual world (observational data) and that in counterfactual world (i.e., what if the individual belongs to other sensitive groups). The existing studies need to pre-define the structural causal model that captures the correlations among variables for counterfactual inference; however, the underlying causal model is usually unknown and difficult to be validated in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the misspecification of the causal model potentially leads to poor performance in model prediction and thus makes unfair decisions. In this research, we propose a novel minimax game-theoretic model for counterfactual fairness that can produce accurate results meanwhile achieve a counterfactually fair decision with the relaxation of strong assumptions of structural causal models. In addition, we also theoretically prove the error bound of the proposed minimax model. Empirical experiments on multiple real-world datasets illustrate our superior performance in both accuracy and fairness.

            "abstract": "To reduce manual tasks and to minimise the risks from a customer, many insurance companies have applied ar-tificial intelligence (AI) solutions, including, but not limited to, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Exclusion anal-ysis is one of the primary tasks in terms of minimising the risks a customer imposes on a life insurance company. Although a few research studies have made this the primary focus, they have yet to provide explainable research for the exclusion analysis to assist the underwriting process (UP) using ML/DL methods. Therefore, this paper makes the process of exclusion classification, along with its explainability, its primary concentration to assist the underwriters in understanding the underwriting data taken from the customer disclosure information. First, we explore this problem by applying a set of four multi-label classifiers (named binary relevance, classifier chains, label powerset, and ensemble learning) blended with five ML techniques (named multinomial Naive Bayes, support vector classifier, logistic regression, random forest, decision tree), using the data provided by one of the leading insurance companies in Australia. Then, we consider the best-performing model's classification probability and feature importance as input for the explainable ML system - Shapley additive explanations and introduced explainability outcome - as a quality assurance report (QAR). This paper offers an extensive empirical evaluation by comparing different metrics and human underwriters' reviews. Finally, the result demonstrates that the binary relevance algorithm combined with the decision tree classifier outperforms other existing methods for explainable exclusion, providing a better overview of the customer's risk profile.",

            "abstract": "Counterfactual explanation is a form of interpretable machine learning that generates perturbations on a sample to achieve the desired outcome. The generated samples can act as instructions to guide end users on how to observe the desired results by altering samples. Although state-of-the-art counterfactual explanation methods are proposed to use variational autoencoder (VAE) to achieve promising improvements, they suffer from two major limitations: 1) the counterfactuals generation is prohibitively slow, which prevents algorithms from being deployed in interactive environments; 2) the counterfactual explanation algorithms produce unstable results due to the randomness in the sampling procedure of variational autoencoder. In this work, to address the above limitations, we design a robust and efficient counterfactual explanation framework, namely CeFlow, which utilizes normalizing flows for the mixed-type of continuous and categorical features. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our technique compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. We release our source at https://github.com/tridungduong16/fairCE.git for reproducing the results.",

            "title": "RETIA: Relation-Entity Twin-Interact Aggregation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation",
            "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) extrapolation aims to predict future unknown events (facts) based on historical information, and has attracted considerable attention due to its great practical significance. Accurate representations (embeddings) of entities and relations form the basis of TKG extrapolation. Recent work has been devoted to improving the rationality of entity representations. However, on the one hand, ignoring relation modeling results in incomplete relation representations; therefore, some approaches aggregate only immediately adjacent entities of relations, but this can lead to the \"message islands\" problem of relation modeling. On the other hand, ignoring the association constraints between relations and entities can make the embeddings of both relations and entities prone to overfitting. To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose an advanced method, namely, RETIA. For the former issue, we generate twin hyperrelation subgraphs for each historical subgraph and then aggregate both the adjacent entities and relations in the hyperrelation subgraphs through a graph convolutional network (GCN). About the latter concern, we propose a twin-interact module (TIM), which provides communication channels for relation aggregation and entity aggregation during the evolution of the historical sequence. Experiments conducted on five public datasets show that RETIA has made great improvements across several evaluation metrics. Our released code is available at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/RETIA.",
