            "abstract": "Human mobility data is useful for various applications in urban planning, transportation, and public health, but collecting and sharing real-world trajectories can be challenging due to privacy and data quality issues. To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories. In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "\n The increasing demand for data-driven machine learning (ML) models has led to the emergence of model markets, where a broker collects personal data from data owners to produce high-usability ML models. To incentivize data owners to share their data, the broker needs to price data appropriately while protecting their privacy. For\n equitable data valuation\n , which is crucial in data pricing,\n Shapley value\n has become the most prevalent technique because it satisfies all four desirable properties in fairness: balance, symmetry, zero element, and additivity. For\n the right to be forgotten\n , which is stipulated by many data privacy protection laws to allow data owners to unlearn their data from trained models, the\n sharded structure\n in ML model training has become a de facto standard to reduce the cost of future unlearning by avoiding retraining the entire model from scratch. In this paper, we explore how the sharded structure for the right to be forgotten affects Shapley value for equitable data valuation in model markets. To adapt Shapley value for the sharded structure, we propose S-Shapley value, a sharded structure-based Shapley value, which satisfies four desirable properties for data valuation. Since we prove that computing S-Shapley value is #P-complete, two sampling-based methods are developed to approximate S-Shapley value. Furthermore, to efficiently update valuation results after data owners unlearn their data, we present two delta-based algorithms that estimate the change of data value instead of the data value itself. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n",

            "abstract": "Federated Learning is a promising machine learning paradigm when multiple parties collaborate to build a high-quality machine learning model. Nonetheless, these parties are only willing to participate when given enough incentives, such as a fair reward based on their contributions. Many studies explored Shapley value based methods to evaluate each party\u2019s contribution to the learned model. However, they commonly assume a semi-trusted server to train the model and evaluate the data owners\u2019 model contributions, which lacks transparency and may hinder the success of federated learning in practice. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework and a protocol to transparently evaluate each participant\u2019s contribution. Our framework protects all parties\u2019 privacy in the model building phase and transparently evaluates contributions based on the model updates. The experiment with the handwritten digits dataset demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the contributions.",
