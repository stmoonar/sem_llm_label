            "abstract": "A healthy and safe indoor environment is an important part of containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",

            "abstract": "Since herbarium specimens are increasingly becoming digitized and accessible in online repositories, an important need has emerged to develop automated tools to process and enrich these collections to facilitate better access to the preserved archives. Particularly, automatic enrichment of multi-specimen herbaria sheets poses unique challenges and problems that have not been adequately addressed. The complexity of localization of species in a page increases exponentially when multiple specimens are present in the same page. This already challenges the performance of models that work accurately with single specimens. Therefore, in this work, we have performed experiments to identify the models that perform well for the plant specimen localization problem. The major bottleneck for performing such experiments was the lack of labeled data. We also address this problem by proposing tools and algorithms to semi-automatically generate annotations for herbarium images. Based on our experiments, segmentation models perform much better than detection models for the task of plant localization. Our binary segmentation model can accurately extract specimens from the background and achieves an F1 score of 0.977. The ablation experiments for multi-specimen instance segmentation show that our proposed augmentation method provides a 38% increase in performance (0.51 mAP@0.9 versus 0.37) on a dataset of 1,500 plant instances.",

Our goal is to develop and implement a pipeline to automatically extract and analyse Twitter data on natural disasters and environmental topics. We aim to provide an additional layer of spatiotemporal data that can be used to study the immediate and lasting impacts of natural disasters, climate change, and environmental topics on the global population. An initial analysis of forest fires was conducted in four different languages confirming the need for multilingual support for global analysis. We found a positive correlation between wildfire occurrence and tweeting behaviour, as well as the geographic spread of fires. We found that simple sentiment predictions add little value when aggregating data on a large scale. A subsequent test using a fine-tuned stance detection model proved promising in determining the stance of tweets towards nuclear energy. We intend to expand our dataset and develop customised models in the future that can be used to analyse the global impact of natural disasters and environmental topics.",

            "abstract": "PurposeHistorical newspaper collections provide a wealth of information about the past. Although the digitization of these collections significantly improves their accessibility, a large portion of digitized historical newspaper collections, such as those of KBR, the Royal Library of Belgium, are not yet searchable at article-level. However, recent developments in AI-based research methods, such as document layout analysis, have the potential for further enriching the metadata to improve the searchability of these historical newspaper collections. This paper aims to discuss the aforementioned issue.Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, the authors explore how existing computer vision and machine learning approaches can be used to improve access to digitized historical newspapers. To do this, the authors propose a workflow, using computer vision and machine learning approaches to (1) provide article-level access to digitized historical newspaper collections using document layout analysis, (2) extract specific types of articles (e.g. feuilletons \u2013 literary supplements from Le Peuple from 1938), (3) conduct image similarity analysis using (un)supervised classification methods and (4) perform named entity recognition (NER) to link the extracted information to open data.FindingsThe results show that the proposed workflow improves the accessibility and searchability of digitized historical newspapers, and also contributes to the building of corpora for digital humanities research. The AI-based methods enable automatic extraction of feuilletons, clustering of similar images and dynamic linking of related articles.Originality/valueThe proposed workflow enables automatic extraction of articles, including detection of a specific type of article, such as a feuilleton or literary supplement. This is particularly valuable for humanities researchers as it improves the searchability of these collections and enables corpora to be built around specific themes. Article-level access to, and improved searchability of, KBR's digitized newspapers are demonstrated through the online tool (https://tw06v072.ugent.be/kbr/).",

            "abstract": "The digitization of image archives across the globe has opened up vast collections of libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions. These collections provide valuable historical information to the public and researchers. Many image collections have little metadata describing who or what is depicted in a structured format, making it difficult to search for specific persons. This work presents a facial recognition pipeline to enrich these collections by recognizing the persons in each image. A reference dataset of over 6,000 known persons was constructed and facial recognition was performed on a dataset of over 150 thousand images. Detected faces were matched with the known faces using a similarity score on the face embeddings. We developed an interactive labeling tool to efficiently validate the face recognition predictions. A total of 182 thousand detected faces were labeled with this tool. Using a minimum similarity score of 0.5, the face recognition model achieved a precision of 0.936 and identified over 62 thousand persons from the image archives. We show how clustering can be used to identify new persons that were not included in the reference dataset. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of facial recognition to enhance the accessibility of the collections and offer new insights.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT In Flanders (Belgium), one in three journeys between home and school by adolescents (12\u201318\u2009years) is made by bike. Sadly, most cycling accidents also occur in this age group. Although research and cycling policies advocate for safer school environments, their focus is often limited to a restricted area near the school gate. Not only school environments but also trajectories to school and adolescents\u2019 experience along it should be considered when designing cycling policies. Therefore, we investigated perceived cycling safety and its relation with the environment along home-to-school routes of adolescents in Flanders. Data were collected using a location based service (LBS) developed for secondary schools. Relations between perceived cycling safety and a wide range of both subjectively scored and objectively measured environmental data were analysed using multilevel linear regressions, at the level of routes, road segments, and intersections. The models show that traffic volume and cycling infrastructure have the strongest associations with perceived safety, and that accident data have a significant relation as well. Therefore, we believe that decreasing traffic volume and enhancing cycling infrastructure will increase adolescents\u2019 cycling safety perception. Furthermore, the results of this study underline the promising value of LBS to develop proactive and stimulating cycling policies.\u2009",

While our cities become more crowded every day, they also become smarter, for example by employing pedestrian tracking sensors. However, the datasets that are generated by these sensors do not allow smart crowd management yet, because they are sparse and not linked to the perception of the crowd. This research will tackle these issues in three steps. First, pedestrian counts will be estimated on streets that have no tracking data by use of deep learning and space syntax data. Next, the perception of crowdedness within the crowd will be linked to the objective pedestrian counts by conducting two user studies, and finally, the resulting subjective pedestrian counts will be used as weights for a routing algorithm. The last step has already been developed as a proof of concept. The routing algorithm, that uses partly simulated data and partly real-time tracking data, has been embedded in a webtool to show stakeholders the potential and goal of this innovative project.",

            "abstract": "Video-based analysis of cycling races can provide a lot of information that can be used to keep cycling interesting for the fans and improve cyclists' safety. In this paper, we propose a solution to collect and process the metadata of cycling races. The idea is to use edge computing, by collecting data from a car in front of the race and processing this data using a tailor-made setup. Our solution consists of a camera to record video, and a GPS module to map the corresponding locations. Both data streams are offered to a single board computer. The video frames are used for crowd size classification to roughly estimate the number of spectators present along the race route. Moreover, we use the same footage to recognize cyclists' names on the road's surface to determine the location of fans of specific cyclists to create metadata around fan engagement. The tailor-made system performs the processing of the video frames and the results are sent to a web server using a cellular network connection. A web application was created to visualize the crowd size and the location of cyclists' names on the road's surface.",

            "title": "Automatic Georeferencing of Topographic Raster Maps",
            "abstract": "In recent years, many scientific institutions have digitized their collections, which often include a large variety of topographic raster maps. These raster maps provide accurate (historical) geographical information but cannot be integrated directly into a geographical information system (GIS) due to a lack of metadata. Additionally, the text labels on the map are usually not annotated, making it inefficient to query for specific toponyms. Manually georeferencing and annotating the text labels on these maps is not cost-effective for large collections. This work presents a fully automated georeferencing approach based on text recognition and geocoding pipeline. After recognizing the text on the maps, publicly available geocoders were used to determine a region of interest. The approach was validated on a collection of historical and contemporary topographic maps. We show that this approach can geolocate the topographic maps fairly accurately, resulting in an average georeferencing error of only 316 m (1.67%) and 287 m (0.90%) for 16 historical maps and 9 contemporary maps spanning 19 km and 32 km, respectively (scale 1:25,000 and 1:50,000). Furthermore, this approach allows the maps to be queried based on the recognized visible text and found toponyms, which further improves the accessibility and quality of the collection.",

            "title": "Thermal Infrared Video Stabilization for Aerial Monitoring of Active Wildfires",
            "abstract": "Measuring wildland fire behavior is essential for fire science and fire management. Aerial thermal infrared (TIR) imaging provides outstanding opportunities to acquire such information remotely. Variables such as fire rate of spread (ROS), fire radiative power (FRP), and fireline intensity may be measured explicitly both in time and space, providing the necessary data to study the response of fire behavior to weather, vegetation, topography, and firefighting efforts. However, raw TIR imagery acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires stabilization and georeferencing before any other processing can be performed. Aerial video usually suffers from instabilities produced by sensor movement. This problem is especially acute near an active wildfire due to fire-generated turbulence. Furthermore, the nature of fire TIR video presents some specific challenges that hinder robust interframe registration. Therefore, this article presents a software-based video stabilization algorithm specifically designed for TIR imagery of forest fires. After a comparative analysis of existing image registration algorithms, the KAZE feature-matching method was selected and accompanied by pre- and postprocessing modules. These included foreground histogram equalization and a multireference framework designed to increase the algorithm's robustness in the presence of missing or faulty frames. The performance of the proposed algorithm was validated in a total of nine video sequences acquired during field fire experiments. The proposed algorithm yielded a registration accuracy between 10 and 1000\u00d7 higher than other tested methods, returned 10\u00d7 more meaningful feature matches, and proved robust in the presence of faulty video frames. The ability to automatically cancel camera movement for every frame in a video sequence solves a key limitation in data processing pipelines and opens the door to a number of systematic fire behavior experimental analyses. Moreover, a completely automated process supports the development of decision support tools that can operate in real time during an emergency.",
