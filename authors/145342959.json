            "title": "Inductive Link Prediction via Interactive Learning Across Relations in Multiplex Networks",
            "abstract": "Network embedding is an important class of link prediction methods, which can use the distance between learned low-dimensional node representations to characterize the similarity between nodes. Traditional network embedding methods focus on single-layer networks, while in reality, a large part of complex networks are not isolated, but interdependent and interrelated, forming multiplex complex networks. Also, how to effectively exploit layer correlations in multiplex networks to learn more robust and valuable representations, to improve link prediction performance, has been a hot research topic in the field of complex network analysis. However, previous studies mainly focus on inferring intralinks in each layer of complex networks or anchor links among layers. Another issue that has not been discussed is how to predict potential links or reconstruct the network in unobserved relations based on existing multiplex networks. To this issue, we define a novel inductive link prediction problem in multiplex networks, in which most existing multichannel network embedding methods fail to solve. This is either because they only emphasize the specific structure information of an individual layer or only capture the common information for all layers. To effectively address this problem, we propose a novel embedding method termed interactive learning across relations (ILAR), to capture and fully exploit the multiple relations and complex layer correlations in multiplex networks. We leverage two convolutional modules and ILAR to capture the sufficient complementary and correlations in multiplex networks. Moreover, during interactive learning, a disparity constraint is introduced, which enforces the features encoded from two convolutional modules to be different and prevents information redundancy. Finally, the extensive experiments in several real-world datasets show that our model can significantly outperform the existing state-of-the-art network embedding methods on the novel link prediction problem in multiplex networks.",

            "title": "Generative Evolutionary Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Networks",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.",

            "abstract": "Capturing structural similarity has been a hot topic in the field of network embedding (NE) recently due to its great help in understanding node functions and behaviors. However, existing works have paid very much attention to learning structures on homogeneous networks, while the related study on heterogeneous networks is still void. In this article, we try to take the first step for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying structures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures, we first propose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous walk (HAW) and give two more applicable variants. Then, we devise the HAW embedding (HAWE) and its variants in a data-driven manner to circumvent using an extremely large number of possible walks and train embeddings by predicting occurring walks in the neighborhood of each node. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure learning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate our methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classic methods and can be applied on large-scale networks.",

            "abstract": "With the popularity of mobile devices, intelligent applications, e.g., face recognition, intelligent voice assistant, and gesture recognition, have been widely used in our daily lives. However, due to the lack of computing capacities, it is difficult for mobile devices to support complex Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference. To alleviate the pressure on these devices, traditional methods usually upload part of the DNN model to a cloud server and perform a DNN query after uploading an entire DNN model. To achieve real-time DNN query, we consider the collaboration between local, edge and cloud, and perform DNN query when uploading DNN partitions. In this paper, we propose an Efficient offloading scheme for DNN Inference Acceleration (EosDNN) in a local-edge-cloud collaborative environment, where the DNN inference acceleration is mainly embodied in the optimization of migration delay and realization of real-time DNN query. EosDNN comprehensively considers the migration plan and uploading plan, where for the former, a Particle Swarm Optimization with Genetic Algorithm (PSO-GA) is applied to obtain the distribution of DNN layers under the server with the lowest migration delay, and for the latter, a Layer Merge Uploading Algorithm (LMU) is proposed to obtain DNN partitions and their upload order with efficient DNN query performance. Experimental results demonstrate that EosDNN can be applied to large-scale DNN model migration, which can achieve an ideal migration delay and obtain a more fine-grained DNN partition uploading plan, thereby optimizing DNN query performance.",

            "abstract": "In Community Question Answering (CQA) websites, expert finding aims at seeking suitable experts to answer questions. The key is to explore the inherent relevance based on the representations of questions and experts. Existing methods usually learn these features from single view information (e.g., question title), which would be not insufficient to fully learn their representations. In this paper, we propose a personalized expert finding method with a multi-view attentive matching mechanism. We design three modules under the multi-view paradigm, including a question encoder, an intra-view encoder, and an inter-view encoder, which aims to comprehend the comprehensive relationships between experts and questions. In the question encoder, we learn the multi-view question features from its title, body and tag views respectively. In the intra-view encoder, we design an interactive attention network to capture the view-specific relevance between the target question and the historical answered questions of experts for all different views. Furthermore, in the inter-view encoder we employ a personalized attention network to aggregate different view information to learn expert/question representations. In this way, the match of the expert and question could be fully captured from the multi-view information via the intra- and inter-view mechanisms. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Temporal community detection is helpful to discover and analyze significant groups or clusters hidden in dynamic networks in the real world. A variety of methods, such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model, has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving the accuracy of dynamic community detection.",

However, the constrained battery capacity of IoT devices greatly limits the user experience. Energy harvesting technologies enable green energy to provide continuous energy support for devices in the IoT environment. Together with the maturity of the mobile edge computing technology and the development of parallel computing, it provides a strong guarantee for the normal operation of resource-constrained IoT devices. In this article, we design a parallel offloading strategy based on Lyapunov optimization, which is conducive to efficiently finding the optimal decision for delay-sensitive and compute-intensive tasks. We establish a stochastic optimization problem on a discrete-time slot system and propose a green parallel online offloading algorithm (GPOOA). By decoupling the target problem three times, the joint optimization of green energy, task division factor, CPU frequency, and transmission power is realized. Experimental results demonstrate that under the constraints of strict task deadlines and limited server computing resources, GPOOA performs well in terms of system cost and task drop ratio, far superior to several existing offloading algorithms.",

The few role analytics methods for dynamic networks either cannot learn general node representations or fail to discovery role transitions of nodes. In this work, we propose a unified framework RDNE (Role-oriented Dynamic Network Embedding) to tackle such challenges, which aim to learn multiple embeddings for individual nodes based on time-varying structural behaviors. Based on regular equivalence, RDNE propagates the structural features over the graph to derive the initial role-oriented representations. Then, it applies capsule network to further model the mapping between nodes and roles, which is the first time capsule network is used for role discovery. For the varying and temporal dependence within dynamic network, we utilize the Gated Recurrent Unit to compute historical information and use historical information to influence the generation of representations at the next snapshot. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks validate the superiority of the proposed RDNE.",

            "title": "HB-DSBM: Modeling the Dynamic Complex Networks From Community Level to Node Level",
            "abstract": "A variety of methods have been proposed for modeling and mining dynamic complex networks, in which the topological structure varies with time. As the most popular and successful network model, the stochastic block model (SBM) has been extended and applied to community detection, link prediction, anomaly detection, and evolution analysis of dynamic networks. However, all current models based on the SBM for modeling dynamic networks are designed at the community level, assuming that nodes in each community have the same dynamic behavior, which usually results in poor performance on temporal community detection and loses the modeling of node abnormal behavior. To solve the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes a hierarchical Bayesian dynamic SBM (HB-DSBM) for modeling the node-level and community-level dynamic behavior in a dynamic network synchronously. Based on the SBM, we introduce a hierarchical Dirichlet generative mechanism to associate the global community evolution with the microscopic transition behavior of nodes near-perfectly and generate the observed links across the dynamic networks. Meanwhile, an effective variational inference algorithm is developed and we can easy to infer the communities and dynamic behaviors of the nodes. Furthermore, with the two-level evolution behaviors, it can identify nodes or communities with abnormal behavior. Experiments on simulated and real-world networks demonstrate that HB-DSBM has achieved state-of-the-art performance on community detection and evolution. In addition, abnormal evolutionary behavior and events on dynamic networks can be effectively identified by our model.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and solving the psychological health problems of college students have become a focus of social attention. Complex networks have become important tools to study the factors affecting psychological health, and the Gaussian graphical model is often used to estimate psychological networks. However, previous studies leave some gaps to overcome, including the following aspects. (1) When studying networks of subpopulations, the estimation neglects the intrinsic relationships among subpopulations, leading to a large difference between the estimated network and the real network. (2) Because of the high cost, previous psychological surveys often have a small sample size, and the psychological description is insufficient. Here, the intrinsic connections among multiple tasks are used, and multitask machine learning is applied to develop a multitask Gaussian graphical model. The psychological networks of the population and subpopulations are estimated based on psychological questionnaire data. This study is the first to apply a psychological network to such a large-scale college student psychological analysis, and we obtain some interesting results. The model presented here is a dynamic model based on complex networks which predicts individual behavior and provides insight into the intrinsic links among various symptoms.",
