            "title": "DEEPSMP: A deep learning model for predicting the ectodomain shedding events of membrane proteins",
            "abstract": "Membrane proteins play essential roles in modern medicine. In recent studies, some membrane proteins involved in ectodomain shedding events have been reported as the potential drug targets and biomarkers of some serious diseases. However, there are few effective tools for identifying the shedding event of membrane proteins. So, it is necessary to design an effective tool for predicting shedding event of membrane proteins. In this study, we design an end-to-end prediction model using deep neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units and attention mechanism, to predict the ectodomain shedding events of membrane proteins only by sequence information. Firstly, the evolutional profiles are encoded from original sequences of these proteins by Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) on Uniref50 database. Then, the LSTM units which contain memory cells are used to hold information from past inputs to the network and the attention mechanism is applied to detect sorting signals in proteins regardless of their position in the sequence. Finally, a fully connected dense layer and a softmax layer are used to obtain the final prediction results. Additionally, we also try to reduce overfitting of the model by using dropout, L2 regularization, and bagging ensemble learning in the model training process. In order to ensure the fairness of performance comparison, firstly we use cross validation process on training dataset obtained from an existing paper. The average accuracy and area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of five-fold cross-validation are 81.19% and 0.835 using our proposed model, compared to 75% and 0.78 by a previously published tool, respectively. To better validate the performance of the proposed model, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed model on independent test dataset. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 83.14%, 84.08%, and 81.63% using our proposed model, compared to 70.20%, 71.97%, and 67.35% by the existing model. The experimental results validate that the proposed model can be regarded as a general tool for predicting ectodomain shedding events of membrane proteins.

            "abstract": "CyanoPATH is a database that curates and analyzes the common genomic functional repertoire for cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) in eutrophic waters. Based on the literature of empirical studies and genome/protein databases, it summarizes four types of information: common biological functions (pathways) driving CyanoHABs, customized pathway maps, classification of blooming type based on databases and the genomes of cyanobacteria. A total of 19 pathways are reconstructed, which are involved in the utilization of macronutrients (e.g. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur), micronutrients (e.g. zinc, magnesium, iron, etc.) and other resources (e.g. light and vitamins) and in stress resistance (e.g. lead and copper). These pathways, comprised of both transport and biochemical reactions, are reconstructed with proteins from NCBI and reactions from KEGG and visualized with self-created transport/reaction maps. The pathways are hierarchical and consist of subpathways, protein/enzyme complexes and constituent proteins. New cyanobacterial genomes can be annotated and visualized for these pathways and compared with existing species. This set of genomic functional repertoire is useful in analyzing aquatic metagenomes and metatranscriptomes in CyanoHAB research. Most importantly, it establishes a link between genome and ecology. All these reference proteins, pathways and maps and genomes are free to download at http://www.csbg-jlu.info/CyanoPATH.",

            "title": "Deep forest ensemble learning for classification of alignments of non-coding RNA sequences based on multi-view structure representations",
            "abstract": "Abstract Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple biological processes. However, only a few ncRNAs\u2019 functions have been well studied. Given the significance of ncRNAs classification for understanding ncRNAs\u2019 functions, more and more computational methods have been introduced to improve the classification automatically and accurately. In this paper, based on a convolutional neural network and a deep forest algorithm, multi-grained cascade forest (GcForest), we propose a novel deep fusion learning framework, GcForest fusion method (GCFM), to classify alignments of ncRNA sequences for accurate clustering of ncRNAs. GCFM integrates a multi-view structure feature representation including sequence-structure alignment encoding, structure image representation and shape alignment encoding of structural subunits, enabling us to capture the potential specificity between ncRNAs. For the classification of pairwise alignment of two ncRNA sequences, the F-value of GCFM improves 6% than an existing alignment-based method. Furthermore, the clustering of ncRNA families is carried out based on the classification matrix generated from GCFM. Results suggest better performance (with 20% accuracy improved) than existing ncRNA clustering methods (RNAclust, Ensembleclust and CNNclust). Additionally, we apply GCFM to construct a phylogenetic tree of ncRNA and predict the probability of interactions between RNAs. Most ncRNAs are located correctly in the phylogenetic tree, and the prediction accuracy of RNA interaction is 90.63%. A web server (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/gcfm/) is developed to maximize its availability, and the source code and related data are available at the same URL.",
