            "title": "Leveraging GPT-4 for Food Effect Summarization to Enhance Product-Specific Guidance Development via Iterative Prompting",
            "abstract": "Food effect summarization from New Drug Application (NDA) is an essential component of product-specific guidance (PSG) development and assessment, which provides the basis of recommendations for fasting and fed bioequivalence studies to guide the pharmaceutical industry for developing generic drug products. However, manual summarization of food effect from extensive drug application review documents is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop automated methods to generate food effect summary. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have demonstrated great potential in improving the effectiveness of automated text summarization, but its ability with regard to the accuracy in summarizing food effect for PSG assessment remains unclear. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach,iterative prompting, which allows one to interact with ChatGPT or GPT-4 more effectively and efficiently through multi-turn interaction. Specifically, we propose a three-turn iterative prompting approach to food effect summarization in which the keyword-focused and length-controlled prompts are respectively provided in consecutive turns to refine the quality of the generated summary. We conduct a series of extensive evaluations, ranging from automated metrics to FDA professionals and even evaluation by GPT-4, on 100 NDA review documents selected over the past five years. We observe that the summary quality is progressively improved throughout the iterative prompting process. Moreover, we find that GPT-4 performs better than ChatGPT, as evaluated by FDA professionals (43% vs. 12%) and GPT-4 (64% vs. 35%). Importantly, all the FDA professionals unanimously rated that 85% of the summaries generated by GPT-4 are factually consistent with the golden reference summary, a finding further supported by GPT-4 rating of 72% consistency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a great potential for GPT-4 to draft food effect summaries that could be reviewed by FDA professionals, thereby improving the efficiency of the PSG assessment cycle and promoting generic drug product development.",

            "abstract": "Product-specific guidances (PSGs) recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are instrumental to promote and guide generic drug product development. To assess a PSG, the FDA assessor needs to take extensive time and effort to manually retrieve supportive drug information of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) from the reference listed drug labeling. In this work, we leveraged the state-of-the-art pre-trained language models to automatically label the ADME paragraphs in the pharmacokinetics section from the FDA-approved drug labeling to facilitate PSG assessment. We applied a transfer learning approach by fine-tuning the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to develop a novel application of ADME semantic labeling, which can automatically retrieve ADME paragraphs from drug labeling instead of manual work. We demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model can outperform conventional machine learning techniques, achieving up to 12.5% absolute F1 improvement. To our knowledge, we were the first to successfully apply BERT to solve the ADME semantic labeling task. We further assessed the relative contribution of pre-training and fine-tuning to the overall performance of the BERT model in the ADME semantic labeling task using a series of analysis methods, such as attention similarity and layer-based ablations. Our analysis revealed that the information learned via fine-tuning is focused on task-specific knowledge in the top layers of the BERT, whereas the benefit from the pre-trained BERT model is from the bottom layers.",

            "abstract": ": Classification on long-tailed distributed data is a challenging problem, which suffers from serious class-imbalance and hence poor performance on tail classes with only a few samples. Owing to this paucity of samples, learning on the tail classes is especially challenging for the fine-tuning when transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task. In this work, we present a simple modification of standard fine-tuning to cope with these challenges. Specifically, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning: we first fine-tune the final layer of the pretrained model with class-balanced reweighting loss, and then we perform the standard fine-tuning. Our modification has several benefits: (1) it leverages pretrained representations by only fine-tuning a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched; (2) it allows the model to learn an initial representation of the specific task; and importantly (3) it protects the learning of tail classes from being at a disadvantage during the model updating. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic datasets of both two-class and multi-class tasks of text classification as well as a real-world application to ADME (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) semantic labeling. The experimental results show that the proposed two-stage fine-tuning outperforms both fine-tuning with conventional loss and fine-tuning with a reweighting loss on the above datasets.",

            "abstract": "In systems neuroscience, it is becoming increasingly common to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously via electrode arrays. The ability to accurately measure the causal interactions among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to understanding how neurons work in concert to generate specific brain functions. The development of new statistical methods for assessing causal influence between spike trains is still an active field of neuroscience research. Here, we suggest a copula-based Granger causality measure for the analysis of neural spike train data. This method is built upon our recent work on copula Granger causality for the analysis of continuous-valued time series by extending it to point-process neural spike train data. The proposed method is therefore able to reveal nonlinear and high-order causality in the spike trains while retaining all the computational advantages such as model-free, efficient estimation, and variability assessment of Granger causality. The performance of our algorithm can be further boosted with time-reversed data. Our method performed well on extensive simulations, and was then demonstrated on neural activity simultaneously recorded from primary visual cortex of a monkey performing a contour detection task.",

            "abstract": "Generalized flash suppression (GFS), in which a salient visual stimulus can be rendered invisible despite continuous retinal input, provides a rare opportunity to directly study the neural mechanism of visual perception. Previous work based on linear methods, such as spectral analysis, on local field potential (LFP) during GFS has shown that the LFP power at distinctive frequency bands are differentially modulated by perceptual suppression. Yet, the linear method alone may be insufficient for the full assessment of neural dynamic due to the fundamentally nonlinear nature of neural signals. In this study, we set forth to analyze the LFP data collected from multiple visual areas in V1, V2 and V4 of macaque monkeys while performing the GFS task using a nonlinear method - adaptive multi-scale entropy (AME) - to reveal the neural dynamic of perceptual suppression. In addition, we propose a new cross-entropy measure at multiple scales, namely adaptive multi-scale cross-entropy (AMCE), to assess the nonlinear functional connectivity between two cortical areas. We show that: (1) multi-scale entropy exhibits percept-related changes in all three areas, with higher entropy observed during perceptual suppression; (2) the magnitude of the perception-related entropy changes increases systematically over successive hierarchical stages (i.e. from lower areas V1 to V2, up to higher area V4); and (3) cross-entropy between any two cortical areas reveals higher degree of asynchrony or dissimilarity during perceptual suppression, indicating a decreased functional connectivity between cortical areas. These results, taken together, suggest that perceptual suppression is related to a reduced functional connectivity and increased uncertainty of neural responses, and the modulation of perceptual suppression is more effective at higher visual cortical areas. AME is demonstrated to be a useful technique in revealing the underlying dynamic of nonlinear/nonstationary neural signal.",

Among many methods, sample entropy (SampEn) has emerged as a robust, powerful measure for quantifying complexity of time series due to its insensitivity to data length and its immunity to noise. Despite its popular use, SampEn is based on the standardized data where the variance is routinely discarded, which may nonetheless provide additional information for discriminant analysis. Here we designed a simple, yet efficient, complexity measure, namely variance entropy (VarEn), to integrate SampEn with variance to achieve effective discriminant analysis. We applied VarEn to analyze local field potential (LFP) collected from visual cortex of macaque monkey while performing a generalized flash suppression task, in which a visual stimulus was dissociated from perceptual experience, to study neural complexity of perceptual awareness. We evaluated the performance of VarEn in comparison with SampEn on LFP, at both single and multiple scales, in discriminating different perceptual conditions. Our results showed that perceptual visibility could be differentiated by VarEn, with significantly better discriminative performance than SampEn. Our findings demonstrate that VarEn is a sensitive measure of perceptual visibility, and thus can be used to probe perceptual awareness of a stimulus.",

In this letter, we introduce adaptive multiscale entropy (AME) measures in which the scales are adaptively derived directly from the data by virtue of recently developed multivariate empirical mode decomposition.

            "abstract": "Characterizing brain connectivity between neural signals is key to understanding brain function. Current measures such as coherence heavily rely on Fourier or wavelet transform, which inevitably assume the signal stationarity and place severe limits on its time-frequency resolution. Here we addressed these issues by introducing a noise-assisted instantaneous coherence (NAIC) measure based on multivariate mode empirical decomposition (MEMD) coupled with Hilbert transform to achieve high-resolution time frequency representation of neural coherence. In our method, fully data-driven MEMD, together with Hilbert transform, is first employed to provide time-frequency power spectra for neural data. Such power spectra are typically sparse and of high resolution, that is, there usually exist many zero values, which result in numerical problems for directly computing coherence. Hence, we propose to add random noise onto the spectra, making coherence calculation feasible. Furthermore, a statistical randomization procedure is designed to cancel out the effect of the added noise. Computer simulations are first performed to verify the effectiveness of NAIC. Local field potentials collected from visual cortex of macaque monkey while performing a generalized flash suppression task are then used to demonstrate the usefulness of our NAIC method to provide highresolution time-frequency coherence measure for connectivity analysis of neural data.",

            "title": "Uncovering perceptual awareness of visual stimulus with adaptive multiscale entropy",
            "abstract": "To probe the perceptual awareness of a visual stimulus, we use the paradigm of generalized flash suppression (GFS) to dissociate physical stimulation from perceptual experience. This perceptual suppression approach has previously been used to investigate perceptual visibility correlates in visual cortex, mainly with linear methods, such as spectral analysis. While meaningful, the linear method alone may be insufficient for the full assessment of neural dynamics due to the fundamentally nonlinear nature of neural signal. In this contribution, we set forth to analyze local field potential (LFP) data collected from the multiple visual areas in V1, V2 and V4 of a macaque monkey while performing the GFS task using nonlinear method - adaptive multiscale entropy (AME) - to study the neural dynamics of perceptual suppression. We also propose a new cross-entropy measure at multiple scales, namely adaptive multiscale cross-entropy (AMCE), to assess the nonlinear interdependency between cortical areas. We show that: (1) multiscale entropy exhibits perception-related changes in all three areas, with higher entropy (i.e. higher complexity) observed during perceptual suppression; (2) the magnitude of the perception-related entropy changes increases systematically over successive hierarchical stages (i.e. from lower areas V1 to V2, up to higher area V4); and (3) cross-entropy between any two cortical areas reveals higher degree of asynchrony or dissimilarity during perceptual suppression, indicating decreased neuronal interdependency between areas. Our findings demonstrate that the adaptive multiscale entropy is a sensitive measure of perceptual visibility, and thus can be used to uncover perceptual awareness of a stimulus.",
