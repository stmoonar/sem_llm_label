            "abstract": "Multi-sourced networks naturally appear in many application domains, ranging from bioinformatics, social networks, neuroscience to management. Although state-of-the-art offers rich models and algorithms to find various patterns when input networks are given, it has largely remained nascent on how vulnerable the mining results are due to the adversarial attacks. In this paper, we address the problem of attacking multi-network mining through the way of deliberately perturbing the networks to alter the mining results. The key idea of the proposed method (<sc>Admiring</sc>) is effective and efficient influence functions on the Sylvester equation defined over the input networks, which plays a central and unifying role in various multi-network mining tasks.

            "abstract": "Data stories often seek to elicit affective feelings from viewers. However, how to design affective data stories remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate one specific design factor, animation, and present Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express five positive affects: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies. The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos.",

            "abstract": "Creating expressive narrative visualization often requires choosing a well-planned narrative order that invites the audience in. The narrative can either follow the linear order of story events (chronology), or deviate from linearity (anachronies). While evidence exists that anachronies in novels and films can enhance story expressiveness, little is known about how they can be incorporated into narrative visualization. To bridge this gap, this work introduces the idea of narrative linearity to visualization and investigates how different narrative orders affect the expressiveness of time-oriented stories. First, we conducted preliminary interviews with seven experts to clarify the motivations and challenges of manipulating narrative linearity in time-oriented stories. Then, we analyzed a corpus of 80 time-oriented stories and identified six most salient patterns of narrative orders. Next, we conducted a crowdsourcing study with 221 participants. Results indicated that anachronies have the potential to make time-oriented stories more expressive without hindering comprehensibility.",

To facilitate the creation of affect-stirring infographics, it is important to characterize and understand people's affective responses to infographics and derive practical design guidelines for designers. To address these research questions, we first conducted two crowdsourcing studies to identify 12 infographic-associated affective responses and collect user feedback explaining what triggered affective responses in infographics. Then, by coding the user feedback, we present a taxonomy of design heuristics that exemplifies the affect-related design factors in infographics. We evaluated the design heuristics with 15 designers. The results showed that our work supports assessing the affective design in infographics and facilitates the ideation and creation of affective infographics.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a common analytical task that aims to identify rare cases that differ from the typical cases that make up the majority of a dataset. When analyzing event sequence data, the task of anomaly detection can be complex because the sequential and temporal nature of such data results in diverse definitions and flexible forms of anomalies. This, in turn, increases the difficulty in interpreting detected anomalies. In this article, we propose a visual analytic approach for detecting anomalous sequences in an event sequence dataset via an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm based on Variational AutoEncoders. We further compare the anomalous sequences with their reconstructions and with the normal sequences through a sequence matching algorithm to identify event anomalies. A visual analytics system is developed to support interactive exploration and interpretations of anomalies through novel visualization designs that facilitate the comparison between anomalous sequences and normal sequences. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of our anomaly detection algorithm, demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through case studies, and report feedback collected from study participants.",

            "abstract": "Data videos, a storytelling genre that visualizes data facts with motion graphics, are gaining increasing popularity among data journalists, non\u2010profits, and marketers to communicate data to broad audiences. However, crafting a data video is often time\u2010consuming and asks for various domain knowledge such as data visualization, animation design, and screenwriting. Existing authoring tools usually enable users to edit and compose a set of templates manually, which still cost a lot of human effort. To further lower the barrier of creating data videos, this work introduces a new approach, AutoClips, which can automatically generate data videos given the input of a sequence of data facts. We built AutoClips through two stages. First, we constructed a fact\u2010driven clip library where we mapped ten data facts to potential animated visualizations respectively by analyzing 230 online data videos and conducting interviews. Next, we constructed an algorithm that generates data videos from data facts through three steps: selecting and identifying the optimal clip for each of the data facts, arranging the clips into a coherent video, and optimizing the duration of the video. The results from two user studies indicated that the data videos generated by AutoClips are comprehensible, engaging, and have comparable quality with human\u2010made videos.",

The vast majority of existing works focus on how to best utilize the topology and attribute information of the input networks as well as the anchor links when available. Nonetheless, it has not been well studied on how to boost the alignment performance through actively obtaining high-quality and informative anchor links, with a few exceptions. The sparse literature on active network alignment introduces the human in the loop to label some seed node correspondence (i.e., anchor links), which are informative from the perspective of querying the most uncertain node given few potential matchings. However, the direct influence of the intrinsic network attribute information on the alignment results has largely remained unknown. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose an active network alignment method (Attent) to identify the best nodes to query. The key idea of the proposed method is to leverage effective and efficient influence functions defined over the alignment solution to evaluate the goodness of the candidate nodes for query. Our proposed query strategy bears three distinct advantages, including (1) effectiveness, being able to accurately quantify the influence of the candidate nodes on the alignment results; (2) efficiency, scaling linearly with 15 \u2212 17 \u00d7 speed-up over the straight-forward implementation without any quality loss; (3) generality, consistently improving alignment performance of a variety of network alignment algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Animated illustrations are a genre of graphic design that communicate a specific contextualized message using dynamic visuals. While animated illustrations has been gaining popularity across different applications, exploring them through the storytelling lens has received limited attention. In this work, we introduce a design space for animated narratives applied to illustrations. The design space combines a dimension for object types of animation techniques with one for narrative intents served by such animation techniques. We derived our design space from the analysis of 121 high-quality animated illustrations collected from online sources. To evaluate the effectiveness of our design space, we ran a workshop with 18 participants. The results of our workshop indicated that the design space can be used as a tool that supports ideation and increases creativity for designing expressive animated illustrations.",
