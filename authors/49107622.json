            "title": "CoSD: Collaborative Stance Detection with Contrastive Heterogeneous Topic Graph Learning",
            "abstract": "Stance detection seeks to identify the viewpoints of individuals either in favor or against a given target or a controversial topic. Current advanced neural models for stance detection typically employ fully parametric softmax classifiers. However, these methods suffer from several limitations, including lack of explainability, insensitivity to the latent data structure, and unimodality, which greatly restrict their performance and applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel collaborative stance detection framework called (CoSD) which leverages contrastive heterogeneous topic graph learning to learn topic-aware semantics and collaborative signals among texts, topics, and stance labels for enhancing stance detection. During training, we construct a heterogeneous graph to structurally organize texts and stances through implicit topics via employing latent Dirichlet allocation. We then perform contrastive graph learning to learn heterogeneous node representations, aggregating informative multi-hop collaborative signals via an elaborate Collaboration Propagation Aggregation (CPA) module. During inference, we introduce a hybrid similarity scoring module to enable the comprehensive incorporation of topic-aware semantics and collaborative signals for stance detection. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of CoSD, verifying the effectiveness and explainability of our collaborative framework.",

            "title": "Enhanced Semantic Representation Learning for Sarcasm Detection by Integrating Context-Aware Attention and Fusion Network",
            "abstract": "Sarcasm is a sophisticated figurative language that is prevalent on social media platforms. Automatic sarcasm detection is significant for understanding the real sentiment tendencies of users. Traditional approaches mostly focus on content features by using lexicon, n-gram, and pragmatic feature-based models. However, these methods ignore the diverse contextual clues that could provide more evidence of the sarcastic nature of sentences. In this work, we propose a Contextual Sarcasm Detection Model (CSDM) by modeling enhanced semantic representations with user profiling and forum topic information, where context-aware attention and a user-forum fusion network are used to obtain diverse representations from distinct aspects. In particular, we employ a Bi-LSTM encoder with context-aware attention to obtain a refined comment representation by capturing sentence composition information and the corresponding context situations. Then, we employ a user-forum fusion network to obtain the comprehensive context representation by capturing the corresponding sarcastic tendencies of the user and the background knowledge about the comments. Our proposed method achieves values of 0.69, 0.70, and 0.83 in terms of accuracy on the Main balanced, Pol balanced and Pol imbalanced datasets, respectively. The experimental results on a large Reddit corpus, SARC, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a significant performance improvement over state-of-art textual sarcasm detection methods.",

            "abstract": "Question-answering sentiment analysis (QASA) is a novel but meaningful sentiment analysis task based on question-answering online reviews. Existing neural network-based models that conduct sentiment analysis of online reviews have already achieved great success. However, the syntax and implicitly semantic connection in the dependency tree have not been made full use of, especially for Chinese which has specific syntax. In this work, we propose a Residual-Duet Network leveraging textual and tree dependency information for Chinese question-answering sentiment analysis. In particular, we explore the synergies of graph embedding with structural dependency links to learn syntactic information. The transverse and longitudinal compression encoders are developed to capture sentiment evidence with disparate types of compression and different residual connections. We evaluate our model on three Chinese QASA datasets in different domains. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in Chinese question-answering sentiment analysis.",
