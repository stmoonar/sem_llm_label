            "abstract": "Multiple approaches have been proposed to automatically recommend potential developers who can address bug reports. These approaches are typically designed to work for any bug report submitted to any software project. However, we conjecture that these approaches may not work equally well for all the reports in a project. We conducted an empirical study to validate this conjecture, using three bug assignment approaches applied on 2,249 bug reports from two open source systems. We found empirical evidence that validates our conjecture, which led us to explore the idea of identifying and applying the best-performing approach for each bug report to obtain more accurate developer recommendations. We conducted an additional study to assess the feasibility of this idea using machine learning. While we found a wide margin of accuracy improvement for this approach, it is far from achieving the maximum possible improvement and performs comparably to baseline approaches. We discuss potential reasons for these results and conjecture that the assignment approaches may not capture important information about the bug assignment process that developers perform in practice. The results warrant future research in understanding how developers assign bug reports and improving automated bug report assignment",

            "abstract": "The operating attitude of a shearer based on a three-dimensional (3D) space scale is the necessary basic information for realizing intelligent mining. Aiming to address the problem of the insufficient perception accuracy of shearers, in this paper, the rotation model of the actual turning mechanism of the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) of shearers is established, and the error propagation characteristics of different single-axis rotation modulation schemes are revealed. Through theory and simulation, the optimal rotation modulation scheme is determined to be the improved four-position turn\u2013stop modulation with a rotation of <360\u00b0. The experiment shows that the 24 h positioning error of this scheme is 3.7 nmile, and the heading angle changes by 0.06\u00b0, which proves that this scheme can effectively improve the attitude perception accuracy of the inertial navigation system (INS). The field application of the shearer operating attitude perception based on this scheme shows that the positioning error after error compensation is 17% of that before compensation, and the heading angle error is 75% of that before compensation, which verifies that this scheme can significantly improve the accuracy of shearer operating attitude perception in field applications. This scheme can achieve higher precision perception accuracy based on SINS and has broad application prospects in the field of high-precision pose perception of coal mining machines, roadheaders, and other equipment.",

            "title": "Instant Representation Learning for Recommendation over Large Dynamic Graphs",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems are able to learn user preferences based on user and item representations via their historical behaviors. To improve representation learning, recent recommendation models start leveraging information from various behavior types exhibited by users. In real-world scenarios, the user behavioral graph is not only multiplex but also dynamic, i.e., the graph evolves rapidly over time, with various types of nodes and edges added or deleted, which causes the Neighborhood Disturbance. Nevertheless, most existing methods neglect such streaming dynamics and thus need to be retrained once the graph has significantly evolved, making them unsuitable in the online learning environment. Furthermore, the Neighborhood Disturbance existing in dynamic graphs deteriorates the performance of neighbor-aggregation based graph models. To this end, we propose SUPA, a novel graph neural network for dynamic multiplex heterogeneous graphs. Compared to neighbor-aggregation architecture, SUPA develops a sample-update-propagate architecture to alleviate neighborhood disturbance. Specifically, for each new edge, SUPA samples an influenced subgraph, updates the representations of the two interactive nodes, and propagates the interaction information to the sampled subgraph. Furthermore, to train SUPA incrementally online, we propose InsLearn, an efficient workflow for single-pass training of large dynamic graphs. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that SUPA has a good generalization ability and is superior to sixteen state-of-the-art baseline methods.

            "title": "Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture dual-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

            "title": "Complexity Model for Predicting Oil Displacement by Imbibition after Fracturing in Tight-Oil Reservoirs",
            "abstract": "With the increasing difficulty of conventional oil and gas exploration and development, oil and gas resources have developed from conventional to unconventional, and the exploration and development of tight-oil reservoirs are highly valued. In view of the complexity of the influencing factors of oil-water spontaneous seepage after fracturing and the instability of reservoir recovery, this paper takes the tight sandstone reservoir of Yanchang Formation in the southern Ordos Basin as the research object. Based on the micro-nano pore throat characteristics of tight sandstone, the seepage experiment is carried out, and the theoretical model of seepage suction is constructed. The mechanism and influencing factors of suction and oil displacement after fracturing in tight reservoirs are analyzed. Based on the analysis of fluid buoyancy and gravity, a mathematical model of the oil-water spontaneous flow after fracturing was established, and its influencing factors were analyzed. The experimental results show that the pore throats of tight sandstone are mainly in micron- and submicron scale, and the reservoir permeability is related to the pore throat structure, oil-water interfacial tension, and wettability. After fracturing, with the increase of the fracture length, the seepage velocity gradually decreases. With the increase of fracture opening, the influence of buoyancy and gravity on seepage velocity increases. With the increase of the fracture number, seepage velocity also increases. The fracture helps to reduce the adsorption of oil droplets on the core surface and improve the efficiency of spontaneous imbibition and oil displacement of the core. The research results provide theoretical data support for enhancing oil recovery and have important application guiding significance for the operational reliability of manufacturing systems with complex topology and the complexity and operability of production operations in manufacturing systems.",

            "abstract": "Increasing the size of embedding layers has shown to be effective in improving the performance of recommendation models, yet gradually causing their sizes to exceed terabytes in industrial recommender systems, and hence the increase of computing and storage costs. To save resources while maintaining model performances, we propose SHARK, the model compression practice we have summarized in the recommender system of industrial scenarios. SHARK consists of two main components. First, we use the novel first-order component of Taylor expansion as importance scores to prune the number of embedding tables (feature fields). Second, we introduce a new row-wise quantization method to apply different quantization strategies to each embedding. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets, demonstrating that each component of our proposed SHARK framework outperforms previous approaches. We conduct A/B tests in multiple models on Kuaishou, such as short video, e-commerce, and advertising recommendation models. The results of the online A/B test showed SHARK can effectively reduce the memory footprint of the embedded layer. For the short-video scenarios, the compressed model without any performance drop significantly saves 70% storage and thousands of machines, improves 30% queries per second (QPS), and has been deployed to serve hundreds of millions of users and process tens of billions of requests every day.",

            "abstract": "We propose a geometric deep-learning-based framework, TractGeoNet, for performing regression using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography and associated pointwise tissue microstructure measurements. By employing a point cloud representation, TractGeoNet can directly utilize tissue microstructure and positional information from all points within a fiber tract without the need to average or bin data along the streamline as traditionally required by dMRI tractometry methods. To improve regression performance, we propose a novel loss function, the Paired-Siamese Regression loss, which encourages the model to focus on accurately predicting the relative differences between regression label scores rather than just their absolute values. In addition, to gain insight into the brain regions that contribute most strongly to the prediction results, we propose a Critical Region Localization algorithm. This algorithm identifies highly predictive anatomical regions within the white matter fiber tracts for the regression task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by predicting individual performance on two neuropsychological assessments of language using a dataset of 20 association white matter fiber tracts from 806 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. The results demonstrate superior prediction performance of TractGeoNet compared to several popular regression models that have been applied to predict individual cognitive performance based on neuroimaging features. Of the twenty tracts studied, we find that the left arcuate fasciculus tract is the most highly predictive of the two studied language performance assessments. Within each tract, we localize critical regions whose microstructure and point information are highly and consistently predictive of language performance across different subjects and across multiple independently trained models. These critical regions are widespread and distributed across both hemispheres and all cerebral lobes, including areas of the brain considered important for language function such as superior and anterior temporal regions, pars opercularis, and precentral gyrus. Overall, TractGeoNet demonstrates the potential of geometric deep learning to enhance the study of the brain's white matter fiber tracts and to relate their structure to human traits such as language performance.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising results on exploiting node representations for many downstream tasks through supervised end-to-end training. To deal with the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world applications, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is leveraged to train GNNs with limited or even no labels by maximizing the mutual information between nodes in its augmented views generated from the original graph. However, the distribution of graphs remains unconsidered in view generation, resulting in the ignorance of unseen edges in most existing literature, which is empirically shown to be able to improve GCL's performance in our experiments. To this end, we propose to incorporate graph generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of views for GCL, in order to i) automatically capture the characteristic of graphs for augmentations, and ii) jointly train the graph GAN model and the GCL model. Specifically, we present GACN, a novel Generative Adversarial Contrastive learning Network for graph representation learning. GACN develops a view generator and a view discriminator to generate augmented views automatically in an adversarial style. Then, GACN leverages these views to train a GNN encoder with two carefully designed self-supervised learning losses, including the graph contrastive loss and the Bayesian personalized ranking Loss. Furthermore, we design an optimization framework to train all GACN modules jointly. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that GACN is able to generate high-quality augmented views for GCL and is superior to twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods. Noticeably, our proposed GACN surprisingly discovers that the generated views in data augmentation finally conform to the well-known preferential attachment rule in online networks.",

            "abstract": "The foundation of intelligent collaborative control of a shearer, scraper conveyor, and hydraulic support (three-machines) is to achieve the precise perception of the status of the three-machines and the full integration of information between the equipment. In order to solve the problems of information isolation and non-flow, independence between equipment, and weak cooperation of three-machines due to an insufficient fusion of perception data, a fusion method of the equipment\u2019s state perception system on the intelligent working surface was proposed. Firstly, an intelligent perception system for the state of the three-machines in the working face was established based on fiber optic sensing technology and inertial navigation technology. Then, the datum coordinate system is created on the working surface to uniformly describe the status of the three-machines and the spatial position relationship between the three-machines is established using a scraper conveyor as a bridge so that the three-machines become a mutually restricted and collaborative equipment system. Finally, an indoor test was carried out to verify the relational model of the spatial position of the three-machines. The results indicate that the intelligent working face three-machines perception system based on fiber optic sensing technology and inertial navigation technology can achieve the fusion of monitoring data and unified expression of equipment status. The research results provide an important reference for building an intelligent perception, intelligent decision-making, and automatic execution system for coal mines.",

            "title": "Generalizable Zero-Shot Speaker Adaptive Speech Synthesis with Disentangled Representations",
            "abstract": "While most research into speech synthesis has focused on synthesizing high-quality speech for in-dataset speakers, an equally essential yet unsolved problem is synthesizing speech for unseen speakers who are out-of-dataset with limited reference data, i.e., speaker adaptive speech synthesis. Many studies have proposed zero-shot speaker adaptive text-to-speech and voice conversion approaches aimed at this task. However, most current approaches suffer from the degradation of naturalness and speaker similarity when synthesizing speech for unseen speakers (i.e., speakers not in the training dataset) due to the poor generalizability of the model in out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, we propose GZS-TV, a generalizable zero-shot speaker adaptive text-to-speech and voice conversion model. GZS-TV introduces disentangled representation learning for both speaker embedding extraction and timbre transformation to improve model generalization and leverages the representation learning capability of the variational autoencoder to enhance the speaker encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that GZS-TV reduces performance degradation on unseen speakers and outperforms all baseline models in multiple datasets.",
