            "title": "A Counterfactual Collaborative Session-based Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Most session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) focus on extracting information from the observed items in the current session of a user to predict a next item, ignoring the causes outside the session (called outer-session causes, OSCs) that influence the user\u2019s selection of items. However, these causes widely exist in the real world, and few studies have investigated their role in SBRSs. In this work, we analyze the causalities and correlations of the OSCs in SBRSs from the perspective of causal inference. We find that the OSCs are essentially the confounders in SBRSs, which leads to spurious correlations in the data used to train SBRS models. To address this problem, we propose a novel SBRS framework named COCO-SBRS (COunterfactual COllaborative Session-Based Recommender Systems) to learn the causality between OSCs and user-item interactions in SBRSs. COCO-SBRS first adopts a self-supervised approach to pre-train a recommendation model by designing pseudo-labels of causes for each user\u2019s selection of the item in data to guide the training process. Next, COCO-SBRS adopts counterfactual inference to recommend items based on the outputs of the pre-trained recommendation model considering the causalities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. As a result, COCO-SBRS can learn the causalities in data, preventing the model from learning spurious correlations. The experimental results of our extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over ten representative SBRSs.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of MOOC quality evaluation that is essential for improving the course materials, promoting students' learning efficiency, and benefiting user services. \nWhile achieving promising performances, current works still suffer from the complicated interactions and relationships of entities in MOOC platforms. \nTo tackle the challenges, we formulate the problem as a course representation learning task based, and develop an Information-aware Graph Representation Learning(IaGRL) for multi-view MOOC quality evaluation. \nSpecifically, We first build a MOOC Heterogeneous Network (HIN) to represent the interactions and relationships among entities in MOOC platforms. \nAnd then we decompose the MOOC HIN into multiple single-relation graphs based on meta-paths to depict multi-view semantics of courses. \nThe course representation learning can be further converted to a multi-view graph representation task. \nDifferent from traditional graph representation learning, the learned course representations are expected to match the following three types of validity: \n(1) the agreement on expressiveness between the raw course portfolio and the learned course representations; \n(2) the consistency between the representations in each view and the unified representations; \n(3) the alignment between the course and MOOC platform representations. \nTherefore, we propose to exploit mutual information for preserving the validity of course representations. \nWe conduct extensive experiments over real-world MOOC datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

            "title": "Reinforced Explainable Knowledge Concept Recommendation in MOOCs",
            "abstract": "In this article, we study knowledge concept recommendation in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in an explainable manner. Knowledge concepts, composing course units (e.g., videos) in MOOCs, refer to topics and skills that students are expected to master. Compared to traditional course recommendation in MOOCs, knowledge concepts recommendation has drawn more attention because students\u2019 interests over knowledge concepts can better revealstudents\u2019 real intention in a more refined granularity. However, there are three unique challenges in knowledge concept recommendation: (1) How to design an appropriate data structure to capture complex relationships between knowledge concepts, course units, and other participants (e.g., students, teachers)? (2) How to model interactions between students and knowledge concepts? (3) How to make explainable recommendation results to students? To tackle these challenges, we formulate the knowledge concept recommendation as a reinforcement learning task integrated with MOOC knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, we first construct MOOC KG as the environment to capture all the relationships and behavioral histories by considering all the entities (e.g., students, teachers, videos, courses, and knowledge concepts) on the MOOC provider. Then, to model the interactions between students and knowledge concepts, we train an agent to mimic students\u2019 learning behavioral patterns facing the complex environment. Moreover, to provide explainable recommendation results, we generate recommended knowledge concepts in the format of a path from MOOC KG to indicate semantic reasons. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world MOOC dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of POI group recommendation is to generate a recommendation list of locations for a group of users. Most of the current studies first conduct personal recommendation and then use recommendation strategies to integrate individual recommendation results. Few studies consider the divergence of groups. To improve the precision of recommendations, we propose a POI group recommendation method based on collaborative filtering with intragroup divergence in this paper. Firstly, user preference vector is constructed based on the preference of the user on time and category. Furthermore, a computation method similar to TF-IDF is presented to compute the degree of preference of the user to the category. Secondly, we establish a group feature preference model, and the similarity of the group and other users\u2019 feature preference is obtained based on the check-ins. Thirdly, the intragroup divergence of POIs is measured according to the POI preference of group members and their friends. Finally, the preference rating of the group for each location is calculated based on a collaborative filtering method and intragroup divergence computation, and the top-ranked score of locations are the recommendation results for the group. Experiments have been conducted on two LBSN datasets, and the experimental results on precision and recall show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other methods.",

            "abstract": "Location based social network develops and gets widely concern along with the population and widespread use of mobile. Point of interest(POI) recommendation become one of the most widely application among location-based service. To get better POI recommendation performance, a fuzzy clustering based collaborative filtering algorithm (FCCF) for time-aware POI recommendation is proposed in this paper. It first constructs the user feature vector from users\u2019 check-in behaviours. Individual\u2019s check-in behaviour can be under the influence of location region and time slots, so user\u2019s feature consists of two parts. One is the vising frequency of each user in different location regions, and the other is the vising frequency of each user in different time slots. Next fuzzy c-means is adopted due to its simplicity to group users according to user feature vector. Then the user similarity computation can be limited in the similar small user groups. In the end, a collaborative filtering algorithm is applied to recommend a number of top-N POIs at a given time for the target user. Some experiments are conducted and the comparative results on Foursquare and Gowalla show that FCCF has higher precision and recall value than the comparative algorithms.",
