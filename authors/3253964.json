            "title": "Generalized Weak Supervision for Neural Information Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have demonstrated effective performance in several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, training NRMs often requires large-scale training data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, one can train NRMs via weak supervision, where a large dataset is automatically generated using an existing ranking model (called the weak labeler) for training NRMs. Weakly supervised NRMs can generalize from the observed data and significantly outperform the weak labeler. This paper generalizes this idea through an iterative re-labeling process, demonstrating that weakly supervised models can iteratively play the role of weak labeler and significantly improve ranking performance without using manually labeled data. The proposed Generalized Weak Supervision (GWS) solution is generic and orthogonal to the ranking model architecture. This paper offers four implementations of GWS: self-labeling, cross-labeling, joint cross- and self-labeling, and greedy multi-labeling. GWS also benefits from a query importance weighting mechanism based on query performance prediction methods to reduce noise in the generated training data. We further draw a theoretical connection between self-labeling and Expectation-Maximization. Our experiments on four retrieval benchmarks suggest that our implementations of GWS lead to substantial improvements compared to weak supervision if the weak labeler is sufficiently reliable.",

            "abstract": "Recipe retrieval is a representative and useful application of cross-modal information retrieval. Recent studies have proposed frameworks for retrieving images of cuisines given textual ingredient lists and instructions. However, the textual form of ingredients easily causes information loss or inaccurate description, especially for novices of cookery who are often the main users of recipe retrieval systems. In this paper, we revisit the task of recipe retrieval by taking images of ingredients as input queries, and retrieving cuisine images by incorporating visual information of ingredients through a deep convolutional neural network. We build an image-to-image recipe retrieval system to validate the effect of ingredient image queries. We further combine the proposed solution with a state-of-the-art cross-modal recipe retrieval model to improve the overall performance of the recipe retrieval task.",

            "abstract": "In traditional retrieval environments, a ranked list of candidate documents is produced without regard to the number of documents. With the rise in interactive IR as well as professional searches such as legal retrieval, this results in a substantial ranked list which is scanned by a user until their information need is satisfied. Determining the point at which the ranking model has low confidence in the relevance score is a challenging, but potentially very useful, task. Truncation of the ranked list must balance the needs of the user with the confidence of the retrieval model. Unlike query performance prediction where the task is to estimate the performance of a model based on an initial query and a given set documents, dynamic truncation minimizes the risk of viewing a non-relevant document given an external metric by estimating the confidence of the retrieval model using a distribution over its already calculated output scores, and subsequently truncating the ranking at that position. In this paper, we propose an assumption-free approach to learning a non-parametric score distribution over any retrieval model and demonstrate the efficacy of our method on Robust04, significantly improving user defined metrics compared to previous approaches.",

            "abstract": "When performing cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) for lower-resourced languages, a common approach is to retrieve over the output of machine translation (MT). However, there is no established guidance on how to optimize the resulting MT-IR system. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the performance of MT systems and both neural and term frequency-based IR models to identify how CLIR performance can be best predicted from MT quality. We explore performance at varying amounts of MT training data, byte pair encoding (BPE) merge operations, and across two IR collections and retrieval models. We find that the choice of IR collection can substantially affect the predictive power of MT tuning decisions and evaluation, potentially introducing dissociations between MT-only and overall CLIR performance.",

            "abstract": "While the popularity of online social network (OSN) apps continues to grow, little attention has been drawn to the increasing cases of Social Network Addictions (SNAs). In this paper, we argue that by mining OSN data in support of online intervention treatment, data scientists may assist mental healthcare professionals to alleviate the symptoms of users with SNA in early stages. Our idea, based on behavioral therapy, is to incrementally substitute highly addictive newsfeeds with safer, less addictive, and more supportive newsfeeds. To realize this idea, we propose a novel framework, called Newsfeed Substituting and Supporting System (N3S), for newsfeed filtering and dissemination in support of SNA interventions. New research challenges arise in 1) measuring the addictive degree of a newsfeed to an SNA patient, and 2) properly substituting addictive newsfeeds with safe ones based on psychological theories. To address these issues, we first propose the Additive Degree Model (ADM) to measure the addictive degrees of newsfeeds to different users. We then formulate a new optimization problem aiming to maximize the efficacy of behavioral therapy without sacrificing user preferences. Accordingly, we design a randomized algorithm with a theoretical bound. A user study with 716 Facebook users and 11 mental healthcare professionals around the world manifests that the addictive scores can be reduced by more than 30%. Moreover, experiments show that the correlation between the SNA scores and the addictive degrees quantified by the proposed model is much greater than that of state-of-the-art preference based models.",

            "abstract": "While the popularity of social network applications continues to grow, increasing cases of social networkmental disorders (SNMDs) are also noted. For behavioral therapy of SNMDs, an idea, similar to providing electronic cigare\u008aes to addictive smokers, is to substitute highly-addictive newsfeeds with safer, less-addictive ones to those users. Nevertheless, this idea faces two major challenges: 1) how to measure the addictive degree of a newsfeed to an SNMD user, and 2) how to exploit the theories in Psychology to determine appropriate substitution of newsfeeds for the therapy. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a learning framework, namely, SNMD-Aware Personalized nEwsfeed Ranking (SAPER), that exploits features extracted from social network data to measure the addictive degree of a newsfeed. With the quanti\u0080ed addictive degrees of newsfeeds, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, Multi-E\u0081cacy Maximization with Interest Constraint (MEMIC), to maximize the e\u0081cacy of the behavioral therapy, without sacri\u0080cing the interests of users. Accordingly, we propose a randomized algorithm called Computing Budget Optimization for MEMIC with Newsfeed Di\u0082erentiation (CBOM-ND). To validate our idea, we conduct a user study on 517 online social network users to evaluate the proposed SAPER framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on large-scale datasets to evaluate the proposed CBOM-ND. \u008ce results show that our approach is promising for alleviating the symptoms of online social network users with potential SNMDs.",

Different from previous works, we force the items with few ratings to be promoted to the users who would potentially be able to give ratings, and then leverage the gathered user preference to punish the promoted items with low quality intrinsically. By slightly sacrificing the benefit of recommending the best items in terms of user satisfaction, our approach seeks to provide all of the items with a chance to be visible equally. The results of the experiments conducted on MovieLens and Netflix data demonstrate its feasibility.",
