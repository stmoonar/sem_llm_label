            "abstract": "Recent works in neural knowledge graph inference attempt to combine logic rules with knowledge graph embeddings to benefit from prior knowledge. However, they usually cannot avoid rule grounding, and injecting a diverse set of rules has still not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we propose InjEx, a mechanism to inject multiple types of rules through simple constraints, which capture definite Horn rules. To start, we theoretically prove that InjEx can inject such rules. Next, to demonstrate that InjEx infuses interpretable prior knowledge into the embedding space, we evaluate InjEx on both the knowledge graph completion (KGC) and few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) settings. Our experimental results reveal that InjEx outperforms both baseline KGC models as well as specialized few-shot models while maintaining its scalability and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "We introduce EventNarrative, a knowledge graph-to-text dataset from publicly available open-world knowledge graphs. Given the recent advances in event-driven Information Extraction (IE), and that prior research on graph-to-text only focused on entity-driven KGs, this paper focuses on event-centric data. However, our data generation system can still be adapted to other other types of KG data. Existing large-scale datasets in the graph-to-text area are non-parallel, meaning there is a large disconnect between the KGs and text. The datasets that have a paired KG and text, are small scale and manually generated or generated without a rich ontology, making the corresponding graphs sparse. Furthermore, these datasets contain many unlinked entities between their KG and text pairs. EventNarrative consists of approximately 230,000 graphs and their corresponding natural language text, 6 times larger than the current largest parallel dataset. It makes use of a rich ontology, all of the KGs entities are linked to the text, and our manual annotations confirm a high data quality. Our aim is two-fold: help break new ground in event-centric research where data is lacking, and to give researchers a well-defined, large-scale dataset in order to better evaluate existing and future knowledge graph-to-text models. We also evaluate two types of baseline on EventNarrative: a graph-to-text specific model and two state-of-the-art language models, which previous work has shown to be adaptable to the knowledge graph-to-text domain.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new neural network architecture for learning vector representations of items with attributes, specifically hotels. Unlike previous works, which typically only rely on modeling of user-item interactions for learning item embeddings, we propose a framework that combines several sources of data, including user clicks, hotel attributes (e.g., property type, star rating, average user rating), amenity information (e.g., if the hotel has free Wi-Fi or free breakfast), and geographic information that leverages an hexagonal geospatial system as well as spatial encoders. During model training, a joint embedding is learned from all of the above information. We show that including structured attributes about hotels enables us to make better predictions in a downstream task than when we rely exclusively on click data. We train our embedding model on more than 60 million user click sessions from a leading online travel platform, and learn embeddings for more than one million hotels. Our final learned embeddings integrate distinct sub-embeddings for user clicks, hotel attributes, and geographic information, providing a representation that can be used flexibly depending on the application. An important advantage of the proposed neural model is that it addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes, which are available for all hotels. We show through the results of an online A/B test that our model generates high-quality representations that boost the performance of a hotel recommendation system on a large online travel platform.",

            "abstract": "Despite the importance and abundance of temporal knowledge graphs, most of the current research has been focused on reasoning on static graphs. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of inference over temporal knowledge graphs. In particular, the task of temporal link prediction. In general, this is a difficult task due to data non-stationarity, data heterogeneity, and its complex temporal dependencies. \nWe propose Chronological Rotation embedding (ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations, and time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and versatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model learns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and time, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the rotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high dimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich interaction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a Temporal Knowledge Graph. Experimentally, we show that ChronoR is able to outperform many of the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets for temporal knowledge graph link prediction.",

            "abstract": "Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), their training suffers from several well-known problems, including mode collapse and difficulties learning a disconnected set of manifolds. In this paper, we break down the challenging task of learning complex high dimensional distributions, supporting diverse data samples, to simpler sub-tasks. Our solution relies on designing a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having a simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition. This is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels. We formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the training of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and 2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with a direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid producing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also facilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We develop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above criteria. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we design an effective neural architecture for the space partitioner that empirically assures these conditions. Experimental results on various standard benchmarks show that the proposed unsupervised model outperforms several recent methods.",

Despite the importance of inductive link prediction, most previous works focused on transductive link prediction and cannot manage previously unseen entities. Moreover, they are black-box models that are not easily explainable for humans. We propose DRUM, a scalable and differentiable approach for mining first-order logical rules from knowledge graphs that resolves these problems. We motivate our method by making a connection between learning confidence scores for each rule and low-rank tensor approximation. DRUM uses bidirectional RNNs to share useful information across the tasks of learning rules for different relations. We also empirically demonstrate the efficiency of DRUM over existing rule mining methods for inductive link prediction on a variety of benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Multiple web-scale Knowledge Bases, e.g., Freebase, YAGO, NELL, have been constructed using semi-supervised or unsupervised information extraction techniques and many of them, despite their large sizes, are continuously growing. Much research effort has been put into mining inference rules from knowledge bases. To address the task of rule mining over evolving web-scale knowledge bases, we propose a parallel incremental rule mining framework. Our approach is able to efficiently mine rules based on the relational model and apply updates to large knowledge bases; we propose an alternative metric that reduces computation complexity without compromising quality; we apply multiple optimization techniques that reduce runtime by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Experiments show that our approach efficiently scales to web-scale knowledge bases and saves over 90% time compared to the state-of-the-art batch rule mining system. We also apply our optimization techniques to the batch rule mining algorithm, reducing runtime by more than half compared to the state-of-the-art. To the best of our knowledge, our incremental rule mining system is the first that handles updates to web-scale knowledge bases.",
