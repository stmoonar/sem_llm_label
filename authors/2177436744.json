            "title": "LAraBench: Benchmarking Arabic AI with Large Language Models",
            "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly influenced the landscape of language and speech research. Despite this progress, these models lack specific benchmarking against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models tailored to particular languages and tasks. LAraBench addresses this gap for Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Processing tasks, including sequence tagging and content classification across different domains. We utilized models such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, BLOOMZ, Jais-13b-chat, Whisper, and USM, employing zero and few-shot learning techniques to tackle 33 distinct tasks across 61 publicly available datasets. This involved 98 experimental setups, encompassing ~296K data points, ~46 hours of speech, and 30 sentences for Text-to-Speech (TTS). This effort resulted in 330+ sets of experiments. Our analysis focused on measuring the performance gap between SOTA models and LLMs. The overarching trend observed was that SOTA models generally outperformed LLMs in zero-shot learning, with a few exceptions. Notably, larger computational models with few-shot learning techniques managed to reduce these performance gaps. Our findings provide valuable insights into the applicability of LLMs for Arabic NLP and speech processing tasks.",

            "title": "AirEye: UAV-Based Intelligent DRL Mobile Target Visitation",
            "abstract": "From traffic monitoring to livestock tracking, and military reconnaissance to marine discovery, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are indispensable. Its dependence on a battery for power supply limits the flight time to visit all planned locations. Consequently, target visitation needs to be smart and minimize the mechanical energy. We propose to develop the AirEye UAV-based smart platform that can perform target visitation in the shortest time possible without knowing targets' exact locations, but with a known probabilistic distribution. We show how to integrate a UAV with the proper hardware to control it and execute commands from an on-ground command and control station. A pre-built machine learning model was modified to detect and identify targets, along with a reinforcement learning (RL) model to autonomously navigate the drone and ensure that all targets are visited while consuming minimal energy. We propose a drone energy model that can be used to estimate the total energy consumed by the drone in a complex scenario. We then use this energy model to compare the total energy consumed by the proposed RL-based technique in comparison with two other heuristic strategies, namely, random, and zigzag motion.",
