            "abstract": "Generating expressive speech with rich and varied prosody continues to be a challenge for Text-to-Speech. Most efforts have focused on sophisticated neural architectures intended to better model the data distribution. Yet, in evaluations it is generally found that no single model is preferred for all input texts. This suggests an approach that has rarely been used before for Text-to-Speech: an ensemble of models.We apply ensemble learning to prosody prediction. We construct simple ensembles of prosody predictors by varying either model architecture or model parameter values.To automatically select amongst the models in the ensemble when performing Text-to-Speech, we propose a novel, and computationally trivial, variance-based criterion. We demonstrate that even a small ensemble of prosody predictors yields useful diversity, which, combined with the proposed selection criterion, outperforms any individual model from the ensemble.",

            "abstract": "Structured chemical reaction information plays a vital role for chemists engaged in laboratory work and advanced endeavors such as computer-aided drug design. Despite the importance of extracting structured reactions from scientific literature, data annotation for this purpose is cost-prohibitive due to the significant labor required from domain experts. Consequently, the scarcity of sufficient training data poses an obstacle to the progress of related models in this domain. In this paper, we propose ReactIE, which combines two weakly supervised approaches for pre-training. Our method utilizes frequent patterns within the text as linguistic cues to identify specific characteristics of chemical reactions. Additionally, we adopt synthetic data from patent records as distant supervision to incorporate domain knowledge into the model. Experiments demonstrate that ReactIE achieves substantial improvements and outperforms all existing baselines.",

            "abstract": "We propose REACTCLASS that automatically maps the low-level concrete chemical entities into the high-level reactant groups without human effort for training data annotation. REACTCLASS is designed to take two special characteristics of the chemical molecules into consideration. The first characteristic is that each chemical molecule can be represented in two modalities: a chemical name in the text and a molecular structure in the graph. We propose to use cross-modal supervision to automatically create the training data for chemical name classification in the text via molecular structure matching in the graph. The second characteristic is that there is a knowledge-aware subword correlation between the surface names of the chemical entities to be classified and that of the reactant groups as class labels. We propose to train a classification model based on the subword cross-attention map between each chemical name and the corresponding reaction group. Experiments demonstrate that REACTCLASS is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance in classifying the chemical names into human-defined reactant groups without requiring human effort for training data annotation.",

            "abstract": "Text-to-speech is now able to achieve near-human naturalness and research focus has shifted to increasing expressivity. One popular method is to transfer the prosody from a reference speech sample. There have been considerable advances in using prosody transfer to generate more expressive speech, but the field lacks a clear definition of what successful prosody transfer means and a method for measuring it. We introduce a dataset of prosodically-varied reference natural speech samples for evaluating prosody transfer. The samples include global variations reflecting emotion and interpersonal attitude, and local variations reflecting topical emphasis, propositional attitude, syntactic phrasing and marked tonicity. The corpus only includes prosodic variations that listeners are able to distinguish with reasonable accuracy, and we report these figures as a benchmark against which text-to-speech prosody transfer can be compared. We conclude the paper with a demonstration of our proposed evaluation methodology, using the corpus to evaluate two text-to-speech models that perform prosody transfer.",

            "abstract": "Scientific literature analysis needs fine-grained named entity recognition (NER) to provide a wide range of information for scientific discovery. For example, chemistry research needs to study dozens to hundreds of distinct, fine-grained entity types, making consistent and accurate annotation difficult even for crowds of domain experts. On the other hand, domain-specific ontologies and knowledge bases (KBs) can be easily accessed, constructed, or integrated, which makes distant supervision realistic for fine-grained chemistry NER. In distant supervision, training labels are generated by matching mentions in a document with the concepts in the knowledge bases (KBs). However, this kind of KB-matching suffers from two major challenges: incomplete annotation and noisy annotation. We propose ChemNER, an ontology-guided, distantly-supervised method for fine-grained chemistry NER to tackle these challenges. It leverages the chemistry type ontology structure to generate distant labels with novel methods of flexible KB-matching and ontology-guided multi-type disambiguation. It significantly improves the distant label generation for the subsequent sequence labeling model training. We also provide an expert-labeled, chemistry NER dataset with 62 fine-grained chemistry types (e.g., chemical compounds and chemical reactions). Experimental results show that ChemNER is highly effective, outperforming substantially the state-of-the-art NER methods (with .25 absolute F1 score improvement).",
