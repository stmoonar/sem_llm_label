In this paper, we consider the Naming Game with multiple committed opinions and investigate the dynamics of the game on a complete graph with an arbitrary large population. The homogeneous mixing condition enables us to use mean-\ufb01eld theory to analyze the opinion evolution of the system. However, when the number of opinions increases, the number of variables describing the system grows exponentially. We focus on a special scenario where the largest group of committed agents competes with a motley of committed groups, each of which is signi\ufb01cantly smaller than the largest one, while the majority of uncommitted agents initially hold one unique opinion. We choose this scenario for two reasons. The \ufb01rst is that it arose many times in different societies, while the second is that its complexity can be reduced by merging all agents of small committed groups into a single committed group. We show that the phase transition occurs when the group of the largest committed fraction dominates the system, and the threshold for the size of the dominant group at which this transition occurs depends on the size of the committed group of the uni\ufb01ed category. Further, we derive the general formula for the multi-opinion evolution using a recursive approach. Finally, we use agent-based simulations to reveal the opinion evolution in the random graphs. Our results provide insights into the conditions under which the dominant opinion emerges in a population and the factors that in\ufb02uence this process.",

            "abstract": "The naming game (NG) is a classic model for studying the emergence and evolution of language within a population. In this article, we extend the traditional NG model to encompass multiple committed opinions and investigate the system dynamics on the complete graph with an arbitrarily large population and random networks of finite size. For the fully connected complete graph, the homogeneous mixing condition enables us to use mean-field theory to analyze the opinion evolution of the system. However, when the number of opinions increases, the number of variables describing the system grows exponentially. To mitigate this, we focus on a special scenario where the largest group of committed agents competes with a motley of committed groups, each of which is smaller than the largest one, while initially, most of uncommitted agents hold one unique opinion. This scenario is chosen for its recurrence in diverse societies and its potential for complexity reduction by unifying agents from smaller committed groups into one category. Our investigation reveals that when the size of the largest committed group reaches the critical threshold, most of uncommitted agents change their beliefs to this opinion, triggering a phase transition. Further, we derive the general formula for the multiopinion evolution using a recursive approach, enabling investigation into any scenario. Finally, we employ agent-based simulations to reveal the opinion evolution and dominance transition in random graphs. Our results provide insights into the conditions under which the dominant opinion emerges in a population and the factors that influence these conditions.",

            "abstract": "Networks of interconnected agents are essential to study complex networked systems' state evolution, stability, resilience, and control. Nevertheless, the high dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics are vital factors preventing us from theoretically analyzing them. Recently, the dimension-reduction approaches reduced the system's size by mapping the original system to a one-dimensional system such that only one effective representative can capture its macroscopic dynamics. However, the approaches dramatically fail as the network becomes heterogeneous and has multiple community structures. Here, we bridge the gap by developing a generalized dimension reduction approach, which enables us to map the original system to a $m$-dimensional system that consists of $m$ interacting components. Notably, by validating it on various dynamical models, this approach accurately predicts the original system state and the tipping point, if any. Furthermore, the numerical results demonstrate that this approach approximates the system evolution and identifies the critical points for complex networks with time delay.",

            "abstract": "The paper describes a methodology for simulating online social media activities that occur in response to external events. A large number of social media simulators model information diffusion on online social networks. However, information cascades do not originate in vacuum. Rather, they often originate as a reaction to events external to the online medium. Thus, to predict activity on the social medium, one must investigate the relation between external stimuli and online social responses. The paper presents a simulation pipeline that features stimulus/response models describing how social systems react to external events of relevance to them. Two case studies are presented to test the fidelity of different models. One investigates online responses to events in the Venezuela election crisis. The other investigates online responses to developments of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). These case studies indicate that simple macroscopic stimulus/response models can accurately predict aggregate online trends.",

            "abstract": "As ecosystems might lose their biodiversity and even change from the functional state to the extinct state due to environmental degradation, resilience restoration thus plays an increasingly important role in recovering the service and functions of the systems. The existence of alternative stable states and the switches between them in ecological systems containing a single dynamical variable has been substantially studied. Impeded by the difficulty of high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and stochastic effects, however, there is little understanding of the bistability and transitions for spatially-extended systems in noisy environment. We bridge the gap by successfully combining nucleation theory and the theory about noise-induced transition, with which the transition and resilience restoration can be explored in multi-variable systems. After applying it to four types of lattice-based ecosystems, two cluster modes that exhibit different transition patterns are distinguished by the system size and noise strength. Large systems under strong noise take less time to complete transition, exhibiting the multi-cluster transition mode. In contrast, small systems subjected to weak noise require more time, leading to the single-cluster mode. We show both analytically and numerically that the recovering time for the single-cluster mode follows an exponential distribution and that for the multi-cluster mode is almost fixed by spatial self-averaging. Our study advances the understanding of the role of noise in ecological restorations. More importantly, this approach is not restricted to ecosystems, but it can be generally used to study resilience and transitions in various dynamical systems with alternative stable states.",

They lack explicit dynamics and have multiple sources of cost, both of which are beyond the current scope of traditional control theory. We construct the global risk network by combining the consensus of experts from the World Economic Forum with risk activation data to define its topology and interactions. Many of these risks, including extreme weather, pose significant economic costs when active. We introduce a method for converting network interaction data into continuous dynamics to which we apply optimal control. We contribute the first method for constructing and controlling risk network dynamics based on empirically collected data. We identify seven risks commonly used by governments to control COVID-19 spread and show that many alternative driver risk sets exist with potentially lower cost of control.",

If a substantial amount of these individuals are motivated to take action from their recently established opinions, a movement or public opinion shift can be induced independent of the information's veracity. Given that social media is ubiquitous in modern society, it is imperative that we understand the threshold at which social media data results in opinion formation. The present study estimates population opinion formation thresholds by querying 2222 participants about the number of various social media data-types (i.e., images, videos, and/or messages) that they would need to passively consume to form opinions. Opinion formation is assessed across three dimensions, 1) data-type(s), 2) context, and 3) source.

            "abstract": "To study the detailed effects of social media consumption on personal opinion dynamics, we gather self reported survey data on the volume of different media types an individual must consume before forming or changing their opinion on a subject. We then use frequent pattern mining to analyze the data for common groupings of responses with respect to various media types, sources, and contexts. We show that in general individuals tend to perceive their behavior to be consistent across many variations in these parameters, while further detail shows various common parameter groupings that indicate response changes as well as small groups of individuals that tend to be consistently more easily swayed than the average participant.",

            "abstract": "The pervasive use of social media has grown to over two billion users to date, and is commonly utilized as a means to share information and shape world events. Evidence suggests that passive social media usage (i.e., viewing without taking action) has an impact on the user's perspective. This empirical influence over perspective could have significant impact on social events. Therefore, it is important to understand how social media contributes to the formation of an individual's perspective. A set of experimental tasks were designed to investigate empirically derived thresholds for opinion formation as a result of passive interactions with different social media data types (i.e., videos, images, and messages). With a better understanding of how humans passively interact with social media information, a paradigm can be developed that allows the exploitation of this interaction and plays a significant role in future military plans and operations.",

            "abstract": "Current models for opinion dynamics typically utilize a Poisson process for speaker selection, making the waiting time between events exponentially distributed. Human interaction tends to be bursty though, having higher probabilities of either extremely short waiting times or long periods of silence. To quantify the burstiness effects on the dynamics of social models, we place in competition two groups exhibiting different speakers' waiting-time distributions. These competitions are implemented in the binary naming game and show that the relevant aspect of the waiting-time distribution is the density of the head rather than that of the tail. We show that even with identical mean waiting times, a group with a higher density of short waiting times is favored in competition over the other group. This effect remains in the presence of nodes holding a single opinion that never changes, as the fraction of such committed individuals necessary for achieving consensus decreases dramatically when they have a higher head density than the holders of the competing opinion. Finally, to quantify differences in burstiness, we introduce the expected number of small-time activations and use it to characterize the early-time regime of the system.",
