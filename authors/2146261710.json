            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has attracted substantial attention over the past decade. Instead of taking textual keywords as input, CBIR techniques directly take a visual query and try to return its similar images from a given database. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight framework to fast locate the images on large-scale datasets. To achieve this, we first group the images with the high similarity into one cluster by using the deep neural network. Then, we extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the images. Based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we propose CB-tree (clustering binary tree) to fast locate the image clusters. Compared with the baseline schemes, the proposed framework can enhance the searching speed by up to 33%.",

            "abstract": ". Biomedical data are gradually increasing. More and more research focused on Relationship querying between genes, drugs, and disorders. Generally, genes, drugs, and disorders information were stored in different heterogeneous datasets. These datasets were stored in different places and different formats, such as RDF/XML, SQL relational databases, and text, etc. The challenge is the fusion of multi-source and cross-platform biomedical datasets for most application based on gene disorder drug Relationship querying. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel multi-source linked open data fusion method for gene disorder drug Relationship querying. In this method, a variety of biomedical datasets are converted into RDF triple data; and then multi-source datasets are formed into a storage system with data fusion method. After fusion, the sys-tem can query the relationships among various entities from different datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method significantly has advantages in integrating multi-source heterogeneous biomedical datasets with high efficiency and reliability. The SPARQL query experiment is carried on 4 different datasets by using 9 kinds of common query questions proposed in this paper. The results show that most of the query results came from different datasets. the method can be used to fusion more other different biomedical datasets.",

            "abstract": ". In the past decade, the volume of RDF (Resource Description Framework, which is a standard model for data interchange on the Web) data has grown enormously, and many RDF datasets (e.g., Wikipedia) have reached up to billions of triples. As a result, ef\ufb01cient management of this huge RDF data has become a tremedous challenge. In this paper, we present HTStore, a hash tree based system for fast storing and accessing large scale RDF data. The design of HTStore has three salient features. First, the compact design can effectively reduce the size of the indexes. Second, HTStore utilizes the hash function to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the query time. Third, the proposed hash tree structure can easily adapt to the changes in data volume (e.g., data expansion). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve the query ef\ufb01ciency up to 21.3% compared with the representative RDF data management systems.",
