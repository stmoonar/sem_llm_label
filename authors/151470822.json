            "title": "Multi-View Maximum Margin Clustering With Privileged Information Learning",
            "abstract": "Maximum margin clustering (MMC) is a typical clustering method which aims to maximize the margin between different clusters. However, in practical applications, a data object may be represented by multiple feature sets (views), with each feature set representing different information of the underlying data. The traditional MMC methods can handle only the data from a single view and are unable to utilize the multi-view data to enhance the clustering model. In multi-view clustering, there are two basic principles: the consensus principle and complementarity principle. Most multi-view clustering methods implement mainly the consensus principle, while the complementarity principle has not been sufficiently taken into account. Distinguished from the existing methods, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> introduces the idea of privileged information learning into multi-view clustering and implements both of the consensus principle and complementarity principle. Based on privileged information learning, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> embodies the complementarity principle by considering one view as the main learning information and the other views as the privileged information, so that multiple views can provide information to complement each other. The derived learning problem is then solved by applying the constrained concave\u2013convex procedure and cutting plane techniques. By employing these techniques, the computational time of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is able to scale linearly with respect to the dataset size. Numerical experiments on real-life multi-view datasets demonstrate that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is able to achieve better clustering accuracy and meanwhile needs less computational time, compared to state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.",

            "abstract": "In this article, to exclusively suppress unuseful underwater noise feature and effectively avoid overenhancement, simultaneously, an underwater attentional generative adversarial network (UAGAN) is innovatively established. Main contributions are as follows: combining dense concatenation with global maximum and average pooling techniques, a cascade dense-channel attention (CDCA) module is devised to adaptively distinguish noise feature and recalibrate channel weight, simultaneously, such that low-contribution feature map can be effectively suppressed; to sufficiently capture long-range dependence between any two nonlocal spatial patches, the position attention (PA) module is created such that the deviation among independent patches can be sufficiently eliminated, thereby avoiding overenhancement; and in conjunction with CDCA and PA modules, the entire UAGAN framework is eventually developed in an end-to-end manner. Comprehensive experiments conducted on underwater image enhancement benchmark (UIEB) and underwater robot professional contest (URPC) datasets demonstrate remarkable effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UAGAN scheme by comparing with typical underwater image enhancement approaches including unsupervised color correction method, image blurriness and light absorption, underwater dark channel prior, underwater generative adversarial network, underwater convolutional neural network, and WaterNet in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, underwater color image quality evaluation, underwater image quality measures, etc.",

            "title": "Ordinal Regression With Pinball Loss",
            "abstract": "Ordinal regression (OR) aims to solve multiclass classification problems with ordinal classes. Support vector OR (SVOR) is a typical OR algorithm and has been extensively used in OR problems. In this article, based on the characteristics of OR problems, we propose a novel pinball loss function and present an SVOR method with pinball loss (pin-SVOR). Pin-SVOR is fundamentally different from traditional SVOR with hinge loss. Traditional SVOR employs the hinge loss function, and the classifier is determined by only a few data points near the class boundary, called support vectors, which may lead to a noise sensitive and re-sampling unstable classifier. Distinctively, pin-SVOR employs the pinball loss function. It attaches an extra penalty to correctly classified data that lies inside the class, such that all the training data is involved in deciding the classifier. The data near the middle of each class has a small penalty, and that near the class boundary has a large penalty. Thus, the training data tend to lie near the middle of each class instead of on the class boundary, which leads to scatter minimization in the middle of each class and noise insensitivity. The experimental results show that pin-SVOR has better classification performance than state-of-the-art OR methods.",

            "abstract": "Due to the limitation of communication technology, the downloading and analysis of Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data in the past are carried out after flight. This is the first time that QAR data\u2019s real-time download and analysis experiment is carried out in China by using Air-to-Ground wireless broadband communication technology. Firstly, a dedicated communication frequency was obtained. Then, a complete Air-to-Ground wireless broadband communication network has been constructed. Based on this, 34 actual tests were carried out on the flight from Beijing to Chengdu, and got about 280,000 QAR real-time data. The integrity, consistency and delay of QAR data transmission via Air-to-Ground communication network are tested. The test results show that the integrity of downloaded QAR data is 99.99%, the consistency rate of data content comparison is 100% and the average round trip delay of QAR data transmission is 71.45 millisecond. It\u2019s fully meet the needs of real-time analysis. Secondly, the method of QAR data decoding is introduced. A real-time QAR data decoding software is developed to decoding while downloading. Finally, based on the real-time decoded QAR engineering data, the corresponding application software is developed. This work can not only solve the lag caused by QAR data post-flight analysis, but also can monitor the operation status of aircraft in real time, supervise flight safety, discover potential safety hazards in time, and realize efficient management and emergency disposal.",

The strategy is divided into two steps: First, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to search for the combination of tasks and robots; after that, the greedy algorithm is used to sort the task execution order in the task combination, and generate the overall cost of task execution plan. Through continuous iteration of the above process, the strategy finally finds the optimal solution. In the computer simulation environment, one TSP example is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",
