            "title": "GraphFC: Customs Fraud Detection with Label Scarcity",
            "abstract": "Customs officials across the world encounter huge volumes of transactions. Associated with customs transactions is customs fraud-the intentional manipulation of goods declarations to avoid taxes and duties. Due to limited manpower, the customs offices can only manually inspect a small number of declarations, necessitating the automation of customs fraud detection by machine learning techniques. The limited availability of manually inspected ground truth data makes it essential for the ML approach to generalize well on unseen data. However, current customs fraud detection models are not well suited or designed for this setting. In this work, we propose GraphFC (Graph Neural networks for Customs Fraud), a model-agnostic, domain-specific, graph neural network based customs fraud detection model that is designed to work in a real-world setting with limited ground truth data. Extensive experimentation using real customs data from two countries demonstrates that GraphFC generalizes well over unseen data and outperforms various baselines and other models by a large margin.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning has been a rising technique in signatureless malware detection and is popular in the anti-virus industry. Despite the powerful ability of machine learning, it is known to be vulnerable to attack by injecting specially crafted input noise (adversarial example). In this paper, we develop a systematic attack method that is effective, general and also efficient which automatically generates functional malware. Experiment results showed that such adversarial malware could deceive commercial anti-virus and completely defeat learning-based malware detector provided by a well-known anti-virus vendor. We further examine the effectiveness of our approach on multiple anti-virus engines on VirusTotal and investigate the transferability of our proposed method between different features and classification algorithms. Finally, we show how our attack could resist JavaScript de-obfuscation techniques.",

            "abstract": "Recent natural language reasoning models have achieved human-level accuracy on several benchmark datasets such as bAbI. While the results are impressive, in this paper we argue by experiment analysis that several existing attention-based models have a hard time generalizing themselves to handle name entities not seen in the training data. We thus propose Unseen Filler Generalization (UFG) as a task along with two new datasets to evaluate the filler generalization capability of a natural language reasoning model. We also propose a simple yet general strategy that can be applied to various models to handle the UFG challenge through modifying the entity occurrence distribution in the training data. Such strategy allows the model to encounter unseen entities during training, and thus not to overfit to only a few specific name entities. Our experiments show that this strategy can significantly boost the filler generalization capability of three existing models including Entity Network, Working Memory Network, and Universal Transformers.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has made dramatic advances in computer vision field, especially in improving the performance of object detection as well as instance semantic segmentation. Still, multi-object tracking (MOT) remains a very challenging issue. Even in state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detectors, a preferred paradigm for MOT: tracking-by-detection, can only slightly improve the tracking performance. Pixel-level information is considered more precise and useful for tracking performance improvement than using conventional information, such as foreground or background content in a bounding box. However, the performance of current state-of-the-art models for automatically annotating pixel-level information is still far from the expectation of human beings. Therefore, we shall explore how multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) is affected when the information obtained after applying instance semantic segmentation is incomplete. We propose a mask-guided two-streamed augmentation learning (MGTSAL) algorithm, which can be applied to TrackR-CNN to alleviate significant drop of MOTS performance when encountering incompletely segmented information. We evaluate the proposed approach on MOTS KITTI dataset, and our approach outperforms the baseline model TrackR-CNN in all our experimental settings. The promising experimental results and ablation study validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

To solve this problem, several studies predict demographic attributes from users\u2019 behavioral data. However, previous works suffer from different kinds of disadvantages. Handling data sparseness and defining useful features remain especially challenge tasks. In this article, we propose a novel Deep Energy Factorization Model to address these two drawbacks. The model is a designed network that performs multi-label classification and feature representation. Experiments are conducted on four datasets with four evaluation metrics.

            "abstract": "The railway is an indispensable means of transportation for people living in urban areas in Japan. However, unexpected accidents or disasters disturb the train operation. People usually check the operation status of trains on the official websites or Twitter of each railway company. However, it is still unclear whether such information is provided in realtime, when it is updated and which station is severely affected. Therefore, we tackle a real-world application of transportation big data using 8 months\u2019 data collected by smart cards for public transportation in Keikyu Line operating in Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefectures. We propose a method to detect the anomaly state by using the number of train users every 10 minutes in major 9 stations in Keikyu Line. In the method, outlier detections by interquartile range, interval estimation and Hotelling\u2019s theory are utilized to detect anomaly points. As the results, our proposal detects anomaly state better than the official announcement by Twitter on some points in terms of realtimeness, update frequency and geographic detail.",

In their daily life, people tend to repeatedly consume similar types of food items over several days and occasionally switch to consuming different types of items when the consumptions become overly monotonous. However, the novel and repeat consumption behaviors have not been studied in food recommendation research. More importantly, the ability to predict daily eating habits of individuals is crucial to improve the effectiveness of food recommender systems in facilitating healthy lifestyle change. In this study, we analyze the patterns of repeat food consumptions using large-scale consumption data from a popular online fitness community called MyFitnessPal (MFP), conduct an offline evaluation of various state-of-the-art algorithms in predicting the next-day food consumption, and analyze their performance across different demographic groups and contexts. The experiment results show that algorithms incorporating the exploration-and-exploitation and temporal dynamics are more effective in the next-day recommendation task than most state-of-the-art algorithms.",
