            "title": "Retrofitting Legacy Substation Monitoring Infrastructure to an Advanced Distribution Management System Employing Middleware: A Case Study",
            "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) in modern power grids, there is an increasing need to seamlessly integrate existing sensors and measurement devices into these systems. Due to compatibility issues and the cost of replacing entire sensor networks, retrofitting legacy infrastructure with new technologies can be a difficult task. The use of middleware as a viable solution for integrating legacy sensors and measurement devices into ADMS, enabling efficient data acquisition and real-time monitoring, is proposed in this paper. Distribution System Operators (DSOs) can efficiently upgrade their monitoring infrastructure, reduce the costs of a complete hardware overhaul, and maximize the potential of ADMS functionalities by leveraging middleware solutions. This method was used in the case study of retrofitting an existing substation monitoring system in the distribution grid managed by the Italian DSO Unareti, which operates in northern Italy. The legacy monitoring infrastructure uses proprietary communication protocols that are incompatible with the ADMS. The middleware layer solves this problem by allowing data from the substation monitoring system to be collected and analyzed by the ADMS. However, the middleware solution is impractical for critical monitoring systems that require real-time and low-latency data exchange. Depending on the characteristics of the legacy system, the middleware layer may introduce data exchange latency that, in the case of the considered case study, up to 15 minutes in the worst case.",

            "title": "Evaluation of the Use of Class B LoRaWAN for the Coordination of Distributed Interface Protection Systems in Smart Grids",
            "abstract": "The adoption of the distributed generation paradigm is introducing several changes in the design and operation of modern distribution networks. Modern grid codes are becoming more and more complex, and the adoption of smart protection systems is becoming mandatory. However, the adoption of newer and smarter units is only half of the story. Proper communication networks must be provided as well, and the overall costs may become critical. In this work, the adoption of the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology is suggested as a viable approach to implement the coordination of Interface Protection Systems. A proper communication architecture based on the LoRaWAN Class B technology was proposed and evaluated in order to assess its feasibility for the considered application. A scalability analysis was carried out, by computing the number of devices that can be handled by a single LoRaWAN Gateway (GW) and the maximum expected time of response between a triggering event and the arrival of the related coordination command. The results of the study showed that up to 312 devices can be managed by a single GW, by assuring a maximum response time of 22.95 s. A faster maximum response time of 6.2 s is also possible by reducing the number of managed devices to 12.",

            "abstract": "Recent innovations in Information Technology, Cloud Computing, Big Data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling technological solutions that were previously unimaginable, or usually available only for big IT companies, with impacts in both industry and services. The demonstrator named Smart Grid Semantic Platform (SGSP) has been created using these technologies integrating several aspects of the management of an electricity distribution network. The services deployed on the platform concern the visualization of the topographic data and electricity grid assets, as well as the processing and displaying of historical data related to the operation of the networks and/or the result of Big Data analysis. This paper demonstrates how useful the synergy is between the standard semantic model of the electric network (IEC CIM 61968) and the historical data of the time series of medium voltage electricity consumption analyzed using a Big Data platform. Specifically it illustrates the realization of a use case about the calculation of a load index of the electric lines.",

Therefore there is a growing interest in new solutions able to improve the power quality level of such a system. Among them, an interesting solution is represented by the open unified power quality conditioner (Open UPQC) proposed within the present work. The system consists of a single or three-phase ac/dc power converter installed at customer's premises and a main single or three-phase ac/dc power converter in the MV/LV substation. The paper discusses the design, simulation and implementation phases related to an Open UPQC installed in a real LV distribution grid in the city of Brescia (Italy) within the smart domo grid project, co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. Results from the field installation show the effectiveness of the proposed solution to face power quality issues in distribution networks.",

The adopted approach in data management make use of both the ontological and big data paradigma.

The adopted ontology is the IEC Common Information Model (CIM), which allows the integration of PQ information recorded by the QuEEN monitoring system, at the HV/MV stations of the DSO Unareti S.p.A., with the associated distribution network topology. Services offered regard: (i) the visualization of PQ indices in association with topological and cartographic information; (ii) a classifier, based on a Software Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, to define the origin of voltage dips; (iii) a web application, developed in the Spark framework, to correlate in space and time QuEEN voltage dips times series with storm cells.",

            "title": "Experimental characterization of communication infrastructure for virtual power plant monitoring",
            "abstract": "In modern distribution systems, the wide presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (e.g. intermittent and non-programmable renewable sources, such as photovoltaic power plants and micro wind turbines), is going to cause increasing problems in the traditional management of the distribution grid. Recently, the use of Distributed Energy Storage Systems (DESSs) has been proposed to limit the impact of renewable power plants on the distribution grid. The presence of a large number of production plants distributed along the grid, which are able to interact between them, requires the Distribution System Operator (DSO) to adopt a proper monitoring system. To allow such an implementation, a communication and a computing architecture able to virtualize several renewable power plants installed in the same area is described in the present work. The proposed architecture can simplify the monitoring from the DSO, using the so-called Virtual Power Plant (VPP) approach. The proposed architecture has been deployed in the area of the Campus of the University of Brescia, Italy, for the monitoring of two photovoltaic (PV) plants and two different Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). The implemented infrastructure makes use of several technologies, such as IEEE 802.11ac and Long Term Evolution (LTE). The characterization of the communication infrastructure highlights the feasibility of the proposed approach (the latency is less than 20 ms in the worst case over IEEE 802.11ac links with a traffic load of 80 Mbit/s). To show the performance of such a solution, the data collected from a system composed by a PV field (64 kWp) and a Li-Ion storage system (25 kWh) has been reported.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the distribution networks are working close to their physical device limits. When congestion takes place, distributed switches can be controlled to change their status in order to find a new optimal network configuration that solves that congestion. In this paper, a new methodology for congestion management by means of distributed network reconfiguration is presented. Switches and controllable voltage units such as PV units were used in the optimization process. The optimization process is guided by a weighted objective function that takes into account real power losses as well as operational limits of the power system under study. The methodology is tested in an Italian real power distribution system.",
