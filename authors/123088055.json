            "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) compute representations of graph nodes by exploiting convolution operators based on some neighborhood aggregation scheme. These operators are defined by using several stacked Graph Convolutional (GC) layers. They are usually defined as additive building blocks that fuse multiple information streams. However, when considering information integration in sequences, the flow of gradient has been shown to be more robust by adopting the Multiplicative Integration (MI) technique. Because of that, it is worth investigating the impact of MI in Graph Neural Networks. We propose three different GC layers that exploit MI to improve various aspects of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. We report both a theoretical and empirical comparison of our proposals with respect to the most common GC operators for the graph classification task.",

            "abstract": "Soft skills (SS) are important for Human Resource Management when recruiting suitable candidates for a job. Nowadays, enterprises aim to automatically extract such information from documents, curriculum vitae (CVs) and job descriptions, to speed up their recruitment process. State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by fine-tuning them to the domain-specific task. However, annotated data for the task is very limited and costly to obtain, since it requires domain experts. Moreover, SS consists of complex long entities which are difficult to extract given few annotated examples. As a consequence, the performance of the LLMs on soft skill detection still needs improvement before being used in a real-world context. In this paper, we introduce data augmentation based entity extraction approach which shows promising performance when the entity length is long (i.e more than three tokens). Moreover, we explore the performance of pre-trained LLMs to generate synthetic data for training. The pre-trained models are used to generate contextual augmentation of the baseline dataset. We further analyse the embeddings generated by these models in aiding the extraction process of entities. We develop an Embedding Manipulation (EM) approach to further improve the performance of baseline models. We evaluated our approach on the only publicly available dataset for soft skills (SKILLSPAN), and on three Entity Extraction datasets (GUM, WNUT-2017 and CoNLL-2003) to assess the proposed approach. Empirical evidence shows that the proposed approach allows us to get 6.52% increased F1 over the baseline model for the soft skills.",

            "abstract": "The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has spurred global collaborative research efforts to model and forecast the disease to improve preparation and control. Epidemiological models integrate experimental data and expert opinions to understand infection dynamics and control measures. Classical Machine Learning techniques often face challenges such as high data requirements, lack of interpretability, and difficulty integrating domain knowledge. A potential solution is to leverage Physically-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) models, which enhance models by incorporating known physical properties of viral spread. Additionally, epidemiological datasets are best represented as graphs, facilitating the modelling of interactions between individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel, interpretable graph-based PIML technique called SINDy-Graph to model infectious disease dynamics. Our approach is a Graph Cellular Automata architecture that combines the ability to identify dynamics for discovering the differential equations governing the physical phenomena under study using graphs modelling relationships between nodes (individuals). The experimental results demonstrate that integrating domain knowledge ensures better physical plausibility. In addition, our proposed model is easier to train and achieves a lower generalisation error compared to other baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "In Graph Convolutional Neural Networks, the capability of learning the representation of graph nodes comes at hand when dealing with graph analysis tasks, such as predicting node properties. Furthermore, node-level representations can be aggregated to obtain a single graph-level representation and predictor. This work explores an alternative route for defining the aggregation function compared to existing approaches. We propose a graph aggregator that exploits Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) to transform a set of node-level representations into a single graph-level one. The integration of GTM in a GCNN pipeline allows to estimate node representation probability densities and projects them in a low-dimensional space, while retaining the information about their mutual similarity and topology. A novel dedicated training procedure is specifically designed to learn from these reduced representations instead of the complete initial data. Experimental results on several graph classification datasets show that this approach achieves competitive predictive performances with respect to the commonly adopted aggregation architectures present in the literature while holding a well-grounded theoretical framework.",
