            "abstract": "In the IEEE 802.11ax Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) has been applied to enable the high-throughput WLAN amendment. However, with the growth of the number of devices, it is difficult for the Access Point (AP) to schedule uplink transmissions, which calls for an efficient access mechanism in the OFDMA uplink system. Based on Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), we propose a Mean-Field Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MFMAPPO) algorithm to improve the throughput and guarantee the fairness. Motivated by the Mean-Field games (MFGs) theory, a novel global state and action design are proposed to ensure the convergence of MFMAPPO in the massive access scenario. The Multi-Critic Single-Policy (MCSP) architecture is deployed in the proposed MFMAPPO so that each agent can learn the optimal channel access strategy to improve the throughput while satisfying fairness requirement. Extensive simulation experiments are performed to show that the MFMAPPO algorithm 1) has low computational complexity that increases linearly with respect to the number of stations 2) achieves nearly optimal throughput and fairness performance in the massive access scenario, 3) can adapt to various diverse and dynamic traffic conditions without retraining, as well as the traffic condition different from training traffic.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth of mobile data traffic has become a great challenge to the licensed spectrum in scarcity. Driven by this, deploying networks in unlicensed bands has been drawing significant attention. This work is devoted to study the impact of the number of links on optimal coexistence performance between Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) and WiFi in unlicensed bands. In particular, we consider three coexistence cases, including 1) single LAA link coexisting with single WiFi link; 2) single LAA link coexisting with multiple WiFi links; 3) multiple LAA links coexisting with multiple WiFi links. The throughput performance in all the three cases is characterized as explicit expressions, based on which the maximum total throughput under the throughput fairness and the corresponding optimal initial backoff window sizes are derived. A systematic comparison among the optimal performance of the three cases is conducted, and it is found that while the maximum total throughput is insensitive to the change of the number of multiple links, the drastic change from single link to multiple links in one network would lead to fierce internal competition in that network, and thus deteriorates both the optimal throughputs of the coexisting network and WiFi. This work sheds important light on the realization of fair and efficient spectrum sharing.",

            "abstract": "5G New Radio Unlicensed (5G NR-U) and WiFi are considered to be the two most representative radio access technologies in the newly released 6 GHz unlicensed bands, and thus their efficient and fair coexistence becomes crucial. In this paper, we study the coexistence performance of 5G NR-U and WiFi by accounting the new physical layer (PHY) enhancements in 5G NR including flexible numerologies and mini-slot scheduling. Consider the 3GPP notion of fairness as the requirement, we further study how to maximize the total network effective throughput of the WiFi and NR-U coexisting network. Explicit expressions of the maximum total network effective throughput and the corresponding optimal initial backoff window sizes of WiFi and NR-U nodes are derived, and verified by simulation results. The analysis shows that if the transmission opportunity (TXOP) value of NR-U nodes exceeds a certain threshold, then a win-win coexistence can be achieved, where both the WiFi and 5G NR-U network can perform no worse than the case when two WiFi networks coexist. In this case, the maximum total network effective throughput steadily grows as the time slot length of NR-U nodes decreases, indicating the PHY enhancement in 5G NR can benefit the coexistence performance of 5G NR-U and WiFi in the unlicensed spectrum.",

            "abstract": "The deployment of 5G New Radio in unlicensed spectrum is a promising solution to alleviate the spectrum crunch for cellular networks. With the openness of unlicensed spectrum, 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) will coexist with the incumbent Wi-Fi networks. It is therefore important to study how to maintain harmonious coexistence with the Wi-Fi network. To address this issue, this paper considers two alternative throughput optimization strategies under the 3GPP fairness by adjusting the access parameter: one is to maximize the total throughput of coexisting scenario, and the other is to maximize the throughput of NR-U network. It is shown that the throughput gain of both optimization strategies are related to the initial backoff window size and the network size of Wi-Fi. Moreover, the first strategy can maximize the total throughput yet it may be unfair to the NR-U network while the second strategy can maximize NR-U throughput yet may be harmful to the total throughput. In practical scenario where the IEEE 802.11 EDCA protocol is adopted in Wi-Fi, the performance of NR-U cannot be guaranteed when optimizing the total throughput, and thus optimizing the throughput of NR-U is suggested for fair coexistence.",

            "abstract": "With the emerging unlicensed spectrum sharing and Machine-to-Machine communications, the coexistence performance of multiple devices with different access schemes operating at the same unlicensed bands has received significant research interests. As the two most representative random-access schemes, Aloha and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) both found wide applications in unlicensed bands. Yet most of the studies have focused on the coexistence of CSMA-based networks, leaving the coexistence of Aloha-based and CSMA-based networks largely unexplored. The challenge originates from the lack of a coexistence model of slotted Aloha and CSMA. In this paper, the throughput performance of coexisting Aloha and CSMA networks is characterized and optimized by extending a unified analytical framework proposed for random-access networks. The analysis shows that different from the single-network case where the maximum throughput of CSMA is much higher thanks to carrier sensing, when Aloha and CSMA coexist, Aloha would significantly outperform CSMA if each network optimizes its own throughput performance without cooperation, leading to poor throughput performance for CSMA and severe unfairness. To achieve fair coexistence, inter-network cooperation is crucial. The optimal transmission probabilities of Aloha and CSMA for maximizing the total network throughput under a given throughput ratio are further derived, and applied to coexisting LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks to optimize their coexistence performance.",

This paper studies the maximum network sum rate of a general M-link 802.11be network with two different synchronous multi-link channel access methods being proposed by Task Group BE, i.e., Longest Backoff and Shortest Backoff. By using a Markov renewal process to model the behavior of each Head-of-Line packet, explicit expressions of the maximum network sum rate and the corresponding optimal initial backoff window sizes are derived, and verified by simulation results. The analysis shows that Longest Backoff and Shortest Backoff achieve an identical maximum network sum rate. However, to achieve the performance limit, the initial backoff window sizes need to be adaptively tuned in a different manner under the two access methods. As the number of links grows, the initial backoff window size with Longest Backoff should be monotonically decreased, while that with Shortest Backoff should be enlarged.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient human pose estimation network-SFM (slender fusion model) by fusing multi-level features and adding lightweight attention blocks-HSA (High-Level Spatial Attention). Many existing methods on efficient network have already taken feature fusion into consideration, which largely boosts the performance. However, its performance is far inferior to large network such as ResNet and HRNet due to its limited fusion operation in the network. Specifically, we expand the number of fusion operation by building bridges between two pyramid frameworks without adding layers. Meanwhile, to capture long-range dependency, we propose a lightweight attention block-HSA, which computes second-order attention map. In summary, SFM maximizes the number of feature fusion in a limited number of layers. HSA learns high precise spatial information by computing the attention of spatial attention map. With the help of SFM and HSA, our network is able to generate multi-level feature and extract precise global spatial information with little computing resource. Thus, our method achieve comparable or even better accuracy with less parameters and computational cost. Our SFM achieve 89.0 in PCKh@0.5, 42.0 in PCKh@0.1 on MPII validation set and 71.7 in AP, 90.7 in AP@0.5 on COCO validation with only 1.7G FLOPs and 1.5M parameters.

            "abstract": "Recently, cybercrime has become an important research issue in the field of cybersecurity. And ransomware is considered one of the main categories of cybercrime. The Wannacry ransomware attack broken out in 2017 is one of the largest ransomware attacks in history, creating huge threats to the data security of individual users and enterprises. Since 2017, although the principle of Wannacry has been figured comprehensively and numerous detection and defense methods have been proposed, all of these existing methods have some defects. Therefore, we propose to build a comprehensive detection approach of Wannacry with a set of rules, which is named Comprehensive Wannacry Detection Rules (CWDR). Through principle analysis, we extract the traffic features. And these features can be easily distinguished from other normal traffic information during the Wannacry attack. Base on these traffic features, a set of rules is designed to detect the attack process of Wannacry. CWDR rule set can detect Wannacry at all 8 stages through network traffic monitoring. Finally, we instantiate the rule set using Suricata and do benchmark experiments with ET Open rule set and Snort rule set. In the basic experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 0%, 25%, 50%. In the evasion experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 12.5%, 75%, 62.5%. The results show that the CWDR rule set can detect the attack process of Wannacry ransomware more precisely.",
