            "title": "Utility-oriented Reranking with Counterfactual Context",
            "abstract": "As a critical task for large-scale commercial recommender systems, reranking rearranges items in the initial ranking lists from the previous ranking stage to better meet users\u2019 demands. Foundational work in reranking has shown the potential of improving recommendation results by uncovering mutual influence among items. However, rather than considering the context of initial lists as most existing methods do, an ideal reranking algorithm should consider the counterfactual context \u2013 the position and the alignment of the items in the reranked lists. In this work, we propose a novel pairwise reranking framework, Utility-oriented Reranking with Counterfactual Context (URCC), which maximizes the overall utility after reranking efficiently. Specifically, we first design a utility-oriented evaluator, which applies Bi-LSTM and graph attention mechanism to estimate the listwise utility via the counterfactual context modeling. Then, under the guidance of the evaluator, we propose a pairwise reranker model to find the most suitable position for each item by swapping misplaced item pairs. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and a proprietary real-world dataset demonstrate that URCC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of both relevance-based metrics and utility-based metrics.",

            "title": "WESE: Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation for LLM Agents",
            "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential as an intelligent agent. However, existing researches mainly focus on enhancing the agent's reasoning or decision-making abilities through well-designed prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning, ignoring the procedure of exploration and exploitation. When addressing complex tasks within open-world interactive environments, these methods exhibit limitations. Firstly, the lack of global information of environments leads to greedy decisions, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand, irrelevant information acquired from the environment not only adversely introduces noise, but also incurs additional cost. This paper proposes a novel approach, Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation (WESE), to enhance LLM agents in solving open-world interactive tasks. Concretely, WESE involves decoupling the exploration and exploitation process, employing a cost-effective weak agent to perform exploration tasks for global knowledge. A knowledge graph-based strategy is then introduced to store the acquired knowledge and extract task-relevant knowledge, enhancing the stronger agent in success rate and efficiency for the exploitation task. Our approach is flexible enough to incorporate diverse tasks, and obtains significant improvements in both success rates and efficiency across four interactive benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of various commercial scenarios, there is an increasing number of studies on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) which trains the recommender system with the data from multiple scenarios, aiming to improve the recommendation performance on all these scenarios synchronously. However, due to the large discrepancy in the number of interactions among domains, multi-scenario recommendation models usually suffer from insufficient learning and negative transfer especially on the cold-start scenarios, thus exacerbating the data sparsity issue. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a novel diffusion model enhanced paradigm tailored for the cold-start problem in multi-scenario recommendation in a data-driven generative manner. Specifically, based on all-domain data, we leverage the diffusion model with our newly designed variance schedule and the proposed classifier, which explicitly boosts the recommendation performance on the cold-start scenarios by exploiting the generated high-quality and informative embedding, leveraging the abundance of rich scenarios. Our experiments on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate two strengths of the proposed paradigm: (i) its effectiveness with a significant increase of 8.5% and 1% in accuracy on the two datasets, and (ii) its compatibility with various multi-scenario backbone models. The implementation code is available for easy reproduction.",

            "abstract": "For better performance and less resource consumption, multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) is proposed to train a unified model to serve all scenarios by leveraging data from multiple scenarios. Current works in MSR focus on designing effective networks for better information transfer among different scenarios. However, they omit two important issues when applying MSR models in industrial situations. The first is the efficiency problem brought by mixed data, which delays the update of models and further leads to performance degradation. The second is that MSR models are insensitive to the changes of distribution over time, resulting in suboptimal effectiveness in the incoming data. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning approach for MSR (IncMSR), which can not only improve the training efficiency but also perceive changes in distribution over time. Specifically, we first quantify the pair-wise distance between representations from scenario, time and time-scenario dimensions respectively. Then, we decompose the MSR model into scenario-shared and scenario-specific parts and apply fine-grained constraints on the distances quantified with respect to the two different parts. Finally, all constraints are fused in an elegant way using a metric learning framework as a supplementary penalty term to the original MSR loss function. Offline experiments on two real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and compatibility of our proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "The sequential recommendation system has been widely studied for its promising effectiveness in capturing dynamic preferences buried in users' sequential behaviors. Despite the considerable achievements, existing methods usually focus on intra-sequence modeling while overlooking exploiting global collaborative information by inter-sequence modeling, resulting in inferior recommendation performance. Therefore, previous works attempt to tackle this problem with a global collaborative item graph constructed by pre-defined rules. However, these methods neglect two crucial properties when capturing global collaborative information, i.e., adaptiveness and personalization, yielding sub-optimal user representations. To this end, we propose a graph-driven framework, named Adaptive and Personalized Graph Learning for Sequential Recommendation (APGL4SR), that incorporates adaptive and personalized global collaborative information into sequential recommendation systems. Specifically, we first learn an adaptive global graph among all items and capture global collaborative information with it in a self-supervised fashion, whose computational burden can be further alleviated by the proposed SVD-based accelerator. Furthermore, based on the graph, we propose to extract and utilize personalized item correlations in the form of relative positional encoding, which is a highly compatible manner of personalizing the utilization of global collaborative information. Finally, the entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm, thus each part of APGL4SR can be mutually reinforced. As a generic framework, APGL4SR can not only outperform other baselines with significant margins, but also exhibit promising versatility, the ability to learn a meaningful global collaborative graph, and the ability to alleviate the dimensional collapse issue of item embeddings.",

            "abstract": "Huawei's vision and mission is to build a fully connected intelligent world. Since 2013, Huawei Noah's Ark Lab has helped many products build recommender systems and search engines for getting the right information to the right users. Every day, our recommender systems serve hundreds of millions of mobile phone users and recommend different kinds of content and services such as apps, news feeds, songs, videos, books, themes, and instant services. The big data and various scenarios provide us with great opportunities to develop advanced recommendation technologies. Furthermore, we have witnessed the technical trend of recommendation models in the past ten years, from the shallow and simple models like collaborative filtering, linear models, low rank models to deep and complex models like neural networks, pre-trained language models. Based on the mission, opportunities and technological trends, we have also met several hard problems in our recommender systems. In this talk, we will share ten important and interesting challenges and hope that the RecSys community can get inspired and create better recommender systems.",

            "title": "Customer Lifetime Value Prediction: Towards the Paradigm Shift of Recommender System Objectives",
            "abstract": "The ultimate goal of recommender systems is satisfying users\u2019 information needs in the long term. Despite the success of current recommendation techniques in targeting user interest, optimizing long-term user engagement and platform revenue is still challenging due to the restriction of optimization objectives such as clicks, ratings, and dwell time. Customer lifetime value (LTV) reflects the total monetary value of a customer to a business over the course of their relationship. Accurate LTV prediction can guide personalized service providers to optimize their marketing, sales, and service strategies to maximize customer retention, satisfaction, and profitability. However, the extreme sparsity, volatility, and randomness of consumption behaviors make LTV prediction rather intricate and challenging. In this tutorial, we give a detailed introduction to the key technologies and problems in LTV prediction. We present a systematic technique chronicle of LTV prediction over decades, including probabilistic models, traditional machine learning methods, and deep learning techniques. Based on this overview, we introduce several critical challenges in algorithm design, performance evaluation and system deployment from an industrial perspective, from which we derive potential directions for future exploration. From this tutorial, the RecSys community can gain a better understanding of the unique characteristics and challenges of LTV prediction, and it may serve as a catalyst to shift the focus of recommender systems from short-term targets to long-term ones.",

            "title": "Graph Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Goal-oriented Learning Path Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Goal-oriented Learning path recommendation aims to recommend learning items (concepts or exercises) step-by-step to a learner to promote the mastery level of her specific learning goals. By formulating this task as a Markov decision process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated great power. Although extensive research efforts have been made, previous methods still fail to recommend effective goal-oriented paths due to the under-utilizing of goals. Specifically, it is mainly reflected in two aspects: (1)The lack of goal planning. When learners have multiple goals with different difficulties, the previous methods can't fully utilize the difficulties and dependencies between goal learning items to plan the sequence of achieving these goals, making the path chaotic and inefficient; (2)The lack of efficiency in goal achieving. When pursuing a single goal, the path may contain learning items unrelated to the goal, which makes realizing a certain goal inefficient. To address these challenges, we present a novel Graph Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GEHRL) framework for goal-oriented learning path recommendation. The framework divides learning path recommendation into two parts: sub-goal selection(planning) and sub-goal achieving(learning item recommendation). Specifically, we employ a high-level agent as a sub-goal selector to select sub-goals for the low-level agent to achieve. The low-level agent in the framework is to recommend learning items to the learner. To make the path only contain goal-related learning items to improve the efficiency of achieving the goal, we develop a graph-based candidate selector to constrain the action space of the low-level agent based on the sub-goal and knowledge graph. We also develop test-based internal reward for low-level training so that the sparsity problem of external reward can be alleviated. Extensive experiments on three different simulators demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
