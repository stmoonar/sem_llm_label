            "abstract": "This paper proposes a template for documenting datasets that have been collected from online platforms for research purposes. The template should help to critically reflect on data quality and increase transparency in research fields that make use of online platform data. The paper describes our motivation, outlines the procedure for developing a specific documentation template that we refer to as TES-D (Total Error Sheets for Datasets) and has the current version of the template, guiding questions and a manual attached as supplementary material. The TES-D approach builds upon prior work in designing error frameworks for data from online platforms, namely the Total Error Framework for digital traces of human behavior on online platforms (TED-On, https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfab018).",

            "abstract": "Uncovering how inequality emerges from human interaction is imperative for just societies. Here we show that the way social groups interact in face-toface situations can enable the emergence of degree inequality. We present a mechanism that integrates group mixing dynamics with individual preferences, which reproduces group degree inequality found in six empirical data sets of face-to-face interactions. We uncover the impact of group-size imbalance on degree inequality, revealing a critical minority group size that changes social gatherings qualitatively. If the minority group is larger than this \u2018critical mass\u2019 size, it can be a well-connected, cohesive group; if it is smaller, minority cohesion widens degree inequality. Finally, we expose the underrepresentation of social groups in degree rankings due to mixing dynamics and propose a way to reduce such biases.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of two studies on how individuals interact with each other during a international, interdisciplinary scientific conference. We first show that contact activity is highly variable across the two conferences and between different socio-demographic groups. However, we found one consistent phenomenon: Professors connect and interact significantly less than the other participants. We interpret this effect as non-tenured researchers using conferences to accumulate social capital, while established researchers already have such capital. We then show that groups mix well during conferences, but note that a language-based homophily is always present. Finally, we show that the dynamics of the contacts across days is also similar between conferences. First day connections are established, then filtering occurs during the following days. The connection turnover between consecutive days proves to be large ( ), and related to the intensity of interactions.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we present a large-scale quantitative comparison between expert- and crowdsourced writing of history by analysing articles from the English Wikipedia and Britannica. In order to quantify attention to particular periods, we extract mentioned year numbers and utilise them to study historical timelines of nations stretched over the last thousand years. By combining this temporal analysis with lexical analysis of both encyclopedic corpora we can identify distinctive historiographic points of view in each encyclopedia. We find that Britannica focuses on social and cultural phenomena, e.g. religion, as well as the geographical characteristics of states, while Wikipedia puts emphasis on political aspects, concentrating on wars and violent conflicts, and events of high popularity. Finally, both encyclopedias exhibit characteristics of English Academic prose, with Britannica being slightly less readable compared to Wikipedia, according to several readability scores.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Portrayals of history are never complete, and each description inherently exhibits a specific viewpoint and emphasis. In this paper, we aim to automatically identify such differences by computing timelines and detecting temporal focal points of written history across languages on Wikipedia. In particular, we study articles related to the history of all UN member states and compare them in 30 language editions. We develop a computational approach that allows to identify focal points quantitatively, and find that Wikipedia narratives about national histories (i) are skewed towards more recent events (recency bias) and (ii) are distributed unevenly across the continents with significant focus on the history of European countries (Eurocentric bias). We also establish that national historical timelines vary across language editions, although average interlingual consensus is rather high. We hope that this paper provides a starting point for a broader computational analysis of written history on Wikipedia and elsewhere.\n \n",
