CLEF was a four-day hybrid event combining a conference and an evaluation forum. The conference featured keynotes by Benno Stein and Rita Cucchiara, and presentation of peer-reviewed research papers covering a wide range of topics, in addition to many posters. The evaluation forum consisted of fourteen labs: ARQMath, BioASQ, CheckThat!, ChEMU, eRisk, HIPE, iDPP, ImageCLEF, JokeR, LeQua, LifeCLEF, PAN, SimpleText, and Touch\u00e9, addressing a wide range of tasks, media, languages, and ways to go beyond standard test collections.

            "abstract": "Abstract We present and explore a real case in case in authorship attribution (A.A.) by combining the traditional philological approach with novel mathematical techniques. The problem involves the extensive productions of Basil of Caesarea and his brother Gregory of Nyssa, two influential 4th century Christian theologians, and the attribution of specific and discussed works in their corpora. Our novel method is based on two similarity (pseudo) distances, based, respectively, on the statistics of n-grams and on zip-like algorithms and on a new ranking/voting system that allows to infer the attribution from the values of distances between the unknown texts and the texts of the training corpus. The main results are on one hand the attribution of the letter with 97% of precision to one of the two authors and on the other the strong agreement of the numerical explorations with both the philological analysis and the so far known results for all the works in the two corpora.",

            "abstract": "We address the issue of generating texts in the style of an existing author, that also satisfy structural constraints imposed by the genre of the text. We focus on song lyrics, for which structural constraints are well-defined: rhyme and meter. Although Markov processes are known to be suitable for representing style, they are difficult to control in order to satisfy non-local properties, such as structural constraints, that require long distance modeling. We show that the framework of Constrained Markov Processes allows us to precisely generate texts that are consistent with a corpus, while being controllable in terms of rhymes and meter, a result that no other technique, to our knowledge, could achieve to date. Controlled Markov processes consist in reformulating Markov processes in the context of constraint satisfaction. We describe how to represent stylistic and structural properties in terms of constraints in this framework and we provide an evaluation of our method by comparing it to both pure Markov and pure constraint-based approaches. We show how this approach can be used for the semi-automatic generation of lyrics in the style of a popular author that has the same structure as an existing song.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of human interactions with social and natural phenomena is mirrored in the way we describe our experiences through natural language. In order to retain and convey such a high dimensional information, the statistical properties of our linguistic output has to be highly correlated in time. An example are the robust observations, still largely not understood, of correlations on arbitrary long scales in literary texts. In this paper we explain how long-range correlations flow from highly structured linguistic levels down to the building blocks of a text (words, letters, etc..). By combining calculations and data analysis we show that correlations take form of a bursty sequence of events once we approach the semantically relevant topics of the text. The mechanisms we identify are fairly general and can be equally applied to other hierarchical settings.",

            "abstract": "Feature generation has been proposed recently to generate feature sets automatically, as opposed to human-designed feature sets. This technique has shown promising results in many areas of supervised classification, in particular in the audio domain. However, feature generation is usually performed blindly, with genetic algorithms. As a result search performance is poor, thereby limiting its practical use. We propose a method to increase the search performance of feature generation systems. We focus on analytical features, i.e. features determined by their syntax. Our method consists in first extracting statistical properties of the feature space called spin patterns, by analogy with statistical physics. We show that spin patterns carry information about the topology of the feature space. We exploit these spin patterns to guide a simulated annealing algorithm specifically designed for feature generation. We evaluate our approach on three audio classification problems, and show that it increases performance by an order of magnitude. More generally this work is a first step in using tools from statistical physics for the supervised classification of complex audio signals.",
