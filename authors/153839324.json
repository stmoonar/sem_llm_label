            "abstract": "Deep neural networks have become the de facto choice as feature extraction engines, ubiquitously used for computer vision tasks. The current approach is to process every input with uniform resolution in a one-shot manner and make all of the predictions at once. However, human vision is an \u201cactive\u201d process that not only actively switches from one focus point to another within the visual field, but also applies spatially varying attention centered at such focus points. To bridge the gap, we propose incorporating the bio-plausible mechanisms of foveation and saccades to build an active object localization framework. While foveation enables it to process different regions of the input with variable degrees of detail, saccades allow it to change the focus point of such foveated regions. Our experiments show that these mechanisms improve the quality of predicted bounding boxes by capturing all the essential object parts while minimizing unnecessary background clutter. Additionally, they enable the resiliency of the method by allowing it to detect multiple objects while being trained only on data containing a single object per image. Finally, we explore the alignment of our method with human perception using the interesting \u201cduck-rabbit\u201d optical illusion.

            "abstract": "The ability of resource-constrained biological systems such as fruitflies to perform complex and high-speed maneuvers in cluttered environments has been one of the prime sources of inspiration for developing vision-based autonomous systems. To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.",

            "abstract": "Modern Byzantine Fault-Tolerant State Machine Replication (BFT-SMR) solutions focus on reducing communication complexity, improving throughput, or lowering latency. This work explores the energy efficiency of BFT-SMR protocols. First, we propose a novel SMR protocol that optimizes for the steady state, i.e., when the leader is correct. This is done by reducing the number of required signatures per consensus unit and the communication complexity by order of the number of nodes n compared to the state-of-the-art BFT-SMR solutions. Concretely, we employ the idea that a quorum (collection) of signatures on a proposed value is avoidable during the failure-free runs. Second, we model and analyze the energy efficiency of protocols and argue why the steady-state needs to be optimized. Third, we present an application in the cyber-physical system (CPS) setting, where we consider a partially connected system by optionally leveraging wireless multicasts among neighbors. We analytically determine the parameter ranges for when our proposed protocol offers better energy efficiency than communicating with a baseline protocol utilizing an external trusted node. We present a hypergraph-based network model and generalize previous fault tolerance results to the model. Finally, we demonstrate our approach's practicality by analyzing our protocol's energy efficiency through experiments on a CPS test bed. In particular, we observe as high as 64% energy savings when compared to the state-of-the-art SMR solution for n = 10 settings using BLE.",

Spiking neural networks that \u201cmimic\u201d certain functionalities of the biological neural networks in the brain is a promising avenue for solving sequential learning problems with high computational efficiency. Nonetheless, training such networks still remains a challenging task as conventional learning rules are not directly applicable to these bio-inspired neural networks. Recent efforts have focused on novel training paradigms that allow spiking neural networks to learn temporal correlations between inputs and solve sequential tasks such as audio or video processing. Such success has fueled the development of event-driven neuromorphic hardware that is specifically optimized for energy-efficient implementation of spiking neural networks.

            "abstract": "Vision-based autonomous navigation systems rely on fast and accurate object detection algorithms to avoid obstacles. Algorithms and sensors designed for such systems need to be computationally efficient, due to the limited energy of the hardware used for deployment. Biologically inspired event cameras are a good candidate as a vision sensor for such systems due to their speed, energy efficiency, and robustness to varying lighting conditions. However, traditional computer vision algorithms fail to work on event-based outputs, as they lack photometric features such as light intensity and texture. In this work, we propose a novel technique that utilizes the temporal information inherently present in the events to efficiently detect moving objects. Our technique consists of a lightweight spiking neural architecture that is able to separate events based on the speed of the corresponding objects. These separated events are then further grouped spatially to determine object boundaries. This method of object detection is both asynchronous and robust to camera noise. In addition, it shows good performance in scenarios with events generated by static objects in the background, where existing event-based algorithms fail. We show that by utilizing our architecture, autonomous navigation systems can have minimal latency and energy overheads for performing object detection.",

            "title": "TOFU: Toward Obfuscated Federated Updates by Encoding Weight Updates Into Gradients From Proxy Data",
            "abstract": "Advances in Federated Learning and an abundance of user data have enabled rich collaborative learning between multiple clients, without sharing user data. This is done via a central server that aggregates learning in the form of weight updates. However, this comes at the cost of repeated expensive communication between the clients and the server, and concerns about compromised user privacy. The inversion of gradients into the data that generated them is termed data leakage. Encryption techniques can be used to counter this leakage but at added expense. To address these challenges of communication efficiency and privacy, we propose TOFU, a novel algorithm that generates proxy data that encodes the weight updates for each client in its gradients. Instead of weight updates, this proxy data is now shared. Since input data is far lower in dimensional complexity than weights, this encoding allows us to send much lesser data per communication round. Additionally, the proxy data resembles noise and even perfect reconstruction from data leakage attacks would invert the decoded gradients into unrecognizable noise, enhancing privacy. We show that TOFU enables learning with less than 1% and 7% accuracy drops on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. This drop can be recovered via a few rounds of expensive encrypted gradient exchange. This enables us to learn to near-full accuracy in a federated setup, while being $4\\times $ and $6.6\\times $ more communication efficient than the standard Federated Averaging algorithm on MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively.",

This paper presents a design for a Reversible Radix-4 Booth Multiplier that is optimized in Garbage Cost and Ancillary inputs. The design proposed is capable of both signed and unsigned multiplication. The optimization in Garbage Cost ensures lower heat dissipation. The Encoded Booth Algorithm or Radix-4 Booth Algorithm reduces the number of partial products generated in signed multiplication to half the number generated using a Radix-2 signed multiplier making it suitable for Digital Signal Processors.
