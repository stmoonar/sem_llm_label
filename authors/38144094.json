            "abstract": "Video Language Grounding is one of the most challenging cross-modal video understanding tasks. This task aims to localize a target moment semantically corresponding to a given language query in an untrimmed video. Many existing VLG methods rely on the proposal-based framework, despite the dominant performance achieved, they usually focus on interacting a few internal frames with the query to score segment proposals, trapping in the long-range dependencies when the proposal feature is limited. Meanwhile, adjacent proposals share similar visual semantics, making VLG models hard to align the accurate semantics of video-query contents and degenerating the ranking performance. To remedy the above limitations, we propose VLG-CRF by introducing the conditional random fields (CRFs) to handle the discrete yet indistinguishable proposals. Specifically, VLG-CRF consists of two cascade CRF-based modules. The AttentiveCRFs is developed for multi-modal feature fusion to better integrate temporal and semantic relation between modalities. We also devise a new variant of ConvCRFs to capture the relation of discrete segments and rectify the predicting scores to make relatively high prediction scores clustered in a range. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Caption, and TACoS, show the superiority of our method and the state-of-the-art performance is achieved.",

            "abstract": "An adaptive interpretable ensemble model based on a 3-D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) and genetic algorithm (GA), i.e., 3DCNN+EL+GA, was proposed to differentiate the subjects with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and also identify the discriminative brain regions significantly contributing to the classifications in a data-driven way. The testing results on the datasets from both the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) indicated that 3DCNN+EL+GA outperformed other state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. More importantly, in these identified brain regions, the discriminative brain subregions at a voxel level were further located with a gradient-based attribution method designed for CNN and illustrated intuitively. Besides these, the behavioral domains corresponding to every identified discriminative brain region (e.g., the rostral hippocampus) were analyzed. It was shown that the resultant behavioral domains were consistent with those brain functions (e.g., emotion) impaired early in the AD process. Further research is needed to examine the generalizability of the proposed ideas and methods in identifying discriminative brain regions and subregions for the diagnosis of other brain disorders (especially little-known ones), such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy, severe depression, autism, Huntington\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, using neuroimaging.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the fair-effective communication and robustness in imperfect and energy-constrained underwater acoustic sensor networks (IC-UASNs). Specifically, we investigate the impact of unexpected node malfunctions on the network performance under the time-varying acoustic channels. Each node is expected to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. However, achieving individual QoS requirements may interfere with other concurrent communications. Underwater nodes rely excessively on the rationality of other underwater nodes when guided by fully cooperative approaches, making it difficult to seek a trade-off between individual QoS and global fair-effective communications under imperfect conditions. Therefore, this paper presents a SEmi-COoperative Power Allocation approach (SECOPA) that achieves fair-effective communication and robustness in IC-UASNs. The approach is distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and the objectives are twofold. On the one hand, each intelligent node individually decides the transmission power to simultaneously optimize individual and global performance. On the other hand, advanced training algorithms are developed to provide imperfect environments for training robust models that can adapt to the time-varying acoustic channels and handle unexpected node failures in the network. Numerical results are presented to validate our proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "EEG emotion recognition plays a significant role in various mental health services. Deep learning-based methods perform excellently, but still suffer from interpretability. Although methods such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM) can cope with the above problem, their coarse granularity cannot accurately reveal the mechanism to promote emotional intelligence. In this paper, fine-grained interpretability is proposed, called Concat-aided Grad-CAM. Specifically, the multi-level feature mapping before the fully connected layer is concatenated to obtain the gradients of the target concept so that the discriminant information can be directly located in the high-precision area. Unlike coarse-grained interpretability methods applied in EEG emotion recognition, it can accurately highlight the EEG channels related to emotion rather than an obscure area. In addition, a systematic brain functional network is proposed to reveal the relationship between those channels and to further improve emotion recognition performance. The channels with greater contributions are connected, and those connections are learned by dynamic graph convolutional networks, while the others are independent to eliminate interference. Experiments on four EEG emotion recognition datasets manifest that Concat-aided Grad-CAM can be interpreted by the fine-grained. In addition, it has been shown that the learned brain functional network can improve the performance of the baselines. Significantly, the experiment results achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple experiments.",

However, in many realistic problems, more information is either revealed or can be computed during some point of the learning process. Motivated by diverse applications ranging from robotics to data center scheduling, we formulate a Hindsight Observable Markov Decision Process (HOMDP) as a POMDP where the latent states are revealed to the learner in hindsight and only during training. We introduce new algorithms for the tabular and function approximation settings that are provably sample-efficient with hindsight observability, even in POMDPs that would otherwise be statistically intractable. We give a lower bound showing that the tabular algorithm is optimal in its dependence on latent state and observation cardinalities.",

            "abstract": "Autonomous exploration is a widely studied fundamental application in the field of quadrotor, which requires them to automatically explore unknown space to obtain complete information about the environment. The frontier-based method, one of the representative works on autonomous exploration, drives autonomous determination by the definition of frontier information so that complete information about the environment is available to the quadrotor. However, existing frontier-based methods are able to accomplish the task but still suffer from inefficient exploration, and how to improve the efficiency of autonomous exploration is the focus of research nowadays. Slow frontier generation affecting real-time viewpoint determination and insufficient determination methods affecting the quality of viewpoints are typical of these problems. Therefore, to overcome the aforementioned problems, this article proposes a two-level viewpoint determination method for frontier-based autonomous exploration. First, a sampling-based frontier detection method is presented for faster frontier generation, improving the immediacy of environmental representation compared to traditional traversal-based methods. Second, the access to environmental information during flight is considered for the first time, and an innovative heuristic evaluation function is designed to decide on high-quality viewpoint as the next local navigation target in each exploration iteration. Extensive benchmark and real-world tests are conducted to validate our method. The results confirm that our method optimizes the frontier search time by 85%, the exploration time by around 20%\u201330%, and the exploration path by 25%\u201335%.",

Despite extensive prior research on in-memory KV stores, little focus has been given to memory usage reduction via block data compression (e.g., LZ4, ZSTD) due to potential performance degradation. This paper introduces design techniques to mitigate compression-induced performance degradation by utilizing decompression streaming, latency differences between compression and decompression, and data access locality in real-world workloads. These techniques can be incorporated into conventional hash or B+-tree indexing structures, enabling integration with most in-memory KV stores without altering their core indexing data structures. For demonstration, we implemented ZipKV that incorporates the developed design techniques. Compared with RocksDB\u2004(in-memory mode) that employs the log-structured merge tree indexing data structure with natural support of block data compression, ZipKV realizes similar memory usage reduction via block data compression, reduces the point query latency by 68%\u2004(LZ4) and 58%\u2004(ZSTD), and achieves up to 3.8\u00d7\u2004(LZ4) and 2.7\u00d7\u2004(ZSTD) point query throughput.",

In this study, we present a theoretically optimal solution for addressing both coreset selection and active learning within the context of linear softmax regression. Our proposed method, COPS (unCertainty based OPtimal Sub-sampling), is designed to minimize the expected loss of a model trained on subsampled data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on explicit calculations of the inverse covariance matrix, which are not easily applicable to deep learning scenarios, COPS leverages the model's logits to estimate the sampling ratio. This sampling ratio is closely associated with model uncertainty and can be effectively applied to deep learning tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenge of model sensitivity to misspecification by incorporating a down-weighting approach for low-density samples, drawing inspiration from previous works. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted extensive empirical experiments using deep neural networks on benchmark datasets. The results consistently showcase the superior performance of COPS compared to baseline methods, reaffirming its efficacy.",

            "abstract": "Conventionally, the sensing and communication stages for edge intelligence systems are executed sequentially, leading to an excessive time of dataset generation and uploading. To combat the weakness, this paper proposes to accelerate edge intelligence via integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where the sensing and communication stages are merged to make the best use of the wireless signals for the dual purpose of dataset generation and uploading. For the proposed ISAC-accelerated edge intelligence system, the resource allocation and beamforming should be jointly optimized to exploit the underlying ISAC benefits. We formulate a joint resource allocation and beamforming optimization problem. Despite the non-convexity, we obtain globally optimal solutions assuming that the constant maximal transmits power, and devise an alternating optimization algorithm for the original problem without such assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the ISAC acceleration gain of the proposed system over that of the conventional edge intelligence system. Both theoretic analysis and simulation results show that ISAC accelerates the conventional edge intelligence system when the duration of generating a sample is more than that of uploading a sample. Otherwise, the ISAC acceleration gain vanishes or even is negative. In this case, we derive a sufficient condition for positive ISAC acceleration gain.",
