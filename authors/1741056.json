            "title": "Beyond Single-Model Views for Deep Learning: Optimization versus Generalizability of Stochastic Optimization Algorithms",
            "abstract": "Despite an extensive body of literature on deep learning optimization, our current understanding of what makes an optimization algorithm effective is fragmented. In particular, we do not understand well whether enhanced optimization translates to improved generalizability. Current research overlooks the inherent stochastic nature of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, resulting in a lack of comprehensive benchmarking and insight into their statistical performance. This paper aims to address this gap by adopting a novel approach. Rather than solely evaluating the endpoint of individual optimization trajectories, we draw from an ensemble of trajectories to estimate the stationary distribution of stochastic optimizers. Our investigation encompasses a wide array of techniques, including SGD and its variants, flat-minima optimizers, and new algorithms we propose under the Basin Hopping framework. Through our evaluation, which encompasses synthetic functions with known minima and real-world problems in computer vision and natural language processing, we emphasize fair benchmarking under a statistical framework, comparing stationary distributions and establishing statistical significance. Our study uncovers several key findings regarding the relationship between training loss and hold-out accuracy, as well as the comparable performance of SGD, noise-enabled variants, and novel optimizers utilizing the BH framework. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate performance on par with flat-minima optimizers like SAM, albeit with half the gradient evaluations. We anticipate that our work will catalyze further exploration in deep learning optimization, encouraging a shift away from single-model approaches towards methodologies that acknowledge and leverage the stochastic nature of optimizers.",

            "abstract": "Traffic speed forecasting is an important task in intelligent transportation system management. The objective of much of the current computational research is to minimize the difference between predicted and actual speeds, but information modalities other than speed priors are largely not taken into account. In particular, though state of the art performance is achieved on speed forecasting with graph neural network methods, these methods do not incorporate information on roadway maintenance work zones and their impacts on predicted traffic flows; yet, the impacts of construction work zones are of significant interest to roadway management agencies, because they translate to impacts on the local economy and public well-being. In this paper, we build over the convolutional graph neural network architecture and present a novel ``Graph Convolutional Network for Roadway Work Zones\"model that includes a novel data fusion mechanism and a new heterogeneous graph aggregation methodology to accommodate work zone information in spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. The model is evaluated on two data sets that capture traffic flows in the presence of work zones in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Extensive comparative evaluation and ablation studies show that the proposed model can capture complex and nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships across a transportation corridor, outperforming baseline models, particularly when predicting traffic flow during a workzone event.",

            "abstract": "Protein language models based on the transformer architecture are increasingly shown to learn rich representations from protein sequences that improve performance on a variety of downstream protein prediction tasks. These tasks encompass a wide range of predictions, including prediction of secondary structure, subcellular localization, evolutionary relationships within protein families, as well as superfamily and family membership. There is recent evidence that such models also implicitly learn structural information. In this paper we put this to the test on a hallmark problem in computational biology, remote homology prediction. We employ a rigorous setting, where, by lowering sequence identity, we clarify whether the problem of remote homology prediction has been solved. Among various interesting findings, we report that current state-of-the-art, large models are still underperforming in the \"twilight zone\" of very low sequence identity.",

The functions of the various players by themselves and in relation to each other in cancer pathology are just beginning to be revealed. Exogenous ligands binding outside of the ligand binding pocket in the ligand binding domain are of interest because they have potential to bind generically to all receptors, resulting in cross-target effects or therapeutic potential. We study the binding of five such ligands in order to ascertain the potential for such effects. In particular, we propose a contact and energy-based approach to understanding ligand binding in steroid nuclear receptors. We also extend the knowledge of a hydrophobic binding cleft as a potential target for therapeutics. Finally, we characterize the predicted binding modes of five drug-like molecules across five steroid nuclear receptors.",

This dynamics results in transient openings in the double helix and is referred to as \"DNA breathing\" or \"DNA bubbles\". The propensity to form local transient openings is important in a wide range of biological processes, such as transcription, replication, and transcription factors binding. However, the modeling and computer simulation of these phenomena, have remained a challenge due to the complex interplay of numerous factors, such as, temperature, salt content, DNA sequence, hydrogen bonding, base stacking, and others.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present pyDNA-EPBD, a parallel software implementation of the Extended Peyrard-Bishop- Dauxois (EPBD) nonlinear DNA model that allows us to describe some features of DNA dynamics in detail. The pyDNA-EPBD generates genomic scale profiles of average base-pair openings, base flipping probability, DNA bubble probability, and calculations of the characteristically dynamic length indicating the number of base pairs statistically significantly affected by a single point mutation using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\npyDNA-EPBD is supported across most operating systems and is freely available at https://github.com/lanl/pyDNA_EPBD.

            "abstract": "Building on the transformer architecture and its revolutionizing of language models for natural language processing, protein language models (PLMs) are now emerging as a powerful tool for learning over large numbers of sequences in protein sequence databases and linking protein sequence to function. PLMs are shown to learn useful, task-agnostic sequence representations that allow predicting protein secondary structure, protein subcellular localization, and evolutionary relationships within protein families. However, existing models are strictly trained over protein sequences and miss an opportunity to leverage and integrate the information present in heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, inspired by the intrinsic role of three-dimensional/tertiary protein structure in determining a broad range of protein properties, we propose a PLM that integrates and attends to both protein sequence and tertiary structure. In particular, this paper posits that learning joint sequence-structure representations yields better representations for function-related prediction tasks. A detailed experimental evaluation shows that such joint sequence-structure representations are more powerful than sequence-based representations, yield better performance on superfamily membership across various metrics, and capture interesting relationships in the PLM-learned embedding space.",

            "abstract": "Designing molecules with desired biological properties remains an outstanding challenge both in the wet and dry laboratories. Meeting this challenge promises great translational impacts across drug discovery, material sciences, biotechnology, and more. Recent momentum in deep learning promises to advance our computational capabilities on molecule generation. In particular, deep graph generative models which treat molecule design as a graph generation problem are allowing us to directly learn from existing databases of small molecules and generate novel, valid molecules. Currently, these models have many shortcomings, including poor controllability of desired molecular properties, especially in practical application where the training data is usually small, noisy, and incomplete. This paper focuses on equipping graph variational autoencoders with the ability to control for desired properties and its practical application in a practical application which is the generation of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QAC). Several controllable graph generation mechanisms are investigated for their effectiveness. A general framework is then proposed to extend these mechanisms by our newly proposed objective function to handle the challenges in practical applications where the property value annotations are usually censored and not fully available in all training samples. The experimental evaluation considers an experimentally-characterized dataset of antimicrobial small molecules with wet-lab characterized activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models and control of desired properties.",

            "abstract": "Detecting anomalies over real-world datasets remains a challenging task. Data annotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential datasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result, data collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or contain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of anomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with incomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the notion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL provides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world datasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we propose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this framework based on different design decisions for key components of the framework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture different physical processes along different modalities. The experimental evaluation draws out several obser-vations. The MIL-based formulation performs no worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and outperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets. Altogether, the results show that the framework generalizes well over diverse datasets resulting from different real-world application domains.",

            "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nExpanding our knowledge of small molecules beyond what is known in nature or designed in wet laboratories promises to significantly advance cheminformatics, drug discovery, biotechnology, and material science. In-silico molecular design remains challenging, primarily due to the complexity of the chemical space and the non-trivial relationship between chemical structures and biological properties. Deep generative models that learn directly from data are intriguing, but they have yet to demonstrate interpretability in the learned representation, so we can learn more about the relationship between the chemical and biological space. In this paper, we advance research on disentangled representation learning for small molecule generation. We build on recent work by us and others on deep graph generative frameworks, which capture atomic interactions via a graph-based representation of a small molecule. The methodological novelty is how we leverage the concept of disentanglement in the graph variational autoencoder framework both to generate biologically-relevant small molecules and to enhance model interpretability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluation in comparison with state of the art models demonstrate the superiority of our disentanglement framework. We believe this work is an important step to address key challenges in small molecule generation with deep generative frameworks.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nTraining and generated data are made available at https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/dataset-disentangled-representation-learning-interpretable-molecule-generation.
