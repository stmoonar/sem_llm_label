            "title": "Alleviating Matthew Effect of Offline Reinforcement Learning in Interactive Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), a technology that offline learns a policy from logged data without the need to interact with online environments, has become a favorable choice in decision-making processes like interactive recommendation. Offline RL faces the value overestimation problem. To address it, existing methods employ conservatism, e.g., by constraining the learned policy to be close to behavior policies or punishing the rarely visited state-action pairs. However, when applying such offline RL to recommendation, it will cause a severe Matthew effect, i.e., the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, by promoting popular items or categories while suppressing the less popular ones. It is a notorious issue that needs to be addressed in practical recommender systems. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the Matthew effect in offline RL-based recommendation. Through theoretical analyses, we find that the conservatism of existing methods fails in pursuing users' long-term satisfaction. It inspires us to add a penalty term to relax the pessimism on states with high entropy of the logging policy and indirectly penalizes actions leading to less diverse states. This leads to the main technical contribution of the work: Debiased model-based Offline RL (DORL) method. Experiments show that DORL not only captures user interests well but also alleviates the Matthew effect. The implementation is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/DORL-codes",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.",

            "abstract": "Negative sampling has been heavily used to train recommender models on large-scale data, wherein sampling hard examples usually not only accelerates the convergence but also improves the model accuracy. Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of Hard Negative Sampling (HNS) have not been revealed yet. In this work, we fill the research gap by conducting thorough theoretical analyses on HNS. Firstly, we prove that employing HNS on the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) learner is equivalent to optimizing One-way Partial AUC (OPAUC). Concretely, the BPR equipped with Dynamic Negative Sampling (DNS) is an exact estimator, while with softmax-based sampling is a soft estimator. Secondly, we prove that OPAUC has a stronger connection with Top-K evaluation metrics than AUC and verify it with simulation experiments. These analyses establish the theoretical foundation of HNS in optimizing Top-K recommendation performance for the first time. On these bases, we offer two insightful guidelines for effective usage of HNS: 1) the sampling hardness should be controllable, e.g., via pre-defined hyper-parameters, to adapt to different Top-K metrics and datasets; 2) the smaller the K we emphasize in Top-K evaluation metrics, the harder the negative samples we should draw. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks verify the two guidelines.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) effectively address information asymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn interactions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences, i.e., users have a firm belief about the fine-grained preference for one or multiple target items. Under this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and treat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and reduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering. However, in reality, users\u2019 preferences are often vague and volatile, with uncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions.

            "abstract": "In recent years, recommender systems have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, while they suffer from a high risk of being attacked due to the growing commercial and social values. Despite significant research progress in recommender attack and defense, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmarking standard in the field, leading to unfair performance comparison and limited credibility of experiments. To address this, we propose RecAD, a unified library aiming at establishing an open benchmark for recommender attack and defense. RecAD takes an initial step to set up a unified benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research by integrating diverse datasets, standard source codes, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, attack knowledge, attack budget, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed to be comprehensive and sustainable, covering both attack, defense, and evaluation tasks, enabling more researchers to easily follow and contribute to this promising field. RecAD will drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems attack and defense, reduce the redundant efforts of researchers, and ultimately increase the credibility and practical value of recommender attack and defense.

            "abstract": "While personalization increases the utility of recommender systems, it also brings the issue of filter bubbles. e.g., if the system keeps exposing and recommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the user feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in static recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In contrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive recommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to leverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user satisfaction. To achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender system (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with causal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on historical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user satisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning of the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an authentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user rating dataset. The experiments show the effectiveness of CIRS in bursting filter bubbles and achieving long-term success in interactive recommendation. The implementation of CIRS is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/ CIRS-codes.",

            "title": "Who are the Best Adopters? User Selection Model for Free Trial Item Promotion",
            "abstract": "With the increasingly fierce market competition, the free trial has been widely applied as an effective incentive strategy to attract users and promote products. By providing opportunities to experience goods without charge, a free trial offers adopters more direct contact with the products and thus raises their willingness to buy. However, as the key point in the promotion process, how to select proper adopters is rarely explored. Empirically winnowing users by their static demographic attributes is feasible but less effective due to the lack of consideration of personalized demands. In this work, we propose SMILE \u2013 a tailored free trial user selection model for finding the best adopters promptly. Based on the reinforcement learning (RL) technique, SMILE can consider long-run profits and rely on user-item interactions to suggest actions. Besides, since selecting adopters from the large user candidates set is time-consuming, we design a balanced tree structure that reformulates the user action space. The experimental analysis on three datasets demonstrates the proposed model's superiority and elucidates why reinforcement learning and tree structure can improve performance. Our study shows technical feasibility of constructing a more robust and intelligent user selection model and guides for investigating more marketing promotion strategies.",

            "abstract": "The progress of recommender systems is hampered mainly by evaluation as it requires real-time interactions between humans and systems, which is too laborious and expensive. This issue is usually approached by utilizing the interaction history to conduct offline evaluation. However, existing datasets of user-item interactions are partially observed, leaving it unclear how and to what extent the missing interactions will influence the evaluation. To answer this question, we collect a fully-observed dataset from Kuaishou's online environment, where almost all 1,411 users have been exposed to all 3,327 items. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world fully-observed data with millions of user-item interactions. With this unique dataset, we conduct a preliminary analysis of how the two factors - data density and exposure bias - affect the evaluation results of multi-round conversational recommendation. Our main discoveries are that the performance ranking of different methods varies with the two factors, and this effect can only be alleviated in certain cases by estimating missing interactions for user simulation. This demonstrates the necessity of the fully-observed dataset. We release the dataset and the pipeline implementation for evaluation at https://kuairec.com",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems deployed in real-world applications can have inherent exposure bias, which leads to the biased logged data plaguing the researchers. A fundamental way to address this thorny problem is to collect users' interactions on randomly expose items, i.e., the missing-at-random data. A few works have asked certain users to rate or select randomly recommended items, e.g., Yahoo!, Coat, and OpenBandit. However, these datasets are either too small in size or lack key information, such as unique user ID or the features of users/items. In this work, we present KuaiRand, an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset containing millions of intervened interactions on randomly exposed videos, collected from the video-sharing mobile App, Kuaishou. Different from existing datasets, KuaiRand records 12 kinds of user feedback signals (e.g., click, like, and view time) on randomly exposed videos inserted in the recommendation feeds in two weeks. To facilitate model learning, we further collect rich features of users and items as well as users' behavior history. By releasing this dataset, we enable the research of advanced debiasing large-scale recommendation scenarios for the first time. Also, with its distinctive features, KuaiRand can support various other research directions such as interactive recommendation, long sequential behavior modeling, and multi-task learning. The dataset is available at https://kuairand.com.",
