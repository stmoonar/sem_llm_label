            "abstract": "Check-worthiness detection is a crucial aspect of the fact-checking pipeline. It aids fact-checkers and journalists by highlighting the claims that necessitate verification. This is especially pertinent in today\u2019s era of social media and varied news channels, where numerous actors voice claims on a range of current affairs topics, including political matters, global warming, and the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, during political events, politicians debate their political agendas and make numerous claims on various subjects. These claims, which often lack factual basis, come in all forms. While some of these claims are important, others are not. Given the time-intensive nature of manual fact-checking, the identification of claims worthy of fact-checking becomes critical. Over the years, there have been research efforts aimed at the automatic detection of such claims. To further this research, in past years, CheckThat! Lab has offered check-worthiness detection tasks on political debates and textual modality social media content. For the first time, CheckThat! Lab offered the task for multimodal content. This study reports our participation in subtask-1A, which consists of Arabic and English. For our experiments, we utilized transformer-based models for both unimodal and multimodal models. The performances of the submitted systems, evaluated using the F1-score on the positive class, were 0 . 671 and 0 . 300 , respectively. Our systems did not rank on the leaderboard as we made late submissions. However, with additional experiments, we achieved 0 . 684 and 0 . 362 for English and Arabic, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Misinformation spreading in mainstream and social media has been misleading users in different ways. Manual detection and verification efforts by journalists and fact-checkers can no longer cope with the great scale and quick spread of misleading information. This motivated research and industry efforts to develop systems for analyzing and verifying news spreading online. The SemEval-2023 Task 3 is an attempt to address several subtasks under this overarching problem, targeting writing techniques used in news articles to affect readers\u2019 opinions. The task addressed three subtasks with six languages, in addition to three \u201csurprise\u201d test languages, resulting in 27 different test setups. This paper describes our participating system to this task. Our team is one of the 6 teams that successfully submitted runs for all setups. The official results show that our system is ranked among the top 3 systems for 10 out of the 27 setups.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges for developing automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages is the limited access to labeled data with domain-specific variations. In this study, we propose a pseudo-labeling approach to develop a large-scale domain-agnostic ASR dataset. With the proposed methodology, we developed a 20k+ hours labeled Bangla speech dataset covering diverse topics, speaking styles, dialects, noisy environments, and conversational scenarios. We then exploited the developed corpus to design a conformer-based ASR system. We benchmarked the trained ASR with publicly available datasets and compared it with other available models. To investigate the efficacy, we designed and developed a human-annotated domain-agnostic test set composed of news, telephony, and conversational data among others. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the model trained on psuedo-label data for the designed test-set along with publicly-available Bangla datasets. The experimental resources will be publicly available.https://github.com/hishab-nlp/Pseudo-Labeling-for-Domain-Agnostic-Bangla-ASR",

Five state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been employed for implementing the system.

Two model quantization techniques such as float16 and dynamic range quantization have been applied to the five state-of-the-art CNN architectures. The study shows that the quantized GoogleNet model achieved the size of 0.143 MB with an accuracy of 97%, which is the best candidate model considering the size criterion. The EfficientNet model achieved the size of 4.2MB with an accuracy of 99%, which is the best model considering the performance criterion.

            "abstract": ": Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) plays an important role to understand the interactions and dependencies of genes in different conditions from gene expression data. An information theoretic GRN method first computes dependency matrix from the given gene expression dataset using an entropy estimator and then infer network using individual inference method. A number of prominent methods use Mutual Information (MI) and its variants for dependency measure because MI is an efficient approach to detect nonlinear dependencies. But MI does not work well for continuous multivariate variables. In this paper, we have investigated the recently proposed association detector method Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), instead of MI, in inferring GRN. It is reported that MIC can detect effectively most forms of statistical dependence between pairs of variables. We have integrated MIC with two prominent MI based GRN inference methods Minimal Redundancy Network and Context Likelihood of Relatedness. The experimental studies on DREAM3 Yeast data, SynTReN generated synthetic data and SOS E. Coli real gene expression data revealed that inferred network with MIC based proposed methods outperformed their counter MI based standard methods in most of the cases, especially for large sized problem.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we have investigated the recently proposed association detector method Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) instead of Mutual Information (MI) in inferring Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). GRN plays an important role to understand the interactions and dependencies of genes in different conditions from gene expression data. An information theoretic GRN method first computes dependency matrix from the given gene expression dataset using an entropy estimator and then infer network using individual inference method. A number of prominent methods use MI because it is an efficient approach to detect nonlinear dependencies. But MI does not work well for continuous multivariate variables. In this paper, MIC incorporated into the prominent MI based GRN method Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) and proposed CLR-MIC. To understand the effectiveness of MIC in GRN inference, SynTReN generated synthetic data and SOS E. Coli real gene expression data were considered. The experimental results revealed that proposed CLR-MIC outperformed its counter standard CLR and identified the proficiency of MIC in GRN inference.",
