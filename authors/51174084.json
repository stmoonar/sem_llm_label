            "abstract": "\n Deeplearning algorithms are revolutionising many aspects of modern life. Typically, they are implemented in CMOS-based hardware with severely limited memory access times and inefficient data-routing. All-optical neural networks without any electro-optic conversions could alleviate these shortcomings. However, an all-optical nonlinear activation function, which is a vital building block for optical neural networks, needs to be developed efficiently on-chip. Here, we introduce and demonstrate both optical synapse weighting and all-optical nonlinear thresholding using two different effects in one single chalcogenide material. We show how the structural phase transitions in a wide-bandgap phase-change material enables storing the neural network weights via non-volatile photonic memory, whilst resonant bond destabilisation is used as a nonlinear activation threshold without changing the material. These two different transitions within chalcogenides enable programmable neural networks with near-zero static power consumption once trained, in addition to picosecond delays performing inference tasks not limited by wire charging that limit electrical circuits; for instance, we show that nanosecond-order weight programming and near-instantaneous weight updates enable accurate inference tasks within 20 picoseconds in a 3-layer all-optical neural network. Optical neural networks that bypass electro-optic conversion altogether hold promise for network-edge machine learning applications where decision-making in real-time are critical, such as for autonomous vehicles or navigation systems such as signal pre-processing of LIDAR systems.",

            "abstract": "Machine-intelligence has become a driving factor in modern society. However, its demand outpaces the underlying electronic technology due to limitations given by fundamental physics such as capacitive charging of wires, but also by system architecture of storing and handling data, both driving recent trends towards processor heterogeneity. Here we introduce a novel amplitude-only Fourier-optical processor paradigm capable of processing large-scale ~(1,000 x 1,000) matrices in a single time-step and 100 microsecond-short latency. Conceptually, the information-flow direction is orthogonal to the two-dimensional programmable-network, which leverages 10^6-parallel channels of display technology, and enables a prototype demonstration performing convolutions as pixel-wise multiplications in the Fourier domain reaching peta operations per second throughputs. The required real-to-Fourier domain transformations are performed passively by optical lenses at zero-static power. We exemplary realize a convolutional neural network (CNN) performing classification tasks on 2-Megapixel large matrices at 10 kHz rates, which latency-outperforms current GPU and phase-based display technology by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. Training this optical convolutional layer on image classification tasks and utilizing it in a hybrid optical-electronic CNN, shows classification accuracy of 98% (MNIST) and 54% (CIFAR-10). Interestingly, the amplitude-only CNN is inherently robust against coherence noise in contrast to phase-based paradigms and features an over 2 orders of magnitude lower delay than liquid crystal-based systems. Beyond contributing to novel accelerator technology, scientifically this amplitude-only massively-parallel optical compute-paradigm can be far-reaching as it de-validates the assumption that phase-information outweighs amplitude in optical processors for machine-intelligence.",

Integrated photonic circuits can straightforwardly perform vector-matrix multiplicationswith high efficiency and low power consumption by using weighting mechanism through linear optics. Although,this can not be said for the activation function which requires either nonlinear optics or an electro-optic module withan appropriate dynamic range. Even though all-optical nonlinear optics is potentially faster, its current integrationis challenging and is rather inefficient. Here we demonstrate an electro-absorption modulator based on an IndiumTin Oxide layer, whose dynamic range is used as nonlinear activation function of a photonic neuron. The nonlinearactivation mechanism is based on a photodiode, which integrates the weighed products, and whose photovoltage drivesthe elecro-absorption modulator. The synapse and neuron circuit is then constructed to execute a 200-node MNISTclassification neural network used for benchmarking the nonlinear activation function and compared with an equivalentelectronic module.",

Since photonic systems are capable of high data throughput and low latency, an increasingly found system limitation stems from the required domain-crossing such as digital-to-analog, and electronic-to-optical. A photonic DAC implementation, in contrast, enables a seamless signal conversion with respect to both energy efficiency and short signal delay, often require bulky discrete optical components and electric-optic transformation hence introducing inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a novel coherent parallel photonic DAC concept along with an experimental demonstration capable of performing this digital-to-analog conversion without optic-electric-optic domain crossing. This design hence guarantees a linear intensity weighting among bits operating at high sampling rates, yet at a reduced footprint and power consumption compared to other photonic alternatives. Importantly, this photonic DAC could create seamless interfaces of next-generation data processing hardware for data-centers, task-specific compute accelerators such as neuromorphic engines, and network edge processing applications.",
