            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of shipping CO2 emissions is important for developing regulations to combat the greenhouse effect. Many shipping CO2 emissions models have been proposed in the past decades. However, most of them are only validated for a few specific ships, and there is a lack of data-driven validation and comparison of these models on a large scale. To fill this gap, this study proposes a general evaluation framework to quantitatively validate and compare different emission models. This framework is based on data integration of three types of data sources: ship technical details, AIS trajectory, and weather. Along with emission models, these data are fed into three carefully-designed modules that perform analysis at both grid and trajectory level as well as use annually aggregated fuel consumption ground truth. Extensive experiments are conducted on one-month data from 1,571 ships passing Danish waters to demonstrate the utility of the framework and insights into the accuracy of five popular CO2 emission models are presented.",

In this paper, we show how querying spatio-temporal trajectory data can be converted to a full-text search problem. This allows for the reuse of efficient data and index structures from the full-text domain. The core idea is to convert a trajectory into a document consisting of spatial and temporal terms. For example, spatial terms are municipality names, zip codes, or road-network segment numbers. Temporal terms are, for example, morning, weekday, spring, and 2020. Using a dataset consisting of +62 million trajectories (24.9 billion GPS points) we show how to query this dataset efficiently. These queries cover spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal queries.",

            "abstract": "Detection of fishing activities in trajectory data is important for authorities to develop fishery management policies and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing at sea. However, the complex movement patterns of fishing activities challenge existing trajectory segmentation approaches, which may not identify complete fishing activities. In light of this, we propose a window-based trajectory segmentation algorithm which aims to detect fishing activities as completely as possible. Firstly, we introduce a visualization-based technique TPoSTE to help design features characterizing different movement patterns. Secondly, a window-based segmentation algorithm WBS-RLE is proposed to split a trajectory into fishing and non-fishing segments. WBS-RLE first utilizes a pre-trained classifier to label windows in a trajectory as fishing or non-fishing, then it uses the run-length encoding technique to merge those labeled windows into complete fishing activities. The effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over existing approaches are evaluated on a real-world trajectory dataset.",

The transportation sector is responsible for about a quarter of all the CO2 in most developed countries. This study uses a large set of trajectory data (272.289 trajectories, built from 75.178.775 GPS points) to analyze and quantify, on a road segment level, the impacts of driving at a steady speed on the energy consumption of electrical vehicles. The results show that drivers should strive to maintain a steady speed for as much as possible as it can reduce the consumption by up to 42% while increasing the travel time by just 10%.",

In the paper, we present a web solution where a user efficiently can label traffic signs by verifying or correcting the labels provided by an object-detection model. All verified/corrected objects can immediately be downloaded by the user for usage in for example semi-supervised or supervised learning. The tool is available via the URL https://gomap.cs.aau.dk",

            "title": "Probabilistic Deep Learning for Electric-Vehicle Energy-Use Prediction",
            "abstract": "The continued spread of electric vehicles raises new challenges for the supporting digital infrastructure. For example, long-distance route planning for such vehicles relies on the prediction of both the expected travel time as well as energy use. We envision a two-tier architecture to produce such predictions. First, a routing and travel-time-prediction subsystem generates a suggested route and predicts how the speed will vary along the route. Next, the expected energy use is predicted from the speed profile and other contextual characteristics, such as weather information and slope. To this end, the paper proposes deep-learning models that are built from EV tracking data. First, as the speed profile of a route is one of the main predictors for energy use, different simple ways to build speed profiles are explored. Next, eight different deep-learning models for energy-use prediction are proposed. Four of the models are probabilistic in that they predict not a single-point estimate but parameters of a probability distribution of energy use on the route. This is particularly relevant when predicting EV energy use, which is highly sensitive to many input characteristics and, thus, can hardly be predicted precisely. Extensive experiments with two real-world EV tracking datasets validate the proposed methods. The code for this research has been made available on GitHub.",

            "abstract": "Maintaining a database with the type, location, and direction of traffic signs is a labor-intensive part of asset management for many road authorities. Today there are high-quality cameras in cell-phones that can add location (EXIF) metadata to the images. This makes it efficient and cheap to collect large geo-located imagery datasets. Detecting traffic signs from imagery is also much simpler today due to the availability of several high-quality open-source object-detection solutions. In this paper, we use the detection of traffic signs to find both the location and the direction of physical traffic signs. Five approaches to cluster the detections are presented. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that it is important to consider both the location and the direction. The evaluation is done on a novel dataset with 21,565 images that is available free for download. This includes the ground-truth location of 277 traffic signs and all source code. The conclusion is that traffic signs are detected with an F1 score of 0.8889, a location accuracy of 5.097-meter (MAE), and a direction accuracy of \u00b1 11.375\u00b0(MAE). Only data from two trips are needed to get these results.",

            "title": "AIS Data as Trajectories and Heat Maps",
            "abstract": "All large ships are by international law required to provide their position, speed, and course while sailing. This data is called AIS data. Several maritime organizations make this data freely available. In this paper, we present two approaches to querying AIS data. The first approach combines the individual AIS data records into trajectories and the second approach is to combine many trajectories into heat maps. The first approach is well suited, e.g., to find the complete route of a few ships or study how many ships are navigating in a smaller area known to be complicated to sail. The heat-map approach is particularly well suited to provide an overview of ship movements in large areas. For the trajectory approach, we introduce and define a novel way to query AIS data called a trident query. This query type is developed in close collaboration with domain experts. The core idea with a trident query is to visualize route choices. The heat-map approach works both for user-defined areas and for predefined Areas Of Interest (AOI) cells. The trajectory approach is difficult to scale and we show how the trajectories can be simplified to make querying and visualization more efficient. We present data on a map and statistical details are provided in graphs and tables, e.g., the distribution of ship types and ship dimensions (length, width, and draught). End-users can filter on attributes such as ship IDs, ship types, and ship dimensions for both the trajectory and heap-map approaches.",

            "abstract": "Action cameras and smartphones have made it simple and cheap to collect large imagery datasets from the road network while driving. At the same time, several frameworks, e.g., Detectron2 and the TensorFlow Object Detection API, have made it fairly easy to build object-detection models for your imagery datasets. In this paper, we use the Detectron2 framework to detect 18 different common traffic signs from 351.469 images. The purpose is to automate the asset management of traffic signs in large road networks. A task that today often is done in a manual and labor-intensive manner. To improve the accuracy of determining the locations of traffic signs, we develop a new, general method that uses the size of the object detected (in pixels) and the camera's GPS position and heading. To further enhance the accuracy, multiple detections of the same physical traffic sign are clustered. The traffic-sign type and computed location are stored in a spatial data warehouse. The clustered locations are presented on a digital road network in a web app. This app allows visual inspection of the overall approach. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the computed locations is good, e.g., signs are placed on the correct side of the road or in/out of a roundabout.",
