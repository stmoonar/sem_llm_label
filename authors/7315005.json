            "title": "CSCT: Charging Scheduling for Maximizing Coverage of Targets in WRSNs",
            "abstract": "In recent years, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), as a crucial technology in cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSSs), have gradually become a hotspot of research, with the development of wireless energy transmission technology. In previous works, the objective is to maximize the survival rate of sensor nodes. However, in this article, we focus on maintaining more targets. First, it details the charging scheduling problem of maximizing coverage of targets (CoT) in on-demand charging architecture of WRSNs. Also, the problem is formalized as a multiple-objective optimization problem, which aims at maximizing the CoT and the energy efficiency simultaneously. After that, the charging scheduling for maximizing coverage of targets (CSCT) scheme is proposed to achieve the above objectives. Then, the problem is reformulated as a Deadline-TSP problem that is NP-hard. To address this problem, we design an energy predictive model and propose the CSCT with an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-path (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-CSCT) scheme that has an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(|\\mathcal {N}|^{n})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> computational complexity. In addition, the resurrection of sensor nodes is considered in this article. Thus, the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-CSCT with node resurrection (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-CSCT-R) scheme is proposed for this case. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes via extensive simulations.",

            "abstract": "To support multiuser offloading with limited radio resources, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently been extensively incorporated into multi-access edge computing (MEC). This study aims to minimize the weighted sum cost in terms of delay and energy consumption in NOMA-enabled multicell MEC networks. To this end, we formulate a joint radio resource allocation and offloading problem to fully unleash the potential of NOMA, by jointly considering all factors affecting the efficiency of NOMA, i.e., both the intra-cell and inter-cell interference,power control, and subchannel allocation. To tackle the intractable mixed-integer non-convex problem, we decouple the original optimization problem into a separated subchannel allocation problem and a power control problem. The subchannel allocation problem is formulated as a coalition game, by fully considering the user state switching from local computing to edge computing, and from the current communication channel to a better channel. And the power control problem is relaxed to a convex optimization problem. Then the solution can be found by iteratively solving these two sub-problems. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the total cost in terms of energy consumption and delay compared to the existing baselines.",

            "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of deep neural networks (DNNs) in industrial artificial intelligence systems (IAISs) promotes the development of industrial automation. However, the growing employment of DNNs also exposes them to various attacks. Recent studies have shown that the data preprocessing process of DNNs is vulnerable to image-scaling attack. Such attacks can craft an attack image, which looks like a given source image but becomes a different target image after being scaled to the target size. The attack images generated by existing image-scaling attacks are easily perceivable to the human visual system, significantly degrading the attack's stealthiness. In this paper, we investigate image-scaling attack from the perspective of signal processing. We unearth that the root cause of the weak deceiving effects of existing image-scaling attack images lies in the introduction of additional high-frequency signals during their construction. Thus, we propose an enhanced image-scaling attack (EIS), which employs adversarial images crafted based on the source (\u201cclean\u201d) images as the target images. Those adversarial images preserve the \u201cclean\u201d pixel information of source images, thereby significantly mitigating the emergence of additional high-frequency signals in the attack images. Specifically, we consider three realistic threat models covering deep models' training and inference phases. Correspondingly, we design three strategies tailored to generate adversarial images with vicious patterns. These patterns are subsequently integrated into the attack images, which can mislead a model with target input size after the necessary scaling operation. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of the proposed image-scaling attack compared to the original one.",

            "abstract": "Link scheduling plays a pivotal role in accommodating stringent reliability and latency requirements. In this paper, we focus on the availability and effectiveness of applying protocol interference model (PIM) under Rayleigh fading model to solve the problem. The motivation is that PIM caters to distributed link scheduling algorithm design, but usually lead to irrationality due to its localization behavior. While Rayleigh fading model can accurately describe the inherent characteristic of wireless signal propagation, but the features of global interference and channel fading make algorithm design more challenging. To be specific, we first remove the effect of channel fading on algorithmic design by establishing the relationship between Rayleigh fading model and non-fading model. We then propose a centralized once link elimination (OLE) algorithm by utilizing local nature of PIM, and achieve its distributed implementation based on the message delivery with time complexity of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\Delta _{\\max }\\ln \\Delta _{\\max })$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta _{\\max }$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the maximum number of nodes around a given node inside some range. Furthermore, based on random contention resolution, we design another distributed algorithm to schedule all the links within <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\Delta ^{3}_{\\max }\\ln \\Delta _{\\max })$ </tex-math></inline-formula> rounds. Simulations show that the PIM is of great confidence as same as Rayleigh fading model, and the proposed algorithms outperform three popular link scheduling algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Device-to-Device (D2D) communication and edge caching are two promising approaches to relieve stress on core networks, and the dynamic topology and complex device types of D2D networks bring more challenges to the design of caching strategies. However, most of the existing research works on D2D caching focus on predictable user mobility without considering its randomness. In addition, they ignore the heterogeneity of user devices. In this paper, we focus on the caching strategies in sophisticated dynamic heterogeneous D2D networks with randomly moving users and heterogeneous user devices. We formulate the average user request delay expectation minimization problem which is proved to be NP-hard. To diminish the impact of coupling user strategies and make full use of the network resources, we propose the policy-network assisted multi-agent collaboration (PAMAC) caching strategy, in which the agents are placed on the user devices and trained collaboratively using a distributed approach. Specifically, in PAMAC, we first propose the collaborative training order optimization (CTOO) algorithm to schedule the training order of the user devices in the network. Then we propose the binary particle swarm policy network (BPSP) algorithm and introduce it to each agent to design the multi-agent collaborative caching scheme. Extensive simulations are conducted to show that PAMAC outperforms other existing caching strategies.",

            "abstract": "As one of the significant supporting technologies for mobile virtual reality (MVR), computer vision is latency-sensitive and always requires real-time response and accurate object analysis. However, the limited computational resources of mobile devices lead to high service delay and low analysis quality, resulting in poor quality of service (QoS). By placing the edge service entities (SEs) of the video tasks on the edge server close to the mobile users, a satisfactory QoS can be obtained for MVR systems. Most of the previous works are restricted to optimizing QoS through service placement, while ignoring the key impact of the network access point and video frame resolution selections on QoS. In this paper, we propose an edge service entity placement model, which aims to jointly optimize service delay and analysis quality for MVR systems. Specifically, we design an efficient dynamic edge service entity placement scheme (EDSP-Edge) based on the block coordinate descent theory, which dynamically determines the selection strategies of network access points, service entities and video frame resolutions for users to effectively improve the QoS. We theoretically analyze the performance of EDSP-Edge and get the gap between EDSP-Edge and the optimal performance. Finally, extensive real-data driven simulations are conducted to show that the EDSP-Edge performs close to the optimal scheme and achieves at least 22% performance improvement compared with previous works.",

            "abstract": "The significance of RFID-based information collection is becoming increasingly visible as more and more sensor-augmented RFID systems are deployed. Tag information collection aims at efficiently and accurately collecting valuable information from target objects attached with RFID tags. Polling-based information collection can effectively avoid response collisions between RFID tags, and it is widely adopted to accurately inventory tags. However, in the traditional polling mode, a polling vector can only be used to query a tag at a time, which is inefficient. In this paper, we design a double polling mode to improve the utilization of polling vectors, which can simultaneously interrogate a pair of tags. Afterwards, several techniques are developed to reduce the polling vector length. First, the Basic Double Polling-based protocol (BDP) employs double indexes to collect information, which greatly reduces the number of polling vectors. Second, the Segmented Double Polling-based protocol (SDP) divides the double indexes into several segments to cut the polling vector length down. Third, the Partial Double Polling-based protocol (PDP) replaces the double index with the size of the empty segment between two adjacent non-zero indexes to further reduce the average polling vector length. Finally, the Differential Double Polling-based protocol (DDP) utilizes the size of the empty segment between two double indexes to improve the utilization of polling vectors. After that, extensive theoretical analyses and simulations are conducted, which demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed protocols.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has advanced significantly in a variety of fields. As a pivotal application of IoT, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have harvested great attention from the research community. Radio frequency identification (RFID) which is an essential technology in IoT plays a key role in ITS to identify tagged vehicles. Unknown tag identification which aims at identifying the existing unknown tags is crucial to monitor the newly entering vehicles in the RFID-assisted intelligent transportation systems. However, the COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) RFID tags that harvest energy from the reader can not support the hash function in reality, which hinders the widespread deployment of hash-enabled unknown tag identification protocols. To conquer this tough issue, we propose two approaches to efficiently identify unknown COTS RFID tags. We first propose a Single-Point Selective unknown tag identification approach called SPS, where an analog hash pattern using the EPC (Electronic Product Code) segments is deployed to exclusively identify unknown tags. An unknown tag will be identified when it selects a singleton slot to reply. To improve the time efficiency of SPS, we further propose a Multi-Point Selective unknown tag identification approach called MPS. In MPS, two techniques of batch identification and batch division are developed to reduce the number of empty slots and avoid tag collisions, respectively. Then the parameters are theoretically analyzed to maximize the identification efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated via both the simulations and COTS RFID device based experiments.",

            "title": "A Dual Stealthy Backdoor: From Both Spatial and Frequency Perspectives",
            "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose serious security threats to deep neural networks (DNNs). Backdoored models make arbitrarily (targeted) incorrect predictions on inputs containing well-designed triggers, while behaving normally on clean inputs. Prior researches have explored the invisibility of backdoor triggers to enhance attack stealthiness. However, most of them only focus on the invisibility in the spatial domain, neglecting the generation of invisible triggers in the frequency domain. This limitation renders the generated poisoned images easily detectable by recent defense methods. To address this issue, we propose a DUal stealthy BAckdoor attack method named DUBA, which simultaneously considers the invisibility of triggers in both the spatial and frequency domains, to achieve desirable attack performance, while ensuring strong stealthiness. Specifically, we first use Wavelet Transform to embed the high-frequency information of the trigger image into the clean image to ensure attack effectiveness. Then, to attain strong stealthiness, we incorporate Fourier Transform and Cosine Transform to mix the poisoned image and clean image in the frequency domain. Moreover, DUBA adopts a novel attack strategy, training the model with weak triggers and attacking with strong triggers to further enhance attack performance and stealthiness. DUBA is evaluated extensively on four datasets against popular image classifiers, showing significant superiority over state-of-the-art backdoor attacks in attack success rate and stealthiness.",

            "title": "Learning Distinct Relationship in Package Recommendation With Graph Attention Networks",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems have been widely developed and extensively used in various websites and platforms to promote products or services to interested users. However, in quite a few sale scenarios, the platform has the necessity to display users a series of items, which is called package recommendation. There is very little research in this area. This article develops a novel and realistic package recommendation system named package graph attention network (PGAT) based on graph neural network. PGAT integrates users, items, and packages to build a unified heterogeneous graph and treat them as a whole. PGAT incorporates an attention mechanism in the first-order neighborhood aggregation operation, which can differentiate the weight of different neighbor nodes to the center node. By performing graph attention and graph convolution operations on the tripartite graph, PGAT can learn node embeddings more expressively and address the problem of data sparse to a large extent. Extensive experiment results on two real-world datasets validate the outstanding performance of PGAT, which is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines by 0.77%\u201310.12%.",
