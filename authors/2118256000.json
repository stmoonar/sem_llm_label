            "abstract": "Data similarity computation is a fundamental research topic which underpins many high-level applications based on similarity measures. However, the exact similarity computation has become daunting in large-scale real-world scenarios. Currently, MinHash is a popular technique for efficiently estimating the Jaccard similarity of binary sets and, furthermore, weighted MinHash is utilized to estimate the generalized Jaccard similarity of weighted sets. This review focuses on categorizing and discussing the existing works of weighted MinHash algorithms. Also, we have developed a Python toolbox for the algorithms, and released it in our github.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability.",

            "abstract": "A query algorithm based on homomorphism counts is a procedure for determining whether a given instance satisfies a property by counting homomorphisms between the given instance and finitely many predetermined instances. In a left query algorithm, we count homomorphisms from the predetermined instances to the given instance, while in a right query algorithm we count homomorphisms from the given instance to the predetermined instances. Homomorphisms are usually counted over the semiring N of non-negative integers; it is also meaningful, however, to count homomorphisms over the Boolean semiring B, in which case the homomorphism count indicates whether or not a homomorphism exists. We first characterize the properties that admit a left query algorithm over B by showing that these are precisely the properties that are both first-order definable and closed under homomorphic equivalence. After this, we turn attention to a comparison between left query algorithms over B and left query algorithms over N. In general, there are properties that admit a left query algorithm over N but not over B. The main result of this paper asserts that if a property is closed under homomorphic equivalence, then that property admits a left query algorithm over B if and only if it admits a left query algorithm over N. In other words and rather surprisingly, homomorphism counts over N do not help as regards properties that are closed under homomorphic equivalence. Finally, we characterize the properties that admit both a left query algorithm over B and a right query algorithm over B.",

            "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is an effective way to alleviate the data sparsity problem. Content-based CDR is one of the most promising branches since most kinds of products can be described by a piece of text, especially when cold-start users or items have few interactions. However, two vital issues are still under-explored: (1) From the content modeling perspective, sufficient long-text descriptions are usually scarce in a real recommender system, more often the light-weight textual features, such as a few keywords or tags, are more accessible, which is improperly modeled by existing methods. (2) From the CDR perspective, not all inter-domain interests are helpful to infer intra-domain interests. Caused by domain-specific features, there are part of signals benefiting for recommendation in the source domain but harmful for that in the target domain. Therefore, how to distill useful interests is crucial. To tackle the above two problems, we propose a metapath and multi-interest aggregated graph neural network (M2GNN). Specifically, to model the tag-based contents, we construct a heterogeneous information network to hold the semantic relatedness between users, items, and tags in all domains. The metapath schema is predefined according to domain-specific knowledge, with one metapath for one domain. User representations are learned by GNN with a hierarchical aggregation framework, where the intra-metapath aggregation firstly filters out trivial tags and the inter-metapath aggregation further filters out useless interests. Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that M2GNN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods and current industrial recommender system in Dianping, respectively. Further analysis shows that M2GNN offers an interpretable recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Given a network, it is well recognized that attributed network embedding represents each node of the network in a low-dimensional space, and, thus, brings considerable benefits for numerous graph mining tasks. In practice, a diverse set of graph tasks can be processed efficiently via the compact representation that preserves content and structure information. The majority of attributed network embedding approaches, especially, the graph neural network (GNN) algorithms, are substantially costly in either time or space due to the expensive learning process, while the randomized hashing technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which does not need learning, can speedup the embedding process at the expense of losing some accuracy. In this article, we propose the MPSketch model, which bridges the performance gap between the GNN framework and the LSH framework by adopting the LSH technique to pass messages and capture high-order proximity in a larger aggregated information pool from the neighborhood. The extensive experimental results confirm that in node classification and link prediction, the proposed MPSketch algorithm enjoys performance comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms and outperforms the existing LSH algorithms, while running faster than the GNN algorithms by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude. More precisely, MPSketch runs 2121, 1167, and 1155 times faster than GraphSAGE, GraphZoom, and FATNet on average, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Graphs, as a non-linear data structure, are ubiquitous in practice, and efficient graph analysis can benefit important information retrieval applications in the era of big data. Currently, one of the fundamental graph mining problems is graph embedding, which aims to represent the graph as a low-dimensional feature vector with the content and structural information in the graph preserved. Although the graph embedding technique has evolved considerably, traditional methods mainly focus on node pairwise relationship in graphs, which makes the representational power of such schemes limited. Recently, a number of works have explored the simplicial complexes, which describe the higher-order interactions between nodes in the graphs, and further proposed several Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithms based on simplicial complexes. However, these GNN approaches are highly inefficient in terms of running time and space, due to massive parameter learning. In this paper, we propose a simple and speedy graph embedding algorithm dubbed SCHash. Through adopting the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique, SCHash captures the higher-order information derived from the simplicial complex in the GNN framework, and it can achieve a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Our extensive experiments clearly show that, in terms of accuracy, the performance of our proposed SCHash algorithm is comparable to that of state-of-the-art GNN algorithms; also, SCHash achieves higher accuracy than the existing LSH algorithms. In terms of efficiency, SCHash runs faster than GNN algorithms by 2 ~ 4 orders of magnitude, and is more efficient than the existing LSH algorithms.",

With this clear optimization objective, the deduced GNNs architecture has sound theoretical foundation, which is able to flexibly remedy the weakness of GNNs. However, this optimization objective is only proved for GNNs with single-relational graph. Can we infer a new type of GNNs for multi-relational graphs by extending this optimization objective, so as to simultaneously solve the issues in previous multi-relational GNNs, e.g., over-parameterization? In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble multi-relational GNNs by designing an ensemble multi-relational (EMR) optimization objective. This EMR optimization objective is able to derive an iterative updating rule, which can be formalized as an ensemble message passing (EnMP) layer with multi-relations. We further analyze the nice properties of EnMP layer, e.g., the relationship with multi-relational personalized PageRank. Finally, a new multi-relational GNNs which well alleviate the over-smoothing and over-parameterization issues are proposed. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Candidate generation task requires that candidates related to user interests need to be extracted in realtime. Previous works usually transform a user's behavior sequence to a unified embedding, which can not reflect the user's multiple interests. Some recent works like Comirec and Octopus use multi-channel structures to capture users' diverse interests. They cluster users' historical behaviors into several groups, claiming that one group represents one interest. However, these methods have some limitations. First, an item may correspond to multiple interests of users, thereby simply allocating it to just one interest group will make the modeling of users' interests coarse-grained and inaccurate. Second, explaining user interests at the level of items is rather vague and not convincing. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Enhanced Multi-Interest Network: KEMI, which exploits knowledge graphs to help learn users' diverse interest representations via heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) and a novel dual memory network. Specifically, we use HGNNs to capture the semantic representation of knowledge entities and a novel dual memory network to learn a user's diverse interests from his behavior sequence. Through memory slots of the user memory network and the item memory network, we can learn multiple interests for each user and each item. Meanwhile, by binding the entities to the channels of memory networks, we enable it to be explained from the perspective of the knowledge graph, which enhances the interpretability and understanding of user interests. We conduct extensive experiments on two industrial and publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) detection aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. In daily HOIs, humans often interact with a variety of objects, e.g., holding and touching dozens of household items in cleaning. However, existing whole body-object interaction video benchmarks usually provide limited object classes. Here, we introduce a new benchmark based on AVA: Discovering Interacted Objects (DIO) including 51 interactions and 1,000+ objects. Accordingly, an ST-HOI learning task is proposed expecting vision systems to track human actors, detect interactions and simultaneously discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors/trackers excel in object detection/tracking tasks, they perform unsatisfied to localize diverse/unseen objects in DIO. This profoundly reveals the limitation of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, how to leverage spatio-temporal cues to address object discovery is explored, and a Hierarchical Probe Network (HPN) is devised to discover interacted objects utilizing hierarchical spatio-temporal human/context cues. In extensive experiments, HPN demonstrates impressive performance. Data and code are available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have been a mainstream approach for reasoning over incomplete KGs. However, limited by their inherently shallow and static architectures, they can hardly deal with the rising focus on complex logical queries, which comprise logical operators, imputed edges, multiple source entities, and unknown intermediate entities. In this work, we present the Knowledge Graph Transformer (kgTransformer) with masked pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. We design a KG triple transformation method to enable Transformer to handle KGs, which is further strengthened by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) sparse activation. We then formulate the complex logical queries as masked prediction and introduce a two-stage masked pre-training strategy to improve transferability and generalizability.Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that kgTransformer can consistently outperform both KG embedding-based baselines and advanced encoders on nine in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, kgTransformer can reason with explainability via providing the full reasoning paths to interpret given answers.",
