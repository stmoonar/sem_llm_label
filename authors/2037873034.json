            "title": "QeNoBi: A System for QuErying and mining BehavIoral Patterns",
            "abstract": "We demonstrate QeNoBi, a system for mining and querying customer behavioral patterns. QeNoBi combines an interactive visual interface, on-demand mining, and efficient topk processing, to provide the exploration of customer behavior over time. QeNoBi relies on two distinct data models: a customercentric graph that represents customers with similar purchasing behaviors and is annotated with a change algebra to reflect their behavior evolution, and product-centric time series that reflect the evolution of customer purchases over time. Users can query both representations along three dimensions: shape (the sketched trend of the behavior), scope (the set of customers/products of interest), and time granularity. QeNoBi provides a holistic behavior exploration capability by allowing users to seamlessly switch between customer-centric and product-centric views in a coordinated manner, thereby catering to various needs. A demonstration of QeNoBi is available at https://bit.ly/2HlcO3S.",

            "abstract": "We develop S4, a Statistically-Sound Segment Search framework that combines principled data partitioning and sound statistical testing to verify common hypotheses in retail data and return interpretable customer data segments. Our framework accommodates one-sample, two-sample, and multiple-sample testing, to provide various aggregations and comparisons of customer transactions. To control the proportion of false discoveries in multiple hypothesis testing, we enforce an FDR-controlling procedure and formulate a unified optimization problem that returns customer data segments that satisfy the test for a given significance level, maximize coverage of the input data, and are within a risk capital. We develop a greedy algorithm to explore different data partitions and test multiple hypotheses in a sound manner. Our extensive experiments on four retail data sets examine the interaction between significance, risk and coverage, and demonstrate the expressivity, usefulness, and scalability of S4 in practice.",

            "abstract": "Our work aims to develop novel technologies for building an efficient data infrastructure as a backbone for a human behavior management system. Our infrastructure aims at facilitating behavior modeling, discovery, and exploitation, leading to two major outcomes: a behavior data management back-end and a high-level behavior specification API that supports mining, indexing and search, and AI-powered algorithms that provide the ability to extract insights on human behavior and to leverage data to advance human capital. We discuss the role of ML in populating and maintaining the back-end, and in exploiting it for human interest.",
