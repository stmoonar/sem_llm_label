            "title": "Improving Teacher-Student Interactions in Online Educational Forums using a Markov Chain based Stackelberg Game Model",
            "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of the Internet, the area of education has undergone a massive transformation in terms of how students and instructors interact in a classroom. Online learning now takes more than one form, including the use of technology to enhance a face-to-face class, a hybrid class that combines both face-to-face meetings and online work, and fully online courses. Further, online classrooms are usually composed of an online education forum (OEF) where students and instructor discuss open-ended questions for gaining better understanding of the subject. However, empirical studies have repeatedly shown that the dropout rates in these online courses are very high partly due to the lack of motivation among the enrolled students. We undertake an empirical comparison of student behavior in OEFs associated with a graduate-level course during two terms. We identify key parameters dictating the dynamics of OEFs like effective incentive design, student heterogeneity, and super-posters phenomenon. Motivated by empirical observations, we propose an analytical model based on continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to capture instructor-student interactions in an OEF. Using concepts from lumpability of CTMCs, we compute steady state and transient probabilities along with expected net-rewards for the instructor and the students. We formulate a mixed-integer linear program which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg game. Through simulations, we observe that students exhibit varied degree of non-monotonicity in their participation (with increasing instructor involvement). We also study the effect of instructor bias and budget on the student participation levels. Our model exhibits the empirically observed super-poster phenomenon under certain parameter configurations and recommends an optimal plan to the instructor for maximizing student participation in OEFs.",

            "abstract": "Preference aggregation, and specifically rank aggregation, is a well known problem in the fields of computational social choice and preference handling with broad application including web search and recommendation systems. Inspired by the recent advances in the area of deep neural representation learning, for the first time in the literature, in this paper we leverage unsupervised deep learning techniques - especially graph embeddings - for aggregating a collection of incomplete rank lists and accordingly we develop an algorithm called DeepAggregation. It takes as input a set of incomplete rank lists and constructs a multi-layer graph wherein the nodes are the alternatives that are ranked and the edges capture information contained in the incomplete rank lists. We then compute deep neural representation vectors (i.e. embeddings) for the nodes and then derive the aggregated order using these representation vectors. Our proposed algorithm can handle incomplete rank lists with or without ties. We conduct thorough empirical analysis of the proposed DeepAggregation algorithm using various real life data sets such as TripAdvisor reviews data. We empirically observe that DeepAggregation generates impressive results in comparison with a number of well-known state-of-the-art preference aggregation methods.",

            "title": "Collaborative Reinforcement Learning Model for Sustainability of Cooperation in Sequential Social Dilemmas",
            "abstract": "Learning the emergence of cooperation in conflicting scenarios such as social dilemmas is a centerpiece of research. Many reinforcement learning based theories exist in the literature to address this problem. The well-known fact about RL based model's very slow learning capabilities coupled with large state space exhibit significant negative effects especially in repeated version of social dilemma settings such as repeated Public Goods Game (PGG) and thereby making them ineffective to model sustainability of cooperation. In this paper, we address this research challenge by augmenting the reinforcement learning based models with a notion of collaboration among the agents, motivated by the fact that humans learn not only through their own actions but also by following the actions of other agents who also continuously learn about the environment. In particular, we propose a novel model, which we refer to as Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL), wherein we define collaboration among the agents as the ability of agents to fully follow other agent's actions/decisions. This is also termed as social learning. The proposed CRL model significantly influences the speed of individual learning, which eventually has a large effect on the collective behavior as compared to that of RL only models and thereby effectively explaining the sustainability of cooperation in repeated PGG settings. We also extend the CRL model for PGGs over different generations where agents die out and new agents are born following a birth-death process.",

            "title": "Dynamic Particle Allocation to Solve Interactive POMDP Models for Social Decision Making",
            "abstract": "In social dilemma settings, such as repeated Public Goods Games (PGGs), humans often come across a dilemma whether to contribute or not based on past contributions from others. In such settings, the decision taken by an agent/human actually depends not only on the belief the agent has about other agents and the environment, but also on their beliefs about others' beliefs. To factor in these aspects, we propose a novel formulation of computational theory of mind (ToM) to model human behavior in a repeated PGG using interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs). Interactive particle filter (IPF) is a well-known algorithm used to approximately solve I-POMDP models for the agents to find their optimal contributions. Number of particles assigned to an agent in IPF can be translated into time and computational resources. Solving I-POMDPs in a time-memory efficient manner even in the case of small state spaces is a largely intractable problem. Also, maintaining a fixed number of particles assigned to each agent, over time, will be highly inefficient in terms of resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic particle allocation algorithm for different agents based on how well they could predict. We validate our proposed algorithm through real experiments involving human agents. Our results suggest that dynamic particle allocation based IPF for I-POMDPs is effective in modelling human behaviours in repeated social dilemma setting while utilizing computational resources in an effective manner.",

            "abstract": "Given a large population, it is an intensive task to gather individual preferences over a set of alternatives and arrive at an aggregate or collective preference of the population. We show that social network underlying the population can be harnessed to accomplish this task effectively, by sampling preferences of a small subset of representative nodes. We first develop a Facebook app to create a dataset consisting of preferences of nodes and the underlying social network, using which, we develop models that capture how preferences are distributed among nodes in a typical social network. We hence propose an appropriate objective function for the problem of selecting best representative nodes. We devise two algorithms, namely, Greedy-min which provides a performance guarantee for a wide class of popular voting rules, and Greedy-sum which exhibits excellent performance in practice. We compare the performance of these proposed algorithms against random-polling and popular centrality measures, and provide a detailed analysis of the obtained results. Our analysis suggests that selecting representatives using social network information is advantageous for aggregating preferences related to personal topics (e.g., lifestyle), while random polling with a reasonable sample size is good enough for aggregating preferences related to social topics (e.g., government policies).",

            "abstract": "There are numerous types of networks in the real-world which involve strategic actors: supply chain networks, logistics networks, company networks, and social networks. In this investigation, we explore the topologies of decentralized networks that will be formed by strategic actors who interact with one another. In particular, we analyze a network formation game in a strategic setting where payoffs of individuals depend only on their immediate neighbourhood. These localized payoffs incorporate the social capital emanating from bridging positions that nodes hold in the network. Using this novel and appealing model of network formation, our study explores the structure of networks that form, satisfying pairwise stability or efficiency or both. We derive sufficient conditions for the pairwise stability of several interesting network structures. We characterize topologies of efficient networks by applying classical results from extremal graph theory and discover that the Tura\u0301n graph (or the complete equi-bipartite network) emerges as the unique efficient network under many configurations of parameters. We examine the tradeoffs between topologies of pairwise stable networks and efficient networks using the notion of price of stability. We identify several parameter configurations where the price of stability is 1 (or at least lower bounded by 0.5) in the proposed model. This leads to another key insight of this paper: under mild conditions, efficient networks will form when strategic individuals choose to add or delete links based on only localized payoffs. We study the dynamics of the proposed model by designing a simple myopic best response updating rule and implementing it on a customized network formation test-bed.",

            "abstract": "Eliciting accurate information on any object (perhaps a new product or service or person) using the wisdom of a crowd of individuals utilizing web-based platforms such as social networks is an important and interesting problem. Peer-prediction method is one of the known efforts in this direction but is limited to a single level of participating nodes. We non-trivially generalize the peer-prediction mechanism to the setting of a tree network of participating nodes that would get formed when the query about the object originates at a root node and propagates to nodes in a social network through forwarding. The feedback provided by the participating nodes must be aggregated hierarchically to generate a high quality answer at the root level. In the proposed tree-based peer-prediction mechanism, we use proper scoring rules for continuous distributions and prove that honest reporting is a Nash Equilibrium when prior probabilities are common knowledge in the tree and the observations made by the sibling nodes are stochastically relevant. To compute payments, we explore the logarithmic, quadratic, and spherical scoring rules using techniques from complex analysis. Through detailed simulations, we obtain several insights including the relationship between the budget of the mechanism designer and the quality of answer generated at the root node.",

            "title": "Topologies and Price of Stability of Complex Strategic Networks with Localized Payoffs : Analytical and Simulation Studies",
            "abstract": "We analyze a network formation game in a strategic setting where payoffs of individuals depend only on their immediate neighbourhood. We call these payoffs as localized payoffs. In this game, the payoff of each individual captures (1) the gain from immediate neighbors, (2) the bridging benefits, and (3) the cost to form links. This implies that the payoff of each individual can be computed using only its single-hop neighbourhood information. Based on this simple model of network formation, our study explores the structure of networks that form, satisfying one or both of the properties, namely, pairwise stability and efficiency. We analytically prove the pairwise stability of several interesting network structures, notably, the complete bi-partite network, complete equi-k-partite network, complete network and cycle network, under various configurations of the model. We validate and extend these results through extensive simulations. We characterize topologies of efficient networks by drawing upon classical results from extremal graph theory and discover that the Turan graph (or the complete equi-bi-partite network) is the unique efficient network under many configurations of parameters. We examine the tradeoffs between topologies of pairwise stable networks and efficient networks using the notion of price of stability, which is the ratio of the sum of payoffs of the players in an optimal pairwise stable network to that of an efficient network. Interestingly, we find that price of stability is equal to 1 for almost all configurations of parameters in the proposed model; and for the rest of the configurations of the parameters, we obtain a lower bound of 0.5 on the price of stability. This leads to another key insight of this paper: under mild conditions, efficient networks will form when strategic individuals choose to add or delete links based on only localized payoffs.",
