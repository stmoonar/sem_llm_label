            "abstract": "Obfuscation stands as a promising solution for safe-guarding hardware intellectual property (IP) against a spectrum of threats including reverse engineering, IP piracy, and tampering. In this paper, we introduce Obfus-chat, a novel framework leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models to automate the obfuscation process. The proposed framework accepts hardware design netlists and key sizes as inputs, and autonomously generates obfuscated code tailored to enhance security. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we employ the Trust-Hub Obfuscation Benchmark for comparative analysis. We employed SAT attacks to assess the security of the design, along with functional verification procedures to ensure that the obfuscated design remains consistent with the original. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed framework in fortifying hardware IP against potential threats, thus providing a valuable contribution to the field of hardware security.",

            "abstract": "On-chip learning is the process of training or updating machine learning models directly on specialized hardware. This approach differs from traditional machine learning, which typically conducts training on external computing resources like Central Processing Units (CPUs) or Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). On-chip learning offers several advantages, including reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, enhanced privacy, and adaptability. Consequently, it holds great promise for enabling intelligent decision-making and adaptability in resource-constrained edge and IoT devices while addressing privacy concerns. In Spiking Neural Network (SNN), on-chip learning is enabled by adjusting synaptic weights, allowing the network\u2019s behavior to dynamically align with desired outcomes. However, this adaptability may introduce potential security vulnerabilities. Unmitigated security risks in on-chip learning can lead to various threats, including data leaks, unauthorized access, and even adversarial manipulation of the learning process. This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the security risks associated with on-chip learning, with a focus on potential vulnerabilities within the SNN architecture. We will explore real-world scenarios where these vulnerabilities can be exploited and outline protective measures and mitigation strategies to address these security concerns.",

            "abstract": "The globalization of the manufacturing process and the supply chain for electronic hardware has been driven by the need to maximize profitability while lowering risk in a technologically advanced silicon sector. However, many hardware IPs\u2019 security features have been broken because of the rise in successful hardware attacks. Existing security efforts frequently ignore numerous dangers in favor of fixing a particular vulnerability. This inspired the development of a unique method that uses emerging spin-based devices to obfuscate circuitry to secure hardware intellectual property (IP) during fabrication and the supply chain. We propose an Optimized and Automated Secure IC (OASIC) Design Flow, a defense-in-depth approach that can minimize overhead while maximizing security. Our EDA tool flow uses a dynamic obfuscation method that employs dynamic lockboxes, which include switch boxes and magnetic random access memory (MRAM)-based look-up tables (LUT) while offering minimal overhead and being flexible and resilient against modern SAT-based attacks and power side-channel attacks. An EDA tool flow for optimized lockbox insertion is also developed to generate SAT-resilient design netlists with the least power and area overhead. PPA metrics and security (SAT attack time) are provided to the designer for each lockbox insertion run. A verification methodology is provided to verify locked and unlocked designs for functional correctness. Finally, we use ISCAS\u201985 benchmarks to show that the EDA tool flow provides a secure hardware netlist with maximum security while considering power and area constraints. Our results indicate that the proposed OASIC design flow can maximize security while incurring less than 15% area overhead and maintaining a similar power footprint compared to the original design. OASIC design flow demonstrates improved performance as design size increases, which demonstrates the scalability of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "This paper discloses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) solution implemented to decrease the peak current by alteration of the clock skews. Clock skews are elements of the clock network calculated throughout the Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) phase of physical design. Initially, the physical design tools targeted obtaining a balanced clock tree and decreasing the clock skew as low as possible. The resulting zero-skew clock tree caused a drastic increase in the current demand for the battery. The proposed solutions in this paper comprise a Reinforcement Learning agent that maneuvers throughout the design and updates the clock arrival time of each register by either adding, removing, or not changing it. The agent\u2019s end game is to maximize the clock arrival distribution of the design. The Reinforcement learning solution allows the exploration and optimization of the clock tree synthesis process beyond the heuristic algorithms employed by traditional Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. This paper contains two experiments using the Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The first experiment results indicate a 35% reduction in peak current and a significant reduction in IR decrease (from package to transistor) in the chosen benchmarks. The second experiment modified the Q-table renewing technique, which resulted in another additional 10% improvement compared to the first experiment. In both experiments, the agent traverses the environment and explores different options despite creating timing violations and obtaining a substantial negative feedback reward for the actions taken. However, the timing violation fixed later results in the agent obtaining a future reward for modifying the clock arrival time of other registers. The overall process resulted in the broader spread of clock arrival distribution.",

            "abstract": "The escalating complexity of modern computing frameworks has resulted in a surge in the cybersecurity vulnerabilities reported to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) by practitioners. Despite the fact that the stature of NVD is one of the most significant databases for the latest insights into vulnerabilities, extracting meaningful trends from such a large amount of unstructured data is still challenging without the application of suitable technological methodologies. Previous efforts have mostly concentrated on software vulnerabilities; however, a holistic strategy incorporates approaches for mitigating vulnerabilities, score prediction, and a knowledge-generating system that may extract relevant insights from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerability Exchange (CVE) databases is notably absent. As the number of hardware attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices continues to rapidly increase, we present the Hardware Vulnerability to Weakness Mapping (HW-V2W-Map) Framework, which is a Machine Learning (ML) framework focusing on hardware vulnerabilities and IoT security. The architecture that we have proposed incorporates an Ontology-driven Storytelling framework, which automates the process of updating the ontology in order to recognize patterns and evolution of vulnerabilities over time and provides approaches for mitigating the vulnerabilities. The repercussions of vulnerabilities can be mitigated as a result of this, and conversely, future exposures can be predicted and prevented. Furthermore, our proposed framework utilized Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide mitigation suggestions.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model training solution, denoted as Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective function that aims to concentrate each class\u2019s features toward their corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to, effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2) anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity training. Gravity\u2019s efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10 classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks but also effectively improves the model training accuracy.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents RAPTA, a customized Representation-learning Architecture for automation of feature engineering and predicting the result of Path-based Timing-Analysis early in the physical design cycle. RAPTA offers multiple advantages compared to prior work: 1) It has superior accuracy with errors std ranges 3.9ps~16.05ps in 32nm technology. 2) RAPTA's architecture does not change with feature-set size, 3) RAPTA does not require manual input feature engineering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work, in which Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) representation learning is used to digest raw information for feature engineering, where generation of latent features and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based regression for timing prediction can be trained end-to-end.",
