            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Designing complex applications and executing them on large-scale topologies of heterogeneous architectures is becoming increasingly crucial in many scientific domains. As a result, diverse workflow modelling paradigms are developed, most of them with no formalisation provided. In these circumstances, comparing two different models or switching from one system to the other becomes a hard nut to crack.This paper investigates the capability of process algebra to model a location aware workflow system. Distributed \u03c0-calculus is considered as the base of the formal model due to its ability to describe the communicating components that change their structure as an outcome of the communication. Later, it is discussed how the base model could be extended or modified to capture different features of location aware workflow system.The intention of this paper is to highlight the fact that due to its flexibility, \u03c0-calculus, could be a good candidate to represent the behavioural perspective of the workflow system.",

This work conducts a systematic mapping study of the Italian workflow research community, analyzing 25 tools and 10 applications from several scientific domains in the context of the \"National Research Centre for HPC, Big Data, and Quantum Computing\" (ICSC). The study aims to outline the main current research directions and determine how they address the critical needs of modern scientific applications. The findings highlight a variegated research ecosystem of tools, with a prominent interest in advanced workflow orchestration and still immature but promising efforts toward energy efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Reversible computing is a paradigm where programs can execute backward as well as in the usual forward direction. Reversible computing is attracting interest due to its applications in areas as different as biochemical modelling, simulation, robotics and debugging, among others. In concurrent systems the main notion of reversible computing is called causal-consistent reversibility, and it allows one to undo an action if and only if its consequences, if any, have already been undone. \nThis paper presents a general and automatic technique to define a causal-consistent reversible extension for given forward models. We support models defined using a reduction semantics in a specific format and consider a causality relation based on resources consumed and produced. The considered format is general enough to fit many formalisms studied in the literature on causal-consistent reversibility, notably Higher-Order \u03c0-calculus and Core Erlang, an intermediate language in the Erlang compilation. Reversible extensions of these models in the literature are ad hoc, while we build them using the same general technique. This also allows us to show in a uniform way that a number of relevant properties, causal-consistency in particular, hold in the reversible extensions we build. Our technique also allows us to go beyond the reversible models in the literature: we cover a larger fragment of Core Erlang, including remote error handling based on links, which has never been considered in the reversibility literature.",

            "abstract": "The main motivations for studying reversible computing comes \nfrom the promise that reversible computation (and circuits) \nwould lead to more energy efficient computers. Besides circuits, nowadays, reversibility is studied in many other domains. This thesis studies the expressiveness of the causalconsistent reversibility (a well-known notion of reversibility \nfor concurrent systems) in CCS and \u03c0-calculus. \nFirst, we show that by means of encodings, LTSs of Reversible \nCCS (introduced by Danos and Krivine) and CCS with Communications Keys (introduced by Phillips and Ulidowski) are \nisomorphic up to some structural transformations of processes. \nAn explanation of this result is the existence of one causality \nnotion in CCS. \nIn \u03c0-calculus, two forms of dependences between the actions \ngive rise to different causal semantics. The main difference is \nhow the parallel extrusion of the same name is treated. We \nconsider three approaches to parallel extrusion problem represented with causal semantics introduced by Boreale et al; \nCrafa et al; and Cristescu et al. To study them, we devise a \nframework for reversible \u03c0-calculi, parametric with respect to \nthe data structure used to keep track of information about a \nname extrusions. We show that reversibility induced by our \nframework is causally-consistent and prove causal correspondence between the semantics given by Boreale et al, and the \ncorresponding instance of the framework.",

            "title": "Towards Parametric Causal Semantics in pi-calculus",
            "abstract": "In a concurrent setting, causally-consistent reversibility relates causality and reversibility. In this note we overview three causal semantics for \u03c0-calculus: two classical and a recent one used for a reversible variant of \u03c0-calculus. We show the differences between them via examples, and discuss how to revise the classical one in order to be used as the underlying machinery for a reversible calculus. We propose a reinterpretation of such notions in particular when it comes to silent actions and names extrusion. Our ultimate goal is to devise a general reversible framework parametric into the underlying notion of causality.",
