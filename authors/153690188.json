            "abstract": "Many real world applications can be formulated as event forecasting on Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) where the occurrence of a timed event between two entities is represented as an edge along with its occurrence timestamp in the graphs.However, most previous works approach the problem in compromised settings, either formulating it as a link prediction task on the graph given the event time or a time prediction problem given which event will happen next. In this paper, we propose a novel model combining Graph Neural Networks and Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) that jointly forecasts multiple link events and their timestamps on communities over a CTDG. Moreover, to scale our model to large graphs, we factorize the jointly event prediction problem into three easier conditional probability modeling problems.To evaluate the effectiveness of our model and the rationale behind such a decomposition, we establish a set of benchmarks and evaluation metrics for this event forecasting task. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model in terms of both model accuracy and training efficiency.",

This paper studies the data-driven fault diagnosis and tolerant control integrated technique focused on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system, especially for the stack degradation fault. The multivariable statistical approach Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are studied for the multi-fault classification and diagnosis purpose. Then based on the diagnosis results, the decision-making part is designed to select appropriate fault reconfigurable control strategy which can handle five types of stack faults and recover the thermal and electrical parameters to normal operating condition. The core of integrated data-based fault monitoring and control approach is to take full advantage of available SOFC measurements data aiming to acquire the useful fault condition information and choosing adequate fault recovery control method. The results are that the proposed strategy can keep the system power near the normal operating state and make the SOFC temperature steady near the enactment value when working in faulty conditions, which may result in both lifetime and durability improvement for the SOFC system.",

Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning task of identifying rare data that differ from the majority.

However, those traditional anomaly detection methods lost their effectiveness in graph data. Since traditional anomaly detection methods are stable, robust and easy to use, it is vitally important to generalize them to graph data. In this work, we propose One Class Graph Neural Network (OCGNN), a one-class classification framework for graph anomaly detection.

Due to the high time complexity of querying k-hop neighbors, most graph algorithms cannot be deployed in a giant dense temporal network to execute millisecond-level inference. This problem dramatically limits the potential of applying graph algorithms in certain areas, especially financial fraud detection. Therefore, we propose Asynchronous Propagation Attention Network, an asynchronous continuous time dynamic graph algorithm for real-time temporal graph embedding. Traditional graph models usually execute two serial operations: first graph querying and then model inference. Different from previous graph algorithms, we decouple model inference and graph computation to alleviate the damage of the heavy graph query operation to the speed of model inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance while greatly improving the inference speed. The source code is published at a Github repository.",

            "abstract": "Feature extraction plays a key role in the data-driven process monitoring. Recently, manifold learning approaches have shown good effectiveness of preserving manifold structure features of process data. However, conventional algorithms only focus on low-order statistics while ignore high-order statistics, which makes them unable to extract non-Gaussian features of data effectively. Moreover, process data may not strictly follow Gaussian distribution in the complex modern industrial processes. In this paper, to address the above issues, a new manifold learning method named statistics local and nonlocal embedding (SLNLE) is proposed for non-Gaussian process monitoring. Firstly, both low-order and high-order process statistics are conducted by statistics pattern analysis (SPA) algorithm under given time window. Then, local and nonlocal embedding (LNLE) is adopted to preserve manifold structure information of them. Compared with locality preserving projections (LPP) algorithm only retaining local structure features, LNLE implements global and local feature extraction simultaneously, which can preserve non-Gaussian features more effectively. Lastly, a SLNLE-based monitoring model is developed and kernel density estimation (KDE) is applied to obtain more accurate control limits for better process monitoring performance. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach are tested on the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process.",

As the framework has been widely used to sequence-to-sequence learning problems, attention mechanism plays a role of predicting where to attend at next step. However, whether the attention is accurate or not is not validated. In other words, the attention model lacks direct supervision. Therefore, the attention weights are reconstructed using ground-truth labels. Difference between original attention weights and reconstructed ones is added to cost function to provide weak supervision for attending process. In addition, the attention model should focus on different positions at different step. To enhance attention strength, a diversity regularization term which maximizes difference of attention weights at different steps is attached to cost function.

            "abstract": "Abstract. In long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, the input gates and output gates control information flowing into and out of memory cells. For sequence-to-sequence learning problems, each element is input into the network only once. If the input gates are closed at a certain step, the information is lost and is not input again. The same problem exists for the output gates. Therefore, the input and output gates do not fully support the roles of gating. An LSTM network with external memories, in which separate memories are installed for the input and output gates, is proposed. Information that is blocked by the input gates is preserved in the input memories, enabling the cells to read these memories when necessary. Similarly, information blocked by the output gates is preserved in the output memories and flows out to hidden units of the network at an appropriate time. In addition, a dynamic attention model is proposed to take into account the attention history. It provides guidance when predicting the attention weights at each step. The proposed model exploits attention-based encoder\u2013decoder architecture to generate image captions. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Captions generated by the proposed method are longer and more informative than those obtained with the original LSTM network.",

Comparing to PCA, diffusion maps is nonlinear manifold learning method derived on the Markov process and robust to noise perturbations. Fault detection consists of off-line modeling and on-line monitoring. As diffusion maps could not get explicit map, Procrustes analysis is applied to facilitate the on-line monitoring.

            "abstract": "The design of fault identification method in fuel cells(FCs)-based systems remains a key challenge. This paper proposes a general data-based fault identification method using deep learning(DL). Because of the great success of deep learning in a variety of practical applications, it has recently become the most popular approach in machine learning. Deep learning employs a hierarchical structure to learn the inherent features in systems layer by layer. The proposed DL-based fault identification method can be structured into three stages: first, transforming the fault identification problem into classification problem, defining the normal and fault state, and preprocessing the original data; second, developing the DL model for fault identification using the preprocessed data and the predefined state; third, validating the DL model with testing dataset. The proposed method is applied to two different size and multiple fault types datasets generated by the SOFC system. And the testing results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the fault type outperforming the other two classification methods. In addition, since the proposed method requires only data, it is easy to migrate to other types of FC-based systems.",
