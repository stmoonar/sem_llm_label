            "title": "The Impact of Covid-19 on Online Discussions: the Case Study of the Sanctioned Suicide Forum",
            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been at the center of the lives of many of us for at least a couple of years, during which periods of isolation and lockdowns were common. How all that affected our mental well-being, especially the ones\u2019 who were already in distress? To investigate the matter we analyse the online discussions on Sanctioned Suicide, a forum where users discuss suicide-related topics freely. We collected discussions starting from March 2018 (before pandemic) up to July 2022, for a total of 53K threads with 700K comments and 16K users. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the discussions in the forum. The data show that covid, while being present in the discussions, especially during the first lockdown, has not been the main reason why new users registered to the forum. However, covid appears to be indirectly connected to other causes of distress for the users, i.e. anxiety for the economy.",

            "title": "A Novel Review Helpfulness Measure Based on the User-Review-Item Paradigm",
            "abstract": "Review platforms are viral online services where users share and read opinions about products (e.g., a smartphone) or experiences (e.g., a meal at a restaurant). Other users may be influenced by such opinions when deciding what to buy. The usability of review platforms is currently limited by the massive number of opinions on many products. Therefore, showing only the most helpful reviews for each product is in the best interest of both users and the platform (e.g., Amazon). The current state of the art is far from accurate in predicting how helpful a review is. First, most existing works lack compelling comparisons as many studies are conducted on datasets that are not publicly available. As a consequence, new studies are not always built on top of prior baselines. Second, most existing research focuses only on features derived from the review text, ignoring other fundamental aspects of the review platforms (e.g., the other reviews of a product, the order in which they were submitted). In this article, we first carefully review the most relevant works in the area published during the last 20 years. We then propose the User-Review-Item (URI) paradigm, a novel abstraction for modeling the problem that moves the focus of the feature engineering from the review to the platform level. We empirically validate the URI paradigm on a dataset of products from six Amazon categories with 270 trained models: on average, classifiers gain +4% in F1-score when considering the whole review platform context. In our experiments, we further emphasize some problems with the helpfulness prediction task: (1) the users\u2019 writing style changes over time (i.e., concept drift), (2) past models do not generalize well across different review categories, and (3) past methods to generate the ground truth produced unreliable helpfulness scores, affecting the model evaluation phase.",

            "abstract": "Honeypots represent one of the most common solutions to study the adversaries\u2019 movements and develop ad-hoc protection strategies. An effective honeypot can mimic a real system behavior and can be used to deceive the attacker and collect data related to his actions. However, current honeypots for Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) still lack realistic physical process simulation of the industrial network. Simulating an industrial process accurately while also enabling interaction with it is a complicated task. In this paper, we present ICSpot, the first ICS honeypot that addresses the current state-of-the-art limitations by integrating a physical process interaction. We developed our honeypot by leveraging different ad-hoc ICS tools resulting in a more completed and realistic solution. Then, we installed our honeypot on a local Internet Exchange Point and an AWS server, and we collected the interaction for 30 days. Finally, we report the finding related to the interaction collection and compare the results on the two installation points. Our results show that the physical process port we implemented is highly attractive to attackers.",

            "title": "KingFisher: an Industrial Security Framework based on Variational Autoencoders",
            "abstract": "The recent evolution of edge computing favored the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) growth, opening dangerous surfaces of vulnerabilities. In this distributed sensor system scenario, due to the insecure interactions between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks, cyber-physical threats could lead to destructive consequences for environments and population safety. To deal with industrial cyber-physical security, modern anomaly detection systems implement innovative Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Unfortunately, current solutions still fail to provide an effective prevention to complex industrial threats. In this paper, we present KingFisher, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework based on ML. KingFisher is, to the best of our knowledge, the first solution that looks independently at IT and OT traffic, but also from sensors deployed to capture side-channel physical processes data (e.g., vibrations, background noise). Thanks to this feature, KingFisher can detect attacks that other systems would ignore. As our tests report, the correlation of inferred physical processes status with OT-network and IT-network data can give insights into suspicious and anomalous activities targeting industrial networks. For our framework, we use the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an unsupervised neural network model, to categorize data without a priori knowledge of the dataset. We evaluate the detection capabilities and performances of KingFisher in a proof of concept simulated industrial scenario under cyber-physical attacks. Our preliminary results show that KingFisher identifies attacks on both network and physical layers.",
