            "abstract": "With the rise of digital communication, memes have become a significant medium for cultural and political expression that is often used to mislead audiences. Identification of such misleading and persuasive multimodal content has become more important among various stakeholders, including social media platforms, policymakers, and the broader society as they often cause harm to individuals, organizations, and/or society. While there has been effort to develop AI-based automatic systems for resource-rich languages (e.g., English), it is relatively little to none for medium to low resource languages. In this study, we focused on developing an Arabic memes dataset with manual annotations of propagandistic content. We annotated ~6K Arabic memes collected from various social media platforms, which is a first resource for Arabic multimodal research. We provide a comprehensive analysis aiming to develop computational tools for their detection. We will make them publicly available for the community.",

            "abstract": "The automatic identification of misleading and persuasive content has emerged as a significant issue among various stakeholders, including social media platforms, policymakers, and the broader society. To tackle this issue within the context of memes, we organized a shared task at SemEval-2024, focusing on the multilingual detection of persuasion techniques. This paper outlines the dataset, the organization of the task, the evaluation framework, the outcomes, and the systems that participated. The task targets memes in four languages, with the inclusion of three surprise test datasets in Bulgarian, North Macedonian, and Arabic. It encompasses three subtasks: (i) identifying whether a meme utilizes a persuasion technique; (ii) identifying persuasion techniques within the meme\u2019s \u201dtextual content\u201d; and (iii) identifying persuasion techniques across both the textual and visual components of the meme (a multimodal task). Furthermore, due to the complex nature of persuasion techniques, we present a hierarchy that groups the 22 persuasion techniques into several levels of categories. This became one of the attractive shared tasks in SemEval 2024, with 153 teams registered, 48 teams submitting results, and finally, 32 system description papers submitted.",

            "abstract": "The development of machine learning solutions often relies on training using large labeled datasets. This raises challenges in terms of data storage, data privacy protection, and longer model training time. One of the possible solutions to overcome these problems is called dataset distillation - a process of creating a smaller dataset while maximizing the preservation of its task-related information. In this paper, a new dataset distillation algorithm is proposed, called DEvS, which uses an evolutionary strategy approach to condense the training samples initially available for an image classification task, while minimizing the loss of classification accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach. Also, contrary to recent trends, DEvS is derivative-free image generation, and therefore has greater scalability on larger input image sizes.",

            "abstract": "Due to the increased volume of national, international, and even intercontinental transportations, it has been a critical responsibility for the road and transport authorities to ensure the safety of the transits. Bridges, in particular, require special maintenance because these are typically built in strategic locations, are more vulnerable to natural disasters, and can inflict more damage to life and property if collapsed. In addition to being expensive and time-consuming, manual structure health monitoring (SHM) is also error-prone, but this is still the standard practice in many countries, especially in Bangladesh. This paper presents a deep learning approach to detect cracks in concrete bridge surfaces from images using Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) with 99.83% detection accuracy to automate SHM, making it less expensive, efficient, and accurate.",

Capturing the topological information of the system through the GNN framework along with the state measurements can improve the performance of the detection mechanism. The problem is formulated as a classification problem through a GNN with message passing mechanism to identify abnormal measurements. The residual block used in the aggregation process of message passing and the gated recurrent unit can lead to improved computational time and performance. The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated through extensive simulations of power system states and attack scenarios showing promising performance. The sensitivity of the model to intensity and location of the attacks and model's detection delay versus detection accuracy have also been evaluated.",

In the literature, this issue is never discussed for the algorithm\u2019s design. Indeed, algorithms do not behave the same when the input is modified to protect privacy. Particularly, the unmodified data samples predicts with low confidences show high vulnerability to decision changes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel solution that enhances classifier\u2019s robustness by particularly addressing the vulnerable samples. It consists of a novel formulation of the learning objective by hybridizing similarity learning, decision margin and intra-class distance. Experimental results and evaluation on a challenging vehicle image dataset exhibit the high effectiveness and potentials of our method for the privacy preserving classification problems.",

Different types of cyber \u2010 attacks have targeted the important function of monitoring smart grids and the integrity of the collected data. The multivariate time series of the state of components are analysed through their instantaneous correlation. The effects of multiple cyber \u2010 attacks and single line failures in the system on the instantaneous correlations are discussed.

This problem is very challenging because any loss of accuracy even of the order of 1% quickly turns into a significant economic loss. To deal with such a problem, many companies currently use optical sensors (OSs) and human observers to correct the classification errors. Herein, a novel vehicle classification method is proposed. It consists in regularizing the problem using one camera to obtain vehicle class probabilities using a set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and, then, uses the Gradient boosting-based classifier to fuse the continuous class probabilities with the discrete class labels obtained from the OS. The method is evaluated on a real-world dataset collected from the toll collection points of the VINCI Autoroutes French network. The results show that it performs significantly better than the existing ATC system and, hence, will vastly reduce the workload of human operators.",

This last decade, the number of camera increases exponentially, but the exploitation of the information depends on the quality of these acquired images, and sequences. A large number of objective blind IQ assessment (OBIQA) methods were proposed which find a global IQ estimation regardless the application. In this work, we assume that is impossible that such a method can be applied to all applications, however, for a given problem an objective model of the quality can be provided. Consequently, this paper addresses this issue for an automatic vehicle type classification application and proposes a novel OBIQA based classification approach. The proposed method first extracts a set of selective image features, then learns to classify images accordingly. In other terms, it aims to prevent misclassification and localize the source of poor images. Experiments show that it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods and can be used for similar applications.",

Unfortunately, manipulated images become a growing concern with respect to spreading misinformation via image sharing in the social media. Despite the availability of a large number of automatic Image Forgery Detection (IFD) methods, their evaluation in real-world benchmarks seems to be limited due to the lack of diverse datasets. Moreover, the motifs behind the manipulation remains unclear. This research aims to address these issues by proposing a novel social media IFD database, called SMIFD-500, to evaluate the efficiency and generalizability of the IFD methods. The unique property of this dataset is the availability of the technical and social attributes in its ground truth annotations. These will benefit the scientific community to develop efficient methods by exploiting such annotations. Moreover, it provides interesting statistics, which highlights the motifs of image manipulation from social science perspective.",
