            "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet-of-Things in smart grid has enabled millions of grid-connected distributed controllable resources (DCR; e.g., electric vehicles, controllable loads) to provide service to the grid, such as frequency regulation and demand response. The integration of these DCRs may become a large virtual power plant network with various characteristics. This poses great challenges from both control and management perspectives, e.g., computation/communication burden, optimization complexity, scalability limitation, prosumer privacy, etc. In this article, we propose an effective autonomous incentive-based DCR control and management framework to integrate a large amount of DCRs to provide grid services, which simultaneously provides accurate active power adjustment to the grid, optimizes DCR allocations, and maximizes the profits for all prosumers and system operators. A model-free deep deterministic policy gradient-based method is designed to find the optimal incentives in a continuous action space to encourage prosumers to adjust their power consumptions. The method is implemented in a consortium open-source blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, which facilitates controls and transaction management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, extensive experimental studies are conducted using real-world data.",

Hence, network robustness becomes critical to understanding system robustness. In this paper, we propose a spectral measure for network robustness: the second spectral moment $m_{2}$ of the network. Our results show that a smaller second spectral moment $m_{2}$ indicates a more robust network. We demonstrate both theoretically and with extensive empirical studies that the second spectral moment can help (1) capture various traditional measures of network robustness; (2) assess the robustness of networks; (3) design networks with controlled robustness; and (4) study how complex networked systems (e.g., power systems) behave under cascading failures.",

            "abstract": "Real-time Transient Stability Assessment (TSA) is essential for prompt control decisions that lead to a stable power system. With the wide deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in power grids, data-driven TSA approaches, particularly those based on machine learning (ML) techniques, have become increasingly relevant in recent years. Within cycles, the well-trained ML-based TSA classifiers enable accurately assessing the post-fault transient stability of a power system. However, events that lead to transient instability are rare. Hence, the training datasets used by ML-based classifiers are highly imbalanced, challenging the accuracy of these methods. An imbalanced dataset, where the number of unstable samples is significantly lower than the number of stable samples, will result in an inaccurate and biased classifier. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is utilized to generate synthetic unstable datasets by learning from the real unstable transient data, with a goal to balance the distribution of the stable and unstable datasets. To learn the spatial and temporal correlations of the PMU data, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the correlation loss are utilized to construct the GAN model. Comparison with other data resampling methods demonstrates that the developed GAN model addresses the problem of an imbalanced training dataset, and results in more accurate machine learning-based algorithms for TSA.",

            "abstract": "Online transient stability assessment (TSA) is essential for secure and stable power system operations. The growing number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) brings about massive sources of data that can enhance online TSA. However, conventional data-driven methods require large amounts of transient data to correctly assess the transient stability state of a system. In this paper, a new data-driven TSA approach is developed for TSA with fewer data compared to the conventional methods. The data reduction is enabled by learning the dynamic behaviors of the historical transient data using generative and adversarial networks (GAN). This knowledge is used online to predict the voltage time series data after a transient event. A classifier embedded in the generative network deploys the predicted post-contingency data to determine the stability of the system following a fault. The developed GAN-based TSA approach preserves the spatial and temporal correlations that exist in multivariate PMU time series data. Hence, in comparison with the state-of-the-art TSA methods, it achieves a higher assessment accuracy using only one sample of the measured data and a shorter response time. Case studies conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the superior performance of the GAN-based method compared to the conventional data-driven techniques.",

            "abstract": "Failure propagation in power systems, and the possibility of becoming a cascading event, depend significantly on power system operating conditions. To make informed operating decisions that aim at preventing cascading failures, it is crucial to know the most probable failures based on operating conditions that are close to real-time conditions. In this paper, this need is addressed by developing a cascading failure model that is adaptive to different operating conditions and can quantify the impact of failed grid components on other components. With a three-step approach, the developed model enables predicting potential sequence of failures in a cascading failure, given system operating conditions. First, the interactions between system components under various operating conditions are quantified using the data collected offline, from a simulation-based failure model. Next, given measured line power flows, the most probable interactions corresponding to the system operating conditions are identified. Finally, these interactions are used to predict potential sequence of failures with a propagation tree model. The performance of the developed model under a specific operating condition is evaluated on both IEEE 30-bus and Illinois 200-bus systems, using various evaluation metrics such as Jaccard coefficient, $F_{1}$ score, Precision@ $K$ , and Kendall\u2019s tau.",

            "abstract": "The ever-growing threats of cascading failures due to cyber-attacks pose a significant challenge to power grid security. A wrong system state estimate caused by a false data injection attack could lead to a wrong control actions and take the system into a more insecure operating condition. As a consequence, an attack-resilient failure mitigation strategy needs to be developed to correctly determine control actions to prevent the propagation of cascades. In this paper, a recovery-based model predictive control methodology is developed to eliminate power system component violations following coordinated cyber-physical attacks where physical attacks are masked by targeted false data injection attacks. Specifically, to address the problem of wrong system state estimation with compromised data, a developed methodology recovers the incorrect states from historical data rather than utilizing the tampered data, and thus allowing control centers to identify proper control actions. Additionally, instead of using a one-step method to optimize control actions, the recovery-based model predictive control methodology scheme incorporates the effect of controls over a finite time horizon and the attack detection delay to make appropriate control decisions. Case studies, performed on IEEE 30-bus and Illinois 200-bus systems, show that the developed recovery-based model predictive control methodology scheme is robust to coordinated attacks and efficient in mitigating cascades.",
