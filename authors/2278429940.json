            "abstract": "In the last decade, data management has been steadily moving to-wards public clouds, turning DBMS \"builders\" into \"operators\". The combined scale and vertical integration gives us the opportunity to optimize systems holistically using a telemetry-based feedback loop. These events aligned with fast advances in the field of Data Science to create the perfect conditions for an explosion of \"ML for Systems\" solutions. More recently, massive improvements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced another intriguing element into the mix. In this panel, we explore questions around the practical adoption and robustness of ML for Systems solutions, as well as the potential role for LLMs, spanning very concrete engineering considerations and very open-ended \"future of this industry\" type thinking.",

            "abstract": "Database systems often rely on historical query traces to perform workload-based performance tuning. However, real production workloads are time-evolving, making historical queries ineffective for optimizing future workloads. To address this challenge, we propose SIBYL, an end-to-end machine learning-based framework that accurately forecasts a sequence of future queries, with the entire query statements, in various prediction windows. Drawing insights from real-workloads, we propose template-based featurization techniques and develop a stacked-LSTM with an encoder-decoder architecture for accurate forecasting of query workloads. We also develop techniques to improve forecasting accuracy over large prediction windows and achieve high scalability over large workloads with high variability in arrival rates of queries. Finally, we propose techniques to handle workload drifts. Our evaluation on four real workloads demonstrates that SIBYL can forecast workloads with an 87.3% median F1 score, and can result in 1.7\u00d7 and 1.3\u00d7 performance improvement when applied to materialized view selection and index selection applications, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The development of natural language (NL) interfaces for databases has been notably shaped by the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide an easy way to automate the translation of NL queries into structured SQL queries. While LLMs bring valuable technical advancements, this paper stresses that achieving Enterprise-Grade NL2SQL is still far from being resolved, necessitating extensive novel research in various domains. We present insights from two competing teams dedicated to delivering reliable enterprise-grade NL2SQL technology, shedding light on challenges faced in real-world applications, including handling complex schemata, dealing with ambiguity in natural language statements, and incorporating it in our benchmarking methodologies and responsible AI considerations. While this paper may raise more questions than it answers, its aim is to act as a catalyst for a fruitful discussion on the topic. Additionally, it provides a practical pathway for the community to develop enterprise-grade NL2SQL solutions.",
