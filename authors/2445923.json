            "abstract": "Causal networks are useful in a wide variety of applications, from medical diagnosis to root-cause analysis in manufacturing. In practice, however, causal networks are often incomplete with missing causal relations. This paper presents a novel approach, called CausalLP, that formulates the issue of incomplete causal networks as a knowledge graph completion problem. More specifically, the task of finding new causal relations in an incomplete causal network is mapped to the task of knowledge graph link prediction. The use of knowledge graphs to represent causal relations enables the integration of external domain knowledge; and as an added complexity, the causal relations have weights representing the strength of the causal association between entities in the knowledge graph. Two primary tasks are supported by CausalLP: causal explanation and causal prediction. An evaluation of this approach uses a benchmark dataset of simulated videos for causal reasoning, CLEVRER-Humans, and compares the performance of multiple knowledge graph embedding algorithms. Two distinct dataset splitting approaches are used for evaluation: (1) random-based split, which is the method typically employed to evaluate link prediction algorithms, and (2) Markov-based split, a novel data split technique that utilizes the Markovian property of causal relations. Results show that using weighted causal relations improves causal link prediction over the baseline without weighted relations.",

Due to the difficulty of perception in challenging situations such as occlusion, degraded weather, and sensor failure, objects can go unobserved and unlabeled. In this paper, we present CLUE-AD, a general-purpose method for detecting and labeling unobserved entities by leveraging the object continuity assumption within the context of a scene. This method is dataset-agnostic, supporting any existing and future AD datasets. Using a real-world dataset representing complex urban driving scenes, we demonstrate the applicability of CLUE-AD for detecting unobserved entities and augmenting the scene data with new labels.",

Deep learning methods have made remarkable breakthroughs in machine learning in general and in automated driving (AD)in particular. However, there are still unsolved problems to guarantee reliability and safety of automated systems, especially to effectively incorporate all available information and knowledge in the driving task. Knowledge graphs (KG) have recently gained significant attention from both industry and academia for applications that benefit by exploiting structured, dynamic, and relational data. The complexity of graph-structured data with complex relationships and inter-dependencies between objects has posed significant challenges to existing machine learning algorithms. However, recent progress in knowledge graph embeddings and graph neural networks allows to applying machine learning to graph-structured data. Therefore, we motivate and discuss the potential benefit of KGs applied to the main tasks of AD including 1) ontologies 2) perception, 3) scene understanding, 4) motion planning, and 5) validation. Then, we survey, analyze and categorize ontologies and KG-based approaches for AD. We discuss current research challenges and propose promising future research directions for KG-based solutions for AD.",

            "abstract": "Automated Driving (AD) datasets, when used in combination with deep learning techniques, have enabled significant progress on difficult AD tasks such as perception, trajectory prediction and motion planning. These datasets represent the content of driving scenes as captured by various sensors, including cameras, RADAR, and LiDAR, along with 2D/3D annotations of traffic participants. Such datasets, however, often fail to capture and to represent the spatial, temporal, functional, and semantic relations between entities in a scene. This lack of knowledge leads to a shallow understanding of the true complexity and dynamics inherent in a driving scene. In this paper, we argue that a knowledge graph based representation of driving scenes, that provides a richer structure and semantics, will lead to further improvements in automated driving. Towards this goal, we developed a layered architecture and ontologies for specific automated driving datasets and a fundamental ontology of shared concepts. We also built knowledge graphs (KG) for three different AD datasets. We perform an analysis w.r.t. information contained in the AD KGs and outline how the additional semantic information contained in the KGs could improve the performance of different AD tasks. Moreover, example queries are provided to retrieve relevant information that can be exploited for augmenting the AD pipelines. All artefacts needed for reproducability purposes are provided via a Dropbox folder11shorturl.at/iwyCV - we will go through an internal approval process for making all artefacts publicly available. We removed our internal namespaces of reused ontologies, because of confidentiality and to provide self-contained ontologies. As the original datasets are under specific licences we can not publish the KGs themselves, but we provided the scripts to generate them.",

            "abstract": "Representing relevant information of a traffic scene and understanding its environment is crucial for the success of autonomous driving. Modeling the surrounding of an autonomous car using semantic relations, i.e., how different traffic participants relate in the context of traffic rule based behaviors, is hardly been considered in previous work. This stems from the fact that these relations are hard to extract from real-world traffic scenes. In this work, we model traffic scenes in a form of spatial semantic scene graphs for various different predictions about the traffic participants, e.g., acceleration and deceleration. Our learning and inference approach uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and shows that incorporating explicit information about the spatial semantic relations between traffic participants improves the predicdtion results. Specifically, the acceleration prediction of traffic participants is improved by up to 12% compared to the baselines, which do not exploit this explicit information. Furthermore, by including additional information about previous scenes, we achieve 73% improvements.",

            "abstract": "Scene understanding is a key technical challenge within the autonomous driving domain. It requires a deep semantic understanding of the entities and relations found within complex physical and social environments that is both accurate and complete. In practice, this can be accomplished by representing entities in a scene and their relations as a knowledge graph (KG). This scene knowledge graph may then be utilized for the task of entity prediction, leading to improved scene understanding. In this paper, we will define and formalize this problem as Knowledge-based Entity Prediction (KEP). KEP aims to improve scene understanding by predicting potentially unrecognized entities by leveraging heterogeneous, high-level semantic knowledge of driving scenes. An innovative neuro-symbolic solution for KEP is presented, based on knowledge-infused learning, which 1) introduces a dataset agnostic ontology to describe driving scenes, 2) uses an expressive, holistic representation of scenes with knowledge graphs, and 3) proposes an effective, non-standard mapping of the KEP problem to the problem of link prediction (LP) using knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE). Using real, complex and high-quality data from urban driving scenes, we demonstrate its effectiveness by showing that the missing entities may be predicted with high precision (0.87 Hits@1) while significantly outperforming the non-semantic/rule-based baselines.",

However, they do not capture inter-object commonsense relationships (e.g., \u201c car is smaller than truck \u201d or \u201c car accelerates faster than bicycle \u201d), on which human drivers rely subconsciously when making decisions. Existing commonsense repositories target mainly general purpose domains, and their coverage with respect to driving scenarios is very limited, prohibiting a straightforward integration.

The various types of equipped sensors include video, LIDAR and RADAR. Scene understanding is an important topic in AD which requires consideration of various aspects of a scene, such as detected objects, events, time and location. Recent work on knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) - an approach that facilitates neuro-symbolic fusion - has shown to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models. With the expectation that neuro-symbolic fusion through KGEs will improve scene understanding, this research explores the generation and evaluation of KGEs for autonomous driving data. We also present an investigation of the relationship between the level of informational detail in a KG and the quality of its derivative embeddings. By systematically evaluating KGEs along four dimensions -- i.e. quality metrics, KG informational detail, algorithms, and datasets -- we show that (1) higher levels of informational detail in KGs lead to higher quality embeddings, (2) type and relation semantics are better captured by the semantic transitional distance-based TransE algorithm, and (3) some metrics, such as coherence measure, may not be suitable for intrinsically evaluating KGEs in this domain. Additionally, we also present an (early) investigation of the usefulness of KGEs for two use-cases in the AD domain.",
