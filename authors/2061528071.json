            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Understanding human mobility has become an important aspect of location-based services in tasks such as personalized recommendation and individual moving pattern recognition, enabled by the large volumes of data from geo-tagged social media (GTSM). Prior studies mainly focus on analyzing human historical footprints collected by GTSM and assuming the veracity of the data, which need not hold when some users are not willing to share their real footprints due to privacy concerns\u2014thereby affecting reliability/authenticity. In this study, we address the problem of Inferring Real Mobility (IRMo) of users, from their unreliable historical traces. Tackling IRMo is a non-trivial task due to the: (1) sparsity of check-in data; (2) suspicious counterfeit check-in behaviors; and (3) unobserved dependencies in human trajectories. To address these issues, we develop a novel Graph-enhanced Attention model called IRMoGA, which attempts to capture underlying mobility patterns and check-in correlations by exploiting the unreliable spatio-temporal data. Specifically, we incorporate the attention mechanism (rather than solely relying on traditional recursive models) to understand the regularity of human mobility, while employing a graph neural network to understand the mutual interactions from human historical check-ins and leveraging prior knowledge to alleviate the inferring bias. Our experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of IRMoGA over several state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., up to 39.16% improvement regarding the Recall score on Foursquare.",

Variants have also been considered which take other factors into consideration, such as broader (implicit or explicit) semantic constraints as well as the limitations on the length of the trip. In this work, we present an efficient algorithmic solution to a novel query \u2013 PaDOC (Paths with Distance, Origin, and Category constraints) \u2013 which combines the generation of a path that (a) can be traversed within a user-specified budget (e.g., limit on distance), (b) starts at one of the user-specified origin locations (e.g., a hotel), and (c) contains PoIs from a user-specified list of PoI categories. We show that the problem of deciding whether such a path exists is an NP-hard problem. Based on a novel indexing structure, we propose two efficient algorithms for approximate PaDOC query processing based on both conservative and progressive distance estimations. We conducted extensive experiments over real, publicly available datasets, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methodologies over straightforward solutions.",

            "abstract": "Route planning based on user\u2019s preferences and Points of Interests (POIs) is one of the most popular applications of Location-Based Services (LBS). Variants of route planning consider distance constraints (e.g., the maximum length of the route), origin constraints (e.g., a set of possible starting locations of the route), and category constraints (e.g., a multiset of POI categories that the route must visit). However, the problem of deciding whether a route exists that visits all required POI categories under the distance constraint is known to be NP-hard. Assuming P \u2260 NP, this means that there is no efficient (polynomial time) solution to find such paths. Recently, approximate algorithms have been proposed for searching for such a path. This demonstration leverages several of these algorithms to provide a web-based system with a graphical user interface (UI) which allows the users to find a path that: (a) satisfies a distance limit; (b) generates a route to visit a list of POIs, based on the user\u2019s preferred categories; (c) provides a set of hotels (as possible starting locations of the path). If the approximate search algorithms are able to find such a path, it will be displayed on a Mapbox-based map interface that shows: (1) all POIs on a path and (2) alternative paths if any were found. The system then allows a user to explore the returned paths, select a path, or refine their constraints. Moreover, the system allows the users to select which approximate algorithm they would prefer to execute.",

            "abstract": "We present CACSE \u2013 a system for Context Aware Clustering of Stellar Evolution \u2013 for datasets corresponding to temporal evolution of stars, which are multivariate time series, usually with a large number of attributes (e.g., \u2265 40). Typically, the datasets are obtained by simulation and are relatively large in size (5 \u223c 10 GB per certain interval of values for various initial conditions). Investigating common evolutionary trends in these datasets often depends on the context \u2013 i.e., not all the attributes are always of interest, and among the subset of the context-relevant attributes, some may have more impact than others. To enable such context-aware clustering, our CACSE system provides functionalities allowing the domain experts to dynamically select attributes that matter, and assign desired weights/priorities. Our system consists of a PostgreSQL database, Python-based middleware with RESTful and Django framework, and a web-based user interface as frontend. The user interface provides multiple interactive options, including selection of datasets and preferred attributes along with the corresponding weights. Subsequently, the users can select a time instant or a time range to visualize the formed clusters. Thus, CACSE enables a detection of changes in the the set of clusters (i.e., convoys) of stellar evolution tracks. Current version provides two of the most popular clustering algorithms \u2013 k-means and DBSCAN.",

            "abstract": "One of the most popular applications of Location Based Services (LBS) is recommending a Point of Interest (POI) based on user's preferences and geo-locations. However, the existing approaches have not tackled the problem of jointly determining: (a) a sequence of POIs that can be traversed within certain budget (i.e., limit on distance) and simultaneously provide a high-enough diversity; and (b) recommend the best origin (i.e., the hotel) for a given user, so that the desired route of POIs can be traversed within the specified constraints. In this work, we take a first step towards identifying this new problem and formalizing it as a novel type of a query. Subsequently, we present na\u00efve solutions and experimental observations over a real-life datasets, illustrating the trade-offs in terms of (dis)associating the initial location from the rest of the POIs.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, clustering of multivariate data aims at grouping objects described with multiple heterogeneous attributes based on a suitable similarity (conversely, distance) function. One of the main challenges is due to the fact that it is not straightforward to directly apply mathematical operations (e.g., sum, average) to the feature values, as they stem from heterogeneous contexts. In this work we take the challenge a step further and tackle the problem of clustering multivariate datasets based on jointly considering: (a) similarity among a subset of the attributes; and (b) distance-based diversity among another subset of the attributes. Specifically, we focus on astrophysics data, where the snapshots of the stellar evolution for different stars contain over 40 distinct attributes corresponding to various physical and categorical (e.g., 'black hole') attributes. We present CSD-CAMD -- a prototype system for Coupling Similarity and Diversity for Clustering Astrophysics Multivariate Datasets. It provides a flexibility for the users to select their preferred subsets of attributes; assign weight (to reflect their relative importance on the clustering); and select whether the impact should be in terms of proximity or distance. In addition, CSD-CAMD allows for selecting a clustring algorithm and enables visualization of the outcome of clustering.",

            "abstract": "Location-Based Services are often used to find proximal Points of Interest PoI \u2013 e.g., nearby restaurants and museums, police stations, hospitals, etc. \u2013 in a plethora of applications. An important recently addressed variant of the problem not only considers the distance/proximity aspect, but also desires semantically diverse locations in the answer-set. For instance, rather than picking several close-by attractions with similar features \u2013 e.g., restaurants with similar menus; museums with similar art exhibitions \u2013 a tourist may be more interested in a result set that could potentially provide more diverse types of experiences, for as long as they are within an acceptable distance from a given (current) location. Towards that goal, in this work we propose a novel approach to efficiently retrieve a path that will maximize the semantic diversity of the visited PoIs that are within distance limits along a given road network. We introduce a novel indexing structure \u2013 the Diversity Aggregated R-tree, based on which we devise efficient algorithms to generate the answer-set \u2013 i.e., the recommended locations among a set of given PoIs \u2013 relying on a greedy search strategy. Our experimental evaluations conducted on real datasets demonstrate the benefits of proposed methodology over the baseline alternative approaches.",

In general, different layers (e.g., ZIP codes, census blocks, school districts, and land use parcels) have different spatial partitions and different types of associated semantic descriptors. In addition, geospatial data may contain errors (e.g., due to imprecision in the measurements or to representation constraints) causing uncertainty that needs to be incorporated and quantified in the query answers. In this paper, we leverage semantic descriptors in heterogeneous information layers to build a data structure that enables efficient processing of geospatial range queries by returning an estimate of the answer together with an error bound. We present the processing algorithms and evaluate our approach by means of experiments that encompass large datasets, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.",

            "title": "Fine-Grained Diversification of Proximity Constrained Queries on Road Networks",
            "abstract": "Proximity-oriented spatial queries, such as range queries and k-nearest neighbors (kNNs), are common in many applications, notably in Location Based Services (LBS). However, in many settings, users may also desire that the returned proximal objects exhibit (likely) maximal and fine-grained semantic diversity. For instance, nearby restaurants with different menu items are more interesting than close ones offering similar menus. Towards that goal, we propose a topic modeling approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a generative statistical model, to effectively model and exploit a fine-grained notion of diversity, namely based on sets of keywords (e.g., menu items) instead of a coarser user-given category (e.g., a restaurant's cuisine). In addition, and relying on the notion of Distance Signatures, we propose an index structure that can be used to effectively extract the k objects that are within a range distance from a given query location, and which are also semantically diverse. Our experimental evaluations using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to provide highly diversified answers to cardinality-wise constrained range queries much more efficiently than a straightforward alternative solution.",
