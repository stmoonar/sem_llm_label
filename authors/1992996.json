            "abstract": "Academic Search is a timeless challenge that the field of Information Retrieval has been dealing with for many years. Even today, the search for academic material is a broad field of research that recently started working on problems like the COVID-19 pandemic. However, test collections and specialized data sets like CORD-19 only allow for system-oriented experiments, while the evaluation of algorithms in real-world environments is only available to researchers from industry. In LiLAS, we open up two academic search platforms to allow participating research to evaluate their systems in a Docker-based research environment. This overview paper describes the motivation, infrastructure, and two systems LIVIVO and GESIS Search that are part of this CLEF lab.",

            "abstract": "Involving users in early phases of software development has become a common strategy as it enables developers to consider user needs from the beginning. Once a system is in production, new opportunities to observe, evaluate and learn from users emerge as more information becomes available. Gathering information from users to continuously evaluate their behavior is a common practice for commercial software, while the Cranfield paradigm remains the preferred option for Information Retrieval (IR) and recommendation systems in the academic world. Here we introduce the Infrastructures for Living Labs STELLA project which aims to create an evaluation infrastructure allowing experimental systems to run along production web-based academic search systems with real users. STELLA combines user interactions and log files analyses to enable large-scale A/B experiments for academic search.",

However, finding appropriate research data is difficult. One possible way to alleviate the situation is to recommend research data to scholarly search system users based on the research articles they are searching. With LiLAS, the lab organizers provide the opportunity i) to present such recommendations to users of the live system GESIS Search and ii) to evaluate the experimental recommender system in this live system with its actual users. As part of our participation in LiLAS, we computed a simple method for recommending research data and evaluated our approach in two rounds each lasting approximately one month. For our approach, we applied the classical TF-IDF method to rank the research data by their relevance to existing publications. We measure our method\u2019s usefulness using user feedback, i.e., simple clicks on the recommendations. In both rounds, our experimental system obtained almost the same outcomes as the baseline.",

Here we show that the way social groups interact in face-toface situations can enable the emergence of degree inequality. We present a mechanism that integrates group mixing dynamics with individual preferences, which reproduces group degree inequality found in six empirical data sets of face-to-face interactions. We uncover the impact of group-size imbalance on degree inequality, revealing a critical minority group size that changes social gatherings qualitatively. If the minority group is larger than this \u2018critical mass\u2019 size, it can be a well-connected, cohesive group; if it is smaller, minority cohesion widens degree inequality. Finally, we expose the underrepresentation of social groups in degree rankings due to mixing dynamics and propose a way to reduce such biases.",

            "abstract": "In scholarly search systems, computing recommendations of the same type, for example, additional publications when reading a particular publication, is a well-approached problem. However, suggesting items from another type, e.g., research data when reading a publication, is rarely covered in scholarly recommendations. In this position paper, we employ word embeddings to approach the problem of such cross-domain recommendations in scientific search systems, more specifically, recommending research data based on publications. Besides various metadata, publication and research dataset entries comprise textual metadata (e.g. title, abstract), which allows to detect similar entries using word embeddings. We illustrate first results, major problems and possible solutions when using word embeddings for recommending datasets based on publications.",

However, often it is difficult or not even possible to reproduce an online evaluation, as solely a few data providers give access to their system, and if they do, it is limited in time and typically only during an official challenge. To alleviate the situation, we propose STELLA: a living lab infrastructure with consistent access to a data provider\u2019s system, which can be used to train and evaluate searchand recommender algorithms. In this position paper, we align STELLA\u2019s architecture to the PRIMAD model and its six different components specifying reproducibility in online evaluations and illustrate two use cases with two academic search systems.",

            "abstract": "Reusing terms from Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies when modeling data as Linked Open Data (LOD) is difficult and without additional guidance far from trivial. This work proposes and evaluates TermPicker: a novel approach alleviating this situation by recommending vocabulary terms based on the information how other data providers modeled their data as LOD. TermPicker gathers such information and represents it via so- called schema-level patterns (SLPs), which are used to calculate a ranked list of RDF vocabulary term recommendations. The ranking of the recommendations is based either on the machine learning approach \"Learning To Rank\" (L2R) or on the data mining approach \"Association Rule\" mining (AR). TermPicker is evaluated in a two-fold way. First, an automated cross-validation evaluates TermPicker\u2019s prediction based on the Mean Average Precision (MAP) as well as the Mean Reciprocal Rank at the first five positions (MRR@5). Second, a user study examines which of the recommendation methods (L2R vs. AR) aids real users more to reuse RDF vocabulary terms in a practical setting. The participants, i.e., TermPicker\u2019s potential users, are asked to reuse vocabulary terms while modeling three data sets as LOD, but they receive either L2R-based recommendations, AR-based recommendation, or no recommendations. The results of the cross-validation show that using SLPs, TermPicker achieves 35% higher MAP and MRR@5 values compared to using solely the features based on the typical reuse strategies. Both the L2R-based and the AR-based recommendation methods were able to calculate lists of recommendations with MAP = 0.75 and MRR@5 = 0.80. However, the results of the user study show that the majority of the participants favor the AR-based recommendations. The outcome of this work demonstrates that TermPicker alleviates the situation of searching for classes and properties used by other data providers on the LOD cloud for representing similar data.",

            "abstract": "Recommender-system datasets are used for recommender-system evaluations, training machine-learning algorithms, and exploring user behavior. While there are many datasets for recommender systems in the domains of movies, books, and music, there are rather few datasets from research-paper recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RARD, the Related-Article Recommendation Dataset, from the digital library Sowiport and the recommendation-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib. The dataset contains information about 57.4 million recommendations that were displayed to the users of Sowiport. Information includes details on which recommendation approaches were used (e.g. content-based filtering, stereotype, most popular), what types of features were used in content based filtering (simple terms vs. keyphrases), where the features were extracted from (title or abstract), and the time when recommendations were delivered and clicked. In addition, the dataset contains an implicit item-item rating matrix that was created based on the recommendation click logs. RARD enables researchers to train machine learning algorithms for research-paper recommendations, perform offline evaluations, and do research on data from Mr. DLib's recommender system, without implementing a recommender system themselves. In the field of scientific recommender systems, our dataset is unique. To the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset with more (implicit) ratings available, and that many variations of recommendation algorithms.
