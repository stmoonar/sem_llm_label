            "title": "Representative and Back-In-Time Sampling from Real-world Hypergraphs",
            "abstract": "Graphs are widely used for representing pairwise interactions in complex systems. Since such real-world graphs are large and often evergrowing, sampling subgraphs is useful for various purposes, including simulation, visualization, stream processing, representation learning, and crawling. However, many complex systems consist of group interactions (e.g., collaborations of researchers and discussions on online Q&A platforms) and thus are represented more naturally and accurately by hypergraphs than by ordinary graphs. Motivated by the prevalence of large-scale hypergraphs, we study the problem of sampling from real-world hypergraphs, aiming at answering (Q1) how can we measure the goodness of sub-hypergraphs, and (Q2) how can we efficiently find a \u201cgood\u201d sub-hypergraph. Regarding Q1, we distinguish between two goals: (a) representative sampling, which aims at capturing the characteristics of the input hypergraph, and (b) back-in-time sampling, which aims at closely approximating a past snapshot of the input time-evolving hypergraph. To evaluate the similarity of the sampled sub-hypergraph to the target (i.e., the input hypergraph or its past snapshot), we consider 10 graph-level, hyperedge-level, and node-level statistics. Regarding Q2, we first conduct a thorough analysis of various intuitive approaches using 11 real-world hypergraphs. Then, based on this analysis, we propose MiDaS and MiDaS-B, designed for representative sampling and back-in-time sampling, respectively. Regarding representative sampling, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that MiDaS, which employs a sampling bias toward high-degree nodes in hyperedge selection, is (a) Representative: finding overall the most representative samples among 15 considered approaches, (b) Fast: several orders of magnitude faster than the strongest competitors, and (c) Automatic: automatically tuning the degree of sampling bias. Regarding back-in-time sampling, we demonstrate that MiDaS-B inherits the strengths of MiDaS despite an additional challenge\u2014the unavailability of the target (i.e., past snapshot). It effectively handles this challenge by focusing on replicating universal evolutionary patterns, rather than directly replicating the target.",

            "title": "VilLain: Self-Supervised Learning on Homogeneous Hypergraphs without Features via Virtual Label Propagation",
            "abstract": "Group interactions arise in various scenarios in real-world systems: collaborations of researchers, co-purchases of products, and discussions in online Q&A sites, to name a few. Such higher-order relations are naturally modeled as hypergraphs, which consist of hyperedges (i.e., any-sized subsets of nodes). For hypergraphs, the challenge to learn node representation when features or labels are not available is imminent, given that (a) most real-world hypergraphs are not equipped with external features while (b) most existing approaches for hypergraph learning resort to additional information. Thus, in this work, we propose VilLain, a novel self-supervised hypergraph representation learning method based on the propagation of virtual labels (v-labels). Specifically, we learn for each node a sparse probability distribution over v-labels as its feature vector, and we propagate the vectors to construct the final node embeddings. Inspired by higher-order label homogeneity, which we discover in real-world hypergraphs, we design novel self-supervised loss functions for the v-labels to reproduce the higher-order structure-label pattern. We demonstrate that VilLain is: (a) Requirement-free: learning node embeddings without relying on node labels and features, (b) Versatile: giving embeddings that are not specialized to specific tasks but generalizable to diverse downstream tasks, and (c) Accurate: more accurate than its competitors for node classification, hyperedge prediction, node clustering, and node retrieval tasks.

            "title": "A Survey on Hypergraph Mining: Patterns, Tools, and Generators",
            "abstract": "Hypergraphs are a natural and powerful choice for modeling group interactions in the real world, which are often referred to as higher-order networks. For example, when modeling collaboration networks, where collaborations can involve not just two but three or more people, employing hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for learning and mining on hypergraphs, and hypergraph mining, which seeks to enhance our understanding of underlying systems through hypergraph modeling, gained increasing attention in research. Researchers have discovered various structural patterns in real-world hypergraphs, leading to the development of mining tools. Moreover, they have designed generators with the aim of reproducing and thereby shedding light on these patterns. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for them, and we also provide in-depth discussions to provide insights into future research on hypergraph mining.",

            "title": "Hypergraph Motifs and Their Extensions Beyond Binary",
            "abstract": "Hypergraphs naturally represent group interactions, which are omnipresent in many domains: collaborations of researchers, co-purchases of items, and joint interactions of proteins, to name a few. In this work, we propose tools for answering the following questions: (Q1) what are the structural design principles of real-world hypergraphs? (Q2) how can we compare local structures of hypergraphs of different sizes? (Q3) how can we identify domains from which hypergraphs are? We first define hypergraph motifs (h-motifs), which describe the overlapping patterns of three connected hyperedges. Then, we define the significance of each h-motif in a hypergraph as its occurrences relative to those in properly randomized hypergraphs. Lastly, we define the characteristic profile (CP) as the vector of the normalized significance of every h-motif. Regarding Q1, we find that h-motifs' occurrences in 11 real-world hypergraphs from 5 domains are clearly distinguished from those of randomized hypergraphs. Then, we demonstrate that CPs capture local structural patterns unique to each domain, and thus comparing CPs of hypergraphs addresses Q2 and Q3. The concept of CP is extended to represent the connectivity pattern of each node or hyperedge as a vector, which proves useful in node classification and hyperedge prediction. Our algorithmic contribution is to propose MoCHy, a family of parallel algorithms for counting h-motifs' occurrences in a hypergraph. We theoretically analyze their speed and accuracy and show empirically that the advanced approximate version MoCHy-A+ is more accurate and faster than the basic approximate and exact versions, respectively. Furthermore, we explore ternary hypergraph motifs that extends h-motifs by taking into account not only the presence but also the cardinality of intersections among hyperedges. This extension proves beneficial for all previously mentioned applications.",
