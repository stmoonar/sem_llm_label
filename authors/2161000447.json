            "abstract": "Suicide is a serious public health issue, but it is preventable with timely intervention. Emerging studies have suggested there is a noticeable increase in the number of individuals sharing suicidal thoughts online. As a result, utilising advance Natural Language Processing techniques to build automated systems for risk assessment is a viable alternative. However, existing systems are prone to incorrectly predicting risk severity and have no early detection mechanisms. Therefore, we propose RISE, a novel robust mechanism for accurate early detection of suicide risk by ensembling Hyperbolic Internal Classifiers equipped with an abstention mechanism and early-exit inference capabilities. Through quantitative, qualitative and ablative experiments, we demonstrate RISE as an efficient and robust human-in-the-loop approach for risk assessment over the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (C-SSRS) and CLPsych 2022 datasets. It is able to successfully abstain from 84% incorrect predictions on Reddit data while out-predicting state of the art models upto 3.5x earlier.",

            "abstract": "Steganography is the art of hiding a secret message signal inside a publicly visible carrier with minimum perceptual loss in the carrier. In order to better hide information, it is critical to optimally represent the message-carrier wave interference while blending the message with the carrier. We propose HyperSteg: a novel steganography method in the hyperbolic space grounded in the hyperbolic properties of wave interference. Through hyperbolic learning, HyperSteg learns to better represent the hyperbolic properties of message-carrier interference with minimum additional computational cost. Through extensive experiments over image and audio datasets, we introduce HyperSteg as a practical, model and modality agnostic approach for information hiding.",

AI-assisted early detection of suicide risk and stress levels using a user\u2019s activity on online forums and social media websites has shown great promise previously. In addition to this, emerging large language models have shown massive potential to provide state-of-the-art-performance for downstream tasks like text classification. Therefore, we attempt to apply one such large language model, GPT3.5 turbo to mental health applications with 3 datasets spanning suicide risk severity and stress presence classification. We also study the inherent demographic biases induced in these models as a result of polluted pretraining data and find that the model consistently estimates the mental health status of young females between the ages of 18 and 30 years best.",

            "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a relatively unexplored class of assets. Designing strategies to forecast NFT trends is an intricate task due to its extremely volatile nature. The market is largely driven by public sentiment and \"hype\", which in turn has a high correlation with conversations taking place on social media platforms like Twitter. Prior work done for modelling stock market data does not take into account the extent of impact certain highly influential tweets and their authors can have on the market. Building on these limitations and the nature of the NFT market, we propose a novel reach-aware temporal learning approach to make predictions for forecasting future trends in the NFT market. We perform experiments on a new dataset consisting of over 1.3 million tweets and 180 thousand NFT transactions spanning over 15 NFT collections curated by us. Our model (TA-NFT) outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by an average of 36%. Through extensive quantitative and ablative analysis, we demonstrate the ability of our approach as a practical method for predicting NFT trends.",

Despite its merits, the sample selection process in mixup is random, which might make it difficult for the model to generalize better and converge faster. We propose CIAug, a novel curriculum-based learning method that builds upon mixup. It leverages the relative position of samples in hyperbolic embedding space as a complexity measure to gradually mix up increasingly difficult and diverse samples along training. CIAug achieves state-of-the-art results over existing interpolative augmentation methods on 10 benchmark datasets across 4 languages in text classification and named-entity recognition tasks. It also converges and achieves benchmark F1 scores 3 times faster. We empirically analyze the various components of CIAug, and evaluate its robustness against adversarial attacks.",
