            "title": "Maxileximin Envy Allocations and Connected Goods",
            "abstract": "Fair allocation of indivisible goods presents intriguing challenges from both a social choice perspective and an algorithmic standpoint. Due to the indivisibility of goods, it is common for one agent to envy the bundle of goods assigned to another agent and, indeed, envy-free solutions do not exist in general. In line with the classical game-theoretic concept of Nucleolus in coalitional games, we propose that a fair allocation should minimize the agents\u2019 dissatisfaction profile in a lexicographic manner, where the dissatisfaction of an agent is defined as her maximum envy towards other agents. Therefore, we seek allocations that minimize the maximum envy. In cases where multiple solutions have an equal maximum value, we minimize the second-worst value, and so on. Additionally, as is customary in fair division problems, we also consider an efficiency requirement: among the allocations with the best agents\u2019 dissatisfaction profile, we prioritize those that maximize the sum of agents\u2019 utilities, known as maximum social welfare. Such allocations, referred to as maxileximin allocations, always exist.\nIn this study, we analyze the computational properties of maxileximin allocations in the context of fair allocation problems with constraints. Specifically, we focus on the Connected Fair Division problem, where goods correspond to the nodes of a graph, and a bundle of goods is allowed if the subgraph formed by those goods is connected. We demonstrate that the problem is F\u2206P2 -complete, even for instances with simple graphical structures such as path and star graphs.\nHowever, we identify islands of tractability for instances with more intricate graphs, such as those having bounded treewidth, provided that the number of agents is bounded by a fixed number and utility functions use small values.",

The paper proposes a novel architecture, named GIDnet, to address this inverse design problem, which is based on exploring a suitably defined latent space associated with the possible designs. Among its distinguishing features, GIDnet is capable of identifying the most appropriate starting point for the exploration and of likely converging into a point corresponding to a design that is a feasible one. Results of a thorough experimental activity evidence that GIDnet outperforms earlier approaches in the literature.",

            "abstract": "LTL on finite traces (LTLf ) is a logic that attracted much attention in recent literature, for its ability to formalize the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in several application domains. However, its practical usage is still rather limited, as LTLf cannot deal with any quantitative aspect, such as with the costs of realizing some desired behaviour. The paper fills the gap by proposing a weighting framework for LTLf encoding such quantitative aspects in the traces over which it is evaluated. The complexity of reasoning problems on weighted traces is analyzed and compared to that of standard LTLf, by considering arbitrary formulas as well as classes of formulas defined in terms of relevant syntactic restrictions. Moreover, a reasoner for LTL on weighted finite traces is presented, and its performances are assessed on benchmark data.",

            "abstract": "Security Games have been used in several different fields to randomise the division of limited resources and thus maximise the possibility of securing a set of targets. For this very practical purpose it is natural to consider primarily mixed strategies, but such focus omits some theoretical properties of the games discussed. In this paper we discuss the existence and properties of pure Nash equilibria in security games. We give an overview of the basic observations that can be made in this setting. We also recognize an interesting problem in a case with multiple players playing a security game asynchronously, propose an algorithm for finding a strategy for any given player in the mentioned case and prove that the strategy profile resulting from the algorithm is in fact a Nash equilibrium and, even stronger, a subgame perfect equilibrium. We think that these findings are a nice supplement of the practical approach to Security Games and allow to form new research questions.",

            "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute on blockchains when some conditions are verified. They encode the legally relevant events needed to satisfy the terms of an agreement and are usually defined by using procedural languages, even if some recent proposals investigated the possibility of using logic formalisms. However, existing logic-based initiatives are rather limited since they only enable the formal checking of properties of a single smart contract, totally neglecting its possible interactions with other smart contracts running on the same blockchain. This paper proposes a framework, called SCRea, that works on a set of smart contracts specified as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. SCRea enables to reason about smart contracts considered individually or by considering them as running cooperatively or competitively on the same blockchain.",

            "abstract": ". The social proof marketing strategy assumes that the marketer provides a novel product for free to some users of a social network and then promptly recommends the product to other users, by informing them that a number of their friends are already using it. In this paper we study this popular marketing strategy in scenarios where the new product enters in markets where two old products are already competing. We show that if customers tend to adopt the product that is the most popular one (over the three alternative products) among their friends, then this marketing strategy allows to maximize the diffusion of the new product only on a narrow class of networks. Moreover, even if we focus on this narrow class of networks, computing the best order of the recommendations is computationally intractable. Instead, if customers are less prone to change their mind, that is, if they are willing to adopt some product only when an absolute majority of their friends has already agreed on it, then the marketing strategy always works well and, furthermore, an optimal order of recommendations can be computed in polynomial time.",

            "abstract": "Maximin share is a compelling notion of fairness proposed by Buddish as a relaxation of more traditional concepts for fair allocations of indivisible goods. In this paper we consider this notion within a setting where bundles of goods must induce connected subsets over an underlying graph. This setting received much attention in earlier literature, and our study answers a number of questions that were left open. First, we show that computing maximin share allocations is F\u03942P-complete, even when focusing on consistent scenarios, that is, where such allocations are a-priori guaranteed to exist. Moreover, the problem remains intractable if all agents have the same type, i.e., have the same utility functions, and if either the values returned by the utility functions are polynomially bounded, or the underlying graphs have a low degree of cyclicity (more precisely, have bounded treewidth). However, if these conditions hold all together, then computing maximin share allocations (or checking that none exists) becomes tractable. The result is established via machineries based on logspace alternating machines that use partial representations of connected bundles, which are interesting in their own.",

            "abstract": "Opinion diffusion has been largely studied in the literature on settings where the opinion whose spread has to be maximized, say white, competes against one opinion only, say black. For instance, for diffusion mechanisms modeled in terms of best response dynamics over majority agents (who change their opinion as to conform it to the majority of their neighbors), it is known that the spread can be maximized via certain greedy dynamics that can be computed in polynomial time. This setting is precisely the one considered in the paper. However, differently from earlier literature, it is assumed that one further opinion, say gray, is available to the agents. Moving from the observation that, with the third alternative to hand, greedy dynamics can dramatically fail to maximize the spread of opinion \\emphwhite, the paper then embarks in thorough computational, algorithmic and experimental studies. The picture that emerges is totally different from what is known for the case when two opinions are available only. Indeed, it is shown that greedy dynamics can dramatically fail in maximizing the spread. In particular, deciding whether there exists a dynamics that can spread the opinion white to at least k agents or can reach a consensus is shown to be intractable, formally $\\NP$-hard. On the other hand, islands of tractability based on certain structural properties of the interaction graph are identified. Finally, experimental results are discussed, which shed lights on opinion diffusion in real social networks.",

Within this setting, questions related to which extent a minority/majority can spread the opinion it supports to the other agents are considered. It is shown that if there are only two available opinions, no matter of the underlying social graph G = (N,E), there is always a group formed by a half of the agents that can annihilate the opposite opinion. A polynomial-time algorithm to compute a group of agents enjoying these properties is also devised and analyzed. The result marks the boundary of tractability, since the influence power of minorities is shown to depend on certain features of the underlying graphs, which are NP-hard to be identified.
