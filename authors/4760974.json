            "title": "Federated Few-shot Learning",
            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a machine learning model without exchanging their own local data. In this way, the server can exploit the computational power of all clients and train the model on a larger set of data samples among all clients. Although such a mechanism is proven to be effective in various fields, existing works generally assume that each client preserves sufficient data for training. In practice, however, certain clients can only contain a limited number of samples (i.e., few-shot samples). For example, the available photo data taken by a specific user with a new mobile device is relatively rare. In this scenario, existing FL efforts typically encounter a significant performance drop on these clients. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a few-shot model that can generalize to clients with limited data under the FL scenario. In this paper, we refer to this novel problem as federated few-shot learning. Nevertheless, the problem remains challenging due to two major reasons: the global data variance among clients (i.e., the difference in data distributions among clients) and the local data insufficiency in each client (i.e., the lack of adequate local data for training). To overcome these two challenges, we propose a novel federated few-shot learning framework with two separately updated models and dedicated training strategies to reduce the adverse impact of global data variance and local data insufficiency. Extensive experiments on four prevalent datasets that cover news articles and images validate the effectiveness of our framework compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great power in learning node representations on graphs. However, they may inherit historical prejudices from training data, leading to discriminatory bias in predictions. Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness.",

            "abstract": "Modeling the behaviors of drug-target-disease interactions is crucial in the early stage of drug discovery and holds great promise for precision medicine and personalized treatments. The growing availability of new types of data on the internet brings great opportunity of learning a more comprehensive relationship among drugs, targets, and diseases. However, existing methods often consider drug-target interactions or drug-disease interactions separately, which ignores the dependencies among these three entities. Also, many of them cannot directly incorporate rich heterogeneous information from diverse sources. In this work, we investigate the utility of tensor factorization to model the relationships of drug-target-disease, specifically leveraging different types of online data. Our motivation is two-fold. First, in human metabolic systems, many drugs interact with protein targets in cells to modulate target activities, which in turn alter biological pathways to promote healthy functions and to treat diseases. Instead of binary relationships of  or , a tighter triple relationships  should be exploited to better understand drug mechanism of actions (MoAs). Second, medical data could be collected from different sources (i.e., drug's chemical structure, target's sequence, or expression measurements). Therefore, effectively exploiting the complementarity among multiple sources is of great importance. Our method elegantly explores a  tensor together with complementarity among different data sources, thus improves prediction accuracy. We achieve this goal by formulating the problem into a coupled tensor-matrix factorization problem and directly optimize it on the nonlinear manifold. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms several competitive methods. Our model opens up opportunities to use large Web data to predict drugs' MoAs in pharmacological studies.",

            "abstract": "Personalized treatments and targeted therapies are the most promising approaches to treat complex human diseases. However, drug resistance is often acquired after treatments. To reduce drug resistance, combinational drug therapies have been considered as a promising strategy in drug discovery. Moreover, the emerging of large-scale genomic, chemical and biomedical data provides new opportunities for drug combinations. In this work, we propose a network approach, called MCDC, that integrates multiple data sources describing drugs, target proteins, and diseases to predict beneficial drug combination. Specifically, MCDC integrates diverse drug-related information (e.g., chemical structure, target profile), disease-related information (e.g., disease phynotype), together with their interactions to construct a two-layer heterogeneous network. MCDC then predicts drug combinations for each disease using a link prediction algorithm. Due to the nature of data collection, missing data is common in systematic integration of these heterogeneous data. We further develop a multiple incomplete view learning algorithm to address the issue of missing data. Extensive experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms several network-based methods. Our approach has great potential to accelerate the development of drug combination treatments.",

In the cross-domain scenarios, we may improve predictive accuracy in one domain by transferring knowledge from the other, which alleviates the data sparsity issue. However, the relatedness of these domains can be exploited by a malicious party to launch data poisoning attacks. Here we study the vulnerability of cross-domain recommendation under data poisoning attacks. We show that data poisoning attacks can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem.

Context-aware recommendations are thus critical to improve both quality and explainability of recommender systems, compared to traditional recommendations that are solely based on user-item interactions. Tensor factorization machines have achieved the state-of-the-art performance due to their capability of integrating users, items, and contextual factors in one unify way. However, few work has focused on the robustness of a context-aware recommender system. Improving the robustness of a tensor-based model is challenging due to the sparsity of the observed tensor and the multi-linear nature of tensor factorization. In this paper, we propose ATF, a model that combines tensor factorization and adversarial learning for context-aware recommendations. Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of tensor factorization, while enhancing the robustness of a recommender model, and thus improves its eventual performance. Empirical studies on two real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms standard tensor-based methods.",

            "abstract": "Personalized treatments and targeted therapies are the most promising approaches to treat complex diseases, especially for cancer. However, drug resistance is often acquired after treatments. To overcome or reduce drug resistance, treatments using drug combinations have been actively investigated in the literature. Existing methods mainly focus on chemical properties of drugs for potential combination therapies without considering relationships among different diseases. Also, they often do not consider the rich knowledge of drugs and diseases, which can enhance the prediction of drug combinations. This motivates us to develop a new computational method that can predict the beneficial drug combinations. We propose DrugCom, a tensor-based framework for computing drug combinations across different diseases by integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources of drugs and diseases. DrugCom first constructs a primary third-order tensor (i.e., drug\u00d7drug \u00d7disease) and several similarity matrices from multiple data sources regarding drugs (e.g., chemical structure) and diseases (e.g., disease phenotype). DrugCom then formulates an objective function, which simultaneously factorizes coupled tensor and matrices to reveal the molecular mechanisms of drug synergy. We adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to effectively solve the optimization problem. Extensive experimental studies using real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance of DrugCom.",

            "title": "Exploiting Structural and Temporal Evolution in Dynamic Link Prediction",
            "abstract": "Link prediction in dynamic networks is an important task with many real-life applications in different domains, such as social networks, cyber-physical systems, and bioinformatics. There are two key processes in dynamic networks: network structural evolution and network temporal evolution, where the former represents interdependency between entities and their neighbors in the network at each timestamp, while the latter captures the evolving behavior of the entire network from the current timestamp to the next. Structural evolution generally assumes that a node is more likely to co-evolve with its neighbors in the near future. Temporal evolution focuses on the trend of network evolution as a whole, based on the accumulation of historical data. It is thus essential to use characteristics of both structural and temporal evolutions to emulate complex behaviors of dynamic networks. However, very few existing work considered both processes. In addition, real-life networks are often very sparse with limited observed links. A missing link between two nodes does not always imply that the two nodes do not have a relation in reality, especially when they share many common neighbors. Most existing methods only focus on the first-order proximity of networks, which is usually insufficient to capture the relationships among nodes. In this work, we propose a novel framework named STEP, to simultaneously integrate both structural and temporal information in link prediction in dynamic networks. STEP first constructs a sequence of higher-order proximity matrices to better capture the implicit relationships among nodes. A regularized optimization problem is then formulated to model those higher-order proximity matrices along with additional structural and temporal constraints. Given the large scale of modern networks, we also develop an efficient block coordinate gradient descent approach to solve the optimization problem efficiently. STEP can be used to solve the link prediction problem in directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted dynamic networks. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets demonstrate that STEP can effectively model link propagation over entire time-varying networks and its superiority over some state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Drug repositioning is a promising strategy in drug discovery. New biomedical insights of drug-target-disease relationships are important in drug repositioning, and such relationships have been intensively studied recently. Most of the studies utilize network-based computational approaches based on drug and disease similarities. However, one common limitation of existing approaches is that both drug similarities and disease similarities are defined based on a single feature of drugs/diseases. In reality, the relationships between drug (or disease) pairs can be characterized based on many different features. Therefore, it is increasingly important to include them in drug repositioning studies. In this study, we propose a flexible and robust multi-source learning (FRMSL) framework to integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources for drug-disease association predictions. We first construct a two-layer heterogeneous network consisting of drug nodes, disease nodes and known drug-disease relationships. The drug repositioning problem can thus be treated as a missing link prediction problem on the heterogeneous graph and can be solved using Kronecker regularized least square (KronRLS) method. Multiple data sources describing drugs and diseases are incorporated into the framework using similarity-based kernels. In practice, a great challenge in such data integration projects is the data incompleteness problem due to the nature of data generation and collection. To address this issue, we develop a novel multi-view learning algorithm based on symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SymNMF). Extensive experimental studies show that our framework outperforms several recent network-based methods.",

Such rich side sources can provide very useful information about users' personal behaviors and items' properties, therefore can significantly benefit recommender systems. Most existing work can only incorporate a single side source of users or items. In many real-life applications, however, there exist multiple side sources for both users and items, which may be constructed from multiple domains. To incorporate multiple sources, we propose a flexible and robust algorithm called MSUI (Learning Multiple Similarities of Users and Items). The key idea of MSUI is to simultaneously capture the associations between latent factors in the U-I matrix and multiple side sources of users and items through joint nonnegative matrix factorization. MSUI has several advantages over existing methods. First, it seamlessly integrates information from the U-I matrix and information from multiple side sources. Second, by incorporating multiple sources that are usually in complementary, it's more robust to noise contained in each source. Finally, it provides a unified framework that can be easily extended to incorporate additional data sources.",
