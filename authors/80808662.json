            "title": "CAMEO: Fostering Joint Conversational Search and Recommendation",
            "abstract": "The rising popularity of conversational agents for accessing information stems from their natural language dialogue-based interaction, facilitating usability for a broad spectrum of users, including the elderly, children, and visually impaired individuals. Among others, two tasks that benefit the most conversational agents are search and recommendation: in the former, the user receives factual information by asking the agent; in the latter, the system refines its knowledge of the user\u2019s needs by posing them a sequence of questions. This work discusses the observations and findings of the first CAMEO (Conversational Agents: Mastering, Evaluating, Optimizing) project retreat. The retreat focused on similarities and differences of conversational search and recommendation to identify the path to construct a joint conversational search and recommendation system. Our observations highlight how all the conversational search/recommendation systems can be categorized using two axes: \u201cexploration-disambiguation\u201d and \u201csearch-recommendation\u201d. The first axis describes whether the question aims to gain knowledge over something unknown or allows to refine already available knowledge. The second axis describes if the user\u2019s interest is in gaining knowledge or obtaining a recommendation. Additionally, we provide insights on obtaining a dataset that can be used to train/test such a joint system. Finally, we describe how the CAMEO project will address the product search task, which we believe is the scenario where the joint conversational search and recommendation system would be the most effective.",

            "abstract": "The LLMJudge challenge is organized as part of the LLM4Eval workshop at SIGIR 2024. Test collections are essential for evaluating information retrieval (IR) systems. The evaluation and tuning of a search system is largely based on relevance labels, which indicate whether a document is useful for a specific search and user. However, collecting relevance judgments on a large scale is costly and resource-intensive. Consequently, typical experiments rely on third-party labelers who may not always produce accurate annotations. The LLMJudge challenge aims to explore an alternative approach by using LLMs to generate relevance judgments. Recent studies have shown that LLMs can generate reliable relevance judgments for search systems. However, it remains unclear which LLMs can match the accuracy of human labelers, which prompts are most effective, how fine-tuned open-source LLMs compare to closed-source LLMs like GPT-4, whether there are biases in synthetically generated data, and if data leakage affects the quality of generated labels. This challenge will investigate these questions, and the collected data will be released as a package to support automatic relevance judgment research in information retrieval and search.",

            "abstract": "We describe our software submission to the ECIR 2024 Workshop on Open Web Search [1]. We submit the query performance prediction toolkit qpptk that comes with 12 performance predictors to substantially simplify the re-use of those predictors in ad-hoc retrieval experiments. Therefore, we have extended qpptk so that it can run in TIREx and that it can process arbitrary workloads using ir_datasets and PyTerrier indices as inputs. We execute qpptk on all 23 test collections in TIREx that have PyTerrier indices available and make their predictions and the Docker image publicly available. Thereby, subsequent retrieval experiments can easily re-use the predictions by just downloading a few kilobytes, instead of having to run the system on their machine (which is still possible, e.g., by executing the Docker image on new or modi\ufb01ed inputs). Our analysis on the 23 test collections highlights predictor performance variability, emphasizing the importance of standardized baselines and evaluation methods. Openly sharing predictions aims to enhance research accessibility, promoting broader utilization of query performance predictors and inspiring the development of novel prediction and evaluation techniques.",

            "abstract": "Ensuring the effectiveness of search queries while protecting user privacy remains an open issue. When an Information Retrieval System (IRS) does not protect the privacy of its users, sensitive information may be disclosed through the queries sent to the system. Recent improvements, especially in NLP, have shown the potential of using Differential Privacy to obfuscate texts while maintaining satisfactory effectiveness. However, such approaches may protect the user's privacy only from a theoretical perspective while, in practice, the real user's information need can still be inferred if perturbed terms are too semantically similar to the original ones. We overcome such limitations by proposing Word Blending Boxes, a novel differentially private mechanism for query obfuscation, which protects the words in the user queries by employing safe boxes. To measure the overall effectiveness of the proposed WBB mechanism, we measure the privacy obtained by the obfuscation process, i.e., the lexical and semantic similarity between original and obfuscated queries. Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of the privatized queries in retrieving relevant documents from the IRS. Our findings indicate that WBB can be integrated effectively into existing IRSs, offering a key to the challenge of protecting user privacy from both a theoretical and a practical point of view.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing have led to significant developments in the way users interact with search engines, with traditional one-shot textual queries being replaced by multi-turn conversations. As a highly interactive search scenario, Conversational Search (CS) can significantly benefit from Query Performance Prediction (QPP) techniques. However, the application of QPP in the CS domain is a relatively new field and requires proper framing. This study proposes a set of spatial-based QPP models, designed to work effectively in the conversational search domain, where dense neural retrieval models are the most common approach and query cutoffs are small. The proposed QPP approaches are shown to improve the predictive performance over the state-of-the-art in different scenarios and collections, highlighting the utility of QPP in the CS domain.",
