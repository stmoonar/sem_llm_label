            "abstract": "While previous chapters focused on recommendation systems (RSs) based on standardized, non-verbal user feedback such as purchases, views, and clicks -- the advent of LLMs has unlocked the use of natural language (NL) interactions for recommendation. This chapter discusses how LLMs' abilities for general NL reasoning present novel opportunities to build highly personalized RSs -- which can effectively connect nuanced and diverse user preferences to items, potentially via interactive dialogues. To begin this discussion, we first present a taxonomy of the key data sources for language-driven recommendation, covering item descriptions, user-system interactions, and user profiles. We then proceed to fundamental techniques for LLM recommendation, reviewing the use of encoder-only and autoregressive LLM recommendation in both tuned and untuned settings. Afterwards, we move to multi-module recommendation architectures in which LLMs interact with components such as retrievers and RSs in multi-stage pipelines. This brings us to architectures for conversational recommender systems (CRSs), in which LLMs facilitate multi-turn dialogues where each turn presents an opportunity not only to make recommendations, but also to engage with the user in interactive preference elicitation, critiquing, and question-answering.",

            "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts. Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models. This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved tremendous success in the field of Natural Language Processing owing to diverse training paradigms that empower LLMs to effectively capture intricate linguistic patterns and semantic representations. In particular, the recent\"pre-train, prompt and predict\"training paradigm has attracted significant attention as an approach for learning generalizable models with limited labeled data. In line with this advancement, these training paradigms have recently been adapted to the recommendation domain and are seen as a promising direction in both academia and industry. This half-day tutorial aims to provide a thorough understanding of extracting and transferring knowledge from pre-trained models learned through different training paradigms to improve recommender systems from various perspectives, such as generality, sparsity, effectiveness and trustworthiness. In this tutorial, we first introduce the basic concepts and a generic architecture of the language modeling paradigm for recommendation purposes. Then, we focus on recent advancements in adapting LLM-related training strategies and optimization objectives for different recommendation tasks. After that, we will systematically introduce ethical issues in LLM-based recommender systems and discuss possible approaches to assessing and mitigating them. We will also summarize the relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and an empirical study on the recommendation performance of training paradigms. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a discussion of open challenges and future directions.",

            "abstract": "Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems, generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities, Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond. Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area. This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation. Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.",

We analyse user preferences over different clarification modes of text, image, and combination of both through crowdsourcing by taking into account image and text quality, clarity, and relevance. Our findings demonstrate that users generally prefer multi-modal clarification over uni-modal approaches. We explore the use of automated image generation techniques and compare the quality, relevance, and user preference of model-generated images with human-collected ones. The study reveals that text-to-image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion, can effectively generate multi-modal clarification questions.

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition that when machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to automate decisions, they may mistreat individuals or groups, with legal, ethical, or economic implications. Recommender systems are prominent examples of these machine learning (ML) systems that aid users in making decisions. The majority of past literature research on RS fairness treats user and item fairness concerns independently, ignoring the fact that recommender systems function in a two-sided marketplace. In this paper, we propose CP-FairRank, an optimization-based re-ranking algorithm that seamlessly integrates fairness constraints from both the consumer and producer side in a joint objective framework. The framework is generalizable and may take into account varied fairness settings based on group segmentation, recommendation model selection, and domain, which is one of its key characteristics. For instance, we demonstrate that the system may jointly increase consumer and producer fairness when (un)protected consumer groups are defined on the basis of their activity level and main-streamness, while producer groups are defined according to their popularity level. For empirical validation, through large-scale on eight datasets and four mainstream collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation models, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy is able to improve both consumer and producer fairness without compromising or very little overall recommendation quality, demonstrating the role algorithms may play in avoiding data biases. Our results on different group segmentation also indicate that the amount of improvement can vary and is dependent on group segmentation, indicating that the amount of bias produced and how much the algorithm can improve it depend on the protected group definition, a factor that, to our knowledge, has not been examined in great depth in previous studies but rather is highlighted by the results discovered in this study.",

            "abstract": "\n This paper explores the biases inherent in ChatGPT-based recommender systems, focusing on provider fairness (item-side fairness). Through extensive experiments and over a thousand API calls, we investigate the impact of prompt design strategies\u2014including structure, system role, and intent\u2014on evaluation metrics such as provider fairness, catalog coverage, temporal stability, and recency. The first experiment examines these strategies in\n classical top-K recommendations,\n while the second evaluates\n sequential in-context learning (ICL\n ).\n \n In the first experiment, we assess seven distinct prompt scenarios on top-K recommendation accuracy and fairness. Accuracy-oriented prompts, like Simple and Chain-of-Thought (COT), outperform diversification prompts, which, despite enhancing temporal freshness, reduce accuracy by up to 50%. Embedding fairness into system roles, such as \u201cact as a fair recommender\u201d, proved more effective than fairness directives within prompts. We also found that diversification prompts led to recommending newer movies, offering broader genre distribution compared to traditional collaborative filtering (CF) models. The system showed high consistency across multiple runs.\n The second experiment explores sequential ICL, comparing zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Results indicate that including user demographic information in prompts affects model biases and stereotypes. However, ICL did not consistently improve item fairness and catalog coverage over zero-shot learning. Zero-shot learning achieved higher NDCG and coverage, while ICL-2 showed slight improvements in hit rate (HR) when age-group context was included. Overall, our study provides insights into biases of RecLLMs, particularly in provider fairness and catalog coverage. By examining prompt design, learning strategies, and system roles, we highlight the potential and challenges of integrating large language models into recommendation systems, paving the way for future research.

            "abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommender systems (RS) presents new challenges in understanding and evaluating their biases, which can result in unfairness or the amplification of stereotypes. Traditional fairness evaluations in RS primarily focus on collaborative filtering (CF) settings, which may not fully capture the complexities of LLMs, as these models often inherit biases from large, unregulated data. This paper proposes a normative framework to benchmark consumer fairness in LLM-powered recommender systems (RecLLMs). We critically examine how fairness norms in classical RS fall short in addressing the challenges posed by LLMs. We argue that this gap can lead to arbitrary conclusions about fairness, and we propose a more structured, formal approach to evaluate fairness in such systems. Our experiments on the MovieLens dataset on consumer fairness, using in-context learning (zero-shot vs. few-shot) reveal fairness deviations in age-based recommendations, particularly when additional contextual examples are introduced (ICL-2). Statistical significance tests confirm that these deviations are not random, highlighting the need for robust evaluation methods. While this work offers a preliminary discussion on a proposed normative framework, our hope is that it could provide a formal, principled approach for auditing and mitigating bias in RecLLMs. The code and dataset used for this work will be shared at\"gihub-anonymized\".",

            "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems (RS) typically use user-item rating histories as their main data source. However, deep generative models now have the capability to model and sample from complex data distributions, including user-item interactions, text, images, and videos, enabling novel recommendation tasks. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey connects key advancements in RS using Generative Models (Gen-RecSys), covering: interaction-driven generative models; the use of large language models (LLM) and textual data for natural language recommendation; and the integration of multimodal models for generating and processing images/videos in RS. Our work highlights necessary paradigms for evaluating the impact and harm of Gen-RecSys and identifies open challenges. This survey accompanies a tutorial presented at ACM KDD'24, with supporting materials provided at: https://encr.pw/vDhLq.",

            "title": "Multi-modal Generative Models in Recommendation System",
            "abstract": "Many recommendation systems limit user inputs to text strings or behavior signals such as clicks and purchases, and system outputs to a list of products sorted by relevance. With the advent of generative AI, users have come to expect richer levels of interactions. In visual search, for example, a user may provide a picture of their desired product along with a natural language modification of the content of the picture (e.g., a dress like the one shown in the picture but in red color). Moreover, users may want to better understand the recommendations they receive by visualizing how the product fits their use case, e.g., with a representation of how a garment might look on them, or how a furniture item might look in their room. Such advanced levels of interaction require recommendation systems that are able to discover both shared and complementary information about the product across modalities, and visualize the product in a realistic and informative way. However, existing systems often treat multiple modalities independently: text search is usually done by comparing the user query to product titles and descriptions, while visual search is typically done by comparing an image provided by the customer to product images. We argue that future recommendation systems will benefit from a multi-modal understanding of the products that leverages the rich information retailers have about both customers and products to come up with the best recommendations. In this chapter we review recommendation systems that use multiple data modalities simultaneously.",
