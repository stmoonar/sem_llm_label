            "abstract": "Abstract The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) underwent a focused review of assay term annotations, logic and hierarchy with a goal to improve and standardize these terms. As a result, inconsistencies in W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) expressions were identified and corrected, and additionally, standardized design patterns and a formalized template to maintain them were developed. We describe here this informative and productive process to describe the specific benefits and obstacles for OBI and the universal lessons for similar projects.",

            "abstract": "Biological ontologies are used to organize, curate, and interpret the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments. While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application, and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology\u2019s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data FAIR.",

As a Bioinformatics Resource Center funded by the National Institutes of Health, with additional support from the Welllcome Trust, VEuPathDB supports >500 organisms comprising invertebrate vectors, eukaryotic pathogens (protists and fungi) and relevant free-living or non-pathogenic species or hosts. Designed to empower researchers with access to Omics data and bioinformatic analyses, VEuPathDB projects integrate >1700 pre-analysed datasets (and associated metadata) with advanced search capabilities, visualizations, and analysis tools in a graphic interface. Diverse data types are analysed with standardized workflows including an in-house OrthoMCL algorithm for predicting orthology. Comparisons are easily made across datasets, data types and organisms in this unique data mining platform. A new site-wide search facilitates access for both experienced and novice users. Upgraded infrastructure and workflows support numerous updates to the web interface, tools, searches and strategies, and Galaxy workspace where users can privately analyse their own data. Forthcoming upgrades include cloud-ready application architecture, expanded support for the Galaxy workspace, tools for interrogating host-pathogen interactions, and improved interactions with affiliated databases (ClinEpiDB, MicrobiomeDB) and other scientific resources, and increased interoperability with the Bacterial & Viral BRC.",

            "abstract": ". The TURBO Medication Mapper (TMM) identifies terms from RxNorm that best represent a list of medication strings, like one would find in a Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW). TMM has several differentiating characteristics, compared to other tools: the machine learning component does not require a human-curated gold standard for training; normalizations are applied to source-specific language in the strings (instead of just excluding them); the confidence of each mapping is represented as a relationship to the absolute truth, along with a 0.0-1.0 score; the results, along with supporting knowledge, are saved into an RDF graph and a Solr document database is generated. Queries for drug classes like \u201cstatins\u201d are based on OBO foundry ontologies like the Drug Ontology (DrOn) and ChEBI, and they return more results than multiple SQL search strategies over the CDW, with few false positives. TMM is available for download from GitHub.",

            "abstract": "Background: The analysis and interpretation of data generated from patient-derived clinical samples relies on access to high-quality bioinformatics resources. These are maintained and updated by expert curators extracting knowledge from unstructured biological data described in free-text journal articles and converting this into more structured, computationally-accessible forms. This enables analyses such as functional enrichment of sets of genes/proteins using the Gene Ontology, and makes the searching of data more productive by managing issues such as gene/protein name synonyms, identifier mapping, and data quality. Objective: To undertake a coordinated annotation update of key public-domain resources to better support Alzheimer\u2019s disease research. Methods: We have systematically identified target proteins critical to disease process, in part by accessing informed input from the clinical research community. Results: Data from 954 papers have been added to the UniProtKB, Gene Ontology, and the International Molecular Exchange Consortium (IMEx) databases, with 299 human proteins and 279 orthologs updated in UniProtKB. 745 binary interactions were added to the IMEx human molecular interaction dataset. Conclusion: This represents a significant enhancement in the expert curated data pertinent to Alzheimer\u2019s disease available in a number of biomedical databases. Relevant protein entries have been updated in UniProtKB and concomitantly in the Gene Ontology. Molecular interaction networks have been significantly extended in the IMEx Consortium dataset and a set of reference protein complexes created. All the resources described are open-source and freely available to the research community and we provide examples of how these data could be exploited by researchers.",

            "abstract": ". The Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (OBO) provides a set of ontologies that can be used to create a semantically rich clinical data model. However, concerns exist regarding the scalability of a pipeline to load clinical data into such a model using Resource Description Framework (RDF). In order to investigate this further, we describe our development of a pipeline for transforming clinical patient data to conform with a model designed using OBO Foundry ontologies, and discuss the runtime and disk space requirements. In order to determine the efficacy of our approach at various throughput levels, we used the synthetic patient data generation service Synthea to generate four patient cohort models of different sizes, the largest containing information about one million patients, and ran each through the pipeline. We also discuss the development of an exemplar question to simulate the type of request we might receive from researchers, and its implementation in the SPARQL query language. We report the results of executing the exemplar question query against each patient cohort model, and conclude that our approach produces a knowledge base which can be generated and queried roughly linearly, and handle requests against large clinical data sets in reasonable time.",

METHODS It uses a custom systems architecture to adopt and enforce rigorous standards that facilitate harmonization of AD-relevant GWAS summary statistics datasets with functional annotations, including a database of >230 million annotated variants from the AD Sequencing Project\u2019s joint-calling efforts. RESULTS The knowledgebase generates genome browser tracks and interactive compiled from harmonized datasets and annotations in the underlying database. These facilitate data sharing and discovery, by contextualizing AD-risk associations in a broader functional genomic context or summarizing them in the context of functionally annotated genes and variants. DISCUSSION Created to make AD-genetics knowledge more accessible to AD-researchers, the GenomicsDB shares annotated AD-relevant summary statistics datasets via a web interface designed to guide users unfamiliar with genetic data in not only exploring, but also interpreting this ever-growing volume of data.",

            "abstract": "Standardizing clinical information in a common data model is important for promoting interoperability and facilitating high quality research. Semantic Web technologies such as Resource Description Framework can be utilized to their full potential when a clinical data model accurately reflects the reality of the clinical situation it describes. To this end, the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry provides a set of ontologies that conform to the principles of realism and can be used to create a realism-based clinical data model. However, the challenge of programmatically defining such a model and loading data from disparate sources into the model has not been addressed by pre-existing software solutions. The PennTURBO Semantic Engine is a tool developed at the University of Pennsylvania that works in conjunction with data aggregation software to transform source-specific RDF data into a source-independent, realism-based data model. This system sources classes from an application ontology and specifically defines how instances of those classes may relate to each other. Additionally, the system defines and executes RDF data transformations by launching dynamically generated SPARQL update statements. The Semantic Engine was designed as a generalizable RDF data standardization tool, and is able to work with various data models and incoming data sources. Its human-readable configuration files can easily be shared between institutions, providing the basis for collaboration on a standard realism-based clinical data model.",

In this study, we report our development of the community-driven Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation (OPMI) and its applications in clinical data and metadata representation. OPMI has been used to represent the common data model (CDM) of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI) program. It has also been used to represent approximately 30 case report forms defined by the NIH-supported Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Our case studies showed that OPMI is able to semantically and precisely represent the OHDSI CDM, various KPMP clinical forms, and their associated data and metadata. Such ontological representations support standardized data representation, sharing, recording, integration, and advanced analysis.",
