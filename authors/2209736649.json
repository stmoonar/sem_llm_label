            "title": "Multi-Modal Hit Detection and Positional Analysis in Padel Competitions",
            "abstract": "Padel is a rapidly growing racquet sport and has gained popularity globally due to its accessibility and exciting gameplay dynamics. Effective coordination between teammates hinges on maintaining an appropriate distance, allowing for seamless transitions between offensive and defensive maneuvers. A balanced inter-player distance and distance to the net not only facilitates efficient communication but also enhances the team\u2019s ability to exploit openings in the opponent\u2019s defense while minimizing vulnerabilities. We introduce a new open dataset of padel rallies with annotations for hits and player-ball interactions, a predictive model for detecting hits based on audio signals, a re-identification algorithm for pose tracking, and a framework for calculating inter-player and player-net distances during rallies. Our predictive model achieves an average F1-score of 92% for hit detection, demonstrating robust performance across different match conditions. Furthermore, we develop a system for accurately assigning hits to individual players, achieving an overall accuracy of 83.70% for player-specific assignment and 86.83% for team-based assignment.",

            "abstract": "A healthy and safe indoor environment is an important part of containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",
