            "abstract": "The recent developments in full duplex (FD) communication promise doubling the capacity of cellular networks using self interference cancellation (SIC) techniques. FD small cells with device-to-device (D2D) communication links could achieve the expected capacity of the future cellular networks (5G). In this work, we consider joint scheduling and dynamic power algorithm (DPA) for a single cell FD small cell network with D2D links (D2DLs). We formulate the optimal user selection and power control as a non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem to get the optimal user scheduling and transmission power in a given TTI. Our numerical results show that using DPA gives better overall throughput performance than full power transmission algorithm (FPA). Also, simultaneous transmissions (combination of uplink (UL), downlink (DL), and D2D occur 80% of the time thereby increasing the spectral efficiency and network capacity.",

            "abstract": "- The data gathering in sensor network is done periodically to mine the unprocessed data readings. This data gathering which makes the data analysis composite. From the wireless sensor networks users are in need to mine the data constantly from the network, in this case exacting the data is not easy-and it is very expensive. It is important to frame a new data gathering scheme by integrating the huddling and predictions techniques. A power proficient for huddling based data gathering in wireless sensor network Scheme incorporates the active/inactive prediction techniques is proposed. In the group of sensor nodes ,a node called huddle head is represented as to collect a data values for readings. To apply this techniques very efficiently in WSN, The framed algorithms are used to utilize the advantages of active/inactive prediction techniques. In this frame work the designed algorithm is more adequate to have sophisticated features with slumber/alert schedule . It avoids the uncontrolled data transmission among node-node, but rather than it apply a faster ,added efficient huddle -to huddle transmission",

            "abstract": "A Computer network or data communication network is a telecommunication network that allows computers to exchange data. Computer networks are typically built from a large number of network devices such as routers, switches and numerous types of middle boxes with many complex protocols implemented on them. They need to accomplish very complex tasks with access to very limited tools. As a result, network management and performance tuning is quite challenging. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture purporting to be adaptable, cost-effective, dynamic and manageable pursuing to be suitable for the high-bandwidth, changing nature of today's applications. SDN architectures decouples network control and forwarding functions, making network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted from applications and network services. The network security is a prominent feature of the network ensuring accountability, confidentiality, integrity, and protection against many external and internal threats. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security software designed to automatically alert administrators when someone or something is trying to compromise information system through malicious activities or through security policy violations. Security violation in SDN environment needs to be identified to prevent the system from an attack. The proposed work aims to detect the attacks on SDN environment. Detecting anomalies on SDN environment will be more manageable and efficient.",

            "abstract": "Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a self-configuring infrastructureless network of mobile devices connected by wireless links. Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction, and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. This paper proposes a TAODV for improving security in adhoc routing protocol. The proposed TAODV detects the network layer attacks like blackhole and wormhole attack and rectifies it by using the trust values. This proposed scheme is based on incentives and penalties depending on the behavior of the nodes in the network. The TAODV allow the source node to choose the trusted and the shortest path during the route discovery and isolate malicious node in the network.",

            "abstract": "The migration of classic Internet to support real time and multimedia applications (videoconference, VoIP) require improvement of the network level service. Since several real-time and multimedia applications are multicast, our interest is to integrate Diffserv and multicasting in order to satisfy QoS requirements of the multicast group. The problem on which we are concentrating in this paper is related to providing QoS requirements for multicast applications using Diffserv and principally on overload traffic, which may be created by replication of multicast packets in Diffserv domain. In this case, the policing component in Diffserv routers may perform dropping packets and because core routers are working by aggregation, thus other traffic (the rest of traffic) may be affected. In this paper, we present a new protocol called control for QoS-based multicasting in Diffserv (CQMD) to resolve the multicast and Diffserv integration problem. This paper shows under what conditions the new member can be accepted into the multicast group in Diffserv domain. In addition CQMD can achieve QoS-satisfaction, ensure protection for other traffic in the Diffserv domain, good resources management and incur less message overhead.",
