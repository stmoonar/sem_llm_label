            "abstract": "We introduce a notion of extensional metamodeling that can be used to extend knowl- edge representation languages, and show that this feature does not increase computational complexity of reasoning in many cases. We sketch the relation of our notion to various existing logics with metamodeling and to non-wellfounded sets, and discuss applications. We also comment on the usability of black-box reductions to develop reasoning algorithms for metamodeling.",

            "abstract": "Nominal schemas have been proposed as an extension to Description Logics (DL), the knowledge representation paradigm underlying the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They provide for a very tight integration of DL and rules. Nominal schemas can be understood as syntactic sugar on top of OWL. However, this naive perspective leads to inefficient reasoning procedures. In order to develop an efficient reasoning procedure for the language ELV ++ , which results from extending the OWL profile language OWL EL with nominal schemas, we propose a transformation from ELV ++ ontologies into Datalog-like rule programs that can be used for satisfiability checking and assertion retrieval. The use of this transformation enables the use of powerful Datalog engines to solve reasoning tasks over ELV ++ ontologies. We implement and then evaluate our approach on several real-world, data-intensive ontologies, and find that it can outperform state-of-the-art reasoners such as Konclude and ELK. As a lesser side result we also provide a self-contained description of a rule-based algorithm for EL ++ which does not require a normal form transformation.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "We propose the combining of region connection calculi with nested hierarchical grids for representing spatial region data in the context of knowledge graphs, thereby avoiding reliance on vector representations. We present a resulting region calculus, and provide qualitative and formal evidence that this representation can be favorable with large data volumes in the context of knowledge graphs; in particular we study means of efficiently choosing which triples to store to minimize space requirements when data is represented this way, and we provide an algorithm for finding the smallest possible set of triples for this purpose including an asymptotic measure of the size of this set for a special case. We prove that a known constraint calculus is adequate for the reconstruction of all triples describing a region from such a pruned representation, but problematic for reasoning with hierarchical grids in general.",
