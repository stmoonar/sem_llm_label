            "abstract": "Link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) has been extensively studied on binary relational KGs, wherein each fact is represented by a triple. A significant amount of important knowledge, however, is represented by hyper-relational facts where each fact is composed of a primal triple and a set of qualifiers comprising a key-value pair that allows for expressing more complicated semantics. Although some recent works have proposed to embed hyper-relational KGs, these methods fail to capture essential inference patterns of hyper-relational facts such as qualifier monotonicity, qualifier implication, and qualifier mutual exclusion, limiting their generalization capability. To unlock this, we present ShrinkE, a geometric hyper-relational KG embedding method aiming to explicitly model these patterns. ShrinkE models the primal triple as a spatial-functional transformation from the head into a relation-specific box. Each qualifier \u201cshrinks\u201d the box to narrow down the possible answer set and, thus, realizes qualifier monotonicity. The spatial relationships between the qualifier boxes allow for modeling core inference patterns of qualifiers such as implication and mutual exclusion. Experimental results demonstrate ShrinkE\u2019s superiority on three benchmarks of hyper-relational KGs.",

            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.",

            "abstract": "Logical rules are essential for uncovering the logical connections between relations, which could improve reasoning performance and provide interpretable results on knowledge graphs (KGs). Although there have been many efforts to mine meaningful logical rules over KGs, existing methods suffer from computationally intensive searches over the rule space and a lack of scalability for large-scale KGs. Besides, they often ignore the semantics of relations which is crucial for uncovering logical connections. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in the field of natural language processing and various applications, owing to their emergent ability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, ChatRule, unleashing the power of large language models for mining logical rules over knowledge graphs. Specifically, the framework is initiated with an LLM-based rule generator, leveraging both the semantic and structural information of KGs to prompt LLMs to generate logical rules. To refine the generated rules, a rule ranking module estimates the rule quality by incorporating facts from existing KGs. Last, the ranked rules can be used to conduct reasoning over KGs. ChatRule is evaluated on four large-scale KGs, w.r.t. different rule quality metrics and downstream tasks, showing the effectiveness and scalability of our method.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability in modeling graphs; however, their performance would significantly degrade when there are noisy edges connecting nodes from different classes. To alleviate negative effect of noisy edges on neighborhood aggregation, some recent GNNs propose to predict the label agreement between node pairs within a single network. However, predicting the label agreement of edges across different networks has not been investigated yet. Our work makes the pioneering attempt to study a novel problem of cross-network homophilous and heterophilous edge classification (CNHHEC) and proposes a novel domain-adaptive graph attention-supervised network (DGASN) to effectively tackle the CNHHEC problem. First, DGASN adopts multihead graph attention network (GAT) as the GNN encoder, which jointly trains node embeddings and edge embeddings via the node classification and edge classification losses. As a result, label-discriminative embeddings can be obtained to distinguish homophilous edges from heterophilous edges. In addition, DGASN applies direct supervision on graph attention learning based on the observed edge labels from the source network, thus lowering the negative effects of heterophilous edges while enlarging the positive effects of homophilous edges during neighborhood aggregation. To facilitate knowledge transfer across networks, DGASN employs adversarial domain adaptation to mitigate domain divergence. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DGASN achieves the state-of-the-art performance in CNHHEC.",

Current computational methods can predict these protein-ligand interaction properties but often lose accuracy without high-resolution protein structures and falter in predicting functional effects.

This enables PSICHIC to attain first-of-its-kind emergent capabilities in deciphering mechanisms underlying protein-ligand interactions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability. Trained on identical protein-ligand pairs without structural data, PSICHIC matched and even surpassed leading structure-based methods in binding affinity prediction. In a library screening for adenosine A1 receptor agonists, PSICHIC discerned functional effects effectively, ranking the sole novel agonist within the top three. PSICHIC\u2019s interpretable fingerprints identified protein residues and ligand atoms involved in interactions. We foresee PSICHIC reshaping virtual screening and deepening our understanding of protein-ligand interactions.",

We introduce a systematic framework, Data-centric Graph Machine Learning (DC-GML), that encompasses all stages of the graph data lifecycle, including graph data collection, exploration, improvement, exploitation, and maintenance. A thorough taxonomy of each stage is presented to answer three critical graph-centric questions: (1) how to enhance graph data availability and quality; (2) how to learn from graph data with limited-availability and low-quality; (3) how to build graph MLOps systems from the graph data-centric view.

Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification.

            "abstract": "Until recently, a novel spatial crowdsourcing paradigm, namely Three-Dimensional (3D) spatial crowdsourcing, has emerged, in which the task requestors and the workers need travel to their designated third-party workplaces, e.g., shared offices, to deliver certain services, such as DiDi station ride-sharing service, Quyundong sport training service in the Online-To-Offline (O2O) applications. In 3D spatial crowdsourcing applications, a core issue is to develop an efficient global tasklist plan, based on the tripartite matching among the three parties, i.e., task requestors, workers and workplaces, which is different from the conventional spatial crowdsourcing. In this context, one key challenge is how to suitably schedule the available workers with the consideration of the interests of all the parties, under the constraint of worker resource. To answer the questions, in this paper, we propose and study a new problem, namely Social-Welfare-driven Task Scheduling (SWTS) problem, which strives to schedule the workers\u2019 continuous routines, i.e., successively implementing tasks for different requestors at different workplaces, to promote the social welfare for all the involved parties. We prove our studied problem is NP-hard, and devise two heuristic optimization algorithms to solve it. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments which verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic data sets.",

            "abstract": "Geometric relational embeddings map relational data as geometric objects that combine vector information suitable for machine learning and structured/relational information for structured/relational reasoning, typically in low dimensions. Their preservation of relational structures and their appealing properties and interpretability have led to their uptake for tasks such as knowledge graph completion, ontology and hierarchy reasoning, logical query answering, and hierarchical multi-label classification. We survey methods that underly geometric relational embeddings and categorize them based on (i) the embedding geometries that are used to represent the data; and (ii) the relational reasoning tasks that they aim to improve. We identify the desired properties (i.e., inductive biases) of each kind of embedding and discuss some potential future work.",

            "title": "Neighbor Contrastive Learning on Learnable Graph Augmentation",
            "abstract": "Recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL), which aims to learn representations from unlabeled graphs, has made great progress. However, the existing GCL methods mostly adopt human-designed graph augmentations, which are sensitive to various graph datasets. In addition, the contrastive losses originally developed in computer vision have been directly applied to graph data, where the neighboring nodes are regarded as negatives and consequently pushed far apart from the anchor. However, this is contradictory with the homophily assumption of net-works that connected nodes often belong to the same class and should be close to each other. In this work, we propose an end-to-end automatic GCL method, named NCLA to apply neighbor contrastive learning on learnable graph augmentation. Several graph augmented views with adaptive topology are automatically learned by the multi-head graph attention mechanism, which can be compatible with various graph datasets without prior domain knowledge. In addition, a neighbor contrastive loss is devised to allow multiple positives per anchor by taking network topology as the supervised signals. Both augmentations and embeddings are learned end-to-end in the proposed NCLA. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that NCLA yields the state-of-the-art node classification performance on self-supervised GCL and even exceeds the supervised ones, when the labels are extremely limited. Our code is released at https://github.com/shenxiaocam/NCLA.",
