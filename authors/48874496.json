            "abstract": "Abstract The IntAct molecular interaction database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact) is a curated resource of molecular interactions, derived from the scientific literature and from direct data depositions. As of August 2021, IntAct provides more than one million binary interactions, curated by twelve global partners of the International Molecular Exchange consortium, for which the IntAct database provides a shared curation and dissemination platform. The IMEx curation policy has always emphasised a fine-grained data and curation model, aiming to capture the relevant experimental detail essential for the interpretation of the provided molecular interaction data. Here, we present recent curation focus and progress, as well as a completely redeveloped website which presents IntAct data in a much more user-friendly and detailed way.",

            "abstract": "Abstract RNAcentral is a comprehensive database of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences that provides a single access point to 44 RNA resources and >18 million ncRNA sequences from a wide range of organisms and RNA types. RNAcentral now also includes secondary (2D) structure information for >13 million sequences, making RNAcentral the world\u2019s largest RNA 2D structure database. The 2D diagrams are displayed using R2DT, a new 2D structure visualization method that uses consistent, reproducible and recognizable layouts for related RNAs. The sequence similarity search has been updated with a faster interface featuring facets for filtering search results by RNA type, organism, source database or any keyword. This sequence search tool is available as a reusable web component, and has been integrated into several RNAcentral member databases, including Rfam, miRBase and snoDB. To allow for a more fine-grained assignment of RNA types and subtypes, all RNAcentral sequences have been annotated with Sequence Ontology terms. The RNAcentral database continues to grow and provide a central data resource for the RNA community. RNAcentral is freely available at https://rnacentral.org.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation A large variety of molecular interactions occurs between biomolecular components in cells. When a molecular interaction results in a regulatory effect, exerted by one component onto a downstream component, a so-called \u2018causal interaction\u2019 takes place. Causal interactions constitute the building blocks in our understanding of larger regulatory networks in cells. These causal interactions and the biological processes they enable (e.g. gene regulation) need to be described with a careful appreciation of the underlying molecular reactions. A proper description of this information enables archiving, sharing and reuse by humans and for automated computational processing. Various representations of causal relationships between biological components are currently used in a variety of resources. Results Here, we propose a checklist that accommodates current representations, called the Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction CAusal STatement (MI2CAST). This checklist defines both the required core information, as well as a comprehensive set of other contextual details valuable to the end user and relevant for reusing and reproducing causal molecular interaction information. The MI2CAST checklist can be used as reporting guidelines when annotating and curating causal statements, while fostering uniformity and interoperability of the data across resources. Availability and implementation The checklist together with examples is accessible at https://github.com/MI2CAST/MI2CAST Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We provide (i) details of the experimental techniques used to obtain the main types of interaction data, (ii) descriptions of the models and approaches introduced to solve such problems and (iii) pointers to both the available databases and software tools. The intent is to lay out a useful roadmap for identifying suitable strategies to analyse cellular data, possibly based on the joint use of different interaction data types or analysis techniques.",

Known methods that perform these tasks operate symmetrically, i.e., they do not assign a distinct role to the input PPI networks. However, in most cases, the input networks are indeed distinguishable on the basis of how the corresponding organism is biologically well characterized. In this paper a new idea is developed, that is, to exploit differences in the characterization of organisms at hand in order to devise methods for comparing their PPI networks. We use the PPI network (called Master) of the best characterized organism as a fingerprint to guide the alignment process to the second input network (called Slave), so that generated results preferably retain the structural characteristics of the Master network. Technically, this is obtained by generating from the Master a finite automaton, called alignment model, which is then fed with (a linearization of) the Slave for the purpose of extracting, via the Viterbi algorithm, matching subgraphs. We propose an approach able to perform global alignment and network querying, and we apply it on PPI networks. We tested our method showing that the results it returns are biologically relevant.",

The automatic analysis and management of such data can provide valuable information on the evolution of different organisms.

Such graphs are called protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. A number of methods have been proposed to perform PPI-network alignment. Such methods operate symmetrically, that is to say, they do not assign a distinct role to the input PPI networks.

            "abstract": "We propose an algorithm, called BI-GRAPPIN, to search for similarities across PPI networks. The technique core consists in computing a maximum weight matching of bipartite graphs to compare the neighborhoods of pairs of proteins in different PPI networks. The idea is that proteins belonging to different networks should be matched look- ing not only at their own sequence similarity, but also at the similarity of proteins they \"strongly\" interact with, ei- ther directly or indirectly. We implemented the method and tested it on both real and synthetic data, showing its effec- tiveness in solving ambiguous situations and in individuat- ing functionally related proteins. Differently from previous work, the presented algorithm allows to take into account both quantitative and reliability information possibly avail- able about interactions.",
