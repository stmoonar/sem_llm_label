            "abstract": "More than half of the global population were spectators of AI-assisted decision making during the recent 2022 FIFA World Cup. For the first time in a Football World Cup, via news and social media, fans were briefed about the Semi-Automated Offside Technology (SAOT), which determined the position of players to be offside or not, in real time, with the help of AI. In this paper, we collect and analyse news articles related to offside decisions made with SAOT, published during and around the tournament. Our findings reveal alternating positive and negative portrayals of SAOT in the news, gaps in communication, and needs of Football fans to gain a better spectator experience. In conclusion, we discuss general implications for designing a better relationship between Spectators and AI, specific implications for bettering the experience of Football fans when using SAOT, and introduce our future research.",

We experimented on personal data management by prototyping a Point-of-Interest recommender system in which data collected on the user can be viewed, edited, deleted, and shared via elements in the User Interface. Based on our qualitative findings, in this paper we discuss\"The ostrich policy\"adopted by end users who do not want to manage their personal data.

In this paper, we present observations of users\u2019 \u201chome\u201d and \u201caway\u201d conducted to refine our understanding of situational Point-of-Interest (POI) needs. Our findings suggest three distinct categories of situations in which users seek POI information: On-the-spot, Refining plans, and Moments of boredom. Based on the similarities and differences of these three situations in five observed underlying constraints \u2013 distance of interest, engagement threshold, ambiguity of the search, profile matching, and other imperative constraints, we derive implications for designing and ranking POIs for a Situational Recommender. To further access our concept, we designed and prototyped Situational Recommender by providing an interactional representation of the situation, and ran a Wizard-of-Oz concept validation study. Our results suggest that participants understood the concept without much effort and appreciated its usefulness.",

Mindsets are categories such as \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d and \u201cSurprise me\u201d designed to lead the users to explicitly state their intent, control the recommended content, save time, get inspired, and gain shortcuts for a satisficing exploration of POI recommendations.

Using the insights gathered from potential end users, we then quantified Mindsets by linking them to POI utility measures using approximated lexicographic multi-objective optimisation. Finally, we ran a summative evaluation of Mindsets and derived guidelines for designing novel categories for recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Conversational Agents (CAs) employing voice as their main interaction mode produce natural language utterances with the aim of mimicking human conversations. To unveil hiccups in conversations with recommender systems, we observed users interacting with CAs. Our findings suggest that those occur as users struggle to start the session, as CAs do not appear exploratory, and as CAs remained silent after offering recommendation(s) or after reporting errors. Users enacted mental models derived from years of experience with Graphical User Interfaces, but also expected human-like characteristics such as explanations and proactivity. Anchoring on these, we designed a dialogue model for a multimodal Conversational Recommender System (CRS) mimicking humans and GUIs. We probed the state of hiccups further with a Wizard-of-Oz prototype implementing this dialogue model. Our findings suggest that participants rapidly adopted GUI mimicries, cooperated for error resolution, appreciated explainable recommendations, and provided insights to improve persisting hiccups in proactivity and navigation. Based on these, we provide implications for design to address hiccups in CRS.",

We present UnlockMe, a concept that aims at preserving the social link, the disposition to come across other people serendipitously when engaged in online activities such as purchasing goods, working from home or when viewing media and entertainment. Our concept relies on virtual co-location detection (both synchronous and asynchronous), to allow users to engage with other people with whom they would have been likely to interact when doing the same activities offline in the physical world. We developed and illustrated UnlockMe with six scenarios and low-fidelity prototyping to test it with 10 participants who were isolated due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Our findings reveal multimedia recommendations from close social connections to be the best scenario for UnlockMe followed by online shopping and connecting with the local community.",

            "abstract": "Recommending Points-of-Interest (POIs) is surfacing in many location-based applications. The literature contains personalized and socialized POI recommendation approaches which employ historical check-ins and social links to make recommendations. However these systems still lack customizability and contextuality particularly in cold start situations. In this paper, we propose LikeMind, a POI recommendation system which tackles the challenges of cold start, customizability, contextuality, and explainability by exploiting look-alike groups mined in public POI datasets. LikeMind reformulates the problem of POI recommendation, as recommending explainable look-alike groups (and their POIs) which are in line with user's interests. LikeMind frames the task of POI recommendation as an exploratory process where users interact with the system by expressing their favorite POIs, and their interactions impact the way look-alike groups are selected out. Moreover, LikeMind employs \"mindsets\", which capture actual situation and intent of the user, and enforce the semantics of POI interestingness. In an extensive set of experiments, we show the quality of our approach in recommending relevant look-alike groups and their POIs, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.",

These intelligent systems succeed in learning the user's profile to recommend movies, music, news and more. However, for designing context-aware recommendations, new challenges emerge in predicting the situational needs of the user. We prototyped Ambient Wanderer, our personalised and contextualised Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender system and experimented it with new locals, people who have recently relocated to a city. Our key findings include: sudden breakdowns during urban exploration, trust issues with the recommendations from people unlike them, feeling bored as the trigger to POI search, intent to find free activities, information needs on areas-of-interest beyond points-of-interest and the demand to build a new social life. For each of these needs, we present the implications to design mobile recommendations for urban exploration.",

Further, we illustrate the identified opportunities of whispering interaction, collaborative recommendations, driving scenario, and local-like conversations for delivering recommendations.",
