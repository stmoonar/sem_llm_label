            "abstract": "\n The recommender system (RS) has been an integral toolkit of online services. They are equipped with various deep learning techniques to model user preference based on identifier and attribute information. With the emergence of multimedia services, such as short videos, news and\n etc.\n , understanding these contents while recommending becomes critical. Besides, multimodal features are also helpful in alleviating the problem of data sparsity in RS. Thus,\n M\n ultimodal\n R\n ecommender\n S\n ystem (MRS) has attracted much attention from both academia and industry recently. In this paper, we will give a comprehensive survey of the MRS models, mainly from technical views. First, we conclude the general procedures and major challenges for MRS. Then, we introduce the existing MRS models according to four categories,\n i.e.,\n Modality Encoder\n ,\n Feature Interaction\n ,\n Feature Enhancement\n and\n Model Optimization\n . Besides, to make it convenient for those who want to research this field, we also summarize the dataset and code resources. Finally, we discuss some promising future directions of MRS and conclude this paper. To access more details of the surveyed papers, such as implementation code, we open source a repository.\n",

            "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) plays an import role in monitoring the brain activities of patients with epilepsy and has been extensively used to diagnose epilepsy. Clinically reading tens or even hundreds of hours of EEG recordings is very time consuming. Therefore, automatic detection of seizure is of great importance. But the huge diversity of EEG signals belonging to different patients makes the task of seizure detection much challenging, for both human experts and automation methods. We propose three deep transfer convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic cross-subject seizure detection, based on VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, respectively. The original dataset is the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. We use short time Fourier transform to generate time-frequency spectrum images as the input dataset, while positive samples are augmented due to the infrequent nature of seizure. The model parameters pretrained on ImageNet are transferred to our models. And the fine-tuned top layers, with an output layer of two neurons for binary classification (seizure or nonseizure), are trained from scratch. Then, the input dataset are randomly shuffled and divided into three partitions for training, validating, and testing the deep transfer CNNs, respectively. The average accuracies achieved by the deep transfer CNNs based on VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 are 97.75%, 98.26%, and 96.17% correspondingly. On those results of experiments, our method could prove to be an effective method for cross-subject seizure detection.",

            "title": "Predicting Human Intention-Behavior Through EEG Signal Analysis Using Multi-Scale CNN",
            "abstract": "At present, the application of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification to human intention-behavior prediction has become a hot topic in the brain computer interface (BCI) research field. In recent studies, the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has contributed to substantial improvements in the EEG signal classification performance. However, there is still a key challenge with the existing CNN-based EEG signal classification methods, the accuracy of them is not very satisfying. This is because most of the existing methods only utilize the feature maps in the last layer of CNN for EEG signal classification, which might miss some local and detailed information for accurate classification. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-scale CNN model-based EEG signal classification method. In this method, first, the EEG signals are preprocessed and converted to time-frequency images using the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) technique. Then, a multi-scale CNN model is designed for EEG signal classification, which takes the converted time-frequency image as the input. Especially, in the designed multi-scale CNN model, both the local and global information is taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the benchmark data set 2b used in the BCI contest IV. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 73.9 percent, which improves the classification accuracy of 10.4, 5.5, 16.2 percent compared with the traditional methods including artificial neural network, support vector machine, and stacked auto-encoder.",

This paper puts forward a hybrid denoising algorithm for MR images based on two sparsely represented morphological components and one residual part. To begin with, decompose a noisy MR image into the cartoon, texture, and residual parts by MCA, and then each part is denoised by using Wiener filter, wavelet hard threshold, and wavelet soft threshold, respectively. Finally, stack up all the denoised subimages to obtain the denoised MR image. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significantly better performance in terms of mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio than each method alone.",
