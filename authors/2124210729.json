            "title": "Augmenting Textual Generation via Topology Aware Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Despite the impressive advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating text, they are often limited by the knowledge contained in the input and prone to producing inaccurate or hallucinated content. To tackle these issues, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is employed as an effective strategy to enhance the available knowledge base and anchor the responses in reality by pulling additional texts from external databases. In real-world applications, texts are often linked through entities within a graph, such as citations in academic papers or comments in social networks. This paper exploits these topological relationships to guide the retrieval process in RAG. Specifically, we explore two kinds of topological connections: proximity-based, focusing on closely connected nodes, and role-based, which looks at nodes sharing similar subgraph structures. Our empirical research confirms their relevance to text relationships, leading us to develop a Topology-aware Retrieval-augmented Generation framework. This framework includes a retrieval module that selects texts based on their topological relationships and an aggregation module that integrates these texts into prompts to stimulate LLMs for text generation. We have curated established text-attributed networks and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance RAG with topological awareness.",

            "title": "Leveraging Opposite Gender Interaction Ratio as a Path towards Fairness in Online Dating Recommendations Based on User Sexual Orientation",
            "abstract": "Online dating platforms have gained widespread popularity as a means for individuals to seek potential romantic relationships. While recommender systems have been designed to improve the user experience in dating platforms by providing personalized recommendations, increasing concerns about fairness have encouraged the development of fairness-aware recommender systems from various perspectives (e.g., gender and race). However, sexual orientation, which plays a significant role in finding a satisfying relationship, is under-investigated. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a novel metric, Opposite Gender Interaction Ratio (OGIR), as a way to investigate potential unfairness for users with varying preferences towards the opposite gender. We empirically analyze a real online dating dataset and observe existing recommender algorithms could suffer from group unfairness according to OGIR. We further investigate the potential causes for such gaps in recommendation quality, which lead to the challenges of group quantity imbalance and group calibration imbalance. Ultimately, we propose a fair recommender system based on re-weighting and re-ranking strategies to respectively mitigate these associated imbalance challenges. Experimental results demonstrate both strategies improve fairness while their combination achieves the best performance towards maintaining model utility while improving fairness.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) have gained widespread applications across various domains owing to the superior ability to capture users' interests. However, the complexity and nuanced nature of users' interests, which span a wide range of diversity, pose a significant challenge in delivering fair recommendations. In practice, user preferences vary significantly; some users show a clear preference toward certain item categories, while others have a broad interest in diverse ones. Even though it is expected that all users should receive high-quality recommendations, the effectiveness of RSs in catering to this disparate interest diversity remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate whether users with varied levels of interest diversity are treated fairly. Our empirical experiments reveal an inherent disparity: users with broader interests often receive lower-quality recommendations. To mitigate this, we propose a multi-interest framework that uses multiple (virtual) interest embeddings rather than single ones to represent users. Specifically, the framework consists of stacked multi-interest representation layers, which include an interest embedding generator that derives virtual interests from shared parameters, and a center embedding aggregator that facilitates multi-hop aggregation. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in achieving better trade-off between fairness and utility across various datasets and backbones.",

            "title": "Edge Classification on Graphs: New Directions in Topological Imbalance",
            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of applying Graph machine learning (GML) to node/graph classification and link prediction. However, edge classification task that enjoys numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis and cybersecurity, has not seen significant advancement. To address this gap, our study pioneers a comprehensive approach to edge classification. We identify a novel `Topological Imbalance Issue', which arises from the skewed distribution of edges across different classes, affecting the local subgraph of each edge and harming the performance of edge classifications. Inspired by the recent studies in node classification that the performance discrepancy exists with varying local structural patterns, we aim to investigate if the performance discrepancy in topological imbalanced edge classification can also be mitigated by characterizing the local class distribution variance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Topological Entropy (TE), a novel topological-based metric that measures the topological imbalance for each edge. Our empirical studies confirm that TE effectively measures local class distribution variance, and indicate that prioritizing edges with high TE values can help address the issue of topological imbalance. Based on this, we develop two strategies - Topological Reweighting and TE Wedge-based Mixup - to focus training on (synthetic) edges based on their TEs. While topological reweighting directly manipulates training edge weights according to TE, our wedge-based mixup interpolates synthetic edges between high TE wedges. Ultimately, we integrate these strategies into a novel topological imbalance strategy for edge classification: TopoEdge. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed strategies on newly curated datasets and thus establish a new benchmark for (imbalanced) edge classification.",

            "title": "A Topological Perspective on Demystifying GNN-Based Link Prediction Performance",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction (LP). While numerous studies aim to improve the overall LP performance of GNNs, none have explored its varying performance across different nodes and its underlying reasons. To this end, we aim to demystify which nodes will perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit poorer LP performance, our empirical findings provide nuances to this viewpoint and prompt us to propose a better metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC has a higher correlation with LP performance than other node-level topological metrics like degree and subgraph density, offering a better way to identify low-performing nodes than using cold-start. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less interactive with that node's existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and theoretically/empirically justify its efficacy in approximating TC and reducing the computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

However, the single focus on utility goals proves to be inadequate in addressing real-world concerns, leading to increasing attention to fairness-aware and diversity-aware RS. While most existing studies explore fairness and diversity independently, we identify strong connections between these two domains. In this survey, we first discuss each of them individually and then dive into their connections. Additionally, motivated by the concepts of user-level and item-level fairness, we broaden the understanding of diversity to encompass not only the item level but also the user level. With this expanded perspective on user and item-level diversity, we re-interpret fairness studies from the viewpoint of diversity. This fresh perspective enhances our understanding of fairness-related work and paves the way for potential future research directions.

However, many of these models prioritize high utility performance, such as accuracy, with a lack of privacy consideration, which is a major concern in modern society where privacy attacks are rampant. To address this issue, researchers have started to develop privacy-preserving GNNs. Despite this progress, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the attacks and the techniques for preserving privacy in the graph domain. In this survey, we aim to address this gap by summarizing the attacks on graph data according to the targeted information, categorizing the privacy preservation techniques in GNNs, and reviewing the datasets and applications that could be used for analyzing/solving privacy issues in GNNs. We also outline potential directions for future research in order to build better privacy-preserving GNNs.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great power in learning node representations on graphs. However, they may inherit historical prejudices from training data, leading to discriminatory bias in predictions. Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully adopted in recommender systems by virtue of the message-passing that implicitly captures collaborative effect. Nevertheless, most of the existing message-passing mechanisms for recommendation are directly inherited from GNNs without scrutinizing whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences. In this paper, we first analyze how message-passing captures the collaborative effect and propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighbors. After demonstrating the benefits of leveraging collaborations from neighbors with higher CIR, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN), that goes beyond 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman(1-WL) test in distinguishing non-bipartite-subgraph-isomorphic graphs. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that the best CAGCN variant outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by nearly 10% in Recall@20 and also achieves around 80% speedup.

            "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) usage and clinical workflows are intrinsically linked. To accommodate the complex care settings (e.g., emergency departments), EHR utilization workflows dynamically change in clinical practice, which in turn shapes the clinical workflows. Learning EHR workflows would provide an opportunity for healthcare organizations to enhance clinical workflows in the context of EHRs. However, very few studies investigated HER utilization workflows executed in clinical practice. We develop a network analysis framework and apply it to EHR audit logs to infer EHR workflows. We then measure the differences in the workflows between patient subgroups divided by races via differential network analysis. We apply our framework to trauma patients admitted to the emergency department, which is one of the clinical settings that need timely support from EHR utilizations. Our results show five core EHR workflows related to Narrator, Navigator, SmartTools, Chart Review, and ED workup activities in the ED. We find EHR workflows involving Narrator, SmartTools, and BPA are different when comparing patient subgroups.",
