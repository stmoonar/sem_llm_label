            "title": "Stance and Hate Event Detection in Tweets Related to Climate Activism - Shared Task at CASE 2024",
            "abstract": "Social media plays a pivotal role in global discussions, including on climate change. The variety of opinions expressed range from supportive to oppositional, with some instances of hate speech. Recognizing the importance of understanding these varied perspectives, the 7th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE) at EACL 2024 hosted a shared task focused on detecting stances and hate speech in climate activism-related tweets. This task was divided into three subtasks: subtasks A and B concentrated on identifying hate speech and its targets, while subtask C focused on stance detection. Participants\u2019 performance was evaluated using the macro F1-score. With over 100 teams participating, the highest F1 scores achieved were 91.44% in subtask C, 78.58% in subtask B, and 74.83% in subtask A. This paper details the methodologies of 24 teams that submitted their results to the competition\u2019s leaderboard.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of text-embedded images presents a formidable challenge in machine learning given the need for multimodal understanding of the multiple aspects of expression conveyed in them. While previous research in multimodal analysis has primarily focused on singular aspects such as hate speech and its subclasses, our study expands the focus to encompass multiple aspects of linguistics: hate, target, stance, and humor detection. We introduce a novel dataset PrideMM comprising text-embedded images associated with the LGBTQ+ Pride movement, thereby addressing a serious gap in existing resources. We conduct extensive experimentation on PrideMM by using unimodal and multimodal baseline methods to establish benchmarks for each task. Additionally, we propose a novel framework MemeCLIP for efficient downstream learning while preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model. The results of our experiments show that MemeCLIP achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed frameworks on two real-world datasets. We further compare the performance of MemeCLIP and zero-shot GPT-4 on the hate classification task. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of our model by qualitatively analyzing misclassified samples.

            "title": "Analyzing the Dynamics of Climate Change Discourse on Twitter: A New Annotated Corpus and Multi-Aspect Classification",
            "abstract": "The discourse surrounding climate change on social media platforms has emerged as a significant avenue for understanding public sentiments, perspectives, and engagement with this critical global issue. The unavailability of publicly available datasets, coupled with ignoring the multi-aspect analysis of climate discourse on social media platforms, has underscored the necessity for further advancement in this area. To address this gap, in this paper, we present an extensive exploration of the intricate realm of climate change discourse on Twitter, leveraging a meticulously annotated ClimaConvo dataset comprising 15,309 tweets. Our annotations encompass a rich spectrum, including aspects like relevance, stance, hate speech, the direction of hate, and humor, offering a nuanced understanding of the discourse dynamics. We address the challenges inherent in dissecting online climate discussions and detail our comprehensive annotation methodology. In addition to annotations, we conduct benchmarking assessments across various algorithms for six tasks: relevance detection, stance detection, hate speech identification, direction and target, and humor analysis. This assessment enhances our grasp of sentiment fluctuations and linguistic subtleties within the discourse. Our analysis extends to exploratory data examination, unveiling tweet distribution patterns, stance prevalence, and hate speech trends. Employing sophisticated topic modeling techniques uncovers underlying thematic clusters, providing insights into the diverse narrative threads woven within the discourse. The findings present a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and communicators seeking to navigate the intricacies of climate change discussions.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognitive abilities and memory, especially in older adults. One of the challenges of AD is that it can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages. However, recent research has shown that changes in language, including speech decline and difficulty in processing information, can be important indicators of AD and may help with early detection. Hence, the speech narratives of the patients can be useful in diagnosing the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While the previous works have presented the potential of using speech narratives to diagnose AD in high-resource languages, this work explores the possibility of using a low-resourced language, i.e., Hindi language, to diagnose AD. In this paper, we present a dataset specifically for analyzing AD in the Hindi language, along with experimental results using various state-of-the-art algorithms to assess the diagnostic potential of speech narratives in Hindi. Our analysis suggests that speech narratives in the Hindi language have the potential to aid in the diagnosis of AD.

            "title": "Multi-Aspect Annotation and Analysis of Nepali Tweets on Anti-Establishment Election Discourse",
            "abstract": "In today\u2019s social media-dominated landscape, digital platforms wield substantial influence over public opinion, particularly during crucial political events such as electoral processes. These platforms become hubs for diverse discussions, encompassing topics, reforms, and desired changes. Notably, in times of government dissatisfaction, they serve as arenas for anti-establishment discourse, highlighting the need to analyze public sentiment in these conversations. However, the analysis of such discourse is notably scarce, even in high-resource languages, and entirely non-existent in the context of the Nepali language. To address this critical gap, we present Nepal Anti Establishment discourse Tweets (NAET), a novel dataset comprising 4,445 multi-aspect annotated Nepali tweets, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of political conversations. Our contributions encompass evaluating tweet relevance, sentiment, and satire, while also exploring the presence of hate speech, identifying its targets, and distinguishing directed and non-directed expressions. Additionally, we investigate hope speech, an underexplored aspect crucial in the context of anti-establishment discourse, as it reflects the aspirations and expectations from new political figures and parties. Furthermore, we set NLP-based baselines for all these tasks. To ensure a holistic analysis, we also employ topic modeling, a powerful technique that helps us identify and understand the prevalent themes and patterns emerging from the discourse. Our research thus presents a comprehensive and multi-faceted perspective on anti-establishment election discourse in a low-resource language setting. The dataset is publicly available, facilitating in-depth analysis of political tweets in Nepali discourse and further advancing NLP research for the Nepali language through labeled data and baselines for various NLP tasks. The dataset for this work is made available at https://github.com/rkritesh210/NAET.",
