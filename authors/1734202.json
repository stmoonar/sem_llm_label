            "abstract": "The evolution of ICT architectures towards IoT, Fog / Edge and Cloud paradigms represents an interesting opportunity for the electro-energy sector as it allows to improve and extend functions currently implemented for the monitoring and control of the electrical infrastructure. Securing these platforms represents an important challenge considering critical infrastructures. It is of paramount importance to study the cyber security aspects in terms of preventive and defensive security measures to be implemented. This paper proposes a secure and cost-effective platform based on openHAB and MQTT implementation for the monitoring and control of Electric Vehicle Recharge system. Moreover the paper evaluates the impact of the implementation of end-to-end security on this particular use case, taking into account the specific requirements, in order to demonstrate the possibility to implement cyber security measures without compromising the communication performance. The use of end-to-end secured communications and the deploy of a private cloud connected with single board computers allow to obtain an economic solution addressing cyber security aspects.",

            "title": "The Smart Grid Semantic Platform: Synergy between IEC Common Information Model (CIM) and Big Data",
            "abstract": "Recent innovations in Information Technology, Cloud Computing, Big Data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling technological solutions that were previously unimaginable, or usually available only for big IT companies, with impacts in both industry and services. The demonstrator named Smart Grid Semantic Platform (SGSP) has been created using these technologies integrating several aspects of the management of an electricity distribution network. The services deployed on the platform concern the visualization of the topographic data and electricity grid assets, as well as the processing and displaying of historical data related to the operation of the networks and/or the result of Big Data analysis. This paper demonstrates how useful the synergy is between the standard semantic model of the electric network (IEC CIM 61968) and the historical data of the time series of medium voltage electricity consumption analyzed using a Big Data platform. Specifically it illustrates the realization of a use case about the calculation of a load index of the electric lines.",

            "abstract": "The objective of the chapter is to present the role of cyber security experiments within a methodological approach for the evaluation of cyber risks in grid control systems. As a starting point, a cyber-power risk index has been defined to support the identification of relevant risk factors across network attack models. Instances of attack models have been then experimented on an ICT architecture implementing grid operation scenarios with the double aim of evaluating the attacks\u2019 effects by means of communication performance measures and of tuning the configuration of security mechanisms. The chapter discusses the results of a variety of attack experiments and their role in the calculation of the risk index.",

            "abstract": "Distributed intelligence and secure interconnected communication networks constitute recognized key factors for the economic operation of electricity infrastructures in competitive power markets. Hence, electric power utilities need to extend risk management frameworks with adequate tools for assessing consequences of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) threats on their critical business. This requires realistic probability estimates to cyber threat occurrences and consequent failure modes. Due to data sensitivity and rapid discovery of new vulnerability exploits, historical data series of ICT failures affecting power control infrastructures are not sufficient for a timely risk treatment. Such lack of data can partially be overcome by setting up testbeds to run controlled experiments and collect otherwise unavailable data related to cyber misbehaviours in power system operation. Within the project CRUTIAL (CRitical UTility InfrastructurAL resilience) two testbed platforms have been set up for experimentally evaluating malicious threats on macro and micro grid control scenarios. Results from experimental campaigns are analyzed in the paper by means of an evaluation framework.",

Such work was developed inside the EU funded project CRUTIAL pursuing the resilience of the EPS. The paper first motivates the use of UML. Then several UML class diagrams representing the EPS organization are presented and described. An example of critical scenario is represented by means of UML diagrams.",
