            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The rapid development of technology allows people to obtain a large amount of data, which contains important information and various noises. How to obtain useful knowledge from data is the most important thing at this stage of machine learning (ML). The problem of unbalanced classification is currently an important topic in the field of data mining and ML. At present, this problem has attracted more and more attention and is a relatively new challenge for academia and industry. The problem of unbalanced classification involves classifying data when there is insufficient data or severe category distribution deviations. Due to the inherent complexity of unbalanced data sets, more new algorithms and tools are needed to effectively convert a large amount of raw data into useful information and knowledge. Unbalanced data set is a special case of classification problem, in which the distribution between classes is uneven, and it is difficult to classify data accurately. This article mainly introduces the research on the processing method of computer algorithms based on the processing method of unbalanced data sets based on ML, aiming to provide some ideas and directions for the processing of computer algorithms based on unbalanced data sets based on ML. This article proposes a research strategy for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML, including data preprocessing, decision tree data classification algorithm, and C4.5 algorithm, which are used to conduct research experiments on processing methods for unbalanced data sets based on ML. The experimental results in this article show that the accuracy rate of the decision tree C4.5 algorithm based on ML is 94.80%, which can be better used for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML.",

            "abstract": "PurposeAs the quality of the environment decreases, enterprises and consumers' awareness of environmental protection is constantly improving. More and more enterprises begin to increase their investment in carbon emission reduction and attract environmentally friendly consumers to buy low-carbon products through advertising. The purpose of this paper is to utilize a realistic differential game model to provide dynamic carbon emission reduction strategies, advertising strategies and cooperation methods for complex supply chain members from a long-term perspective.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses the extend Vidale-Wolfe model (V-W model) to discuss the dynamic joint emission reduction strategy in the supply chain.Findings(1) When consumers' awareness of environmental protection increases, on the whole, carbon emission reduction and profit of products show an upward trend. (2) From a long-term perspective, the manufacturer's advertising subsidy to one of the retailers is the best choice. If the strength of the two retailers is unbalanced, the manufacturer will choose to cooperate with the dominant retailer. (3) Advertising, as a marketing means for retailers to promote low-carbon products, can alleviate the adverse effects of prisoner's dilemma in a semi-cooperative state, but it cannot achieve the Pareto optimization result.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper focuses on the analysis of the situation that when the manufacturer is the leader and thinks that consumers are active advocates of low-carbon products.Originality/valueThe results of this paper can provide theoretical basis for the joint emission strategy of supply chain members in low-carbon environment.",

            "abstract": "Lane reservation optimization is important in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing studies are carried out under deterministic road conditions by assuming constant road travel time. However, road conditions vary due to various factors, resulting in uncertain road travel time. This work addresses a new reliability-based lane reservation and route design problem by considering uncertain road travel time with its known mean and covariance matrix. It aims to decide which road segments in a network should implement reserved lanes and to design routes for special time-crucial transportation tasks. The objective is to maximize transportation service reliability (i.e., the probability of completing the special tasks on time). For this problem, a novel distributionally robust optimization model is first established. To solve it, this work proposes i) an adapted sample average approximation-based approach and ii) a two-stage hierarchical heuristic algorithm based on second-order cone programming. Experimental results on an illustrative example and a real-world case demonstrate that the latter is more effective and efficient than the former. In addition, we conduct a series of parameter sensitivity analysis experiments to reveal the factors affecting lane reservation and provide optimal solutions given different parameter settings.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The explanation of spatial errors in geospatial modelling has long been a challenge. This study introduces an index that captures the complexity of local spatial distribution, which can partially provide insight into spatial errors. While previous studies have explored the complexity of geographical data from various perspectives, there is limited knowledge on assessing the complexity while taking spatial dependence into account. This study proposes a measure of geocomplexity, i.e. the spatial local complexity indicator, which characterizes the complexity of local spatial patterns while considering spatial neighbor dependence. We used both aspatial and spatial models to estimate the economic inequality in Australia, and applied the spatial local complexity indicator to explain spatial errors in these models. Results show that the developed geocomplexity indicator, using a binary spatial matrix, can effectively explain spatial errors arising from models, including 17%-47% of errors in aspatial models and 14% in a spatial model. The experiments in this study support our hypothesis that geocomplexity is an essential component in explaining spatial errors. The proposed geocomplexity indicator, along with our hypothesis, has the potential for advancing the understanding complex geospatial systems and enabling applications in various fields related to spatial data analysis.",

            "abstract": "Transport infrastructure is a fundamental component of the whole infrastructure system and socio-economic development. However, it is still a challenge to identify factors affecting large-scale infrastructure due to the lack of high-quality data and inconsistent methods. To address this issue, this study developed a comparison of data- and knowledge-driven approaches in exploring factors affecting road infrastructure performance in Western Australia using network-level high-resolution road defects data. In data-driven analysis, an optimal parameters-based geographical detectors (OPGD) model, developed based on spatial heterogeneity, was developed to investigate the contributions of explanatory factors from a spatial data perspective. In knowledge-driven analysis, a questionnaire survey was performed through group interviews with regional road management teams to analyze potential explanatory factors. A spatial analytic hierarchy process (S-AHP) approach was implemented to quantify the contributions of factors based on the survey. Finally, the consistency and difference between data- and knowledge-driven approaches are evaluated based on contributions of factors and the predictions of defect risks across the road network. The results indicate that the contributions of factors tend to be similar in both approaches, and the spatial distributions of defect risks predicted by both approaches are highly correlated. The factors and risks analyzed using both methods in rural areas are more consistent than those in urban areas due to the complexity and uncertainty of road defects. Findings from this study are critical to understanding data- and knowledge-driven approaches in transport infrastructure management and determining reasonable approaches for decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing image fusion is a fundamental issue in the field of remote sensing. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing image fusion method based on optimal scale morphological convolutional neural networks (CNN) using the principle of entropy from information theory. We use an attentional CNN to fuse the optimal cartoon and texture components of the original images to obtain a high-resolution multispectral image. We obtain the cartoon and texture components using sparse decomposition-morphological component analysis (MCA) with an optimal threshold value determined by calculating the information entropy of the fused image. In the sparse decomposition process, the local discrete cosine transform dictionary and the curvelet transform dictionary compose the MCA dictionary. We sparsely decompose the original remote sensing images into a texture component and a cartoon component at an optimal scale using the information entropy to control the dictionary parameter. Experimental results show that the remote sensing image fusion method proposed in this paper can effectively retain the information of the original image, improve the spatial resolution and spectral fidelity, and provide a new idea for image fusion from the perspective of multi-morphological deep learning.",

            "abstract": "For better monitoring and controlling influenza, WHO has launched FluNet (recently integrated to FluMART) to provide a unified platform for participating countries to routinely collect influenza-related syndromic, epidemiological and virological data. However, the reported data were incomplete.We propose a novel surveillance system based on data from multiple sources to accurately assess the epidemic status of different countries, especially for those with missing surveillance data in some periods. The proposed method can automatically select a small set of reliable and informative indicators for assessing the underlying epidemic status and proper supporting data to train the predictive model. Our proactive selection method outperforms three other out-of-box methods (linear regression, multilayer perceptron, and long-short term memory) to make accurate predictions.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks have proved its capability in many machine learning tasks. The effectiveness of deep neural networks in real-world applications, however, is greatly affected by the distribution discrepancy between the training and testing data. To address the issue, domain adaptation methods have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method which combines the feature learning and the distribution estimation into one learning framework, enabling automatic update of feature representations through fine-tuning parameterized distributions. As such, our model can produce an unified distribution to represent both source and target samples. Furthermore, two new regularizers are integrated into the optimization objective to minimize the divergence of the unified distribution from those of source and target domains. Experiments on character reconstruction show that our method demonstrates much better learning ability compared to the existing variational autoencoder. More importantly, our method improves recognition accuracy by more than 5% from that of the state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation tasks built upon popular character datasets.",
