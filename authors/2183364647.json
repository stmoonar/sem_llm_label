            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Guidance\u2010assisted crowd evacuation is a process of combining individual exit choice behavior with managers' exit assignment control. The knowledge of individual exit choice preference is of great significance for optimizing global exit assignment planning. This study proposes an improved optimization model for crowd evacuation by integrating the individual\u2010level exit choice preference analysis with system\u2010level exit assignment optimization to represent more realistic crowd evacuation decisions. First, the impact factors of individual exit choice behavior are considered in a mixed logit model to predict the probability of each individual choosing each exit in specific situations. Second, a preference\u2010based exit filtering strategy is designed to analyze the sensible alternative exits for individuals or groups in multi\u2010scale evacuation cells. Finally, to pursue optimal exit assignment planning, a multi\u2010objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and an improved social force model are adopted to simulate the process of crowd evacuation and evaluate the performance of the specific exit assignment plans. The case study of an outdoor multiple\u2010exit scenario in Xi'an, China, indicates that the proposed model can help managers to understand the heterogeneity of individual evacuation behaviors. Furthermore, it will support more reliable and realistic evacuation decisions in real\u2010life situations than conventional plans that typically implement the top\u2010n strategy.",

            "abstract": "Route choice is a complex issue in simulating individual behaviors and reproducing collective phenomena during evacuations. A growing concern has been given to the individual cognitive mechanism to investigate how routing decisions are made in specific situations. However, the essential role of multiple spatio-temporal scales has not been completely considered in the current cognitive frameworks, which leads to the inaccuracy of cognition representation in evacuation decisions. This study proposes a novel spatio-temporal cognitive framework integrated with multiple spatio-temporal scales for individual route choice. First, a complete spatio-temporal cognitive mechanism is constructed to depict the individual evacuation cognition process. Second, a spatio-temporal route choice strategy that emerges from agent-based simulation and extends into the spatio-temporal potential field is designed to represent the overall time-varying cost along routes in individual subjective estimation. Finally, a spatio-temporal A* algorithm is developed for individual optimal route planning in complex outdoor evacuation scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperformed the conventional potential field model in evacuation performance, in both objective crowd evacuation evaluation metrics and individual subjectively estimated evacuation cost in cognition, and may provide more insights on crowd evacuation management and guidance.",
