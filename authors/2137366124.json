            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) effectively address information asymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn interactions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences, i.e., users have a firm belief about the fine-grained preference for one or multiple target items. Under this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and treat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and reduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering. However, in reality, users\u2019 preferences are often vague and volatile, with uncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions.

            "abstract": "While personalization increases the utility of recommender systems, it also brings the issue of filter bubbles. e.g., if the system keeps exposing and recommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the user feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in static recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In contrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive recommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to leverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user satisfaction. To achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender system (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with causal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on historical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user satisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning of the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an authentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user rating dataset. The experiments show the effectiveness of CIRS in bursting filter bubbles and achieving long-term success in interactive recommendation. The implementation of CIRS is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/ CIRS-codes.",

            "abstract": "The progress of recommender systems is hampered mainly by evaluation as it requires real-time interactions between humans and systems, which is too laborious and expensive. This issue is usually approached by utilizing the interaction history to conduct offline evaluation. However, existing datasets of user-item interactions are partially observed, leaving it unclear how and to what extent the missing interactions will influence the evaluation. To answer this question, we collect a fully-observed dataset from Kuaishou's online environment, where almost all 1,411 users have been exposed to all 3,327 items. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world fully-observed data with millions of user-item interactions. With this unique dataset, we conduct a preliminary analysis of how the two factors - data density and exposure bias - affect the evaluation results of multi-round conversational recommendation. Our main discoveries are that the performance ranking of different methods varies with the two factors, and this effect can only be alleviated in certain cases by estimating missing interactions for user simulation. This demonstrates the necessity of the fully-observed dataset. We release the dataset and the pipeline implementation for evaluation at https://kuairec.com",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems deployed in real-world applications can have inherent exposure bias, which leads to the biased logged data plaguing the researchers. A fundamental way to address this thorny problem is to collect users' interactions on randomly expose items, i.e., the missing-at-random data. A few works have asked certain users to rate or select randomly recommended items, e.g., Yahoo!, Coat, and OpenBandit. However, these datasets are either too small in size or lack key information, such as unique user ID or the features of users/items. In this work, we present KuaiRand, an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset containing millions of intervened interactions on randomly exposed videos, collected from the video-sharing mobile App, Kuaishou. Different from existing datasets, KuaiRand records 12 kinds of user feedback signals (e.g., click, like, and view time) on randomly exposed videos inserted in the recommendation feeds in two weeks. To facilitate model learning, we further collect rich features of users and items as well as users' behavior history. By releasing this dataset, we enable the research of advanced debiasing large-scale recommendation scenarios for the first time. Also, with its distinctive features, KuaiRand can support various other research directions such as interactive recommendation, long sequential behavior modeling, and multi-task learning. The dataset is available at https://kuairand.com.",

            "title": "Seamlessly Unifying Attributes and Items: Conversational Recommendation for Cold-start Users",
            "abstract": "Static recommendation methods like collaborative filtering suffer from the inherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start users. Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this limitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods model recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider the items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which naturally provide interpretable information of user\u2019s current demands and can effectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the conversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask the attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important scenario was studied in a recent work [54]. However, it employs a hand-crafted function to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such separate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system highly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing fragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify attributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs automatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational Thompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in conversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to play. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) [54] and Estimation\u2014Action\u2014Reflection model [27] in both metrics of success rate and average number of conversation turns.",

            "abstract": ": There is no reasonable scientific basis for selecting the excellent teachers of the school\u2019s courses. To solve the practical problem, we firstly give a series of normalization models for defining the key attributes of teachers\u2019 professional foundation, course difficulty coefficient, and comprehensive evaluation of teaching. Then, we define a partial weight function to calculate the key attributes, and obtain the partial recommendation values. Next, we construct a highly sparse Teaching Recommendation Factorization Machines (TRFMs) model, which takes the 5-tuples relation including teacher, course, teachers\u2019 professional foundation, course difficulty, teaching evaluation as the feature vector, and take partial recommendation value as the recommendation label. Finally, we design a novel Top-N excellent teacher recommendation algorithm based on TRFMs by course classification on the highly sparse dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed TRFMs and recommendation algorithm can accurately realize the recommendation of excellent teachers on a highly sparse historical teaching dataset. The recommendation accuracy is superior to that of the three-dimensional tensor decomposition model algorithm which also solves sparse datasets. The proposed method can be used as a new recommendation method applied to the teaching arrangements in all kinds of schools, which can effectively improve the teaching quality.",
