            "abstract": "Abstract The rapid development of technology allows people to obtain a large amount of data, which contains important information and various noises. How to obtain useful knowledge from data is the most important thing at this stage of machine learning (ML). The problem of unbalanced classification is currently an important topic in the field of data mining and ML. At present, this problem has attracted more and more attention and is a relatively new challenge for academia and industry. The problem of unbalanced classification involves classifying data when there is insufficient data or severe category distribution deviations. Due to the inherent complexity of unbalanced data sets, more new algorithms and tools are needed to effectively convert a large amount of raw data into useful information and knowledge. Unbalanced data set is a special case of classification problem, in which the distribution between classes is uneven, and it is difficult to classify data accurately. This article mainly introduces the research on the processing method of computer algorithms based on the processing method of unbalanced data sets based on ML, aiming to provide some ideas and directions for the processing of computer algorithms based on unbalanced data sets based on ML. This article proposes a research strategy for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML, including data preprocessing, decision tree data classification algorithm, and C4.5 algorithm, which are used to conduct research experiments on processing methods for unbalanced data sets based on ML. The experimental results in this article show that the accuracy rate of the decision tree C4.5 algorithm based on ML is 94.80%, which can be better used for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML.",
