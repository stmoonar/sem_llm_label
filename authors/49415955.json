            "abstract": "Edge caching has emerged as a promising approach to meet explosive mobile data on 6G networks. One critical issue in edge caching is file popularity prediction. The federated learning (FL) based distributed algorithm is used to predict file popularity, which solves user privacy issues in centralized algorithms. However, due to the heterogeneity of user devices, the feedback time (i.e., the update and upload time of model parameters) is various for each user, which causes the feedback delay in the framework of FL-based edge caching. In this letter, we devise a feedback delay-tolerant proactive caching scheme (FLASH) based on FL in which each user utilizes hybrid filtering on stacked autoencoders to train the prediction model locally. Experimental results indicate that FLASH can effectively handle feedback delay and outperform counterpart algorithms in cache efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is considered to be a promising technique to mitigate multi-user interference and achieve concurrent uplink transmissions, but the optimal power allocation (PA) issue for SIC users is not well addressed. In this article, we focus on the optimization of the PA ratio of users on an SIC channel and analytically obtain the optimal PA ratio with regard to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for successful demodulation and the sustainable demodulation error rate. Then, we design an efficient resource allocation (RA) scheme using the obtained optimal PA ratio. Finally, we compare the proposal with the near-optimum RA obtained by a simulated annealing search and the RA scheme with random PA. Simulation results show that our proposal achieves a performance close to the near-optimum and much higher performance than the random scheme in terms of total utility and Jain\"s fairness index. To demonstrate the applicability of our proposal, we also simulate the proposal in various network paradigms, including wireless local area network, body area network, and vehicular ad hoc network.",

            "abstract": "To mitigate interference on cell-edge users and improve fairness of the whole system, dynamic inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) is one of the promising solutions. However, traditional dynamic ICIC is considered as an NP-hard problem and power variability further adds another dimension to this joint optimization issue, making it even more difficult to quickly reach a near-optimal solution. Therefore, we theoretically obtain the closed-form expression of the near-optimal power allocation ratio for users in adjacent cells paired in the same resource block and interfere each other, so that the total utility corresponding to \u03b1-fairness is maximized. Dynamic ICIC using this closed-form solution could improve user fairness without causing an increment of the computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with the schemes using identical power for different users, our method does not obviously degrade the system's average spectral efficiency.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of wireless networking technologies, the Internet of Things and heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) tend to be integrated to form a promising wireless network paradigm for 5G. Hyper-dense sensor and mobile devices will be deployed under the coverage of heterogeneous cells, so that each of them could freely select any available cell covering it and compete for resource with others selecting the same cell, forming a cell selection (CS) game between these devices. Since different types of cells usually share the same portion of the spectrum, devices selecting overlapped cells can experience severe inter-cell interference (ICI). In this article, we study the CS game among a large amount of densely-deployed sensor and mobile devices for their uplink transmissions in a two-tier HCN. ICI is embedded with the traditional congestion game (TCG), forming a congestion game with ICI (CGI) and a congestion game with capacity (CGC). For the three games above, we theoretically find the circular boundaries between the devices selecting the macrocell and those selecting the picocells, indicated by the pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE). Meanwhile, through a number of simulations with different picocell radii and different path loss exponents, the collapse of the PSNE impacted by severe ICI (i.e., a large number of picocell devices change their CS preferences to the macrocell) is profoundly revealed, and the collapse points are identified.",
