            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become ubiquitous across scientific fields, and their execution methods and systems continue to be the subject of research and development. Most experimental evaluations of these workflows rely on workflow instances, which can be either real-world or synthetic, to ensure relevance to current application domains or explore hypothetical/future scenarios. The WfCommons project addresses this need by providing data and tools to support such evaluations. In this paper, we present an overview of WfCommons and describe two recent developments. Firstly, we introduce a workflow execution \"tracer\" for Nextflow, which significantly enhances the set of real-world instances available in WfCommons. Secondly, we describe a workflow instance \"translator\" that enables the execution of any real-world or synthetic WfCommons workflow instance using Dask. Our contributions aim to provide researchers and practitioners with more comprehensive resources for evaluating scientific workflows.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Tightening the Integration between Computing Facilities and Scientific Workflows",
            "abstract": "The importance of workflows is highlighted by the fact that they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past decades. Many of these workflows have significant computational, storage, and communication demands, and thus must execute on a range of large-scale computer systems, from local clusters to public clouds and upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Historically, infrastructures for workflow execution consisted of complex, integrated systems, developed in-house by workflow practitioners with strong dependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing need to support workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide abstractions for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and efficiently while ensuring portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile individually, there are now hundreds of independent workflow systems. The resulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may present significant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly comparable, yet usually mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to tackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded ExaWorks and NSF-funded WorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled the\"Workflows Community Summit\". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community Summit\"explored workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of computing centers and facilities. The third summit brought together a small group of facilities representatives with the aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.

To handle the deployment, monitoring, and optimization of workflow executions, many workflow systems have been developed over the past decade. There is a need for workflow benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the performance of workflow systems on current and future software stacks and hardware platforms.We present a generator of realistic workflow benchmark specifications that can be translated into benchmark code to be executed with current workflow systems. Our approach generates workflow tasks with arbitrary performance characteristics (CPU, memory, and I/O usage) and with realistic task dependency structures based on those seen in production workflows. We present experimental results that show that our approach generates benchmarks that are representative of production workflows, and conduct a case study to demonstrate the use and usefulness of our generated benchmarks to evaluate the performance of workflow systems under different configuration scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of Big Data in recent years has resulted in a growing need for efficient data processing solutions. While infrastructures with sufficient compute power are available, the I/O bottleneck remains. The Linux page cache is an efficient approach to reduce I/O overheads, but few experimental studies of its interactions with Big Data applications exist, partly due to limitations of real-world experiments. Simulation is a popular approach to address these issues, however, existing simulation frameworks do not simulate page caching fully, or even at all. As a result, simulation-based performance studies of data-intensive applications can lead to misleading results and inaccurate conclusions.In this paper, we propose an I/O simulation model that captures the key features of the Linux page cache. We have implemented this model as part of the WRENCH workflow simulation framework, which itself builds on the popular Sim-Grid distributed systems simulation framework. Our model and its implementation enable the simulation of both single-threaded and multithreaded applications, and of both writeback and writethrough caches for local or network-based filesystems. We evaluate the accuracy of our model in different conditions, including sequential and concurrent applications, as well as local and remote I/Os. We find that our page cache model reduces the simulation error by up to an order of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art, cacheless simulations. Our model is publicly available in the WRENCH framework, making it usable in a wide range of simulation studies.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflow applications have become mainstream and their automated and efficient execution on large-scale compute platforms is the object of extensive research and development. For these efforts to be successful, a solid experimental methodology is needed to evaluate workflow algorithms and systems. A foundation for this methodology is the availability of realistic workflow instances. Dozens of workflow instances for a few scientific applications are available in public repositories. While these are invaluable, they are limited: workflow instances are not available for all application scales of interest. To address this limitation, previous work has developed generators of synthetic, but representative, workflow instances of arbitrary scales. These generators are popular, but implementing them is a manual, labor-intensive process that requires expert application knowledge. As a result, these generators only target a handful of applications, even though hundreds of applications use workflows in production.In this work, we present WfChef, a framework that fully automates the process of constructing a synthetic workflow generator for any scientific application. Based on an input set of workflow instances, WfChef automatically produces a synthetic workflow generator. We define and evaluate several metrics for quantifying the realism of the generated workflows. Using these metrics, we compare the realism of the workflows generated by WfChef generators to that of the workflows generated by the previously available, hand-crafted generators. We find that the WfChef generators not only require zero development effort (because it is automatically produced), but also generate workflows that are more realistic than those generated by hand-crafted generators.",

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.
