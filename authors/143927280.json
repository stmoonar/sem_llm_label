            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral remote sensing produces large volumes of data, quite often requiring hundreds of megabytes to \ngigabytes of memory storage for a small geographical area for one-time data collection. Although the high spectral resolution \nof hyperspectral data is quite useful for capturing and discriminating subtle differences in geospatial characteristics of the \ntarget, it contains redundant information at the band level. The objective of this study was to identify those bands that contain \nthe most information needed for characterizing a specific geospatial feature with minimal redundancy. Band selection is performed \nwith both unsupervised and supervised approaches. Five methods (three unsupervised and two supervised) are proposed \nand compared to identify hyperspectral image bands to characterize soil electrical conductivity and canopy coverage \nin agricultural fields. The unsupervised approach includes information entropy measure and first and second derivatives \nalong the spectral axis. The supervised approach selects hyperspectral bands based on supplemental ground truth data using \nprincipal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) based models. Each hyperspectral image band was \nranked using all five methods. Twenty best bands were selected by each method with the focus on soil and plant canopy characterization \nin precision agriculture. The results showed that each of these methods may be appropriate for different applications. \nThe entropy measure and PCA were quite useful for selecting bands with the most information content, while derivative \nmethods could be used for identifying absorption features. ANN measure was the most useful in selecting bands specific to \na target characteristic with minimum information redundancy. The results also indicated that a combination of wavebands \nwith different bandwidths will allow use of fewer than 20 bands used in this study to represent the information contained in \nthe top 20 bands, thus reducing image data dimensionality and volume considerably.",

            "abstract": "Feature selection is one of the fundamental problems in nearly every application of statistical modeling, and hyperspectral data analysis is no exception. We propose a new methodology for combining unsupervised and supervised methods under classification accuracy and computational requirement constraints. It is designed to perform not only hyperspectral band (wavelength range) selection but also classification method selection. The procedure involves ranking hands based on information content and redundancy and evaluating a varying number of the top ranked bands. We term this technique Rank Ordered With Accuracy Selection (ROWAS). It provides a good tradeoff between feature space exploration and computational efficiency. To verify our methodology, we conducted experiments with a georeferenced hyperspectral image (acquired by an AVIRIS sensor) and categorical ground measurements.",
