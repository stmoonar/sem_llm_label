            "title": "GLUCOSE: GeneraLized and COntextualized Story Explanations",
            "abstract": "When humans read or listen, they make implicit commonsense inferences that frame their understanding of what happened and why. As a step toward AI systems that can build similar mental models, we introduce GLUCOSE, a large-scale dataset of implicit commonsense causal knowledge, encoded as causal mini-theories about the world, each grounded in a narrative context. To construct GLUCOSE, we drew on cognitive psychology to identify ten dimensions of causal explanation, focusing on events, states, motivations, and emotions. Each GLUCOSE entry includes a story-specific causal statement paired with an inference rule generalized from the statement. This paper details two concrete contributions: First, we present our platform for effectively crowdsourcing GLUCOSE data at scale, which uses semi-structured templates to elicit causal explanations. Using this platform, we collected 440K specific statements and general rules that capture implicit commonsense knowledge about everyday situations. Second, we show that existing knowledge resources and pretrained language models do not include or readily predict GLUCOSE's rich inferential content. However, when state-of-the-art neural models are trained on this knowledge, they can start to make commonsense inferences on unseen stories that match humans' mental models.",

            "abstract": "Frame semantic parsing is a complex problem which includes multiple underlying subtasks. Recent approaches have employed joint learning of subtasks (such as predicate and argument detection), and multi-task learning of related tasks (such as syntactic and semantic parsing). In this paper, we explore multi-task learning of all subtasks with transformer-based models. We show that a purely generative encoder-decoder architecture handily beats the previous state of the art in FrameNet 1.7 parsing, and that a mixed decoding multi-task approach achieves even better performance.",

            "abstract": "Many tasks aim to measure machine reading comprehension (MRC), often focusing on question types presumed to be difficult. Rarely, however, do task designers start by considering what systems should in fact comprehend. In this paper we make two key contributions. First, we argue that existing approaches do not adequately define comprehension; they are too unsystematic about what content is tested. Second, we present a detailed definition of comprehension\u2014a \u201cTemplate of Understanding\u201d\u2014for a widely useful class of texts, namely short narratives. We then conduct an experiment that strongly suggests existing systems are not up to the task of narrative understanding as we define it.",

            "abstract": "Conflict management, communication, and negotiation are important components of collaborative multiagent activity. Thus, a collaborative agent must be able to handle situations in which conflicts arise and must be capable of negotiating with other agents to reach an agreement. This paper presents a model which 1) captures multi-agent collaboration in Propose-Evaluate-Modij~ cycle of actions, 2) initiates negotiation with the executing agent to resolve detected conflicts regarding proposed actions and proposed beliefs, 3) selects the focus of the modification process when multiple conflicts arise, and 4) handles the negotiation of proposed domain actions, proposed problem-solving actions, and proposed beliefs in a unified manner.",
