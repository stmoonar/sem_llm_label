            "abstract": "Reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of the complex relationships between entities and the underlying logic of their relations. Current approaches rely on learning geometries to embed entities in vector space for logical query operations, but they suffer from subpar performance on complex queries and dataset-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled approach, Language-guided Abstract Reasoning over Knowledge graphs (LARK), that formulates complex KG reasoning as a combination of contextual KG search and logical query reasoning, to leverage the strengths of graph extraction algorithms and large language models (LLM), respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art KG reasoning methods on standard benchmark datasets across several logical query constructs, with significant performance gain for queries of higher complexity. Furthermore, we show that the performance of our approach improves proportionally to the increase in size of the underlying LLM, enabling the integration of the latest advancements in LLMs for logical reasoning over KGs. Our work presents a new direction for addressing the challenges of complex KG reasoning and paves the way for future research in this area.",

            "title": "Text Enriched Sparse Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks",
            "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks, which connect informative nodes containing text with different edge types, are routinely used to store and process information in various real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their hyperbolic variants provide a promising approach to encode such networks in a low-dimensional latent space through neighborhood aggregation and hierarchical feature extraction, respectively. However, these approaches typically ignore metapath structures and the available semantic information. Furthermore, these approaches are sensitive to the noise present in the training data. To tackle these limitations, in this paper, we propose Text Enriched Sparse Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Network (TESH-GCN) to capture the graph's metapath structures using semantic signals and further improve prediction in large heterogeneous graphs. In TESH-GCN, we extract semantic node information, which successively acts as a connection signal to extract relevant nodes' local neighborhood and graph-level metapath features from the sparse adjacency tensor in a reformulated hyperbolic graph convolution layer. These extracted features in conjunction with semantic features from the language model (for robustness) are used for the final downstream task. Experiments on various heterogeneous graph datasets show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin on the task of link prediction. We also report a reduction in both the training time and model parameters compared to the existing hyperbolic approaches through a reformulated hyperbolic graph convolution. Furthermore, we illustrate the robustness of our model by experimenting with different levels of simulated noise in both the graph structure and text, and also, present a mechanism to explain TESH-GCN's prediction by analyzing the extracted metapaths.",

            "abstract": "Short text is ambiguous and often relies predominantly on the domain and context at hand in order to attain semantic relevance. Existing classification models perform poorly on short text due to data sparsity and inadequate context. Auxiliary context, which can often provide sufficient background regarding the domain, is typically available in several application scenarios. While some of the existing works aim to leverage real-world knowledge to enhance short-text representations, they fail to place appropriate emphasis on the auxiliary context. Such models do not harness the full potential of the available context in auxiliary sources. To address this challenge, we reformulate short-text classification as a dual channel self-supervised learning problem (that leverages auxiliary context) with a generation network and a corresponding prediction model. We propose a self-supervised framework, Pseudo-Auxiliary Context generation network for Short-text Modeling (PACS), to comprehensively leverage auxiliary context and it is jointly learned with a prediction network in an end-to-end manner. Our PACS model consists of two sub-networks: a Context Generation Network (CGN) that models the auxiliary context\u2019s distribution and a Prediction Network (PN) to map the short-text features and auxiliary context distribution to the final class label. Our experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that PACS outperforms formidable state-of-the-art baselines. We also demonstrate the performance of our model on cold-start scenarios (where contextual information is non-existent) during prediction. Furthermore, we perform interpretability and ablation studies to analyze various representational features captured by our model and the individual contribution of its modules to the overall performance of PACS, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Product search is a fundamentally challenging problem due to the large-size of product catalogues and the complexity of extracting semantic information from products. In addition to this, the black-box nature of most search systems also hamper a smooth customer experience. Current approaches in this area utilize lexical and semantic product information to match user queries against products. However, these models lack (i) a hierarchical query representation, (ii) a mechanism to detect and capture inter-entity relationships within a query, and (iii) a query composition method specific to e-commerce domain. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an AtteNTive Hyperbolic Entity Model (ANTHEM), a novel attention-based product search framework that models query entities as two-vector hyperboloids, learns inter-entity intersections and utilizes attention to unionize individual entities and inter-entity intersections to predict product matches from the search space. ANTHEM utilizes the first and second vector of hyperboloids to determine the query's semantic position and to tune its surrounding search volume, respectively. The attention networks capture the significance of intra-entity and inter-entity intersections to the final query space. Additionally, we provide a mechanism to comprehend ANTHEM and understand the significance of query entities towards the final resultant products. We evaluate the performance of our model on real data collected from popular e-commerce sites. Our experimental study on the offline data demonstrates compelling evidence of ANTHEM's superior performance over state-of-the-art product search methods with an improvement of more than 10% on various metrics. We also demonstrate the quality of ANTHEM's query encoder using a query matching task.",

            "title": "Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9: A Unification Framework for Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Hyperbolic neural networks have recently gained signi\ufb01cant attention due to their promising results on several graph problems including node classi\ufb01cation and link prediction. The primary reason for this success is the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space in capturing the inherent hierarchy of graph datasets. However, they are limited in terms of generalization, scalability, and have inferior performance when it comes to non-hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we take a completely orthogonal perspective for modeling hyperbolic networks. We use Poincar\u00e9 disk to model the hyperbolic geometry and also treat it as if the disk itself is a tangent space at origin. This enables us to replace non-scalable M\u00f6bius gyrovector operations with an Euclidean approximation, and thus simplifying the entire hyperbolic model to a Euclidean model cascaded with a hyperbolic normalization function. Our approach does not adhere to M\u00f6bius math, yet it still works in the Riemannian manifold, hence we call it Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9 framework. We applied our non-linear hyperbolic normalization to the current state-of-the-art homogeneous and multi-relational graph networks and demonstrate signi\ufb01cant improvements in performance compared to both Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts. The primary impact of this work lies in its ability to capture hierarchical features in the Euclidean space, and thus, can replace hyperbolic networks without loss in performance metrics while simultaneously leveraging the power of Euclidean networks such as interpretability and ef\ufb01cient execution of various model components.",

            "abstract": "Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained prominence for representation learning in graph processing tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Several Euclidean graph models have been adapted to work in the hyperbolic space and the variants have shown a significant increase in performance. However, research and development in graph modeling currently involve several tedious tasks with a scope of standardization including data processing, parameter configuration, optimization tricks, and unavailability of public codebases. With the proliferation of new tasks such as knowledge graph reasoning and generation, there is a need in the community for a unified framework that eases the development and analysis of both Euclidean and hyperbolic graph networks, especially for new researchers in the field. To this end, we present a novel framework, GraphZoo, that makes learning, designing and applying graph processing pipelines/models systematic through abstraction over the redundant components. The framework contains a versatile library that supports several hyperbolic manifolds and an easy-to-use modular framework to perform graph processing tasks which aids researchers in different components, namely, (i) reproduce evaluation pipelines of state-of-the-art approaches, (ii) design new hyperbolic or Euclidean graph networks and compare them against the state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, (iii) add custom datasets for evaluation, (iv) add new tasks and evaluation criteria.",

This has driven research into hyperbolic space due to their ability to effectively encode the inherent hierarchy present in graph datasets. However, a major bottleneck here is the obscurity of hyperbolic geometry and a better comprehension of its gyrovector operations. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce researchers and practitioners in the data mining community to the hyperbolic equivariants of the Euclidean operations that are necessary to tackle their application to neural networks. We describe the popular hyperbolic variants of GNN architectures and explain their implementation, in contrast to the Euclidean counterparts. Also, we motivate our tutorial through critical analysis of existing applications in the areas of graph mining, knowledge graph reasoning, search, NLP, and computer vision.",

However, they entangle multiple incongruent (gyro-)vector spaces within a layer, which makes them limited in terms of generalization and scalability.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we propose the Poincar\u00e9 disk model as our search space, and apply all approximations on the disk (as if the disk is a tangent space derived from the origin), thus getting rid of all inter-space transformations. Such an approach enables us to propose a hyperbolic normalization layer and to further simplify the entire hyperbolic model to a Euclidean model cascaded with our hyperbolic normalization layer. We applied our proposed nonlinear hyperbolic normalization to the current state-of-the-art homogeneous and multi-relational graph networks. We demonstrate that our model not only leverages the power of Euclidean networks such as interpretability and efficient execution of various model components, but also outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts on various benchmarks.

            "title": "Graph-based Multilingual Language Model: Leveraging Product Relations for Search Relevance",
            "abstract": "The large-scale nature of product catalog and the changing demands of customer queries makes product search a challenging problem. The customer queries are ambiguous and implicit. They may be looking for an exact match of their query, or a functional equivalent (i.e., substitute), or an accessory to go with it (i.e., complement). It is important to distinguish these three categories from merely classifying an item for a customer query as relevant or not. This information can help direct the customer and improve search applications to understand the customer mission. In this paper, we formulate search relevance as a multi-class classification problem and propose a graph-based solution to classify a given query-item pair as exact, substitute, complement, or irrelevant (ESCI). The customer engagement (clicks, add-to-cart, and purchases) between query and items serve as a crucial information for this problem. However, existing approaches rely purely on the textual information (such as BERT) and do not sufficiently focus on the structural relationships. Another challenge in including the structural information is the sparsity of such data in some regions. We propose Structure-Aware multilingual LAnguage Model (SALAM), that utilizes a language model along with a graph neural network, to extract region-specific semantics as well as relational information for the classification of query-product pairs. Our model is first pre-trained on a large region-agnostic dataset and behavioral graph data and then fine-tuned on region-specific versions to address the sparsity. We show in our experiments that SALAM significantly outperforms the current matching frameworks on the ESCI classification task in several regions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using a two-phased training setup (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning) in capturing region-specific information. Also, we provide various challenges and solutions for using the model in an industrial setting and outline its contribution to the e-commerce engine.",
