            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

In this paper we examine a complex workflow using XGC fusions simulation run on the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility's supercomputer Summit, which also involve three anal-yses as part of the results necessary for scientific discovery. We discuss the challenges faced when implementing these algorithms and present an original hybrid staging technique to help enable the physicists to make discoveries during the execution of the simulation. By creating this infrastructure, we can examine complicated physics results, which may not have been possible without the infrastructure. For example, our work enables the online visualization of turbulent homoclinic tangle around the magnetic X-point, breaking the last confinement surface. This visualization could help fusion scientists to better understand and improve the turbulence spread of plasma exhaust heat, which is crucial toward realizing plasmas beyond the currently accessible physics regimes of present-day tokamak reactors. The physics of turbulent homoclinic tangle will be reported in a future physics publication, by utilizing the original online analysis/visualization framework presented in this paper.",

To handle the deployment, monitoring, and optimization of workflow executions, many workflow systems have been developed over the past decade. There is a need for workflow benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the performance of workflow systems on current and future software stacks and hardware platforms.We present a generator of realistic workflow benchmark specifications that can be translated into benchmark code to be executed with current workflow systems. Our approach generates workflow tasks with arbitrary performance characteristics (CPU, memory, and I/O usage) and with realistic task dependency structures based on those seen in production workflows. We present experimental results that show that our approach generates benchmarks that are representative of production workflows, and conduct a case study to demonstrate the use and usefulness of our generated benchmarks to evaluate the performance of workflow systems under different configuration scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The ever-increasing volumes of scientific data combined with sophisticated techniques for extracting information from them have led to the increasing popularity of ensemble workflows which are a collection of runs of individual workflows. A traditional approach followed by scientists to run ensembles is to rely on simple scripts to execute different runs and manage resources. This approach is not scalable and is error-prone, thereby motivating the development of workflow management systems that specialize in executing ensembles on HPC clusters. However, when the size of both the ensemble and the target system reach extreme scales, existing workflow management systems face new challenges that hamper their efficient execution. In this paper, we describe our experience scaling an ensemble workflow from the computational biology domain from the early design stages to the execution at extreme scale on Summit, a leadership class supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We discuss challenges that arise when scaling ensembles to several million runs on thousands of HPC nodes. We identify challenges with composition of the ensemble itself, its execution at large scale, post-processing of the generated data, and scalability of the file system. Based on the experience acquired, we develop a generic vision of the capabilities and abstractions to add to existing workflow management systems to enable the execution of ensemble workflows at extreme scales. We believe that the understanding of these fundamental challenges will help application teams along with workflow system developers with designing the next generation of infrastructure for composing and executing extreme-scale ensemble workflows.",

            "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to study large-scale molecular systems. HPC systems are ideal platforms to run these studies, however, reaching the necessary simulation timescale to detect rare processes is challenging, even with modern supercomputers. To overcome the timescale limitation, the simulation of a long MD trajectory is replaced by multiple short-range simulations that are executed simultaneously in an ensemble of simulations. Analyses are usually co-scheduled with these simulations to efficiently process large volumes of data generated by the simulations at runtime, thanks to in situ techniques. Executing a workflow ensemble of simulations and their in situ analyses requires efficient co-scheduling strategies and sophisticated management of computational resources so that they are not slowing down each other. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to co-schedule simulations and in situ analyses such that the makespan of the workflow ensemble is minimized. We present a novel approach to allocate resources for a workflow ensemble under resource constraints by using a theoretical framework modeling the workflow ensemble\u2019s execution. We evaluate the proposed approach using an accurate simulator based on the WRENCH simulation framework on various workflow ensemble configurations. Results demonstrate the significance of co-scheduling simulations and in situ analyses that couple data together to benefit from data locality, in which inefficient scheduling decisions can lead to slowdown in makespan up to a factor of 30.",

            "abstract": "The amount of data generated by numerical simulations in various scientific domains led to a fundamental redesign of how the analysis and visualization of simulation outputs are performed. The throughput and capacity of storage subsystems have not evolved as fast as the computing power in extreme-scale supercomputers, making the classical post-hoc approach highly inefficient. In situ processing has then emerged as a solution in which simulation and data analysis/visualization are intertwined for better performance and greater interactivity. Determining the best allocation, i.e., how many resources to allocate to simulation and analysis respectively, mapping, i.e., where and at which frequency to run the analysis/visualization, and data transfer mode is a complex task whose performance assessment is crucial to the efficient execution of in situ processing. However, such a performance evaluation of different strategies usually relies either on directly running them on the targeted execution environments, which can rapidly become extremely time- and resource-consuming, or on resorting to simplified models of the components of an in situ application, which can lack of realism. In both cases, the validity of the performance evaluation is limited. In this paper, we present SIM-SITU, a framework for the faithful performance evaluation of in situ processing strategies. We designed SIM-SITU to reflect the typical features of in situ processing systems. Thanks to its modular design, Sim-Situ has the necessary flexibility to easily and faithfully evaluate the behavior and performance of various allocation, mapping, and data transfer strategies. We illustrate the capabilities of SIM-SITU on a Molecular Dynamics use case. We study the impact of different strategies on performance and show how users can leverage SIM-SITU to determine interesting tradeoffs when adding analysis/visualization components to their application.",

This in turn leads to a tremendous increase in size and complexity of the underlying computing infrastructures. The performance assessment of such distributed systems and the applications they run is then a complex task for which various approaches can be considered. This talk will give a general overview of these approaches for the performance assessment of distributed systems and applications: experimentation, emulation, and simulation. It will specifically focus on the main features and strengths of the SimGrid toolkit. SimGrid is a 20+ year old research project whose scope has broaden over the years from the simulation of computing grids to P2P systems, clouds, and HPC. It will introduce the two main programming APIs, the underlying (in)validated models, and present some of the tools based on SimGrid that are currently available",

            "abstract": "The promise of an easy access to a virtually unlimited number of resources makes Infrastructure as a Service Clouds a good candidate for the execution of data\u2010intensive workflow applications composed of hundreds of computational tasks. Thanks to a careful execution planning, workflow management systems can build a tailored compute infrastructure by combining a set of virtual machine instances. However, these applications usually rely on files to handle dependencies between tasks. A storage space shared by all virtual machines may become a bottleneck and badly impact the application execution time. In this article, we propose an original data\u2010aware planning algorithm that leverages two characteristics of a family of virtual machines instances, that is, a large number of cores and a dedicated storage space on fast SSD drives, to improve data locality, hence reducing the amount of data transfers over the network during the execution of a workflow. We also propose a simulation\u2010driven approach to solve a cost\u2010performance optimization problem and correctly dimension the virtual infrastructure onto which execute a given workflow. Experiments conducted with real application workflows show the benefits of the presented algorithms. The data\u2010aware planning leads to a clear reduction of both execution time and volume of data transferred over the network while the simulation\u2010driven approach allows us to dimension the infrastructure in a reasonable time.",

            "title": "Sequence-RTG: Efficient and Production-Ready Pattern Mining in System Log Messages",
            "abstract": "System logs are a wealth of information that can be leveraged to control the behaviour of a computing and storage infrastructure, detect deviations from normal behaviour, and react accordingly by triggering some predefined actions. System log management usually consists of a complex workflow that collects, standardises, indexes, stores, and visualises the log messages to help system administration teams in their daily operations. In large scale data centres such log management infrastructures can collect millions if not billions of messages per day. A key component in this workflow is the identification of message patterns, which requests the expertise of administrators. These patterns represent a template of both static and variable message parts against which a new log message can be matched. This crucial task is often done manually, but these patterns can change frequently making it time consuming for the human operators to keep up. Therefore, we propose in this paper to automate the discovery of patterns in system log messages by extending the functionalities of an existing pattern mining framework, called Sequence. Our main objectives are to improve both the scalability of this framework and its capacity to be integrated into a complete system log management workflow. We present how we addressed six main limitations of the seminal Sequence tool. These modifications led us to propose Sequence-RTG (Sequence-Ready-To-Go), a more efficient and production-ready version. We analyse its performance in terms of both speed, using data-sets of increasing sizes, and accuracy on data-sets from the literature. We also show that two months after the introduction of Sequence-RTG within the system log management framework of the IN2P3 Computing Centre we reduced the fraction of messages that are not matched to a pattern from 75-80% to only 15%.",
