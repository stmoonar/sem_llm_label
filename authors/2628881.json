            "abstract": "Sound decision-making relies on accurate prediction for tangible outcomes ranging from military conflict to disease outbreaks. To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts. The system provides a platform where users can interact with machine models and thus anchor their judgments on an objective",

            "abstract": "Wikidata and Wikipedia have been proven useful for reason-ing in natural language applications, like question answering or entitylinking. Yet, no existing work has studied the potential of Wikidata for commonsense reasoning. This paper investigates whether Wikidata con-tains commonsense knowledge which is complementary to existing commonsense sources. Starting from a definition of common sense, we devise three guiding principles, and apply them to generate a commonsense subgraph of Wikidata (Wikidata-CS). Within our approach, we map the relations of Wikidata to ConceptNet, which we also leverage to integrate Wikidata-CS into an existing consolidated commonsense graph. Our experiments reveal that: 1) albeit Wikidata-CS represents a small portion of Wikidata, it is an indicator that Wikidata contains relevant commonsense knowledge, which can be mapped to 15 ConceptNet relations; 2) the overlap between Wikidata-CS and other commonsense sources is low, motivating the value of knowledge integration; 3) Wikidata-CS has been evolving over time at a slightly slower rate compared to the overall Wikidata, indicating a possible lack of focus on commonsense knowledge. Based on these findings, we propose three recommended actions to improve the coverage and quality of Wikidata-CS further.",

            "abstract": "Commonsense question answering (QA) requires background knowledge which is not explicitly stated in a given context. Prior works use commonsense knowledge graphs (KGs) to obtain this knowledge for reasoning. However, relying entirely on these KGs may not suffice, considering their limited coverage and the contextual dependence of their knowledge. In this paper, we augment a general commonsense QA framework with a knowledgeable path generator. By extrapolating over existing paths in a KG with a state-of-the-art language model, our generator learns to connect a pair of entities in text with a dynamic, and potentially novel, multi-hop relational path. Such paths can provide structured evidence for solving commonsense questions without fine-tuning the path generator. Experiments on two datasets show the superiority of our method over previous works which fully rely on knowledge from KGs (with up to 6% improvement in accuracy), across various amounts of training data. Further evaluation suggests that the generated paths are typically interpretable, novel, and relevant to the task.",

At present, a number of valuable commonsense knowledge sources exist, with different foci, strengths, and weaknesses. In this paper, we list representative sources and their properties. Based on this survey, we propose principles and a representation model in order to consolidate them into a Common Sense Knowledge Graph (CSKG). We apply this approach to consolidate seven separate sources into a first integrated CSKG. We present statistics of CSKG, present initial investigations of its utility on four QA datasets, and list learned lessons.",

The goal is to \ufb01nd tightly connected subgroups of nodes that also have similar node-speci\ufb01c time series (temporal\u2014not necessarily structural\u2014behavior). We formulate the problem as a coupled matrix factorization for the time series, combined with regularization for network smoothness. We propose CCTN , and an incrementally-updated counterpart, CCTN-inc , which e\ufb03ciently handles network updates. Extensive experiments show that CCTN is up to 4 \u00d7 more accurate than baselines that consider graph structure or time series alone, and CCTN-inc is up to 55 \u00d7 faster than CCTN . As an application, we explore an exclusive database with millions of online ads on human tra\ufb03cking, and successfully deploy our technique to detect criminal organizations.",

            "abstract": "There is a large amount of data on the web in tabular form, such as excel sheets, CSVs, and web tables. Often, tabular data is meant for human consumption, using data layouts that are difficult for machines to interpret automatically. Previous work uses the stylistic features of tabular cells (e.g. font size, border type, background color) to classify tabular cells by their role in the data layout of the document (top attribute, data, metadata, etc.). In this paper, we propose a method to embed the semantic and contextual information about tabular cells in a low dimension cell embedding space. We then propose an RNN-based classification technique to use these cell vector representations, combining them with stylistic features introduced in previous work, in order to improve the performance of cell type classification in complex documents. We evaluate the performance of our system on three datasets containing documents with various data layouts, in two settings, in-domain, and cross-domain training. Our evaluation result shows that our proposed cell vector representations in combination with our RNN-based classification technique significantly improves cell type classification performance.",

            "abstract": "Developing scalable, semi-automatic approaches to derive insights from a domain-specific Web corpus is a longstanding research problem in the knowledge discovery community. The problem is particularly challenging in illicit fields, such as human trafficking, where traditional assumptions concerning information representation are frequently violated. In this article, we describe an end-to-end investigative knowledge discovery system for illicit Web domains. We built and evaluated a prototype, involving separate components for information extraction, semantic modeling and query execution, on a real-world human trafficking Web corpus containing 1.3 million pages, with promising results.",
