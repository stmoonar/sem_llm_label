            "title": "U2UData: A Large-scale Cooperative Perception Dataset for Swarm UAVs Autonomous Flight",
            "abstract": "Modern perception systems for autonomous flight are sensitive to occlusion and have limited long-range capability, which is a key bottleneck in improving low-altitude economic task performance. Recent research has shown that the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous flight industry. However, the lack of a large-scale dataset is hindering progress in this area. This paper presents U2UData, the first large-scale cooperative perception dataset for swarm UAVs autonomous flight. The dataset was collected by three UAVs flying autonomously in the U2USim, covering a 9 km$^2$ flight area. It comprises 315K LiDAR frames, 945K RGB and depth frames, and 2.41M annotated 3D bounding boxes for 3 classes. It also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. U2USim is the first real-world mapping swarm UAVs simulation environment. It takes Yunnan Province as the prototype and includes 4 terrains, 7 weather conditions, and 8 sensor types. U2UData introduces two perception tasks: cooperative 3D object detection and cooperative 3D object tracking. This paper provides comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative perception algorithms on these tasks.",

            "title": "The Correlation Analysis Between Cybersickness and Postural Behavior in Immersive VR Experience",
            "abstract": "Cybersickness detection is one of the primary tasks in Virtual Reality (VR) content production. The existing subjective and objective studies on cybersickness give few guiding implications to VR content creators. To do experimental verification on previous hypotheses and propose design guidelines, this paper investigates the relationship between cybersickness and postural behavior, by analyzing the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and hand movement videos. We conducted a user study to build the sEMG-video Cybersickness Benchmark Dataset (sEMG-CBD) and employed statistical analysis to summarize the regular pattern of participants\u2019 dizziness status under VR experiences. The results indicate that the fluctuations of cybersickness correlate positively with the extent of forearm sEMG signals and hand movements. The preliminary analysis implies the potentiality of sEMG-based cybersickness detection being used as one of the significant representations of VR viewing experience, which could contribute to VR content production.",
