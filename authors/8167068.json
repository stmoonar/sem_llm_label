            "abstract": "Seaports play a crucial role in the global economy, and researchers have sought to understand their significance through various studies. In this paper, we aim to explore the common characteristics shared by important ports by analyzing the network of connections formed by vessel movement among them. To accomplish this task, we adopt a bottom-up network construction approach that combines three years' worth of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from around the world, constructing a Ports Network that represents the connections between different ports. Through such representation, we use machine learning to measure the relative significance of different port features. Our model examined such features and revealed that geographical characteristics and the depth of the port are indicators of a port's significance to the Ports Network. Accordingly, this study employs a data-driven approach and utilizes machine learning to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to ports' importance. The outcomes of our work are aimed to inform decision-making processes related to port development, resource allocation, and infrastructure planning in the industry.",

            "abstract": "The growing prevalence of location-based devices has resulted in a significant abundance of location data from various tracking vendors. Nevertheless, a noticeable deficit exists regarding readily accessible, extensive, and publicly available datasets for research purposes, primarily due to privacy concerns and ownership constraints. There is a pressing need for expansive datasets to advance machine learning techniques in this domain. The absence of such resources currently represents a substantial hindrance to research progress in this field. Data augmentation is emerging as a popular technique to mitigate this issue in several domains. However, applying state-of-the-art techniques as-is proves challenging when dealing with trajectory data due to the intricate spatio-temporal dependencies inherent to such data. In this work, we propose a novel strategy for augmenting trajectory data that applies a geographical perturbation on trajectory points along a trajectory. Such a perturbation results in controlled changes in the raw trajectory and, consequently, causes changes in the trajectory feature space. We test our strategy in two trajectory datasets and show a performance improvement of approximately 20% when contrasted with the baseline. We believe this strategy will pave the way for a more comprehensive framework for trajectory data augmentation that can be used in fields where few labeled trajectory data are available for training machine learning models.",

            "title": "Building a Safer Maritime Environment Through Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting",
            "abstract": "Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. AIS data have improved maritime safety by reducing vessel-to-vessel collisions, but this study delves into utilizing AIS data as a proactive measure for averting vessel-to-whale ones. This paper tackles an intrinsic problem to trajectory forecasting: the effective multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of AIS data. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory\u2019s potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel\u2019s trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a R 2 score of over 98% in different techniques using varying features. The high R 2 score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes. However, our model stands out among other forecasting approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and path selection. Also, we have shown that our model can achieve more accurate forecasting with average and median forecasting errors of 11km and 6km, respectively. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.",

            "abstract": "Graphs have often been used to answer questions about the interaction between real-world entities by taking advantage of their capacity to represent complex topologies. Complex networks are known to be graphs that capture such non-trivial topologies; they are able to represent human phenomena such as epidemic processes, the dynamics of populations, and the urbanization of cities. The investigation of complex networks has been extrapolated to many fields of science, with particular emphasis on computing techniques, including artificial intelligence. In such a case, the analysis of the interaction between entities of interest is transposed to the internal learning of algorithms, a paradigm whose investigation is able to expand the state of the art in Computer Science. By exploring this paradigm, this thesis puts together complex networks and machine learning techniques to improve the understanding of the human phenomena observed in pandemics, pendular migration, and street networks. Accordingly, we contribute with: (i) a new neural network architecture capable of modeling dynamic processes observed in spatial and temporal data with applications in epidemics propagation, weather forecasting, and patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning methodology for analyzing and predicting links in the scope of human mobility between all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques for identifying inconsistencies in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most influential vertices, with applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We obtained results sustained by sound evidence of advances to the state of the art in artificial intelligence, rigorous formalisms, and ample experimentation. Our findings rely upon real-world applications in a range of domains, demonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.",

            "abstract": "The oceans are a source of an impressive mixture of complex data that could be used to uncover relationships yet to be discovered. Such data comes from the oceans and their surface, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages used for tracking vessels\u2019 trajectories. AIS messages are transmitted over radio or satellite at ideally periodic time intervals but vary irregularly over time. As such, this paper aims to model the AIS message transmission behavior through neural networks for forecasting upcoming AIS messages\u2019 content from multiple vessels, particularly in a simultaneous approach despite messages\u2019 temporal irregularities as outliers. We present a set of experiments comprising multiple algorithms for forecasting tasks with horizon sizes of varying lengths. Deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) revealed themselves to adequately preserve vessels\u2019 spatial awareness regardless of temporal irregularity. We show how convolutional layers, feed-forward networks, and recurrent neural networks can improve such tasks by working together. Experimenting with short, medium, and large-sized sequences of messages, our model achieved <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$36/37/38\\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of the Relative Percentage Difference\u2013 the lower, the better, whereas we observed <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$92/45/96\\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> on the Elman\u2019s RNN, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$51/52/40\\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> on the GRU, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$129/98/61\\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> on the LSTM. These results support our model as a driver for improving the prediction of vessel routes when analyzing multiple vessels of diverging types simultaneously under temporally noise data.",

            "abstract": "Corrosion identification and repair is a vital task in aircraft maintenance to ensure continued structural integrity. Regarding fuselage lap joints, typically, visual inspections are followed by non-destructive methodologies, which are time-consuming. The visual inspection of large areas suffers not only from subjectivity but also from the variable probability of corrosion detection, which is aggravated by the multiple layers used in fuselage construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatic image-based corrosion detection of aircraft structures using deep neural networks. For machine learning, we use a dataset that consists of D-Sight Aircraft Inspection System (DAIS) images from different lap joints of Boeing and Airbus aircrafts. We also employ transfer learning to overcome the shortage of aircraft corrosion images. With precision of over 93%, we demonstrate that our approach detects corrosion with a precision comparable to that of trained operators, aiding to reduce the uncertainties related to operator fatigue or inadequate training. Our results indicate that our methodology can support specialists and engineers in corrosion monitoring in the aerospace industry, potentially contributing to the automation of condition-based maintenance protocols.",

However, when the need for graph-like queries arises, applications often execute a sequence of related queries in a single session. We argue that it is possible to reduce the total cost of a set of related queries, by expanding individual intermediate results and sharing them among multiple queries. SHARq is our framework that enables sharing intermediate results of the common graph-like queries Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP), Connected Components (CC), and PageRank (PR). Our solution prepares result tables expanded with additional columns to store partial results of graph-like query combinations, such as multiple SSSP, or a sequence of queries comprising SSSP, CC, and PR. Experimental results on 9 datasets show query speedups of up to ten times when combining multiple SSSP queries, and up to two times when combining SSSP, CC, and PR queries. The results reveal a significant reduction in the query time, providing timely results for analyses relying on multiple navigational graph-like queries.",

However, existing works focus only on optimizing the recursive query statements and processing, disregarding the potential physical arrangements that might improve performance. In this work, we propose to use an approach based on adjacent-list storage to physically organize the graph-like data aiming at both reducing the recursive query time and the number of I/O operations. By using Clustered Tables, we tied the adjacency list in chunks for (i) storing both vertex and edge tables together in a Combined Tables approach; and (ii) reordering the edge table with the Edge Clustered Table approach using 20% and 80% of the total adjacency list size. The clustered approaches enabled a faster recursive query processing (up to 22%) and a reduction of up to 61% in the number of page accesses when compared to the Conventional approach. When starting from multiple vertices, the Combined Tables approach achieved a query reduction time of up to 50% in the first join operation, and Edge Clustered Table 20% provided an overall time reduction of up to 20%. The results show that our physical design is effective and allows one to use recursive queries without adaptations.",

            "abstract": "Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in artificial intelligence. It has the power to bring light to problems in several areas of knowledge, such as epidemiological studies, healthcare inference, and climate change analysis. Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. An open gap in the literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. The existing applications consistently disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions, named after Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with tens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones. The results outperformed both statistical and ensemble-learning approaches, showing an improvement of 64.87 percent over the competing algorithms on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset of the renowned John Hopkins University for 188 countries simultaneously. For further validation, we tested our architecture in two other public datasets of different domains, the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012 and Brazilian Weather datasets. We also analyzed the Evolution Weights arising from the hidden layers of ReGENN to describe how the variables of the dataset interact with each other; and, as a result of looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, we concluded that time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.",

As a framework, Hadoop was presented as a powerful tool to deal with large amounts of data. However, it still causes doubts about how to deal with its deployment and if there is any reliable method to compare the performance of distinct Hadoop clusters. This paper presents a methodology based on benchmark analysis to guide the Hadoop cluster deployment. The experiments employed The Apache Hadoop and the Hadoop distributions of Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR, analyzing the architectures on local and on clouding\u2014using centralized and geographically distributed servers. The results show the methodology can be dynamically applied on a reliable comparison among different architectures.

            "abstract": "Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are widely employed in several applications, including those that deal with data modeled as graphs. Existing solutions store every edge in a distinct row in the edge table, however, for most cases, such modeling does not provide adequate performance. In this work, we propose Edge-k, a technique to group the vertex neighborhood into a reduced number of rows in a table through additional columns that stores up to k edges per row. The technique provides a better table organization and reduces both table size and query processing time. We evaluate Edge-k table management for insert, update, delete and bulkload operations, and compare the query processing performance both with the conventional edge table \u2014 adopted by the existing frameworks \u2014 and with the Neo4j graph database. Experiments using Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) queries reveal that our new proposal approach always outperforms the conventional edge table as well as it was faster than Neo4j for the first iterations, being slightly slower than Neo4j only for iterations after having loaded the whole graph from disk to memory. It was able to reach a speedup of 66% over a representative real dataset, with an average reduction of up to 58% in our tests. The average speedup over synthetic datasets was up to 54%. Edge-k was also the best one when performing graph degree distribution queries. Moreover, the Edge-k table obtained a processing time reduction of 70% for bulkload operations, despite having an overhead of 50% for individual insert, update and delete operations. Finally, Edge-k advances the state of the art for graph data management within relational database systems.",

The automatic identification of wild animals is extremely important for the estimation of the species\u2019 population within Pantanal. However, digital processing techniques for the identification and tracking of species have faced great challenges due to clumsy light and pose conditions present in images taken in the wild. To overcome such problems, we propose a methodology that, by combining regular RGB images and thermal images, improves the identilication of species even in images taken in rough circumstances. We use the SLIC segmentation algorithm to identify the regions of the images where animals are present; after that, we apply convolutional neural networks to classify the identified regions according to eight possible animal species. We experiment on a real-world dataset composed of 1,600 images. Our results showed an average gain between 6% and 10% when compared to the method Fast R-CNN.",

            "abstract": "The basic purpose of a map is to trace shortest paths between two locations in a city. However, this is not always what a user needs. Consider a tourist in an unknown city, he/she might want to trace routes to visit multiple landmarks while passing through the main streets of the city, possibly more than once through the same street. Such functionality is not yet available in online map services, which are prone to provide shortest paths that connect all landmarks. Rather, is of common interest a tour that puts together the most central streets (topologically speaking), minimizes the trajectory and, at the same time, passes through such landmarks. To cope with this problem, it is possible to investigate techniques of Center-Piece Subgraph, Absorbing Random Walk Centrality and Spanning Edge-Betweenness; such techniques can be used to find induced subgraphs that optimize centrality measures for a set of referential nodes or edges, i.e. landmarks or streets. The results shall be in the form of optimized algorithms, and how to integrate them into online systems. Studies in this line can succeed if they can guarantee timely scalability at the same time that they provide algorithms that produce tours (1) considering all the known destinations; (2) including the main streets of a city; and, (3) ensuring the shortest routes.",

Studies in Cognitive Psychology and Pedagogy have already reported that each individual has a specific Learning Style, which describes her/his best means of perceiving and acquiring knowledge. The detection of the personal Learning Style of each student has long been made by using questionnaires; an analysis that demands too much effort, mainly in courses with hundreds of students. Therefore, the automatic modeling of learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students\u2019 Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior to those reported in the related literature.",

            "abstract": "Medical exams, such as CT scans and mammograms, are obtained and stored every day in hospitals all over the world, including images, patient data, and medical reports. It is paramount to have tools and systems to improve computer-aided diagnoses based on such huge volumes of stored information. The Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a powerful paradigm to help reaching such a goal, providing physicians with intelligent retrieval tools to present him/her with similar or complementary cases, in which visual characteristics improve textual data. Employing comparative inspection on previous cases, the physician can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the case he/she is working on. Current hospital systems do not carry native CBIR functionalities yet, relying on add-on subsystems, which often do not adhere to the existing relational database infrastructures. In this work, we propose RAFIKI, a software prototype that extends the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) PostgreSQL, providing native support for CBIR functionalities, modular extensibility, and seamless integration for data science tools, such as Python and R. We show the applicability of our system by evaluating three clinical scenarios, performing queries over a real-world image dataset of lung exams. Our results spot actual potential in promoting informed decision-making from the physician's perspective. Besides, the system exhibited a higher performance when compared to previous systems found in the literature. Moreover, RAFIKI contributes with a model to establish how to put together CBIR concepts and relational data, providing a powerful design for further development of theoretical and practical concepts and tools.",

This article presents the analysis of a tool called Restify, which is able to dynamically create web services to provide an online database as a service. Restify achieved the system interoperability requirements regarding heterogeneous operations, programming languages, and server infrastructures. As a result, we observed that the performance of this tool was comparable, if not better, than other evaluated web services, such as REST and SOAP. Finally, Restify excels by behaving like an interface tool, allowing the management and integration of multiple online system tools with various relational databases.",

Two classifications procedures were used, one based on the composition of heroes in each team and another considering the duration of the match. The experiments were performed on data collected from 123,326 matches of Dota 2, showing that it was possible to achieve approximately 77% accuracy.

            "abstract": "Social networks are of significant analytical interest. This is because their data are generated in great quantity, and intermittently, besides that, the data are from a wide variety, and it is widely available to users. Through such data, it is desired to extract knowledge or information that can be used in decision-making activities. In this context, we have identified the lack of methods that apply data mining techniques to the task of analyzing the professional profile of employees. The aim of such analyses is to detect competencies that are of greater interest by being more required and also, to identify their associative relations. Thus, this work introduces MineraSkill methodology that deals with methods to infer the desired profile of a candidate for a job vacancy. In order to do so, we use keyword detection via natural language processing techniques; which are related to others by inferring their association rules. The results are presented in the form of a case study, which analyzed data from LinkedIn, demonstrating the potential of the methodology in indicating trending competencies that are required together.",

            "title": "A smartphone application to measure the quality of pest control spraying machines via image analysis",
            "abstract": "The need for higher agricultural productivity has demanded the intensive use of pesticides. However, their correct use depends on assessment methods that can accurately predict how well the pesticides' spraying covered the intended crop region. Some methods have been proposed in the literature, but their high cost and low portability harm their widespread use. This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a new methodology based on the use of a smartphone-based mobile application, named DropLeaf. Experiments performed using DropLeaf showed that, in addition to its versatility, it can predict with high accuracy the pesticide spraying. DropLeaf is a five-fold image-processing methodology based on: (i) color space conversion; (ii) threshold noise removal; (iii) convolutional operations of dilation and erosion; (iv) detection of contour markers in the water-sensitive card; and, (v) identification of droplets via the marker-controlled watershed transformation. The authors performed successful experiments over two case studies, the first using a set of synthetic cards and the second using a real-world crop. The proposed tool can be broadly used by farmers equipped with conventional mobile phones, improving the use of pesticides with health, environmental and financial benefits.",
