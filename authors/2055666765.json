            "title": "Large Language Models Enhanced Collaborative Filtering",
            "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest among researchers to leverage these models to enhance Recommender Systems (RSs). Existing work predominantly utilizes LLMs to generate knowledge-rich texts or utilizes LLM-derived embeddings as features to improve RSs. Although the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs generally benefits RSs, the application can only take limited number of users and items as inputs, without adequately exploiting collaborative filtering information. Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distils the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into collaborative filtering. We also explored a concise and efficient instruction-tuning method, which improves the recommendation capabilities of LLMs while preserving their general functionalities (e.g., not decreasing on the LLM benchmark). Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-CF significantly enhances several backbone recommendation models and consistently outperforms competitive baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in distilling the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering.",

            "title": "To Search or to Recommend: Predicting Open-App Motivation with Neural Hawkes Process",
            "abstract": "Incorporating Search and Recommendation (S&R) services within a singular application is prevalent in online platforms, leading to a new task termed open-app motivation prediction, which aims to predict whether users initiate the application with the specific intent of information searching, or to explore recommended content for entertainment. Studies have shown that predicting users' motivation to open an app can help to improve user engagement and enhance performance in various downstream tasks. However, accurately predicting open-app motivation is not trivial, as it is influenced by user-specific factors, search queries, clicked items, as well as their temporal occurrences. Furthermore, these activities occur sequentially and exhibit intricate temporal dependencies. Inspired by the success of the Neural Hawkes Process (NHP) in modeling temporal dependencies in sequences, this paper proposes a novel neural Hawkes process model to capture the temporal dependencies between historical user browsing and querying actions. The model, referred to as Neural Hawkes Process-based Open-App Motivation prediction model (NHP-OAM), employs a hierarchical transformer and a novel intensity function to encode multiple factors, and open-app motivation prediction layer to integrate time and user-specific information for predicting users' open-app motivations. To demonstrate the superiority of our NHP-OAM model and construct a benchmark for the Open-App Motivation Prediction task, we not only extend the public S&R dataset ZhihuRec but also construct a new real-world Open-App Motivation Dataset (OAMD). Experiments on these two datasets validate NHP-OAM's superiority over baseline models. Further downstream application experiments demonstrate NHP-OAM's effectiveness in predicting users' Open-App Motivation, highlighting the immense application value of NHP-OAM.",

            "title": "UniSAR: Modeling User Transition Behaviors between Search and Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, many platforms provide users with both search and recommendation services as important tools for accessing information. The phenomenon has led to a correlation between user search and recommendation behaviors, providing an opportunity to model user interests in a fine-grained way. Existing approaches either model user search and recommendation behaviors separately or overlook the different transitions between user search and recommendation behaviors. In this paper, we propose a framework named UniSAR that effectively models the different types of fine-grained behavior transitions for providing users a Unified Search And Recommendation service. Specifically, UniSAR models the user transition behaviors between search and recommendation through three steps: extraction, alignment, and fusion, which are respectively implemented by transformers equipped with pre-defined masks, contrastive learning that aligns the extracted fine-grained user transitions, and cross-attentions that fuse different transitions. To provide users with a unified service, the learned representations are fed into the downstream search and recommendation models. Joint learning on both search and recommendation data is employed to utilize the knowledge and enhance each other. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of UniSAR in terms of enhancing both search and recommendation simultaneously. The experimental analysis further validates that UniSAR enhances the results by successfully modeling the user transition behaviors between search and recommendation.",

            "abstract": "The significance of modeling long-term user interests for CTR prediction tasks in large-scale recommendation systems is progressively gaining attention among researchers and practitioners. Existing work, such as SIM and TWIN, typically employs a two-stage approach to model long-term user behavior sequences for efficiency concerns. The first stage rapidly retrieves a subset of sequences related to the target item from a long sequence using a search-based mechanism namely the General Search Unit (GSU), while the second stage calculates the interest scores using the Exact Search Unit (ESU) on the retrieved results. Given the extensive length of user behavior sequences spanning the entire life cycle, potentially reaching up to 10^6 in scale, there is currently no effective solution for fully modeling such expansive user interests. To overcome this issue, we introduced TWIN-V2, an enhancement of TWIN, where a divide-and-conquer approach is applied to compress life-cycle behaviors and uncover more accurate and diverse user interests. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering method groups items with similar characteristics in life-cycle behaviors into a single cluster during the offline phase. By limiting the size of clusters, we can compress behavior sequences well beyond the magnitude of 10^5 to a length manageable for online inference in GSU retrieval. Cluster-aware target attention extracts comprehensive and multi-faceted long-term interests of users, thereby making the final recommendation results more accurate and diverse. Extensive offline experiments on a multi-billion-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of TWIN-V2. Under an efficient deployment framework, TWIN-V2 has been successfully deployed to the primary traffic that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users at Kuaishou.",

However, existing multi-task learning methods in recommendations overlook the specific characteristics of recommendation scenarios, falling short in achieving proper gradient balance. To address this challenge, we set the target of multi-task learning as attaining the appropriate magnitude balance and the global direction balance, and propose an innovative methodology named GradCraft in response. GradCraft dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes to align with the maximum gradient norm, mitigating interference from gradient magnitudes for subsequent manipulation. It then employs projections to eliminate gradient conflicts in directions while considering all conflicting tasks simultaneously, theoretically guaranteeing the global resolution of direction conflicts. GradCraft ensures the concurrent achievement of appropriate magnitude balance and global direction balance, aligning with the inherent characteristics of recommendation scenarios. Both offline and online experiments attest to the efficacy of GradCraft in enhancing multi-task performance in recommendations.

            "abstract": "With the proliferation of short video applications, the significance of short video recommendations has vastly increased. Unlike other recommendation scenarios, short video recommendation systems heavily rely on feedback from watch time. Existing approaches simply treat watch time as a direct label, failing to effectively harness its extensive semantics and introduce bias, thereby limiting the potential for modeling user interests based on watch time. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework named Debiased Multiple-semantics-extracting Labeling (DML). DML constructs labels that encompass various semantics by utilizing quantiles derived from the distribution of watch time, prioritizing relative order rather than absolute label values. This approach facilitates easier model learning while aligning with the ranking objective of recommendations. Furthermore, we introduce a method inspired by causal adjustment to refine label definitions, thereby directly mitigating bias at the label level. We substantiate the effectiveness of our DML framework through both online and offline experiments. Extensive results demonstrate that our DML could effectively leverage watch time to discover users' real interests, enhancing their engagement in our application.",

            "title": "Enhancing Recommendation with Search Data in a Causal Learning Manner",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems are currently widely used in various applications helping people filter information. Existing models always embed the rich information for recommendation, such as items, users, and contexts in real-value vectors, and make predictions based on these vectors. In the view of causal inference, the associations between representation vectors and user feedback are inevitably a mixture of the causal part that describes why a user prefers an item, and the non-causal part that merely reflects the statistical dependencies, for example, the display ranking position and sales promotion. However, most recommender systems assume the user-item interactions are only affected by user preferences, neglecting the striking differences between these two associations. To address this problem, we propose a model-agnostic causal learning framework called IV4Rec+ that can effectively decompose the embedding vectors into these two parts. Moreover, two strategies are proposed to utilize search queries as instrumental variables: IV4Rec+(I) only decomposes the item embeddings, while IV4Rec+(UI) decomposes both user and item embeddings. IV4Rec+ is a model-agnostic design that can be applied to many existing recommender systems, e.g., DIN, NRHUB, and SRGNN. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that IV4Rec+ significantly facilitates the performance of recommender systems and outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks.",

            "abstract": "Short video recommendations often face limitations due to the quality of user feedback, which may not accurately depict user interests. To tackle this challenge, a new task has emerged: generating more dependable labels from original feedback. Existing label generation methods rely on manual rules, demanding substantial human effort and potentially misaligning with the desired objectives of the platform. To transcend these constraints, we introduce LabelCraft, a novel automated label generation method explicitly optimizing pivotal operational metrics for platform success. By formulating label generation as a higher-level optimization problem above recommender model optimization, LabelCraft introduces a trainable labeling model for automatic label mechanism modeling. Through meta-learning techniques, LabelCraft effectively addresses the bi-level optimization hurdle posed by the recommender and labeling models, enabling the automatic acquisition of intricate label generation mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets corroborate LabelCraft's excellence across varied operational metrics, encompassing usage time, user engagement, and retention.

            "abstract": "Life-long user behavior modeling, i.e., extracting a user's hidden interests from rich historical behaviors in months or even years, plays a central role in modern CTR prediction systems. Conventional algorithms mostly follow two cascading stages: a simple General Search Unit (GSU) for fast and coarse search over tens of thousands of long-term behaviors and an Exact Search Unit (ESU) for effective Target Attention (TA) over the small number of finalists from GSU. Although efficient, existing algorithms mostly suffer from a crucial limitation: the inconsistent target-behavior relevance metrics between GSU and ESU. As a result, their GSU usually misses highly relevant behaviors but retrieves ones considered irrelevant by ESU. In such case, the TA in ESU, no matter how attention is allocated, mostly deviates from the real user interests and thus degrades the overall CTR prediction accuracy. To address such inconsistency, we propose TWo-stage Interest Network (TWIN), where our Consistency-Preserved GSU (CP-GSU) adopts the identical target-behavior relevance metric as the TA in ESU, making the two stages twins. Specifically, to break TA's computational bottleneck and extend it from ESU to GSU, or namely from behavior length 102 to length 104 - 105, we build a novel attention mechanism by behavior feature splitting. For the video inherent features of a behavior, we calculate their linear projection by efficient pre-computing & caching strategies. And for the user-item cross features, we compress each into a one-dimentional bias term in the attention score calculation to save the computational cost. The consistency between two stages, together with the effective TA-based relevance metric in CP-GSU, contributes to significant performance gain in CTR prediction. Offline experiments on a 46 billion scale real production dataset from Kuaishou and an Online A/B test show that TWIN outperforms all compared SOTA algorithms. With optimized online infrastructure, we reduce the computational bottleneck by 99.3%, which contributes to the successful deployment of TWIN on Kuaishou, serving the main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users everyday.",

            "title": "When Search Meets Recommendation: Learning Disentangled Search Representation for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Modern online service providers such as online shopping platforms often provide both search and recommendation (S&R) services to meet different user needs. Rarely has there been any effective means of incorporating user behavior data from both S&R services. Most existing approaches either simply treat S&R behaviors separately, or jointly optimize them by aggregating data from both services, ignoring the fact that user intents in S&R can be distinctively different. In our paper, we propose a Search-Enhanced framework for the Sequential Recommendation (SESRec) that leverages users' search interests for recommendation, by disentangling similar and dissimilar representations within S&R behaviors. Specifically, SESRec first aligns query and item embeddings based on users' query-item interactions for the computations of their similarities. Two transformer encoders are used to learn the contextual representations of S&R behaviors independently. Then a contrastive learning task is designed to supervise the disentanglement of similar and dissimilar representations from behavior sequences of S&R. Finally, we extract user interests by the attention mechanism from three perspectives, i.e., the contextual representations, the two separated behaviors containing similar and dissimilar interests. Extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate that SESRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models. Empirical studies further validate that SESRec successfully disentangle similar and dissimilar user interests from their S&R behaviors.",
