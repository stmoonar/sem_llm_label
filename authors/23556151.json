            "title": "ADL: Adaptive Distribution Learning Framework for Multi-Scenario CTR Prediction",
            "abstract": "Large-scale commercial platforms usually involve numerous business scenarios for diverse business strategies. To provide click-through rate (CTR) predictions for multiple scenarios simultaneously, existing promising multi-scenario models explicitly construct scenario-specific networks by manually grouping scenarios based on particular business strategies. Nonetheless, this pre-defined data partitioning process heavily relies on prior knowledge, and it may neglect the underlying data distribution of each scenario, hence limiting the model's representation capability. Regarding the above issues, we propose Adaptive Distribution Learning (ADL): an end-to-end optimization distribution framework which is composed of a clustering process and classification process. Specifically, we design a distribution adaptation module with a customized dynamic routing mechanism. Instead of introducing prior knowledge for pre-defined data allocation, this routing algorithm adaptively provides a distribution coefficient for each sample to determine which cluster it belongs to. Each cluster corresponds to a particular distribution so that the model can sufficiently capture the commonalities and distinctions between these distinct clusters. Our results on both public and large-scale industrial datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of ADL: the model yields impressive prediction accuracy with more than 50% reduction in time cost during the training phase when compared to other methods.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale commercial platforms usually involve numerous business domains for diverse business strategies and expect their recommendation systems to provide click-through rate (CTR) pre-dictions for multiple domains simultaneously. Existing promising and widely-used multi-domain models discover domain relationships by explicitly constructing domain-specific networks, but the computation and memory boost significantly with the increase of domains. To reduce computational complexity, manually grouping domains with particular business strategies is common in industrial applications. However, this pre-defined data partitioning way heavily relies on prior knowledge, and it may neglect the underlying data distribution of each domain, hence limiting the model\u2019s representation capability. Regarding the above issues, we propose an elegant and flexible multi-distribution modeling paradigm, named A daptive D istribution H ierarchical M odel (AdaptDHM), which is an end-to-end optimization hierarchical structure consisting of a clustering process and classification process. Specifically, we design a distribution adaptation module with a customized dynamic routing mechanism. Instead of introducing prior knowledge for pre-defined data allocation, this routing algorithm adaptively provides a distribution coefficient for each sample to determine which cluster it belongs to. Each cluster corresponds to a particular distribution so that the model can sufficiently capture the commonalities and distinctions between these distinct clusters. Extensive experiments on both public and large-scale Alibaba industrial datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of AdaptDHM: Our model achieves impressive prediction accuracy and its time cost during the training stage is more than 50% less than that of other models.",

            "title": "OPT-GAN: A Broad-Spectrum Global Optimizer for Black-Box Problems by Learning Distribution",
            "abstract": "Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are concerned with finding the best solutions for problems with missing analytical details. Most classical methods for such problems are based on strong and fixed a priori assumptions, such as Gaussianity. However, the complex real-world problems, especially when the global optimum is desired, could be very far from the a priori assumptions because of their diversities, causing unexpected obstacles. In this study, we propose a generative adversarial net-based broad-spectrum global optimizer (OPT-GAN) which estimates the distribution of optimum gradually, with strategies to balance exploration-exploitation trade-off. It has potential to better adapt to the regularity and structure of diversified landscapes than other methods with fixed prior, e.g., Gaussian assumption or separability. \nExperiments on diverse BBO benchmarks and high dimensional real world applications exhibit that OPT-GAN outperforms other traditional and neural net-based BBO algorithms.

Most classical methods for such problems are based on strong and \ufb01xed a priori assumptions, such as Gaussianity.

In this paper, we present a generative adversarial nets-based optimizer (OPT-GAN) to adapt to diverse black-box problems via estimating the distribution of optima. The method learns the extensive distribution of the optimal region dominated by selective and randomly moving candidates, balancing the exploration and exploitation. Experiments conducted on Black-box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) problems and several other benchmarks with diversi\ufb01ed distributions exhibit that, the OPT-GAN outperforms many traditional and neural net-based BBO algorithms.",
