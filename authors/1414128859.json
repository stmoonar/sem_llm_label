            "title": "Quantifying and Addressing Ranking Disparity in Human-Powered Data Acquisition",
            "abstract": "Algorithmic bias has been identified as a key challenge in many AI applications. One major source of bias is the data used to build these applications. For instance, many AI applications rely on human users to generate training data. The generated data might be biased if the data acquisition process is skewed towards certain groups of people based on say gender, ethnicity or location. This typically happens as a result of a hidden association between the people's qualifications for data acquisition and the people's protected attributes. In this paper, we study how to unveil and address disparity in data acquisition. We focus on the case where the data acquisition process involves ranking of people and we define disparity as the unbalanced targeting of people by the data acquisition process. To quantify disparity, we formulate an optimization problem that partitions people on their protected attributes, computes the qualifications of people in each partition, and finds the partitioning that exhibits the highest disparity in qualifications. Due to the combinatorial nature of our problem, we devise heuristics to navigate the space of partitions. We also discuss how to address disparity between partitions. We conduct a series of experiments on real and simulated datasets that demonstrate that our proposed approach is successful in quantifying and addressing ranking disparity in human-powered data acquisition.",

            "title": "Customizing Travel Packages with Interactive Composite Items",
            "abstract": "We examine the applicability of Composite Items (CIs) for generating customized travel packages consisting of Points of Interest (POIs) in a given city. CIs have been shown to serve complex information needs such as selecting books for a reading club, identifying a set of products for a promotion, or planning a city tour. In the travel domain, a synthesized view of travel options in a city can be provided with a set of cohesive CIs, each of which is covering a different region in the city. In this paper, we attempt to understand the benefit of letting users customize travel packages, and examine the relationship between customization and personalization. For personalization, we gather user preferences on POI features when available or on latent topics extracted from POI tags. For customization, we develop a framework within which a user interacts with proposed travel packages and the system suggests new CIs according to refined user preferences. Our experiments reveal a tension between personalization and the cohesiveness of items forming each CI. As a result, customization is necessary to find a balance between POI personalization and CI cohesiveness. We also show that the refined user preferences obtained from customization in one city help build better travel packages in another city.",
