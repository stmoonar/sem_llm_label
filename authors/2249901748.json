Indeed, the Big Data era has realized the availability of voluminous datasets that are dynamic, multidimensional, noisy and heterogeneous in nature. Transforming a data-curious user into someone who can access and analyze that data is even more burdensome now for a great number of users with little or no support and expertise on the data processing part.",

With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

GIO.G offers configurable parameters such as building characteristics, urban density, and foot traffic congestion levels, enabling users to explore a wide range of scenarios with precision and scalability. Through a series of scenarios, we highlight GIO.G\u2019s unique features and showcase GIO.G\u2019s versatility and effectiveness in generating realistic Indoor-Outdoor Graphs.",

            "abstract": "To facilitate fast-visual data analysis, there is a need for recommending top-k views with \"interesting\" insights automatically. However, working with high-dimensional time series data makes the process of view recommendations difficult. The primary obstacle lies in finding an automatic way to generate views with less processing time (efficiency) while still closely aligning with the ground truth (effectiveness). In this paper, we propose TiVEx (Time Series Visual Exploration), a technique to address this challenge. TiVEx aims to achieve a balance between efficiency and effectiveness in generating view recommendations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant cost savings achieved by TiVEx, indicating its efficiency. Furthermore, our analysis delves into the exploration of striking the right balance between efficiency and effectiveness.",

A step towards reproducibility within the IPIN community is the contribution of this paper, our software-based testbed, called RETSINA (Reproducibility and Experimentation Testbed for Signal-strength Indoor Near Analysis). RETSINA enables the repeatability, reproducibility and comparison of approaches that use machine learning to detect proximity. We demonstrate RETSINA\u2019s functionality by repeating and extending the findings of a recent case study on Wi-Fi signal strength based contact tracing accuracy. Furthermore, we leverage RETSINA to experimentally compare the results for detecting close encounters produced by the original Wi-Fi signal strength readings study and our study using Bluetooth signal strength readings.",

After briefly discussing HR-VEAW\u2019s data acquisition and analysis components, we demonstrate how it visualizes rich spatio-temporal and conceptual information, enabling the examination of changes in patterns of violation and protection in aggregate over time, or across both space and time. This way HR-VEAW helps to explain social instability and conflicts and to guide decision-making, theorizing, and predictions.",

            "abstract": "Data Warehouses usually work on history data. In most cases, the Data Warehouse is loaded with data from operational or transactional systems on a weekly or nightly basis. As today's decisions in the business world are becoming real-time, it is only natural that Data Warehouse, Business Intelligence, Decision Support and OLAP systems must quickly begin incorporating real-time data. When shifting from a traditional offline and time-consuming data warehousing system to a real-time system, two important considerations are speeding up the ETL and the OLAP process. This survey looks into the various challenges involved in building a real-time Data Warehouse and some of the solutions available to overcome them.",
