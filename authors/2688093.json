            "abstract": "Automatic analysis of image sentiment has gained considerable attention with the increasing throughput of user-generated visual contents online. Recently, researchers generally tend to design different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract image content features for sentiment analysis. However, they underestimated the importance of image color, which has been proved very crucial for image sentiment expressing by psychology and art theory. Moreover, we further observe that the coordination of content and color is the main form of image sentiment expressing. Different combinations of content and color could express extremely different sentiments. To that end, in this paper, we propose a Color Enhanced Cross Correlation Net (CECCN), a novel architecture for image sentiment analysis that not only leverages contents and colors simultaneously, but also takes their correlations into consideration. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained CNN to extract content features and color moment to collect color features from multiple color spaces. Then, we propose a novel Cross Correlation (CC) method to model the correlations between content features and color features with attention mechanism and sequence convolution, in which sentiment expressing of content and color can be enhanced by each other. Finally, we integrate these two types of information for better image sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments on two popular and well-studied benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our proposed CECCN.",

            "title": "RecStudio: Towards a Highly-Modularized Recommender System",
            "abstract": "A dozen recommendation libraries have recently been developed to accommodate popular recommendation algorithms for reproducibility. However, they are almost simply a collection of algorithms, overlooking the modularization of recommendation algorithms and their usage in practical scenarios. Algorithmic modularization has the following advantages: 1) helps to understand the effectiveness of each algorithm; 2) easily assembles new algorithms with well-performed modules by either drag-and-drop programming or automatic machine learning; 3) enables reinforcement between algorithms since one algorithm may act as a module of another algorithm. To this end, we develop a highly-modularized recommender system -- RecStudio, in which any recommendation algorithm is categorized into either a ranker or a retriever. In the RecStudio library, we implement 90 recommendation algorithms with the pure Pytorch, covering both common algorithms in other libraries and complex algorithms involving multiple recommendation models. RecStudio is featured from several perspectives, such as index-supported efficient recommendation and evaluation, GPU-accelerated negative sampling, hyperparameter learning on the validation, and cooperation between the retriever and ranker. RecStudio is also equipped with a web service, where the recommendation pipeline can be quickly established and visually evaluated on selected datasets, and the evaluation results are automatically archived and visualized in a leaderboard. The project and documents are released at http://recstudio.org.cn.",

            "abstract": "A sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action sequence. While previous methods have made many efforts to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce a new concept dubbed socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. In light of this, we contribute a novel solution named GCARec (short for graph-augmented co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. GCARec decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps. First, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user preference. Then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at sequential-level and social-level, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of GCARec against several state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets have been released at: https://github.com/wubinzzu/GCARec.",

            "title": "Description-Enhanced Label Embedding Contrastive Learning for Text Classification",
            "abstract": "Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing, which requires an agent to determine the most appropriate category for input sentences. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in this area, especially pretrained language models (PLMs). Usually, these methods concentrate on input sentences and corresponding semantic embedding generation. However, for another essential component: labels, most existing works either treat them as meaningless one-hot vectors or use vanilla embedding methods to learn label representations along with model training, underestimating the semantic information and guidance that these labels reveal. To alleviate this problem and better exploit label information, in this article, we employ self-supervised learning (SSL) in model learning process and design a novel self-supervised relation of relation (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{R}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) classification task for label utilization from a one-hot manner perspective. Then, we propose a novel relation of relation learning network(<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{R}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Net) for text classification, in which text classification and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{R}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> classification are treated as optimization targets. Meanwhile, triplet loss is employed to enhance the analysis of differences and connections among labels. Moreover, considering that one-hot usage is still short of exploiting label information, we incorporate external knowledge from WordNet to obtain multiaspect descriptions for label semantic learning and extend <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{R}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Net to a novel description-enhanced label embedding network(DELE) from a label embedding perspective. One step further, since these fine-grained descriptions may introduce unexpected noise, we develop a mutual interaction module to select appropriate parts from input sentences and labels simultaneously based on contrastive learning (CL) for noise mitigation. Extensive experiments on different text classification tasks reveal that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{R}^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Net can effectively improve the classification performance and DELE can make better use of label information and further improve the performance. As a byproduct, we have released the codes to facilitate other research.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering based recommendation learns users\u2019 preferences from all users\u2019 historical behavior data, and has been popular to facilitate decision making. Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does not perform equally well for different user groups according to users\u2019 sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to improve fairness. Given each real original user-item interaction record, we propose the following hypotheses for augmenting the training data: each user in one group has a similar item preference (click or non-click) as the item preference of any user in the remaining group. With these hypotheses, we generate \u201cfake\" interaction behaviors to complement the original training data. After that, we design a bi-level optimization target, with the inner optimization generates better fake data to augment training data with our hypotheses, and the outer one updates the recommendation model parameters based on the augmented training data. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FDA.",

            "abstract": "Review information has been demonstrated beneficial for the explainable recommendation. It can be treated as training corpora for generation-based methods or knowledge bases for extraction-based models. However, for generation-based methods, the sparsity of user-generated reviews and the high complexity of generative language models lead to a lack of personalization and adaptability. For extraction-based methods, focusing only on relevant attributes makes them invalid in situations where explicit attribute words are absent, limiting the potential of extraction-based models. To this end, in this paper, we focus on the explicit and implicit analysis of review information simultaneously and propose novel a Topic-enhanced Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) to fully explore review information for better explainable recommendations. To be specific, we first use a pre-trained topic model to analyze reviews at the topic level, and design a sentence-enhanced topic graph to model user preference explicitly, where topics are intermediate nodes between users and items. Corresponding sentences serve as edge features. Thus, the requirement of explicit attribute words can be mitigated. Meanwhile, we leverage a review-enhanced rating graph to model user preference implicitly, where reviews are also considered as edge features for fine-grained user-item interaction modeling. Next, user and item representations from two graphs are used for final rating prediction and explanation extraction. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TGNN with both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.",

            "abstract": "By treating users' interactions as a user-item graph, graph learning models have been widely deployed in Collaborative Filtering~(CF) based recommendation. Recently, researchers have introduced Graph Contrastive Learning~(GCL) techniques into CF to alleviate the sparse supervision issue, which first constructs contrastive views by data augmentations and then provides self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between contrastive views. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current GCL-based recommendation models are still limited as current data augmentation techniques, either structure augmentation or feature augmentation. First, structure augmentation randomly dropout nodes or edges, which is easy to destroy the intrinsic nature of the user-item graph. Second, feature augmentation imposes the same scale noise augmentation on each node, which neglects the unique characteristics of nodes on the graph. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Variational Graph Generative-Contrastive Learning (VGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, we leverage variational graph reconstruction to estimate a Gaussian distribution of each node, then generate multiple contrastive views through multiple samplings from the estimated distributions, which builds a bridge between generative and contrastive learning. The generated contrastive views can well reconstruct the input graph without information distortion. Besides, the estimated variances are tailored to each node, which regulates the scale of contrastive loss for each node on optimization. Considering the similarity of the estimated distributions, we propose a cluster-aware twofold contrastive learning, a node-level to encourage consistency of a node's contrastive views and a cluster-level to encourage consistency of nodes in a cluster. Finally, extensive experimental results on three public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely used in recent years. By exploiting historical user-item interactions, recommender systems can model personalized potential interests of users and have been widely applied to a wide range of scenarios. Despite their impressive performance, most of them may be subject to unwanted biases related to sensitive attributes (e.g., race and gender), leading to unfairness. An intuitive idea to alleviate this problem is to ensure that there is no mutual information between recommendation results and sensitive attributes. However, keeping independence conditions solely achieves fairness improvement while causing an obvious degradation of recommendation accuracy, which is not a desired result. To this end, in this paper, we re-define recommendation fairness with a novel two-fold mutual information objective. In concerned details, we define fairness as mutual information minimization between embeddings and sensitive information, and mutual information maximization between embeddings and non-sensitive information. Then, a flexible Fair Mutual Information (FairMI) framework is designed to achieve this goal. FairMI first employs a sensitive attribute encoder to capture sensitive information in the data. Then, based on results from the sensitive attribute encoder, an interest encoder is developed to generate sensitive-free embeddings, which are expected to contain rich non-sensitive information of input data. Moreover, we propose novel mutual information (upper/lower) bounds with contrastive information estimation for model optimization. Extensive experiments over two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FairMI in reducing unfairness and improving recommendation accuracy simultaneously.",

            "title": "MEGCF: Multimodal Entity Graph Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In most E-commerce platforms, whether the displayed items trigger the user\u2019s interest largely depends on their most eye-catching multimodal content. Consequently, increasing efforts focus on modeling multimodal user preference, and the pressing paradigm is to incorporate complete multimodal deep features of the items into the recommendation module. However, the existing studies ignore the mismatch problem between multimodal feature extraction (MFE) and user interest modeling (UIM). That is, MFE and UIM have different emphases. Specifically, MFE is migrated from and adapted to upstream tasks such as image classification. In addition, it is mainly a content-oriented and non-personalized process, while UIM, with its greater focus on understanding user interaction, is essentially a user-oriented and personalized process. Therefore, the direct incorporation of MFE into UIM for purely user-oriented tasks, tends to introduce a large number of preference-independent multimodal noise and contaminate the embedding representations in UIM. This paper aims at solving the mismatch problem between MFE and UIM, so as to generate high-quality embedding representations and better model multimodal user preferences. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, multimodal entity graph collaborative filtering, short for MEGCF. The UIM of the proposed model captures the semantic correlation between interactions and the features obtained from MFE, thus making a better match between MFE and UIM. More precisely, semantic-rich entities are first extracted from the multimodal data, since they are more relevant to user preferences than other multimodal information. These entities are then integrated into the user-item interaction graph. Afterwards, a symmetric linear Graph Convolution Network (GCN) module is constructed to perform message propagation over the graph, in order to capture both high-order semantic correlation and collaborative filtering signals. Finally, the sentiment information from the review data are used to fine-grainedly weight neighbor aggregation in the GCN, as it reflects the overall quality of the items, and therefore it is an important modality information related to user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of MEGCF.1",

            "abstract": "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) plays an important role in many applications ranging from information retrieval, recommender systems to natural language processing and machine learning. However, exhaustive MIPS is often expensive and impractical when there are a large number of candidate items. The state-of-the-art approximated MIPS is product quantization with a score-aware loss, which weighs more heavily on items with larger inner product scores. However, it is challenging to extend the score-aware loss for additive quantization due to parallel-orthogonal decomposition of residual error. Learning additive quantization with respect to this loss is important since additive quantization can achieve a lower approximation error than product quantization. To this end, we propose a quantization method called Anisotropic Additive Quantization to combine the score-aware anisotropic loss and additive quantization. To efficiently update the codebooks in this algorithm, we develop a new alternating optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated on three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines with respect to approximate search accuracy while guaranteeing a similar retrieval efficiency.",
