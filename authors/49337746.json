            "abstract": "The International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023) is now running its third edition. The Sci-K workshop is a venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines (including, but not limited to, Digital Libraries, Information Extraction, Machine Learning, Semantic Web, Knowledge Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Science of Science, Scientometrics and Bibliometrics), as well as professionals from the industry, to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the production and consumption of Scientific Knowledge Graphs and assessing the research impact. The workshop has called for high-quality submissions around the three main themes of research, related to scientific knowledge: representation, discovery, and assessment. In response to the call for papers, the workshop has received outstanding submissions from researchers in 15 different countries: United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, India, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ethiopia, and Norway. Each paper was reviewed at least by three members of the programme committee. Given the quality and the interesting topics covered by the submissions, we accepted 10 papers. Sci-K 2023 builds on two previous successful editions and keeps attracting a combined pool of attendees. The first edition (Sci-K 2021), was held on 13 April 2021 in conjunction with The Web Conference 2021. Its program consisted of two keynote talks, and the presentation of 11 research papers. The second edition (Sci-K 2022) took place on the 26 April 2022 at The Web Conference 2022. The program included the presentation of 5 long papers, 4 short papers, 2 vision papers, 2 keynote speeches and a panel on \u201cWhat\u2019s next after Microsoft Academic Graph?\u201d. The full program as well as the list of accepted papers can be found on the Sci-K website: https://sci-k.github.io/2023/.",

Many top computer scientists are also excellent researchers in the science of science. The purpose of this workshop is to bridge the two communities (i.e., the knowledge discovery community and the science of science community) together as the scholarly activities become salient web and social activities that start to generate a ripple effect on broader knowledge discovery communities. This workshop will showcase the current data-driven science of science research by highlighting several studies and constructing a community of researchers to explore questions critical to the future of data-driven science of science, especially a community of data-driven science of science in Data Science so as to facilitate collaboration and inspire innovation. Through discussion on emerging and critical topics in the science of science, this workshop aims to help generate effective solutions for addressing environmental, societal, and technological problems in the scientific community.",

            "abstract": "COVID-19 resulted in an infodemic, which could erode public trust, impede virus containment, and outlive the pandemic itself. The evolving and fragmented media landscape is a key driver of the spread of misinformation. Using misinformation identified by the fact-checking platform by Tencent and posts on Weibo, our results showed that the evolution of misinformation follows an issue-attention cycle, pertaining to topics such as city lockdown, cures, and preventions, and school reopening. Sources of authority weigh in on these topics, but their influence is complicated by peoples' pre-existing beliefs and cultural practices. Finally, social media has a complicated relationship with established or legacy media systems. Sometimes they reinforce each other, but in general, social media may have a topic cycle of its own making. Our findings shed light on the distinct characteristics of misinformation during the COVID-19 and offer insights into combating misinformation in China and across the world at large.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion channels are critical to determining the adoption scale, which leads to the ultimate impact of an innovation. The aim of this study is to develop an integrative understanding of the impact of two diffusion channels (i.e., broadcasting vs. virality) on innovation adoption. Using citations of a series of classic algorithms and the time series of co\u2010authorship as the footprints of their diffusion trajectories, we propose a novel method to analyze the intertwining relationships between broadcasting and virality in the innovation diffusion process. Our findings show that broadcasting and virality have similar diffusion power, but play different roles across diffusion stages. Broadcasting is more powerful in the early stages but may be gradually caught up or even surpassed by virality in the later period. Meanwhile, diffusion speed in virality is significantly faster than broadcasting and members from virality channels tend to adopt the same innovation repetitively.",

            "abstract": "Tech mining is the application of text mining tools to science and technology information resources. The ever-increasing volume of scientific outputs is a boom to technological innovation, but it also complicates efforts to obtain useful and concise information for problem solving. This challenge extends to tech mining, where the development of techniques compatible with big data is an urgent issue. This article introduces a semi-supervised method for extracting layered technological information from scientific papers in order to extend the reach of tech mining. Our method starts with several pre-set seed patterns used to extract candidate phrases by matching the dependency tree of each sentence. Then, after a series of judgements, phrases are divided into two categories: \u2018main technique\u2019 and \u2018tech-component\u2019. (A technique, for the purposes of this study, is a method or tool used in the article being analysed.) In order to generate new patterns for subsequent iterations, a weighted pattern learning method is also adopted. Finally, multiple iterations of the method are applied to extract technological information from each paper. A dataset from the field of optical switcher is used to verify the method\u2019s effectiveness. Our findings are that (1) by two loops of extraction process in each iteration, our method realises the layered technological information extraction, which contains the \u2018part\u2013whole\u2019 relationships between main techniques and tech-components; (2) the recall rate for main techniques is superior to the baseline after iterating 23 rounds; (3) when layering is disregarded, in the aspect of the precision and the volume of techniques, the new method is higher than that for the baseline; and (4) adjusting another two parameters can optimise the efficiency \u2013 however, the effect is neither pronounced nor straightforward.",

            "abstract": "Innovations transform our research traditions and become the driving force to advance individual, group, and social creativity. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary research is increasingly being promoted as a route to advance the complex challenges we face as a society. In this paper, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) citation as a proxy context for the diffusion of an innovation. With an analysis of topic evolution, we divide the diffusion process into five stages: testing and evaluation, implementation, improvement, extending, and fading. Through a correlation analysis of topic and subject, we show the application of LDA in different subjects. We also reveal the cross\u2010boundary diffusion between different subjects based on the analysis of the interdisciplinary studies. The results show that as LDA is transferred into different areas, the adoption of each subject is relatively adjacent to those with similar research interests. Our findings further support researchers' understanding of the impact formation of innovation.",

            "abstract": "Autism represents a broad group of developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions. It has attracted widespread concern in academia and media. The reported causes of autism have an enormous impact on the people's opinion about autistic patients and various treatments from scientific literature and media news. In this study, we use open information extraction (OIE), a machine reading technique, to automatically extract causal relationships from autism researches and news reports. We explored the differences between the scientific literature and news about the reported etiologies with respect to autism. As a result, we find that scientific papers clearly emphasize physical and biological factors, while the media emphasizes social factors as the perceived cause of autism.",
