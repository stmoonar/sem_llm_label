            "title": "Software Architecture Design of Animation Studies Platform Using Structure-Behavior Coalescence Method",
            "abstract": "Animation education in the new media era is moving toward the goal of cultivating high-end talents. The development of an architecture-oriented animation studies platform provides guarantee for the training of talents in terms of teaching quality. This research uses the Internet as the medium and mobile phones and computer clients as the main technology platforms, starting from the software architecture and constructing the system model of the animation studies platform according to the Structure-Behavior Coalescence (SBC) method. The core theme of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a modeling language with model consistency of systems structure and systems behavior. This paper developed Structure-Behavior Coalescence State Machine (SBC-SM) as the formal language for the MBSE animation studies platform design model singularity. The model consistency will be fully guaranteed in the MBSE animation studies platform design when the SBC state machine approach is adopted. It not only improves the efficiency of platform development but also reduces the difficulty and risk of platform development.",
