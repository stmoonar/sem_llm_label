            "abstract": "We present a novel end-to-end generative task and system for predicting event factuality holders, targets, and their associated factuality values. We perform the first experiments us-ing all sources and targets of factuality statements from the FactBank corpus. We perform multi-task learning with other tasks and event-factuality corpora to improve on the FactBank source and target task. We argue that careful domain specific target text output formatting in generative systems is important and verify this with multiple experiments on target text output structure. We redo previous state-of-the-art author-only event factuality experiments and also offer insights towards a generative paradigm for the author-only event factuality prediction task.",

            "abstract": "Explicit linguistic knowledge, encoded by resources such as rule-based morphological analyzers, continues to prove useful in downstream NLP tasks, especially for low-resource languages and dialects. Rules are an important asset in descriptive linguistic grammars. However, creating such resources is usually expensive and non-trivial, especially for spoken varieties with no written standard. In this work, we present a novel approach for automatically learning morphophonological rules of Arabic from a corpus. Motivated by classic cognitive models for rule learning, rules are generalized cautiously. Rules that are memorized for individual items are only allowed to generalize to unseen forms if they are sufficiently reliable in the training data.The learned rules are further examined to ensure that they capture true linguistic phenomena described by domain experts. We also investigate the learnability of rules in low-resource settings across different experimental setups and dialects.",

            "abstract": "Building a system for morphological processing is a challenging task in morphologically complex languages like Arabic. Although there are some deep learning based models that achieve successful results, these models rely on a large amount of annotated data. Building such datasets, specially for some of the lower-resource Arabic dialects, is very difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. In addition, some parts of the annotated data do not contain useful information for training machine learning models. Active learning strategies allow the learner algorithm to select the most informative samples for annotation. There has been little research that focuses on applying active learning for morphological inflection and morphophonological processing. In this paper, we have proposed a deep active learning method for this task. Our experiments on Egyptian Arabic show that with only about 30% of annotated data, we achieve the same results as does the state-of-the-art model on the whole dataset.",

            "abstract": "We present a generalized paradigm for adaptation of propositional analysis (predicate-argument pairs) to new tasks and domains. We leverage an analogy between stances (belief-driven sentiment) and concerns (topical issues with moral dimensions/endorsements) to produce an explanatory representation. A key contribution is the combination of semi-automatic resource building for extraction of domain-dependent concern types (with 2-4 hours of human labor per domain) and an entirely automatic procedure for extraction of domain-independent moral dimensions and endorsement values. Prudent (automatic) selection of terms from propositional structures for lexical expansion (via semantic similarity) produces new moral dimension lexicons at three levels of granularity beyond a strong baseline lexicon. We develop a ground truth (GT) based on expert annotators and compare our concern detection output to GT, to yield 231% improvement in recall over baseline, with only a 10% loss in precision. F1 yields 66% improvement over baseline and 97.8% of human performance. Our lexically based approach yields large savings over approaches that employ costly human labor and model building. We provide to the community a newly expanded moral dimension/value lexicon, annotation guidelines, and GT.",

            "abstract": "Norm discovery is important for understanding and reasoning about the acceptable behaviors and potential violations in human communication and interactions. We introduce NormSage, a framework for addressing the novel task of conversation-grounded multi-lingual, multi-cultural norm discovery, based on language model prompting and self-verification. NormSAGE leverages the expressiveness and implicit knowledge of the pretrained GPT-3 language model backbone, to elicit knowledge about norms through directed questions representing the norm discovery task and conversation context. It further addresses the risk of language model hallucination with a self-verification mechanism ensuring that the norms discovered are correct and are substantially grounded to their source conversations. Evaluation results show that our approach discovers significantly more relevant and insightful norms for conversations on-the-fly compared to baselines (>10+% in Likert scale rating). The norms discovered from Chinese conversation are also comparable to the norms discovered from English conversation in terms of insightfulness and correctness (<3% difference). In addition, the culture-specific norms are promising quality, allowing for 80% accuracy in culture pair human identification. Finally, our grounding process in norm discovery self-verification can be extended for instantiating the adherence and violation of any norm for a given conversation on-the-fly, with explainability and transparency. NormSAGE achieves an AUC of 95.4% in grounding, with natural language explanation matching human-written quality.",

            "abstract": "We present a generalized framework for domain-specialized stance detection, focusing on Covid-19 as a use case. We define a stance as a predicate-argument structure (combination of an action and its participants) in a simplified one-argument format, e.g., wear(a mask), coupled with a task-specific belief category representing the purpose (e.g., protection) of an argument (e.g., mask) in the context of its predicate (e.g., wear), as constrained by the domain (e.g., Covid-19). A belief category PROTECT captures a belief such as \u201cmasks provide protection,\u201d whereas RESTRICT captures a belief such as \u201cmask mandates limit freedom.\u201d A stance combines a belief proposition, e.g., PROTECT(wear(a mask)), with a sentiment toward this proposition. From this, an overall positive attitude toward mask wearing is extracted. The notions purpose and function serve as natural constraints on the choice of belief categories during resource building which, in turn, constrains stance detection. We demonstrate that linguistic constraints (e.g., light verb processing) further refine the choice of predicate-argument pairings for belief and sentiment assignments, yielding significant increases in F1 score for stance detection over a strong baseline.",

            "title": "Open-Domain Frame Semantic Parsing Using Transformers",
            "abstract": "Frame semantic parsing is a complex problem which includes multiple underlying subtasks. Recent approaches have employed joint learning of subtasks (such as predicate and argument detection), and multi-task learning of related tasks (such as syntactic and semantic parsing). In this paper, we explore multi-task learning of all subtasks with transformer-based models. We show that a purely generative encoder-decoder architecture handily beats the previous state of the art in FrameNet 1.7 parsing, and that a mixed decoding multi-task approach achieves even better performance.",
