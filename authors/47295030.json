            "title": "PromptST: Prompt-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Multi-Attribute Prediction",
            "abstract": "In the era of information explosion, spatio-temporal data mining serves as a critical part of urban management. Considering the various fields demanding attention, e.g., traffic state, human activity, and social event, predicting multiple spatio-temporal attributes simultaneously can alleviate regulatory pressure and foster smart city construction. However, current research can not handle the spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction well due to the complex relationships between diverse attributes. The key challenge lies in how to address the common spatio-temporal patterns while tackling their distinctions. In this paper, we propose an effective solution for spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction, PromptST. We devise a spatio-temporal transformer and a parameter-sharing training scheme to address the common knowledge among different spatio-temporal attributes. Then, we elaborate a spatio-temporal prompt tuning strategy to fit the specific attributes in a lightweight manner. Through the pretrain and prompt tuning phases, our PromptST is able to enhance the specific spatio-temoral characteristic capture by prompting the backbone model to fit the specific target attribute while maintaining the learned common knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify that our PromptST attains state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also prove PromptST owns good transferability on unseen spatio-temporal attributes, which brings promising application potential in urban computing. The implementation code is available to ease reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of diffusion on a graph is a prevalent and significant phenomenon, as evidenced by the spread of rumors, influenza-like viruses, smart grid failures, and similar events. Comprehending the behaviors of flow is a formidable task, due to the intricate interplay between the distribution of seeds that initiate flow propagation, the propagation model, and the topology of the graph. The study of networks encompasses a diverse range of academic disciplines, including mathematics, physics, social science, and computer science. This interdisciplinary nature of network research is characterized by a high degree of specialization and compartmentalization, and the cooperation facilitated by them is inadequate. From a machine learning standpoint, there is a deficiency in a cohesive platform for assessing algorithms across various domains. One of the primary obstacles to current research in this field is the absence of a comprehensive curated benchmark suite to study the flow behaviors under network scenarios. To address this disparity, we propose the implementation of a novel benchmark suite that encompasses a variety of tasks, baseline models, graph datasets, and evaluation tools. In addition, we present a comprehensive analytical framework that offers a generalized approach to numerous flow-related tasks across diverse domains, serving as a blueprint and roadmap. Drawing upon the outcomes of our empirical investigation, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of current foundational models, and we underscore potential avenues for further study.

            "abstract": "In object detection and recognition, similar but nonidentical sensing data probably maps to the same result. Therefore, a cache preserving popular results to support approximate match for similar input requests can accelerate the task by avoiding the otherwise expensive deep learning model inferences. However, the current software and hardware practices carried on edge or cloud servers are inefficient in either cost or performance. Taking advantage of the on-path programmable switches, we propose In-Switch Approximate Cache (ISAC) to reduce the server workload and latency. The unique approximate matching requirement sets ISAC apart from a conventional exact-match cache. Equipped with efficient encoding and qualifying algorithms, ISAC in an on-path switch can fulfill most of the input requests with high accuracy. When adapting to a P4 programmable switch, it can sustain up to 194M frames per second and fulfill 60.3% of them, achieving a considerable reduction on detection latency, server cost, and power consumption. Readily deployable in existing network infrastructure, ISAC is the first-of-its-kind approximate cache that can be completely implemented in a switch to support a class of IoT applications.",

            "abstract": "Microservices are becoming more complicated, posing new challenges for traditional performance monitoring solutions. On the one hand, the rapid evolution of microservices places a significant burden on the utilization and maintenance of existing distributed tracing frameworks. On the other hand, complex infrastructure increases the probability of network performance problems and creates more blind spots on the network side. In this paper, we present DeepFlow, a network-centric distributed tracing framework for troubleshooting microservices. DeepFlow provides out-of-the-box tracing via a network-centric tracing plane and implicit context propagation. In addition, it eliminates blind spots in network infrastructure, captures network metrics in a low-cost way, and enhances correlation between different components and layers. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that DeepFlow is capable of locating microservice performance anomalies with negligible overhead. DeepFlow has already identified over 71 critical performance anomalies for more than 26 companies and has been utilized by hundreds of individual developers. Our production evaluations demonstrate that DeepFlow is able to save users hours of instrumentation efforts and reduce troubleshooting time from several hours to just a few minutes.",

            "abstract": "Federated recommendation is a new Internet service architecture that aims to provide privacy-preserving recommendation services in federated settings. Existing solutions are used to combine distributed recommendation algorithms and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Thus it inherently takes the form of heavyweight models at the server and hinders the deployment of on-device intelligent models to end-users. This paper proposes a novel Personalized Federated Recommendation (PFedRec) framework to learn many user-specific lightweight models to be deployed on smart devices rather than a heavyweight model on a server. Moreover, we propose a new dual personalization mechanism to effectively learn fine-grained personalization on both users and items. The overall learning process is formulated into a unified federated optimization framework. Specifically, unlike previous methods that share exactly the same item embeddings across users in a federated system, dual personalization allows mild finetuning of item embeddings for each user to generate user-specific views for item representations which can be integrated into existing federated recommendation methods to gain improvements immediately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of PFedRec and the dual personalization mechanism. Moreover, we provide visualizations and in-depth analysis of the personalization techniques in item embedding, which shed novel insights on the design of recommender systems in federated settings.

Jointly modeling multiple spatio-temporal tasks can further promote an intelligent city life by integrating their inseparable relationship. However, existing studies fail to address this joint learning problem well, which generally solve tasks individually or a fixed task combination. The challenges lie in the tangled relation between different properties, the demand for supporting flexible combinations of tasks and the complex spatio-temporal dependency. To cope with the problems above, we propose an Automated Spatio-Temporal multi-task Learning (AutoSTL) method to handle multiple spatio-temporal tasks jointly. Firstly, we propose a scalable architecture consisting of advanced spatio-temporal operations to exploit the complicated dependency. Shared modules and feature fusion mechanism are incorporated to further capture the intrinsic relationship between tasks. Furthermore, our model automatically allocates the operations and fusion weight. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verified that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. As we can know, AutoSTL is the first automated spatio-temporal multi-task learning method.",

            "abstract": "Federated recommendation system usually trains a global model on the server without direct access to users' private data on their own devices. However, this separation of the recommendation model and users' private data poses a challenge in providing quality service, particularly when it comes to new items, namely cold-start recommendations in federated settings. This paper introduces a novel method called Item-aligned Federated Aggregation (IFedRec) to address this challenge. It is the first research work in federated recommendation to specifically study the cold-start scenario. The proposed method learns two sets of item representations by leveraging item attributes and interaction records simultaneously. Additionally, an item representation alignment mechanism is designed to align two item representations and learn the meta attribute network at the server within a federated learning framework. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate IFedRec's superior performance for cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, we also verify IFedRec owns good robustness when the system faces limited client participation and noise injection, which brings promising practical application potential in privacy-protection enhanced federated recommendation systems.

            "abstract": "In-Network Computing (INC) has found many applications for performance boosts or cost reduction. However, given heterogeneous devices, diverse applications, and multi-path network typologies, it is cumbersome and error-prone for application developers to effectively utilize the available network resources and gain predictable benefits without impeding normal network functions. Previous work is oriented to network operators more than application developers. We develop ClickINC to streamline the INC programming and deployment using a unified and automated workflow. Click-INC provides INC developers a modular programming abstractions, without concerning to the states of the devices and the network topology. We describe the ClickINC framework, model, language, workflow, and corresponding algorithms. Experiments on both an emulator and a prototype system demonstrate its feasibility and benefits.",

            "abstract": "We introduce SparCAssist, a general-purpose risk assessment tool for the machine learning models trained for language tasks. It evaluates models' risk by inspecting their behavior on counterfactuals, namely out-of-distribution instances generated based on the given data instance. The counterfactuals are generated by replacing tokens in rational subsequences identified by ExPred, while the replacements are retrieved using HotFlip or the Masked-Language-Model-based algorithms. The main purpose of our system is to help the human annotators to assess the model's risk on deployment. The counterfactual instances generated during the assessment are the by-product and can be used to train more robust NLP models in the future.",

Given the increasing use of complex machine learning models in search systems, explainability is essential in building and auditing responsible information retrieval models. This survey fills a vital gap in the otherwise topically diverse literature of explainable information retrieval. It categorizes and discusses recent explainability methods developed for different application domains in information retrieval, providing a common framework and unifying perspectives. In addition, it reflects on the common concern of evaluating explanations and highlights open challenges and opportunities.",
