            "abstract": "This article discusses a survey carried out within the NexusLinguarum COST Action which aimed to give an overview of existing guidelines (GLs) and best practices (BPs) in linguistic linked data. In particular it focused on four core tasks in the production/publication of linked data: generation, interlinking, publication, and validation. We discuss the importance of GLs and BPs for LLD before describing the survey and its results in full. Finally we offer a number of directions for future work in order to address the findings of the survey.",

This approach is based on the use of the CIDOC-CRM aligned FRBRoo ontology together with the Ontolex-Lemon vocabulary and its follow up lexicographic module, lexicog . After introducing the TEI-based distinction between di\ufb00erent views on lexicographic resources, we discuss Ontolex-Lemon and CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo. Next, we look at some motivating use cases before introducing our approach. Finally, we model one of these use cases in more depth using this approach.",

In this paper, we describe our efforts in manually aligning monolingual dictionaries. The alignment is carried out at sense-level for various resources in 15 languages. Moreover, senses are annotated with possible semantic relationships such as broadness, narrowness, relatedness, and equivalence. In comparison to previous datasets for this task, this dataset covers a wide range of languages and resources and focuses on the more challenging task of linking general-purpose language. We believe that our data will pave the way for further advances in alignment and evaluation of word senses by creating new solutions, particularly those notoriously requiring data such as neural networks. Our resources are publicly available at https://github.com/elexis-eu/MWSA.",

            "abstract": "The increasing recognition of the utility of Linked Data as a means of publishing lexical resource has helped to underline the need for RDF based data models which have the flexibility and expressivity to be able to represent the most salient kinds of information contained in such resources as structured data, including, notably, information relating to time and the temporal dimension. In this article we describe a perdurantist approach to modelling diachronic lexical information which builds upon work which we have previously presented and which is based on the ontolex-lemon vocabulary. We present two extended examples, one taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, the other from a work on etymology, to show how our approach can handle different kinds of temporal information often found in lexical resources.",

More precisely we describe the publication of the morphological layer of the Italian Parole Simple Clips lexicon (PSC-M) as linked open data. The novelty of our work is in the use of the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to encode morphological patterns, thereby allowing the automatic derivation of the in\ufb02ectional variants of the entries in the lexicon. By doing so we make these patterns available in a form that is human readable and that therefore gives a comprehensive morphological description of a large number of Italian words.",

We start by discussing why Linked Data is the right publishing approach for such diachronic datasets. We then describe our model, lemonEty, which utilizes the ontology engineering technique of perdurants in order to model lexical entries as dynamic processes. Next we go onto explain how to represent etymologies using our model, and in particular how to associate temporal information with word senses, taking examples from two different lexicographic resources. In addition, we will show how our model deals with cognates and attestations.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we describe ongoing work in the restructuring of a tagset originally organised as a taxonomy and used to annotate literary themes and motifs in a corpus of classical works of poetry from a number of different traditions. We show how such a tagset can be rendered more efficient and useful through the appropriation of ideas and techniques from lexical semantics and ontology design. The newly redesigned tagset is described with examples showing how the new design is much more expressive than the old taxonomy; furthermore, an example query is described in order to demonstrate how more refined semantic searches can be carried using the new version of the taxonomy. The final result is, we hope, a resource that will be useful not only for the specific project for which it was developed but one that is well-designed and well-documented enough to be of use for other similar semantic annotation tasks.
