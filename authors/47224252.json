            "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit a suite of popular proximity problems (such as, KNN, clustering, minimum spanning tree) that repeatedly perform distance computations to compare distances during their execution. Our effort here is to design principled solutions to minimize distance computations for such problems in general metric spaces, especially for the scenarios where calling an expensive oracle to resolve unknown distances are the dominant cost of the algorithms for these problems. We present a suite of techniques, including a novel formulation of the problem, that studies how distance comparisons between objects could be modelled as a system of linear inequalities that assists in saving distance computations, multiple graph based solutions, as well as a practitioners guide to adopt our solution frameworks to proximity problems. We compare our designed solutions conceptually and empirically with respect to a broad range of existing works. We finally present a comprehensive set of experimental results using multiple large scale real-world datasets and a suite of popular proximity algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.",

            "title": "Multi-Session Diversity to Improve User Satisfaction in Web Applications",
            "abstract": "In various Web applications, users consume content in a series of sessions. That is prevalent in online music listening, where a session is a channel and channels are listened to in sequence, or in crowdsourcing, where a session is a set of tasks and task sets are completed in sequence. Content diversity can be defined in more than one way, e.g., based on artists or genres for music, or on requesters or rewards in crowdsourcing. A user may prefer to experience diversity within or across sessions. Naturally, intra-session diversity is set-based, whereas, inter-session diversity is sequence-based. This novel multi-session diversity gives rise to four bi-objective problems with the goal of minimizing or maximizing inter and intra diversities. Given the hardness of those problems, we propose to formulate a constrained optimization problem that optimizes inter diversity, subject to the constraint of intra diversity. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve our problem. Our experiments with human subjects on two real datasets, music and crowdsourcing, show our diversity formulations do serve different user needs, and yield high user satisfaction. Our large data experiments on real and synthetic data empirically demonstrate that our solution satisfy the theoretical bounds and is highly scalable, compared to baselines.",

            "abstract": "We investigate online group formation where members seek to increase their learning potential via collaboration. We capture two common learning models: LpA where each member learns from all higher skilled ones, and LpD where the least skilled member learns from the most skilled one. We formulate the problem of forming groups with the purpose of optimizing peer learning under different affinity structures: AffD where group affinity is the smallest between all members, and AffC where group affinity is the smallest between a designated member (e.g., the least skilled or the most skilled) and all others. This gives rise to multiple variants of a multiobjective optimization problem. We propose principled modeling of these problems and investigate theoretical and algorithmic challenges. We first present hardness results, and then develop computationally efficient algorithms with constant approximation factors. Our real-data experiments demonstrate with statistical significance that forming groups considering affinity improves learning. Our extensive synthetic experiments demonstrate the qualitative and scalability aspects of our solutions.",

In this work, we believe that asking workers to indicate their preferences explicitly improve their experience in task completion and hence, the quality of their contributions. Explicit elicitation can indeed help to build more accurate worker models for task completion that captures the evolving nature of worker preferences. We design a worker model whose accuracy is improved iteratively by requesting preferences for task factors such as required skills, task payment, and task relevance. We propose a generic framework, develop efficient solutions in realistic scenarios, and run extensive experiments that show the benefit of explicit preference elicitation over implicit ones with statistical significance.",

The present study intended to examine textual features of Persian translational and non-translational journalistic political news applying a contrastive approach. To this end, a comparable corpus of Persian translational and non-translational news articles was compiled to define and clarify the textual and lexical features of the texts utilizing corpora and concordance program. The investigated features included lexical density, lexical variety and mean sentence length. The comparable corpus was comprised of two collections of almost equal size: 47,510 words of translational and 48,030 words of non-translational news texts. The findings of the study revealed that the translational texts were significantly different from their non-translational counterparts in terms of lexical density and lexical variety. But they did not significantly differ in terms of mean sentence length.",

            "abstract": "A B ST R A C T This study investigated some cross-linguistic properties of poetic and prosaic genre through the compilation and application of a parallel corpus. To this end, 16 stories from Sa'di's Gulistan (Rose Garden) and three translations of the book by Gladwin, Ross and Rehatsek were compared. Regarding the general contentions in terms of explicit hypotheses about the translations, four hypotheses were formulated to test two translation universals, i.e., simplification and explicitation. The analysis of the data demonstrated significant crosslinguistic differences in the original Persian text and its translations as pertinent to the intended properties.",
