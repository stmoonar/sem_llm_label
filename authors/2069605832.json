            "abstract": "The Future of Work (FoW) is witnessing an evolution where AI systems (broadly machines or businesses) are used to the benefit of humans. Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

In this study, we adopt the dual process theory as our theoretical basis to account for conscious and unconscious modes of individual decision making processes to examine privacy paradox in order to gain an understanding of the reasons which cause inconsistency between privacy concern and information disclosure. We also posit that privacy paradox can occur due to the conscious mode (affected by bounded rationality) as well as unconscious biases.",

            "abstract": "Generalized communicative suspicion (GCS) has been implicated in the deception literature as a trait that causes individuals to believe they can accurately detect deception in face-to-face settings. Separately, the online deception literature has implicated users' heuristic processing as the reason for them failing to recognize deception and falling prey to cybercrimes like phishing attacks. Such online deception work, however, has yet to explore how GCS might affect individual abilities to detect deception in a mediated context. The current work connects these two streams of research by introducing information insufficiency as a mediator between GCS and processing and extending it to the phishing context. We find that high GCS increases uncertainty and leads to a desire for more information before making a judgment. Desiring more information leads to systematically processing available information and more accurate phishing deception detection.",

Our study establishes a research framework to provide an understanding of the factors affecting knowledge sharing among bloggers in online social networks. The research results indicate that bloggers' trust, strength of social ties, and reciprocity all have a positive effect on their knowledge-sharing behavior. Further, the impact of each factor on such behavior varies by gender. Our results provide evidence that offline expected social norms tend to persist in the online blogosphere and that gender differences need to be considered as a significant factor in understanding the IT usage behavior in the context of social capital theory. For IT managers and blog service providers, our results also highlight the importance of being gender aware in an effort to elicit participation from all constituent members for the successful adoption and usage of blogs as a knowledge-sharing mechanism.",

In particular, the framework draws together two theories: expectation-confirmation theory and social exchange theory. Following the longitudinal pre-purchase and post-purchase stages, this study provides a theoretical framework combining trust, expectation and satisfaction, and tests the proposed models empirically using Internet consumer behavior data collected via two rounds of Web surveys conducted in two major Korean universities. In accordance with existing literature of traditional commerce, the empirical findings suggest that both consumer's trust and expectation have positive influences on consumer's satisfaction. The study also provides a framework explaining the subsequent relationships of trust and satisfaction (trust \u2192 satisfaction \u2192 post-trust \u2192 long-term trust) following the pre-purchase and post-purchase stages. In addition, a significant and positive relationship is detected between consumer's trust and expectation.",

            "abstract": "The multiple discrete resource allocation problem (MDRAP) explores how the decision maker allocates a number of resources of different types among agents in order to achieve the aggregate maximum utility. The MDRAP belongs in the NP-hard category of time complexity, which requires excessive efforts to obtain the optimal solution even for a moderate problem size. Partial enumeration techniques such as dynamic programming and branch-and-bound are available to tackle this complexity issue to some degree. In this paper, a new partial enumeration method based on divide-and-conquer is proposed. The pronounced distinction of this divide-and-conquer approach lies in its potential ability to parallelize the solving process, and hence can obtain the optimal solution more quickly. A simulation study on a dedicated computer is conducted and presented.",
