            "title": "SSPRA: A Robust Approach to Continuous Authentication Amidst Real-World Adversarial Challenges",
            "abstract": "In real-world deployment, continuous authentication for mobile devices faces challenges such as intermittent data streams, variable data quality, and varying modality reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework based on Markov process, named State-Space Perturbation-Resistant Approach (SSPRA). SSPRA integrates a two-level multi-modality fusion mechanism and dual state transition machines (STMs). This two-level fusion integrates probabilities from available modalities at each inspection (vertical-level) and evolves state probabilities over time (horizontal-level), thereby enhancing decision accuracy. It effectively manages modality disruptions and adjusts to variations in modality reliability. The dual STMs trigger appropriate responses upon detecting suspicious data, managing data fluctuations and extending operational duration, thus improving user experience. In our simulations, covering standard operations and adversarial scenarios like zero to non-zero-effort (ZE/NZE) attacks, modality disconnections, and data fluctuations, SSPRA consistently outperformed all baselines, including Sim\u2019s HMM and three state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Notably, in adversarial attack scenarios, SSPRA achieved substantial reductions in False Alarm Rate (FAR) - 36.31%, 36.58%, and 8.26% - and improvements in True Alarm Rate (TAR) - 33.15%, 33.75%, and 5.1% compared to the DeepSense, Siamese-structured network, and UMSNet models, respectively. Furthermore, it outperformed all baselines in modality disconnection and fluctuation scenarios, underscoring SSPRA\u2019s potential in addressing real-world challenges in mobile device authentication.",

            "title": "Learn-to-Respond: Sequence-Predictive Recovery from Sensor Attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems",
            "abstract": "While many research efforts on Cyber-Physical System (CPS) security are devoted to attack detection, how to respond to the detected attacks receives little attention. Attack response is essential since serious consequences can be caused if CPS continues to act on the compromised data by the attacks. In this work, we aim at the response to sensor attacks and adapt machine learning techniques to recover CPSs from such attacks. There are, however, several major challenges. i) Cumulative error. Recovery needs to estimate the current state of a physical system (e.g., the speed of a vehicle) in order to know if the system has been driven to a certain state. However, the estimation error accumulates over time in presence of compromised sensors. ii) Timely response. A fast response is needed since slow recovery not only comes with large estimation errors but also may be too late to avoid irreparable consequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel learning-based solution, named sequence-predictive recovery (or SeqRec). To reduce the estimation error, SeqRec designs the first sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model to uncover the temporal and spatial dependencies among sensors and control demands, and then uses the model to estimate system states using the trustworthy data logged in history. To achieve an adequate and fast recovery, SeqRec designs the second Seq2Seq model that considers both the current time step using the remaining intact sensors and the future time steps based on a given target state, and embeds the model into a novel recovery control algorithm to drive a physical system back to that state. Experimental results demonstrate that SeqRec can effectively and efficiently recover CPSs from sensor attacks.",

            "abstract": "Accelerometer signals generated through gait present a new frontier of human interface with mobile devices. Gait cycle detection based on these signals has applications in various areas, including authentication, health monitoring, and activity detection. Template-based studies focus on how the entire gait cycle represents walking patterns, but these are compute-intensive. Aggregate feature-based studies extract features in the time domain and frequency domain from the entire gait cycle to reduce the number of features. However, these methods may miss critical structural information needed to appropriately represent the intricacies of walking patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no study has formally proposed a structure to capture variations within gait cycles or phases from accelerometer readings. We propose a new structure named the PQRST Complex, which corresponds to the swing phase in a gait cycle and matches the foot movements during this phase, thus capturing the changes in foot position. In our experiments, based on the nine features derived from this structure, the accelerometer-based gait authentication system outperforms many state-of-the-art gait cycle-based authentication systems. Our work opens up a new paradigm of capturing the structure of gait and opens multiple areas of research and practice using gait analogous to the\"QRS complex\"structure of ECG signals related to the heart.",

Currently, most state-of-the-art works on gait recognition rely on only images and are purely based on convolutional neural networks. Most of these methods are very sensitive to small variations in the appearance of a walking person. For instance, if a person wears a coat or carries a bag, the accuracy of these methods may drop significantly. To address this problem, we propose to treat a sequence of human key points as a point cloud and combine human key point features and convolution feature map for final prediction. The experimental results show the promise of this approach, which outperforms three state-oft-he-art baselines in all walking scenarios, including the ones involving heavy clothing or carried items.",

            "title": "Graph-Based Identification and Authentication: A Stochastic Kronecker Approach",
            "abstract": "A large body of research has focused on analyzing large networks and graphs. However, network and graph data is often anonymized for reasons such as protecting data privacy. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to verify the source of network data, which leads to questions such as: Given an anonymized graph, can we identify the network from which it is collected? Or, if one claims the graph is sampled from a certain network, can we verify this claim? The intuitive approach is to check for subgraph isomophism. However, subgraph isomophism is NP-complete; hence, infeasible for most large networks. Inspired by biometrics studies, we address these challenges by formulating two new problems: network identification and network authentication. To tackle these problems, similar to research on human fingerprints, we introduce two versions of a network identity: (1) embedding-based identity and (2) distribution-based identity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these network identities using extensive experiments on real-world networks. Using these identities, we propose two approaches for network identification. One method uses supervised learning and can achieve an identification accuracy of 84.4 percent, and the other, which is easier to implement, relies on distances between identities and achieves an accuracy rate of 70.8 percent. For network authentication, we propose two methods to build a network authentication system. The first is a supervised learner and yields a low false accept rate and the other method, allows one to control the false reject rate with a reasonable false accept rate across networks. We demonstrate that network authentication can also be used for biometrics, authenticating users based on their touch data on phones and tablets. Our study can help identify or verify the source of network data, validate network-based research, and be used for network-based biometrics.",

            "abstract": "The recent prevalence of machine learning-based techniques and smart device embedded sensors has enabled widespread human-centric sensing applications. However, these applications are vulnerable to false data injection attacks (FDIA) that alter a portion of the victim's sensory signal with forged data comprising a targeted trait. Such a mixture of forged and valid signals successfully deceives the continuous authentication system (CAS) to accept it as an authentic signal. Simultaneously, introducing a targeted trait in the signal misleads human-centric applications to generate specific targeted inference; that may cause adverse outcomes. This paper evaluates the FDIA's deception efficacy on sensor-based authentication and human-centric sensing applications simultaneously using two modalities - accelerometer, blood volume pulse signals. We identify variations of the FDIA such as different forged signal ratios, smoothed and non-smoothed attack samples. Notably, we present a novel attack detection framework named Siamese-MIL that leverages the Siamese neural networks' generalizable discriminative capability and multiple instance learning paradigms through a unique sensor data representation. Our exhaustive evaluation demonstrates Siamese-MIL's real-time execution capability and high efficacy in different attack variations, sensors, and applications.",

            "abstract": "The use of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) in two factor authentication (2FA) is fast emerging, as wearables promise better usability compared to smartphones. Still, the current deployments of wearable 2FA have significant usability and security issues. Specifically, one-time PIN-based wearable 2FA (PIN-2FA) requires noticeable user effort to open the app and copy random PINs from the wearable to the login terminal's (desktop/laptop) browser. An alternative approach, based on one-tap approvals via push notifications (Tap-2FA), relies upon user decision making to thwart attacks and is prone to skip-through. Both approaches are also vulnerable to traditional phishing attacks. To address this security-usability tension, we introduce a fundamentally different design of wearable 2FA, called SG-2FA, involving wrist-movement \u201cseamless gestures\u201d captured near transparently by the second factor wearable device while the user types a very short special sequence on the browser during the login process. The typing of the special sequence creates a wrist gesture that when identified correctly uniquely associates the login attempt with the device's owner. The special sequence can be fixed (e.g., \u201c${@}{\\$}{@}{\\$}$\u201d), does not need to be a secret, and does not need to be memorized (could be simply displayed on the browser). This design improves usability over PIN-2FA since only this short sequence has to be typed as part of the login process (no interaction with or diversion of attention to the wearable and copying of random PINs is needed). It also greatly improves security compared to Tap-2FA since the attacker can not succeed in login unless the user's wrist is undergoing the exact same gesture at the exact same time. Moreover, the approach is phishing-resistant and privacy-preserving (unlike behavioral biometrics). Our results show that SG-2FA incurs only minimal errors in both benign and adversarial settings based on appropriate parameterizations.",

In addition, it could be using different sets of features or different classification algorithms, or both. Despite the use of a variety of sensors, feature sets (ranked by mutual information), and six different classification algorithms, Treadmill Assisted Gait Spoofing was able to increase the average false accept rate from 4% to 26%.

            "abstract": "Very few studies have explored linkages between physiological, such as electroencephalograph (EEG), and behavioral patterns, such as wrist movements. These linkages provide us a unique mechanism to predict one set of patterns from other related patterns. Unlike conventional biometrics, EEG biometrics are hard to spoof using standard presentation attack methods, given the intrinsic liveness resulting from the bounded randomness of EEG signals specific to an individual. In this article, we propose a novel attack on the EEG-based authentication systems by investigating and leveraging the strong correlation between hand movements and brain signals captured through the motion sensors on a smartwatch and the wearable EEG headset, respectively. Based on this technique, we can successfully estimate the user\u2019s EEG signals from the stolen hand movement data while the user was typing on the keyboard. Our attack results on the EEG biometric authentication system show an increase in the mean equal error rates of the classifiers by between 180% and 360% based on a dataset of 59 users. In summary, our pilot study calls for a rethinking of EEG-based authentication mechanisms from the perspective of unique vulnerabilities, particularly for multimodal biometric systems involving a variety of wearable or mobile devices.",
