            "abstract": "Managing software artifacts is one of the most essential aspects of computer science. It enables to develop, operate, and maintain software in an engineer-like manner. Therefore, numerous concrete strategies, methods, best practices, and concepts are available. A combination of such methods must be adequate, efficient, applicable, and effective for a concrete project. Eelsewise, the developers, managers, and testers should understand it to avoid chaos. Therefore, we exemplify the {\\ss}MACH method that provides software guidance. The method can point out missing management aspects (e.g., the V-model is not usable for software operation), identify problems of knowledge transfer (e.g., how is responsible for requirements), provide an understandable management description (e.g., the developers describe what they do), and some more. The method provides a unified, knowledge-based description strategy applicable to all software management strategies. It provides a method to create a minimal but complete description. In this paper, we apply {\\ss}MACH to the microservice concept to explain both and to test the applicability and the advantages of {\\ss}MACH.",

            "title": "Validity Constraints for Data Analysis Workflows",
            "abstract": "Porting a scientific data analysis workflow (DAW) to a cluster infrastructure, a new software stack, or even only a new dataset with some notably different properties is often challenging. Despite the structured definition of the steps (tasks) and their interdependencies during a complex data analysis in the DAW specification, relevant assumptions may remain unspecified and implicit. Such hidden assumptions often lead to crashing tasks without a reasonable error message, poor performance in general, non-terminating executions, or silent wrong results of the DAW, to name only a few possible consequences. Searching for the causes of such errors and drawbacks in a distributed compute cluster managed by a complex infrastructure stack, where DAWs for large datasets typically are executed, can be tedious and time-consuming. We propose validity constraints (VCs) as a new concept for DAW languages to alleviate this situation. A VC is a constraint specifying some logical conditions that must be fulfilled at certain times for DAW executions to be valid. When defined together with a DAW, VCs help to improve the portability, adaptability, and reusability of DAWs by making implicit assumptions explicit. Once specified, VC can be controlled automatically by the DAW infrastructure, and violations can lead to meaningful error messages and graceful behaviour (e.g., termination or invocation of repair mechanisms). We provide a broad list of possible VCs, classify them along multiple dimensions, and compare them to similar concepts one can find in related fields. We also provide a first sketch for VCs' implementation into existing DAW infrastructures.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "During the last years, a growing amount of industry areas started to use microservices. Microservices offer advantages like scalability and independent service realization, but also pitfall. We noticed inconsistencies between the different existing definitions of the term microservice and practical implementations of microservice based systems. Therefore, we evaluate existing microservice-definitions and analyze the coherence of identified pitfalls to the definitions. Thereby, we observed that many pitfalls are related to imprecise definitions. With a new, distinct, and explicit definition of microservices as slice service style, we can avoid most pitfalls - the definition is given as architectural style with demand to tailor the software process model. Furthermore, we discuss pitfalls of microservices that the definition cannot avoid.",

            "abstract": "Software Performance Engineers evaluate quality attributes (like response time) of software rich systems based on architectural models during early design time. Thereby, they use model-based approaches to analyze the software's behaviour and resource consumption. One prominent approach is the Palladio Component Model (PCM) which has been researched for over a decade. However, when it comes to multicore support or massive parallel execution the approaches still suffer from major drawbacks. Drawbacks include inaccurate prediction models, insufficient modelling languages, and missing tool support, to name just some of them. In this paper, we focus on overcoming the last two drawbacks, namely improving the modelling language and the tool support. We present a template catalogue for parallel performance patterns in software performance predictions. We use the example of a parallel-loop in the Palladio Component Model to exemplify our idea.",

Nevertheless, microservices break with abstraction models like object orientation, to avoid code duplicates, or to have the code of behavior and data of one type of objects at one place. Thus, microservices break with learned and established concepts of programming. In this paper, we present historical developments, identify trends, and summarize our observations. Based on that, we provide suggestions for extending microservices to support more abstract programming concepts. In so doing, we suggest concrete strategies for our extensions based on already established concepts and without interfering with to the microservice concept.",

            "abstract": "Perception is an essential procedure for intelligent vehicles where the safety issue is the most critical one. Usually, the perceptual approach is constructed based on measurements received from multiple sensors such as (Radar, and LiDAR) in order to model the immediate driving environment for autonomous vehicles navigation. These sensors are often limited and uncertain in providing visual information in any weather condition and they are expensive. Furthermore, they require intensive calculations. Therefore, they can't be easily processed online. The aim of this study is to provide a solution based on the low-cost, light, and low-power stereo camera. The proposed solution focuses on the spatial information about the driving environment which is represented as a 3D point cloud. These post-processed points are projected on the 2D rectangle grid and divided into identical square cells. Each cell is holding information about the 3D points that lie over it and this created what is called a height map. In the same time, a confidence map is built to reduce and discard scattered points because the produced 3D point cloud is noisy. Finally, an occlusion map is constructed to estimate the status of each cell as a border, free or occluded.",

Using these models as input, architectural analyses assess the impact of architects' decisions on quality\u2010of\u2010service properties. While the creation of suitable architectural models requires software architects to apply complex architectural knowledge, for example, in the form of established architectural styles and patterns, current architectural analyses lack support for directly reusing such knowledge. This lack points to an unused potential to make the work of software architects more effective and efficient.",

            "abstract": "Context: Software developers face complex, connected, and large software projects. The development of such systems involves design decisions that directly impact the quality of the software. For an early decision making, software developers can use model-based prediction approaches for (non-)functional quality properties. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these approaches is challenged by newly introduced hardware features like multiple cores within a single CPU (multicores) and their dependence on shared memory and other shared resources. Objectives: Our goal is to understand whether and how existing model-based performance prediction approaches face this challenge. We plan to use gained insights as foundation for enriching existing prediction approaches with capabilities to predict systems running on multicores. Methods: We perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify current model-based prediction approaches in the context of multicores. Results: Our SLR covers the software engineering, embedded systems, High Performance Computing, and Software Performance Engineering domains for which we examined 34 sources in detail. We found various performance prediction approaches which tries to increase prediction accuracy for multicore systems by including shared memory designs to the prediction models. Conclusion: However, our results show that the memory designs models are only in an initial phase. Further research has to be done to improve cache, memory, and memory bandwidth model as well as to include auto tuner support.",
