            "title": "Multi-Domain Recommendation to Attract Users via Domain Preference Modeling",
            "abstract": "Recently, web platforms are operating various service domains simultaneously. Targeting a platform that operates multiple service domains, we introduce a new task, Multi-Domain Recommendation to Attract Users (MDRAU), which recommends items from multiple ``unseen'' domains with which each user has not interacted yet, by using knowledge from the user's ``seen'' domains. In this paper, we point out two challenges of MDRAU task. First, there are numerous possible combinations of mappings from seen to unseen domains because users have usually interacted with a different subset of service domains. Second, a user might have different preference for each of the target unseen domains, which requires recommendations to reflect users' preference on domains as well as items. To tackle these challenges, we propose DRIP framework that models users' preference at two levels (i.e., domain and item) and learns various seen-unseen domain mappings in a unified way with masked domain modeling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRIP in MDRAU task and its ability to capture users' domain-level preferences.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decades, for One-Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF), many learning objectives have been researched based on a variety of underlying probabilistic models. From our analysis, we observe that models trained with different OCCF objectives capture distinct aspects of user-item relationships, which in turn produces complementary recommendations. This paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named as ConCF, that exploits the complementarity from heterogeneous objectives throughout the training process, generating a more generalizable model. ConCF constructs a multi-branch variant of a given target model by adding auxiliary heads, each of which is trained with heterogeneous objectives. Then, it generates consensus by consolidating the various views from the heads, and guides the heads based on the consensus. The heads are collaboratively evolved based on their complementarity throughout the training, which again results in generating more accurate consensus iteratively. After training, we convert the multi-branch architecture back to the original target model by removing the auxiliary heads, thus there is no extra inference cost for the deployment. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ConCF significantly improves the generalization of the model by exploiting the complementarity from heterogeneous objectives.",

            "abstract": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a model compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge transferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that transferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly improves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the knowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in that primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation space. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the student by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in the teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the whole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the student's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student is highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole topological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which distills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide in-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

            "abstract": "Recent recommender systems have started to employ knowledge distillation, which is a model compression technique distilling knowledge from a cumbersome model (teacher) to a compact model (student), to reduce inference latency while maintaining performance. The state-of-the-art methods have only focused on making the student model to accurately imitate the predictions of the teacher model. They have a limitation in that the prediction results incompletely reveal the teacher's knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for recommender system, called DE-RRD, which enables the student model to learn from the latent knowledge encoded in the teacher model as well as from the teacher's predictions. Concretely, DE-RRD consists of two methods: 1) Distillation Experts (DE) that directly transfers the latent knowledge from the teacher model. DE exploits \"experts\" and a novel expert selection strategy for effectively distilling the vast teacher's knowledge to the student with limited capacity. 2) Relaxed Ranking Distillation (RRD) that transfers the knowledge revealed from the teacher's prediction with consideration of the relaxed ranking orders among items. Our extensive experiments show that DE-RRD outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors and achieves comparable or even better performance to that of the teacher model with faster inference time.",

            "abstract": "Recent recommender systems started to use rating elicitation, which asks new users to rate a small seed itemset for inferring their preferences, to improve the quality of initial recommendations. The key challenge of the rating elicitation is to choose the seed items which can best infer the new users\u2019 preference. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end Deep learning framework for Rating Elicitation (DRE), that chooses all the seed items at a time with consideration of the non-linear interactions. To this end, it first defines categorical distributions to sample seed items from the entire itemset, then it trains both the categorical distributions and a neural reconstruction network to infer users\u2019 preferences on the remaining items from CF information of the sampled seed items. Through the end-to-end training, the categorical distributions are learned to select the most representative seed items while reflecting the complex non-linear interactions. Experimental results show that DRE outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the recommendation quality by accurately inferring the new users\u2019 preferences and its seed itemset better represents the latent space than the seed itemset obtained by the other methods.",

            "title": "Multi-Modal Component Embedding for Fake News Detection",
            "abstract": "As numerous fake news bloom and spread wildly on social media, fake news detection has recently been drawing a growing amount of attention. Single news consists of various multi-modal components (e.g., text, image, and event). Thus, a desirable model for fake news detection must satisfy two requirements: 1) it must correctly learn the reliability of each component 2) it must be capable of capturing the relationship among the components. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal Component Embedding framework (MCE) for fake news detection, which is designed to satisfy all the requirements. It first defines a latent vector for each news article as the sum of its component latent vectors. For each component, we regard its magnitude as its reliability, and regard its directional relationship as its consistency. In this context, the magnitude of each news latent vector represents how reliable the news is. Thus, MCE learns the latent space so that the magnitude of the real news vectors becomes larger than that of the fake news vectors. During the training, a news vector becomes larger when its component vectors are reliable (i.e., large magnitude) and when its component vectors are well aligned (i.e., high consistency). By doing so, MCE can capture the complex relationship among the components as well as the reliability of each component. Our extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that MCE outperforms all the baselines. We also provide a qualitative analysis on the embedding space to verify its capability of satisfying the requirements.",

            "abstract": "Users' behaviors observed in many web-based applications are usually heterogeneous, so modeling their behaviors considering the interplay among multiple types of actions is important. However, recent collaborative filtering (CF) methods based on a metric learning approach cannot learn multiple types of user actions, because they are developed for only a single type of user actions. This paper proposes a novel metric learning method, called METAS, to jointly model heterogeneous user behaviors. Specifically, it learns two distinct spaces: 1) action space which captures the relations among all observed and unobserved actions, and 2) entity space which captures high-level similarities among users and among items. Each action vector in the action space is computed using a non-linear function and its corresponding entity vectors in the entity space. In addition, METAS adopts an efficient triplet mining algorithm to effectively speed up the convergence of metric learning. Experimental results show that METAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in predicting users' heterogeneous actions, and its entity space represents the user-user and item-item similarities more clearly than the space trained by the other methods.",

            "abstract": "Providing accurate recommendations to newly joined users (or potential users, so-called cold-start users) has remained a challenging yet important problem in recommender systems. To infer the preferences of such cold-start users based on their preferences observed in other domains, several cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods have been studied. The state-of-the-art Embedding and Mapping approach for CDR (EMCDR) aims to infer the latent vectors of cold-start users by supervised mapping from the latent space of another domain. In this paper, we propose a novel CDR framework based on semi-supervised mapping, called SSCDR, which effectively learns the cross-domain relationship even in the case that only a few number of labeled data is available. To this end, it first learns the latent vectors of users and items for each domain so that their interactions are represented by the distances, then trains a cross-domain mapping function to encode such distance information by exploiting both overlapping users as labeled data and all the items as unlabeled data. In addition, SSCDR adopts an effective inference technique that predicts the latent vectors of cold-start users by aggregating their neighborhood information. Our extensive experiments on different CDR scenarios show that SSCDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of CDR accuracy, particularly in the realistic settings that a small portion of users overlap between two domains.",
