            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "This work presents frances, an integrated text mining tool that combines information extraction, knowledge graphs, NLP, deep learning, parallel processing and Semantic Web techniques to unlock the full value of historical digital textual collections, offering new capabilities for researchers to use powerful analysis methods without being distracted by the technology and middleware details. To demonstrate these capabilities, we use the first eight editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica offered by the National Library of Scotland (NLS) as an example digital collection to mine and analyse. We have developed novel parallel heuristics to extract terms from the original collection (alongside metadata), which provides a mix of unstructured and semi-structured input data, and populated a new knowledge graph with this information. Our Natural Language Processing models enable frances to perform advanced analyses that go significantly beyond simple search using the information stored in the knowledge graph. Furthermore, frances also allows for creating and running complex text mining analyses at scale. Our results show that the novel computational techniques developed within frances provide a vehicle for researchers to formalize and connect findings and insights derived from the analysis of large-scale digital corpora such as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.",

Given an input folder with code, inspect4py uses abstract syntax trees and state of the art tools to find all functions, classes, tests, documentation, call graphs, module dependencies and control flows within all code files in that repository. Using these findings, inspect4py infers different ways of invoking a software component. We have evaluated our framework on 95 annotated repositories, obtaining promising results for software type classification (over 95% F1-score). With inspect4py, we aim to ease the understandability and adoption of software repositories by other researchers and developers.

            "abstract": "The recent advances in DNA sequencing technology triggered next-generation sequencing (NGS) research in full scale. Big Data (BD) is becoming the main driver in analyzing these large-scale bioinformatics data. However, this complicated process has become the system bottleneck, requiring an amal-gamation of scalable approaches to deliver the needed performance and hide the deployment complexity. Utilizing cutting-edge scientific workflows can robustly address these challenges. This paper presents a Spark-based alignment workflow called SparkFlow for massive NGS analysis over singularity containers. SparkFlow is highly scalable, reproducible, and capable of parallelizing computation by utilizing data-level parallelism and load balancing techniques in HPC and Cloud environments. The proposed workflow capitalizes on benchmarking two state-of-art NGS workflows, i.e., Base Recalibrator and ApplyBQSR. SparkFlow realizes the ability to accelerate large-scale cancer genomic analysis by scaling vertically (HyperThreading) and horizontally (provisions on-demand). Our result demonstrates a trade-off inevitably between the targeted applications and proces-sor architecture. SparkFlow achieves a decisive improvement in NGS computation performance, throughput, and scalability while maintaining deployment complexity. The paper's findings aim to pave the way for a wide range of revolutionary enhancements and future trends within the High-performance Data Analytics (HPDA) genome analysis realm.",

            "abstract": "During the last years, the fast evolution of computers and networks has led to the creation of a wide variety of services that have changed the way we live, like video streaming, online gaming and online shopping. These services are supported by complex systems, which require not only high computational power but high-speed and low-latency networks to fulfil the expected quality requirements. However, a misleading configuration in one of the thousand components that compose these systems may cause performance bottlenecks and functioning disruptions. Unfortunately, conventional testing methods are not adequate for checking these systems since, on many occasions, there is no mechanism to determine if the behaviour of a system is the expected one. Fortunately, Metamorphic Testing is a valuable and promising testing technique that alleviates the two fundamental problems of testing: the oracle problem and the reliable test set problem. In this paper, we combine Metamorphic Testing and simulation techniques for validating communication network configurations in HPC systems. For this, we rely on a catalogue of Metamorphic Relations, based on network communications knowledge, for checking their correctness. In addition, we have conducted an experimental study for analysing the communication networks of HPC systems. The results show that Metamorphic Testing is appropriate for checking the correctness of communication networks supported by complex topologies in HPC systems.",

            "abstract": "The landscape of workflow systems for scientific applications is notoriously convoluted with hundreds of seemingly equivalent workflow systems, many isolated research claims, and a steep learning curve. To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",

We have also extended the collection of XML schemas supported by defoe, increasing the versatility of the tool for the analysis of digital historical textual data at scale. Finally, we have conducted several studies in which we worked with humanities and social science researchers who posed complex and interested questions to large-scale digital collections. Results shows that defoe allows researchers to conduct their studies and obtain results faster, while all the large-scale text mining complexity is automatically handled by defoe.",

            "abstract": "<p>Climate impact and adaptation measures are becoming urgent to be put in place and anticipated. During the past years, climate change effects have been producing adverse conditions in many parts of the world, with significant societal and financial impacts. Advanced analysis tools are needed to process ensembles of simulations of the future climate, in order to generate useful and tailored products for end users.</p><p>An example of a complex analysis tool used in climate research and adaptation studies is a tool to follow storm tracks. In the context of climate change, it is important to know how storm tracks will change in the future, in both their frequency and intensity. Storms can cause significant societal impacts, hence it is important to assess future patterns. Having access to this type of complex analysis tool is very useful, and integrating them with front-ends like the IS-ENES climate4impact (C4I) can enable the use of those tools by a larger number of researchers and end users.</p><p>Integrating this type of complex tool is not an easy task. It requires significant development effort, especially if one of the objectives is also to adhere to FAIR principles. The DARE Platform enables research developers to faster develop the implementations of scientific workflows more rapidly. This work presents how such a complex analysis tool has been implemented to be easily integrated with the C4I platform. The DARE Platform also provides easy access to e-infrastructure services like EUDAT B2DROP, to store intermediate or final results and powerful provenance-powered tools to help researchers manage their work and data.</p><p>This project has received funding from the European Union&#8217;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements N&#176;824084 and N&#176;777413.</p>",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the last decade. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.
