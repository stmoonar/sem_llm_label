            "abstract": "Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.",

To address this challenge, this paper introduces the OpenAIRE Beginner's Kit, a user-friendly solution providing access to a subset of the OpenAIRE Graph within a sandboxed environment coupled with a Jupyter notebook for analysis. The OpenAIRE Beginner's Kit is meticulously designed to democratise research and data exploration, offering accessibility from standard desktop and laptop setups. Within this paper, we provide a brief overview of the included dataset and offer guidance on leveraging the kit through a selection of illustrative queries tailored to address common scientometric inquiries.",

            "abstract": "The full exploitation of scholarly repositories is pivotal in modern Open Science, and scholarly repository registries are kingpins in enabling researchers and research infrastructures to list and search for suitable repositories. However, since multiple registries exist, repository managers are keen on registering multiple times the repositories they manage to maximise their traction and visibility across different research communities, disciplines, and applications. These multiple registrations ultimately lead to information fragmentation and redundancy on the one hand and, on the other, force registries' users to juggle multiple registries, profiles and identifiers describing the same repository. Such problems are known to registries, which claim equivalence between repository profiles whenever possible by cross-referencing their identifiers across different registries. However, as we will see, this ``claim set'' is far from complete and, therefore, many replicas slip under the radar, possibly creating problems downstream. In this work, we combine such claims to create duplicate sets and extend them with the results of an automated clustering algorithm run over repository metadata descriptions. Then we manually validate our results to produce an ``as accurate as possible'' de-duplicated dataset of scholarly repositories.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, scholarly graphs became fundamental to storing and managing scholarly knowledge in a structured and machine-readable way. Methods and tools for discovery and impact assessment of science rely on such graphs and their quality to serve scientists, policymakers, and publishers. Since research data became very important in scholarly communication, scholarly graphs started including dataset metadata and their relationships to publications. Such graphs are the foundations for Open Science investigations, data-article publishing workflows, discovery, and assessment indicators. However, due to the heterogeneity of practices (FAIRness is indeed in the making), they often lack the complete and reliable metadata necessary to perform accurate data analysis; e.g., dataset metadata is inaccurate, author names are not uniform, and the semantics of the relationships is unknown, ambiguous or incomplete. This work describes an open and curated scholarly graph we built and published as a training and test set for data discovery, data connection, author disambiguation, and link prediction tasks. Overall the graph contains 4,047 publications, 5,488 datasets, 22 software, 21,561 authors; 9,692 edges interconnect publications to datasets and software and are labeled with semantics that outline whether a publication is citing, referencing, documenting, supplementing another product. To ensure high-quality metadata and semantics, we relied on the information extracted from PDFs of the publications and the datasets and software webpages to curate and enrich nodes metadata and edges semantics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever published resource, including publications and datasets with manually validated and curated metadata.",

As a result, evaluators often end up relying heavily on a selection of performance indicators like the h-index. However, over-reliance on such indicators may result in reinforcing dubious research practices, while overlooking important aspects of a researcher\u2019s career, such as their exact role in the production of particular research works or their contribution to other important types of academic or research activities (e.g., production of datasets, peer reviewing). In response, a number of initiatives that attempt to provide guidelines towards fairer research assessment frameworks have been established. In this work, we present BIP! Scholar, a Web-based service that offers researchers the opportunity to set up profiles that summarise their research careers taking into consideration well-established guidelines for fair research assessment, facilitating the work of evaluators who want to be more compliant with the respective practices.

            "abstract": "Introduction While, in early science, most of the papers were authored by a handful of scientists, modern science is characterised by more extensive collaborations, and the average number of authors per article has increased across many disciplines (Baethge, 2008; Cronin, 2001; Fernandes & Monteiro, 2017; Frandsen & Nicolaisen, 2010; Wren et al., 2007). Indeed, in some fields of science (e.g., High Energy Physics), it is not infrequent to encounter hundreds or thousands of authors co-participating in the same piece of research2. Such intricate collaboration patterns make it difficult to establish a correct relationship between contributor and scientific contribution and hence get an accurate and fair reward during research evaluation (Brand, Allen, Altman, Hlava, & Scott, 2015; Vasilevsky et al., 2021; Vergoulis et al., 2022). Thus, as widely known, scientific authorship tends to be a rather hot-button topic in academia, as roughly one-fifth of academic disputes among authors stem from this (Dance, 2012).",
