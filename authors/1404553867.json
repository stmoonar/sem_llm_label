            "abstract": "In this work we propose a set of new automatic text augmentations that leverage Large Language Models from song metadata to improve on music information retrieval tasks. Compared to recent works, our proposed methods leverage large language models and copyright-free corpora from web sources, enabling us to release the knowledge sources collected. We show how combining these representations with the audio signal provides a 21% relative improvement on five of six datasets on genre classification, emotion recognition and music tagging, achieving state-of-the-art in three (GTZAN, FMA-Small and Deezer). We demonstrate the benefit of injecting external knowledge sources by comparing them withintrinsic text representation methods that rely only on the sample's information.",

            "abstract": "The ranking of nodes in a network according to their centrality or ``importance'' is a classic problem that has attracted the interest of different scientific communities in the last decades. The COVID-19 pandemic has recently rejuvenated the interest in this problem, as the ranking may be used to decide who should be tested, or vaccinated, first, in a population of asymptomatic individuals. In this paper, we review classic methods for node ranking and compare their performance in a benchmark network that considers the community-based structure of society. The outcome of the ranking procedure is then used to decide which individuals should be tested, and possibly quarantined, first. Finally, we also review the extension of these ranking methods to weighted graphs and explore the importance of weights in a contact network by providing a toy model and comparing node rankings for this case in the context of disease spread.",

Contact tracing apps give the unprecedented possibility to reconstruct graphs of daily contacts, so the question is: who should be tested? As human contact networks are known to exhibit community structure, in this paper we show that the Kemeny constant of a graph can be used to identify and analyze bridges between communities in a graph. Our \u2018Kemeny indicator\u2019 is the value of the Kemeny constant in the new graph that is obtained when a node is removed from the original graph. We show that testing individuals who are associated with large values of the Kemeny indicator can help in efficiently intercepting new virus outbreaks, when they are still in their early stage. Extensive simulations provide promising results in early identification and in blocking the possible \u2018super-spreaders\u2019 links that transmit disease between different communities.",

            "abstract": "Fast intermittent lock-down intervals with regular period are suggested as a COVID-19 exit strategy from the widely adopted policy of total lock-down. Many proposed exit strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to a second wave of infection [1,2]. We demonstrate that our proposed policies have the potential to be a method of virus suppression, while at the same time allowing continued (albeit reduced) economic activity. Furthermore, these policies, while not eliminating the virus, can nevertheless be sustained over long periods of time, until a vaccine or treatment becomes available. The robustness of these policies stems from the fact that they are open loop methods; namely, lock-down periods are not triggered by measurements -- inevitably uncertain and delayed -- over short time scales such as hospital admissions, but rather are driven by predictable, high-frequency, periodic triggers in- and out- of lock-down. A slow and inherently robust outer supervisory feedback loop, based on measurements over longer time scales, is used to tune the parameters of the mitigation strategy. These methods can act alone, or can be used in combination with other mitigation strategies, to provide additional levels of effectiveness in their operation.",

We show\u2014as proof of concept grounded on rigorous mathematical evidence\u2014that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements over short time scales. In turn\u2014while not eliminating the virus\u2014this fast switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of 1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown mitigation. All code is available on Github at https://github.com/V4p1d/FPSP_Covid19. A software tool has also been developed so that interested parties can explore the proof-of-concept system.",
