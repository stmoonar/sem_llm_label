            "title": "Counteracting Duration Bias in Video Recommendation via Counterfactual Watch Time",
            "abstract": "In video recommendation, an ongoing effort is to satisfy users' personalized information needs by leveraging their logged watch time. However, watch time prediction suffers from duration bias, hindering its ability to reflect users' interests accurately. Existing label-correction approaches attempt to uncover user interests through grouping and normalizing observed watch time according to video duration. Although effective to some extent, we found that these approaches regard completely played records (i.e., a user watches the entire video) as equally high interest, which deviates from what we observed on real datasets: users have varied explicit feedback proportion when completely playing videos. In this paper, we introduce the counterfactual watch time(CWT), the potential watch time a user would spend on the video if its duration is sufficiently long. Analysis shows that the duration bias is caused by the truncation of CWT due to the video duration limitation, which usually occurs on those completely played records. Besides, a Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) is proposed, revealing that CWT equals the time users get the maximum benefit from video recommender systems. Moreover, a cost-based transform function is defined to transform the CWT into the estimation of user interest, and the model can be learned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihood function defined over observed user watch times. Extensive experiments on three real video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing demonstrated that CWM effectively enhanced video recommendation accuracy and counteracted the duration bias.",

            "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an indispensable role in online recommendation and advertising platforms. Numerous deep learning based models have been proposed to improve CTR prediction accuracy, and they typically leverage user behavior sequences to capture users' shifting preferences. However, these historical sequences of user interactions often suffer from severe homogeneity and scarcity compared to the extensive item pool. Relying solely on such sequences for user representations is inherently restrictive, as user interests extend beyond the scope of items they have previously engaged with. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach to enrich user representations.We recognize user profiling and recall items as two ideal data sources within the cross-stage framework, encompassing the u2u (user-to-user) and i2i (item-to-item) aspects, respectively, because of their higher relevance to target users and ranking items, as well as their greater diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Recall-Augmented Ranking (RAR).RAR consists of two key sub-modules, namely the Cross-Stage User and Item Selection Module and the Co-Interaction Module. These sub-modules synergistically gather information from a vast pool of look-alike users and recall items, resulting in enriched user representations. Notably, RAR is orthogonal to many existing CTR models, allowing for seamless integration and consistent performance improvements in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on CTR prediction benchmarks, which verify the efficacy and compatibility of RAR against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, vanilla MLP networks are inefficient in learning multiplicative feature interactions, making feature interaction learning an essential topic for CTR prediction. Existing feature interaction networks are effective in complementing the learning of MLPs, but they often fall short of the performance of MLPs when applied alone. Thus, their integration with MLP networks is necessary to achieve improved performance. This situation motivates us to explore a better alternative to the MLP backbone that could potentially replace MLPs. Inspired by factorization machines, in this paper, we propose FINAL, a factorized interaction layer that extends the widely-used linear layer and is capable of learning 2nd-order feature interactions. Similar to MLPs, multiple FINAL layers can be stacked into a FINAL block, yielding feature interactions with an exponential degree growth. We unify feature interactions and MLPs into a single FINAL block and empirically show its effectiveness as a replacement for the MLP block. Furthermore, we explore the ensemble of two FINAL blocks as an enhanced two-stream CTR model, setting a new state-of-the-art on open benchmark datasets. FINAL can be easily adopted as a building block and has achieved business metric gains in multiple applications at Huawei.

            "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems face the challenge of operating in non-stationary environments, where data distribution shifts arise from evolving user behaviors over time. To tackle this challenge, a common approach is to periodically re-train or incrementally update deployed deep models with newly observed data, resulting in a continual learning process. However, the conventional learning paradigm of neural networks relies on iterative gradient-based updates with a small learning rate, making it slow for large recommendation models to adapt. In this paper, we introduce ReLoop2, a self-correcting learning loop that facilitates fast model adaptation in online recommender systems through responsive error compensation. Inspired by the slow-fast complementary learning system observed in human brains, we propose an error memory module that directly stores error samples from incoming data streams. These stored samples are subsequently leveraged to compensate for model prediction errors during testing, particularly under distribution shifts. The error memory module is designed with fast access capabilities and undergoes continual refreshing with newly observed data samples during the model serving phase to support fast model adaptation. We evaluate the effectiveness of ReLoop2 on three open benchmark datasets as well as a real-world production dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of ReLoop2 in enhancing the responsiveness and adaptiveness of recommender systems operating in non-stationary environments.",

            "abstract": "In the video recommendation, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of user interest. However, watch time is not only influenced by the matching of users\u2019 interests but also by other factors, such as duration bias and noisy watching. Duration bias refers to the tendency for users to spend more time on videos with longer durations, regardless of their actual interest level. Noisy watching, on the other hand, describes users taking time to determine whether they like a video or not, which can result in users spending time watching videos they do not like. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for indicating user interest. Furthermore, current methods primarily address duration bias and ignore the impact of noisy watching, which may limit their effectiveness in uncovering user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users\u2019 watch time from a unified causal viewpoint. Specifically, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user\u2019s actual interest level, the duration-biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D2Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in online advertising and recommendation. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep CTR prediction models, but it has been widely shown that applying a vanilla MLP network alone is ineffective in learning complex feature interactions. As such, many two-stream models (e.g., Wide&Deep, DeepFM, and DCN) have recently been proposed, aiming to integrate two parallel sub-networks to learn feature interactions from two different views for enhanced CTR prediction. In addition to one MLP stream that learns feature interactions implicitly, most of the existing research focuses on designing another stream to complement the MLP stream with explicitly enhanced feature interactions. Instead, this paper presents a simple two-stream feature interaction model, namely FinalMLP, which employs only MLPs in both streams yet achieves surprisingly strong performance. In contrast to sophisticated network design in each stream, our work enhances CTR modeling through a feature selection module, which produces differentiated feature inputs to two streams, and a group-wise bilinear fusion module, which effectively captures stream-level interactions across two streams. We show that FinalMLP achieves competitive or even better performance against many existing two-stream CTR models on four open benchmark datasets and also brings significant CTR improvements during an online A/B test in our industrial news recommender system. We envision that the simple yet effective FinalMLP model could serve as a new strong baseline for future development of two-stream CTR models.

            "abstract": "Alleviating the examination and trust bias in ranking systems is an important research line in unbiased learning-to-rank (ULTR). Current methods typically use the propensity to correct the biased user clicks and then learn ranking models based on the corrected clicks. Though successes have been achieved, directly modifying the clicks suffers from the inherent high variance because the propensities are usually involved in the denominators of corrected clicks. The problem gets even worse in the situation of mixed examination and trust bias. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel ULTR method called Decomposed Ranking Debiasing (DRD). DRD is tailored for learning unbiased relevance models with low variance in the existence of examination and trust bias. Unlike existing methods that directly modify the original user clicks, DRD proposes to decompose each click prediction as the combination of a relevance term outputted by the ranking model and other bias terms. The unbiased relevance model, therefore, can be learned by fitting the overall click predictions to the biased user clicks. A joint learning algorithm is developed to learn the relevance and bias models' parameters alternatively. Theoretical analysis showed that, compared with existing methods, DRD has lower variance while retains unbiasedness. Empirical studies indicated that DRD can effectively reduce the variance and outperform the state-of-the-art ULTR baselines.",

            "title": "Unbiased Top-$k$ Learning to Rank with Causal Likelihood Decomposition",
            "abstract": "Unbiased learning to rank methods have been proposed to address biases in search ranking. These biases, known as position bias and sample selection bias, often occur simultaneously in real applications. Existing approaches either tackle these biases separately or treat them as identical, leading to incomplete elimination of both biases. This paper employs a causal graph approach to investigate the mechanisms and interplay between position bias and sample selection bias. The analysis reveals that position bias is a common confounder bias, while sample selection bias falls under the category of collider bias. These biases collectively introduce a cascading process that leads to biased clicks. Based on our analysis, we propose Causal Likelihood Decomposition (CLD), a unified method that effectively mitigates both biases in top-k learning to rank. CLD removes position bias by leveraging propensity scores and then decomposes the likelihood of selection biased data into sample selection bias term and relevance term. By maximizing the overall log-likelihood function, we obtain an unbiased ranking model from the relevance term. We also extend CLD to pairwise neural ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLD and its pairwise neural extension outperform baseline methods by effectively mitigating both position bias and sample selection bias. The robustness of CLD is further validated through empirical studies considering variations in bias severity and click noise.",

            "title": "MINER: Multi-Interest Matching Network for News Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation is an essential technique to help users find interested news. Accurately matching user\u2019s interests and candidate news is the key to news recommendation. Most existing methods learn a single user embedding from user\u2019s historical behaviors to represent the reading interest. However, user interest is usually diverse and may not be adequately modeled by a single user embedding. In this paper, we propose a poly attention scheme to learn multiple interest vectors for each user, which encodes the different aspects of user interest. We further propose a disagreement regularization to make the learned interests vectors more diverse. Moreover, we design a category-aware attention weighting strategy that incorporates the news category information as explicit interest signals into the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the MIND news recommendation benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Debiased Recommendation with User Feature Balancing",
            "abstract": "Debiased recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Traditional models mostly rely on the inverse propensity score (IPS), which can be hard to estimate and may suffer from the high variance issue. To alleviate these problems, in this article, we propose a novel debiased recommendation framework based on user feature balancing. The general idea is to introduce a projection function to adjust user feature distributions, such that the ideal unbiased learning objective can be upper bounded by a solvable objective purely based on the offline dataset. In the upper bound, the projected user distributions are expected to be equal given different items. From the causal inference perspective, this requirement aims to remove the causal relation from the user to the item, which enables us to achieve unbiased recommendation, bypassing the computation of IPS. To efficiently balance the user distributions upon each item pair, we propose three strategies, including clipping, sampling, and adversarial learning to improve the training process. For more robust optimization, we deploy an explicit model to capture the potential latent confounders in recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work on debiased recommendation based on confounder balancing. In the experiments, we compare our framework with many state-of-the-art methods based on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is effective in promoting the recommendation performance.",
