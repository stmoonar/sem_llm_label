            "title": "Geocomplexity explains spatial errors",
            "abstract": "Abstract The explanation of spatial errors in geospatial modelling has long been a challenge. This study introduces an index that captures the complexity of local spatial distribution, which can partially provide insight into spatial errors. While previous studies have explored the complexity of geographical data from various perspectives, there is limited knowledge on assessing the complexity while taking spatial dependence into account. This study proposes a measure of geocomplexity, i.e. the spatial local complexity indicator, which characterizes the complexity of local spatial patterns while considering spatial neighbor dependence. We used both aspatial and spatial models to estimate the economic inequality in Australia, and applied the spatial local complexity indicator to explain spatial errors in these models. Results show that the developed geocomplexity indicator, using a binary spatial matrix, can effectively explain spatial errors arising from models, including 17%-47% of errors in aspatial models and 14% in a spatial model. The experiments in this study support our hypothesis that geocomplexity is an essential component in explaining spatial errors. The proposed geocomplexity indicator, along with our hypothesis, has the potential for advancing the understanding complex geospatial systems and enabling applications in various fields related to spatial data analysis.",

            "abstract": "The core idea and basic views of the complex adaptive system theory are expounded, and the compatibility between complex adaptive system theory and supply chain is demonstrated. With the independent enterprises participating in the operation of supply chain system as the adaptive agents, a hierarchical system model of department-enterprise-multi-agent is constructed under the theoretical framework of complex adaptive system. The whole evolution process and main characteristics of each stage of supply chain\u2019s evolution and development are revealed. The key technology system of supply chain optimization in the future is studied by using complex adaptive system theory from simulative perspective and entity optimization aspect. This paper proposes a thinking pattern to study the evolution process of supply chain by using complex adaptive system theory.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the number of motor vehicles in China has grown rapidly, and the contradiction between supply and demand of vehicles and roads has become more apparent. The problem of urban traffic congestion has become increasingly prominent, and the mechanism of congestion resolution has emerged. At present, there are still many shortcomings in China's traffic congestion control system. The phenomenon of urban road congestion is still widespread. The existing traffic control system cannot meet the complicated traffic network and cannot alleviate the deterioration of traffic conditions. This paper proposes a multi-agent traffic control system, which aims to control the green-signal and red-signal ratio of traffic flow at multiple adjacent intersections in the traffic network, thereby improving the driving ability of the traffic flow. This paper starts from the traffic control network and uses a single agent as the unit. Through multi-agent technology, the information between multiple agents at each intersection can be circulated, and each agent can quickly respond and automatically adapt to changes in traffic information. A genetic algorithm is used to establish a distributed urban traffic control system that can be continuously optimized. It is hoped that through the research in this paper, the problem of urban road traffic congestion deterioration can be effectively solved, thereby improving the vehicle traffic capacity and the efficiency of social activities.",

            "abstract": "The thesis starts with the theoretical connotation of revenue distribution in supply chain, which lays the theoretical support for the model construction and realization mechanism, then takes the joint utility model as the basic research method and establishes two-stage closed-loop profit distribution model of supply chain, which composed of suppliers and manufacturers. This paper also analyzes the value range of relevant parameters and the revenue change of all parties in the supply chain. Through the research, the feasibility of applying the joint utility model to the revenue distribution model of two-stage closed-loop supply chain is verified. The purpose of this paper is to propose the method and model of cooperative benefit distribution in supply chain, which is to make distribution of cooperative interests between enterprises fairer and more reasonable. Also, it can strengthen the cooperative relationship between supply chain members.",
