            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

However, with the rapid growth of big geospatial data, most of the commonly used geospatial analytic tools are not efficient (or even feasible) to support large-scale datasets. As such, domain experts have raised the concerns about the inefficiency issues for using these tools. In this tutorial, we aim to arouse the attention of database researchers for this important, emerging, database-related, and interdisciplinary topic, which consists of four parts. In the first part, we will discuss different problems and highlight the challenges for two types of geospatial analytic tools, which are (1) hotspot detection and (2) correlation analysis. In the second and third parts, we will specifically discuss two geospatial analytic tools, namely kernel density visualization (the representative hotspot detection method) and K-function (the representative correlation analysis method), respectively, and their variants. In the fourth part, we will highlight the future opportunities for this topic.",

It is structured into four parts: a thorough discussion of the background of KDV, a review of state-of-the-art methods for generating KDVs, a discussion of key variants of KDV, including network kernel density visualization (NKDV) and spatiotemporal kernel density visualization (STKDV), and an outline of future directions for this topic.",

            "abstract": "Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to provide recommendations for different domains (e.g., types of products) with overlapping users/items and is common for platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and LinkedIn that host multiple services. Existing MDR models face two challenges: First, it is difficult to disentangle knowledge that generalizes across domains (e.g., a user likes cheap items) and knowledge specific to a single domain (e.g., a user likes blue clothing but not blue cars). Second, they have limited ability to transfer knowledge across domains with small overlaps. We propose a new MDR method named EDDA with two key components, i.e., embedding disentangling recommender and domain alignment, to tackle the two challenges respectively. In particular, the embedding disentangling recommender separates both the model and embedding for the inter-domain part and the intra-domain part, while most existing MDR methods only focus on model-level disentangling. The domain alignment leverages random walks from graph processing to identify similar user/item pairs from different domains and encourages similar user/item pairs to have similar embeddings, enhancing knowledge transfer. We compare EDDA with 12 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 real datasets. The results show that EDDA consistently outperforms the baselines on all datasets and domains. All datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/Stevenn9981/EDDA.",

            "abstract": "is an unsupervised classification technique for grouping set of abstract objects into classes of similar objects. Clustering uncertain data is one of the essential tasks in mining uncertain data. Uncertain data is typically found in the area of sensor networks, weather data, customer rating data etc. The earlier methods for clustering uncertain data based on probability distribution, uses Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure similarity between two uncertain objects. In this paper, uncertain object in discrete domain is modeled, where uncertain object is treated as a discrete random variable. The Jenson- Shannon divergence is used to measure the similarity between two uncertain objects and integrate it into partitioning and density based clustering approaches. Experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of model developed and results are at par with the existing approaches.",
