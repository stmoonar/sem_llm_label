            "title": "Navigating Industry 5.0: A Survey of Key Enabling Technologies, Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities",
            "abstract": "This century has been a major avenue for revolutionary changes in technology and industry. Industries have transitioned towards intelligent automation, relying less on human intervention, resulting in the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. That is why IoT has been the researcher\u2019s arena for quite some time. With Industry 4.0 still in motion, the world is on the verge of the $5^{\\textit {th}}$ industrial revolution, a relatively new concept with many unclear opinions regarding its potential benefits, challenges, opportunities, trends, and impact on society. There is a dire need for a broader and more critical perspective. This research paints a bigger picture of \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat to expect?\u201d during the transition phase of Industry 5.0. In this comprehensive review, we have addressed the state-of-the-art practices in Industry 4.0 and the transitional phase of Industry 5.0. We have highlighted the most promising key enabling technologies, trends, research topics, rising challenges, and unfolding opportunities that can help prepare society for this paradigm shift. The paper then surveys the work toward the outstanding key enablers, challenges, trends, and opportunities in the IoT evolution for Industry 5.0. To spur further avenues for researchers and industrialists, the paper offers conclusive insights at the end. In addition, the article has a precise set of research questions answered in consequent sections and subsections for the reader\u2019s clarity.",

            "abstract": "Reputation systems are widely used to provide a trustworthy environment and improve the sustainability of online discussions. They help users understand and evaluate the quality of information by collecting and counting feedback from different users. However, a common issue in most reputation systems is how to maintain users\u2019 reputation and protect their anonymity simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a new practical anonymous reputation system based on SGX. The establishment of an anonymous reputation system has a positive effect on sustainable trust in reputation-based online applications. Our system achieves the combination of reputation and anonymity by utilizing Intel SGX and the Bloom filter. The Path ORAM algorithm is also implemented to resist side-channel attacks. The experiments demonstrate that our system achieves high performance in terms of computation and storage costs. When compared to two state-of-the-art anonymous reputation systems, our system has better computation performance with at least three orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been advancing and gaining tremendous interests from both academia and industry. With the development of wireless technologies, a huge amount of data generated at the network edge provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop GANs applications. However, due to the constraints such as bandwidth, privacy, and legal issues, it is inappropriate to collect and send all data to the cloud or servers for analysis, training, and mining. Thus, deploying and training GANs at the edge becomes a promising alternative solution. The instability of GANs introduced by non-independent and identical data (Non-IID) poses significant challenges to training GANs. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel federated learning framework for GANs, namely, Collaborated gAme Parallel Learning (CAP). CAP supports parallel training of data and models for GANs, breaking the isolated training among generators that exists in the previous distributed algorithms, and achieving collaborative learning among cloud, edge servers, and devices. Then, to further enhance the ability of CAP-GAN for addressing Non-IID issues, we propose a Mix-Generator module (Mix-G) which divides a generator into the sharing layer and personalizing layer. The Mix-G module extracts the generic and personalization features and improves the performance of CAP-GAN on extremely personalizing datasets. Experimental results and analysis substantiate the usefulness and superiority of our proposed CAP-GAN scheme which can achieve better results in the Non-IID scenarios compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection, in recent years, has gained increasing attention in the research and practice of time series processing. However, the task is particularly challenging with multivariate time series which complicates the temporal dependency between observations and introduces complex inter-channel correlation. Meanwhile, in order to fit a broader range of applications, robustness during both training and detection is also a critical aspect. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, hybrid model-driven anomaly detection scheme capable of (1) transforming sequences into a fused representation of temporal dependency embeddings and inter-channel correlation embeddings, and (2) achieving robust anomaly detection using a temporal prediction network for sample-wise posterior estimation combined with a data reconstruction network to assess the source of prediction. On this basis, we develop a probability density-based anomaly scoring mechanism for online detection in multivariate time series, where the anomaly score for each observation is rectified by the reliability of the prediction source. The results of extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets show that our proposed solution outperforms various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms (including DL-based and non-DL-based), achieving a performance improvement (in F1-Score) by up to 10.42%.",

Previous studies assume that local agents are receiving data from the same phenomenon, and a same final model is fitted to them. However, this \u201cone model fits all\u201d approach leads to a biased performance evaluation of individual agents.

            "abstract": "This article focuses on a simple, yet fundamental question of distributed edge computing: \u201chow to handle IoT traffic with different levels of sensitivity and criticality by satisfying the application-specific latency constraints?\u201d This question arises in the practical deployment of edge computing, where user data can arrive at a much faster rate than that they can be processed by an edge node. Addressing this question is critical for meeting the latency requirement for latency-sensitive applications, but existing approaches are inadequate to the problem. We present Janus, a multi-level traffic scheduling system for managing multiple data streams with various degrees of latency constraints. At the edge node level, Janus uses multi-level queues to manage data streams with different latency constraints. It then allocates the output bandwidth of the edge node according to the requirements of applications in different priority queues, aiming to reduce the queuing and processing delay of latency-sensitive streams while maximizing the edge-node throughput. At the network level, Janus actively redirects incoming data streams to the less-loaded ones to achieve better network-wide load balance and improve the overall throughput. Experiments show that Janus reduces the latency to only 16.6% of a non-priority based solution and improves the throughput by 1.7x of a state-of-the-art priority-aware data stream scheduling approach.",

            "abstract": "The surging of deep learning brings new vigor and vitality to shape the prospect of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT), and the rise of edge intelligence enables provisioning real-time deep neural network (DNN) inference services for mobile users. To perform efficient and effective DNN model training in edge computing environments while preserving training data security and privacy of IoT devices, federated learning has been envisioned as an ideal learning paradigm for this purpose. In this article, we study energy-aware DNN model training in edge computing. We first formulate a novel energy-aware, Device-to-Device (D2D) assisted federated learning problem with the aim to minimize the global loss of a training DNN model, subject to bandwidth capacity on an edge server and energy capacity on each IoT device. We then devise a near-optimal learning algorithm for the problem when the training data follows the i.i.d. data distribution. The crux of the proposed algorithm is to explore using the energy of neighboring devices of each device for its local model uploading, by reducing the problem to a series of weighted maximum matching problems in corresponding auxiliary graphs. We also consider the problem without the assumption of the i.i.d. data distribution, for which we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are promising.",

            "abstract": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a cost-effective energy disaggregation means to estimate the energy consumption of individual appliances from a central load reading. Learning-based methods are the new trends in NILM implementations but require large labeled data to work properly at end-user premises. We first formulate an unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation problem to address this challenge by leveraging rich public datasets for building the NILM model. Then, we prove a new generalization bound for the target domain under multi-source settings. A hybrid loss-driven multi-source domain adversarial network (HLD-MDAN) is developed by approximating and optimizing the bound to tackle the domain shift between source and target domains. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world residential energy datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of HLD-MDAN, showing that it is superior to other methods in single-source and multi-source learning scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in time series prediction with promising results. The model explanation of time series prediction falls behind the model development and makes less sense to users in understanding model decisions. This paper proposes ES-Mask, a post-hoc and model-agnostic evolutionary strip mask-based saliency approach for time series applications. ES-Mask designs the mask consisting of strips with the same salient value in consecutive time steps to produce binary and sustained feature importance scores over time for easy understanding and interpretation of time series. ES-Mask uses an evolutionary algorithm to search for the optimal mask by manipulating strips in rounds, thus is agnostic to models by involving no internal model states in the search. The initial experiments on MIMIC-III data set show that ES-Mask outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "In this article, we propose and analyze FastSlowMo, a combined Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) style worker momentum and aggregator momentum algorithm for federated learning (FL). Existing NAG momentum-based FL algorithms depend on either worker momentum only or aggregator momentum only, which may be inefficient due to infrequent usage of momentum, data heterogeneity, and out-of-date momentum. FastSlowMo combines the advantages of worker momentum and aggregator momentum to address these issues. We then provide mathematical proof for the convergence of FastSlowMo. Finally, extensive experiments based on real-world datasets and trace-driven simulation are conducted, verifying that FastSlowMo decreases the total training time by 3\u201361%, and outperforms existing mainstream benchmarks under a wide range of settings.",
