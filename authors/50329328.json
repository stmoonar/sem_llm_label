            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Posterior Cortical Atrophy is a rare but significant form of dementia which affects people's visual ability before their memory. This is often misdiagnosed as an eyesight rather than brain sight problem. This paper aims to address the frequent, initial misdiagnosis of this disease as a vision problem through the use of an intelligent, cost-effective, wearable system, alongside diagnosis of the more typical Alzheimer's Disease. We propose low-level features constructed from the IMU data gathered from 35 participants, while they performed a stair climbing and descending task in a real-world simulated environment. We demonstrate that with these features the machine learning models predict dementia with 87.02% accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate how system parameters, such as number of sensors, affect the prediction accuracy. This lays the groundwork for a simple clinical test to enable detection of dementia which can be carried out in the wild.",

This study introduced a PAPW with force velocity assist control (FVAC) based on individual capability of pushing force velocity relationship. This PAPW assists attendant pushing when more pushing force is needed over usual range of individual physical capabilities of pushing. With the PAPW, we investigated the performance of the FVAC and compared it with proportional assist control (PAC) on a flat level surface and a longitudinal slope (6.5%) with three participants. The experimental results showed that the PAPW with the FVAC reduced 50% of pushing force on the slope and this was similar performance of the PAC in terms of assisting. The FVAC also reduced 79% of mean mechanical assisting power on the flat against the PAC. These results support that the PAPW with the FVAC has flexibilities to adapt to individual physical capabilities and provides certain level of physical activities with sufficient assisting when needed, and low energy consumption for long time and distance operations for attendants. the assisting boundary and assisted attendant pushing when more pushing force over the endurable individual physical capability was needed. The validation in this study shows that the FVAC achieves similar performance to the PAC in terms of reduction of pushing force, in addition, better performance to keep certain level of attendant's physical activities and to reduce mechanical power compared with the PAC, especially 79% reduction on the flat. The flat condition would account for the main part of environments in travelling, so the driving distance and",

While patients may exhibit abnormal gait parameters, adaptive gait irregularities when navigating environments are little explored or understood. The aim of this study was to assess adaptive locomotor responses of AD subjects in a complex environment requiring spatial navigation. A controlled environment of three corridors was set up: straight (I), U-shaped (U) and dog-leg (S). Participants were asked to walk along corridors as part of a counterbalanced repeated-measures design. Three groups were studied: 11 people with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), 10 with typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) and 13 controls. Spatio-temporal gait parameters and position within the corridors were monitored with shoe-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Hesitant steps were identified from statistical analysis of the distribution of step time data. Walking paths were generated from position data calculated by double integration of IMU acceleration. People with PCA and tAD had similar gait characteristics, having shorter steps and longer step times than controls. Hesitant steps tended to be clustered within certain regions of the walking paths. IMUs enabled identification of key gait characteristics in this clinical population (step time, length and step hesitancy) and environmental conditions (route complexity) modifying their expression.",

            "abstract": "Manual wheelchair is an effective device for assisting independent life of motor disabled subjects. However, many users of manual wheelchair have been suffered from shoulder pain because propelling the wheelchair needs repetitive movement of upper extremities. The purpose of this study was to examine a validity of using shoulder joint moment in evaluation of load on the users in wheelchair propulsion. Since shoulder joint moment can evaluate mechanical load on the shoulder, the indexes are expected to provide information to help wheelchair propulsion in decreasing of shoulder pain. Two evaluation indexes derived from shoulder joint moment were tested in this paper: Ft/Ms and Fr/Ms, which showed contribution of shoulder joint moment (MS) to wheelchair propulsion (tangential force on handrim FT) and to the resultant force on handrim (FR). These indexes were compared to the index FT/FR which was based on previous studies. Measurements of movements during wheelchair propulsion were performed with 3 healthy subjects on stationary wheelchair ergometer under the different conditions of propulsion speed and resistance of ergometer. Correlation coefficient between the proposed indexes and FT/FR were low (\u22120.51 to 0.10), which suggested that the proposed indexes had different information from the index FT/FR. Change of the index values between low and high propulsion load conditions were different between subjects. These results suggest that using indexes derived from shoulder joint moment would be effective in evaluation of load in wheelchair propulsion.",

The classification was conducted on data collected from 34 people (14 controls; 20 people with dementia, comprising 10 with typical Alzheimer's disease [tAD] and 10 with posterior cortical atrophy [PCA]) walking up a set of 4 steps. Attributes used to discriminate those with and without dementia were the mean and root mean square values of: resultant acceleration, roll, pitch and yaw. Each person's data was allocated to one of two datasets (N=17, N=17). A weighted nearest neighbor classifier was trained on each dataset in turn and subsequently used on the remaining dataset. Overall accuracy of the classifier was 0.67, with a precision of 0.62 and recall of 0.47.",

            "abstract": "Pain-related emotions are a major barrier to effective self rehabilitation in chronic pain. Automated coaching systems capable of detecting these emotions are a potential solution. This paper lays the foundation for the development of such systems by making three contributions. First, through literature reviews, an overview of how pain is expressed in chronic pain and the motivation for detecting it in physical rehabilitation is provided. Second, a fully labelled multimodal dataset (named `EmoPain') containing high resolution multiple-view face videos, head mounted and room audio signals, full body 3D motion capture and electromyographic signals from back muscles is supplied. Natural unconstrained pain related facial expressions and body movement behaviours were elicited from people with chronic pain carrying out physical exercises. Both instructed and non-instructed exercises were considered to reflect traditional scenarios of physiotherapist directed therapy and home-based self-directed therapy. Two sets of labels were assigned: level of pain from facial expressions annotated by eight raters and the occurrence of six pain-related body behaviours segmented by four experts. Third, through exploratory experiments grounded in the data, the factors and challenges in the automated recognition of such expressions and behaviour are described, the paper concludes by discussing potential avenues in the context of these findings also highlighting differences for the two exercise scenarios addressed.",

            "abstract": "This study aimed to examine simple locomotion and eye behaviour of individuals with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) and typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) within a simulated real-world environment. Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by parietal, occipital and occipito-temporal tissue loss and progressive impairment of higher-order visual function in contrast to relatively spared memory and language. Targeted types of locomotion were walking in a series of corridors, up or down stairs, and across an open room with or without the presence of an obstacle. Eye tracking measures and inertial moment units (IMU) were used in this experiment, and resultant acceleration of left foot and fixation duration were extracted. Findings from three participants are presented as a case series: one control, one PCA and one tAD patient. The averaged resultant acceleration of PCA patient was the slowest in all types of locomotion, especially in stairs. The averaged resultant accelerations of PCA and tAD participants were slower than the control participant. The PCA participant had longer mean fixation durations than the tAD and control participants, however, mean fixation duration was similar between tAD and control participants. Results may help characterise locomotion and eye behaviour in PCA and tAD and may suggest ways to support effective diagnosis and assessment of disease progression.",

            "abstract": "There is a need to develop an assisting device which can be adapted to the individual capabilities of elderly attendants, which would allow them to maintain a level of fitness when pushing a wheelchair, while minimising the risk of injury to them. Furthermore there is a need to reduce the overall energy consumption of the device in keeping with the current trends of reducing carbon emissions. The control system for attendants pushing wheelchairs that reduces the energy needed by the assisting device is an increasing trend of optimisation of assistive technology devices to individual capabilities to ensure less energy expenditure of the attendant. The control parameters for existing assisting systems for attendant wheelchair propulsion are difficult to optimise for individual capabilities. We focus on the individual propelling performance, and propose an assisting control method based on the force velocity relationship of the individual. Our proposed assisting controller generates an assisting force when the attendant's propelling force exceeds an assisting boundary defined by the force velocity relationship. In this paper, we tested the performance of the assisting controller based on force velocity (FV) relationship using simulation. The simulation used an attendant wheelchair model with parameters determined from experiments. From the simulated results of the assisting force trajectories, the FV assisting system worked as we defined. The FV assisting system used less energy consumption than the existing proportional assisting systems. Also the FV assisting system would have a limit of maximum attendant propelling power, so the distribution between the attendant force and the assisting force can be easily adjusted to the individual's force velocity relationship. Our proposed FV assisting system would be useful as it would allow an optimised system based on individual capabilities to be created for rehabilitation/training systems, which would allow optimum energy consumption when propelling a wheelchair.",

            "abstract": "Dwell time is the time that a public transport vehicle remains stopped while transferring passengers. Dwell time depends on the number of boarding and alighting passengers plus other characteristics, such as platform height, door width, fare collection method, internal layout of the vehicle, and occupancy of the vehicle. Traditionally, dwell time has been described as a linear function of the number of passengers boarding and alighting. In this paper, results are presented of dwell time parameters obtained from real-scale experiments made at the Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory, University College London. Three variables were controlled: platform height (0, 150, and 300 mm), door width (800 and 1,600 mm), and fare collection method (prepayment outside the vehicle and payment with an electronic card at the entrance of the vehicle). For each value of the variables mentioned above, between 15 and 20 runs were recorded on videotape with four cameras and different views. In total, 300 records of boarding and alighting processes were obtained. Some results indicate that door width has more influence than platform height. For example, it was found that a wider door can reduce the average alighting time by almost 40%, regardless of platform height, and can reduce the average boarding time by 20%. However, for the same door width, a lower platform reduces the average alighting time by only 1% to 9%. More results and analysis are reported in this paper.",
