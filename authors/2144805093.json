            "title": "Routing Optimization With Deep Reinforcement Learning in Knowledge Defined Networking",
            "abstract": "Traditional routing algorithms cannot dynamically change network environments due to the limited information for routing decisions. Meanwhile, they are prone to performance bottlenecks in the face of increasingly complex business requirements. Some approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been proposed to address the routing problems. However, they hardly utilize the information about the network environment fully. The Knowledge Defined Networking (KDN) architecture inspires us to develop new learning mechanisms adapted to the dynamic characteristics of the network topology. In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to solve the routing optimization problem by adding a graph neural network (GNN) structure to DRL, called Message Passing Deep Reinforcement Learning (MPDRL). MPDRL uses the characteristics of GNN to interact with the network topology environment and extracts exploitable knowledge through the message passing process of information between links in the topology. The goal is to achieve the load balance of network traffic and improve network performance. We have conducted experiments on three Internet Service Provider (ISP) network topologies. The evaluation results show that MPDRL obtains better network performance than the baseline algorithms.",

            "title": "A Blockchain-Based Scheme for Secure Data Offloading in Healthcare With Deep Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "With the widespread popularity of the Internet of Things and various intelligent medical devices, the amount of medical data is rising sharply, and thus medical data processing has become increasingly challenging. Mobile edge computing technology allows computing power to be allocated at the edge closer to users, which enables efficient data offloading for healthcare systems. However, existing studies on medical data offloading seldom guarantee effective data privacy and security. Moreover, the research equipping data offloading architectures with Blockchain neglect the delay and energy consumption costs incurred in using Blockchain technology for medical data offloading. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data offloading scheme for healthcare based on Blockchain technology, which achieves optimal medical resource allocation and simultaneously minimizes the cost of offloading tasks. Specifically, we design a smart contract to ensure secure data offloading. And, we formulate the cost problem as a Markov Decision Process, solved by a policy search-based deep reinforcement learning (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) scheme, where we jointly consider offloading decisions, allocation of computing resources and radio transmission bandwidth, and Blockchain data security audits. The security of our smart-contract-based mechanism is theoretically and empirically proved, while extensive experimental results also show that our solution can obtain superior performance gains with lower cost than other baselines.",

            "abstract": "Due to the outstanding merits such as mobility, high maneuverability, and flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are viable mobile power transmitters that can be rapidly deployed in geographically constrained regions. They are good candidates for supplying power to energy-limited Sensor Nodes (SNs) with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-enabled WPT system that transmits power to a set of SNs at unknown positions. A key challenge is how to efficiently gather the locations of SNs and design a power transfer scheme. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize these objectives: maximization of UAV's search efficiency, maximization of total harvested energy, minimization of UAV's flight energy consumption and maximization of UAV's energy utilization efficiency. To tackle these issues, we present a two-stage strategy that includes a UAV Motion Control (UMC) algorithm for obtaining the coordinates of SNs and a Dynamic Genetic Clustering (DGC) algorithm for power transfer via grouping SNs into clusters. First, the UMC algorithm enables the UAV to autonomously control its own motion and conduct target search missions. The objective is to make the energy-restricted UAV find as many SNs as feasible without any priori known location information. Second, the DGC algorithm is used to optimize the energy consumption of the UAV by combining a genetic clustering algorithm with a dynamic clustering strategy to maximize the amount of energy harvested by SNs and the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts.",

            "abstract": "Communication infrastructure is damaged by disasters and it is difficult to support communication services in affected areas. UAVs play an important role in the emergency communication system. Due to the limited airborne energy of a UAV, it is a critical technical issue to effectively design flight routes to complete rescue missions. We fully consider the distribution of the rescue area, the type of mission, and the flight characteristics of the UAV. Firstly, according to the distribution of the crowd, the PSO algorithm is used to cluster the target-POI of the task area, and the neural collaborative filtering algorithm is used to prioritize the target-POI. Then we also design a Trans-UTPA algorithm. Based on MAPPO 's policy network and value function, we introduce transformer model to make Trans-UTPA's policy learning have no action space limitation and can be multi-task parallel, which improves the efficiency and generalization of sample processing. In a three-dimensional space, the UAV selects the emergency task to be performed (data acquisition and networking communication) based on strategic learning of state information (location information, energy consumption information, etc.) and action information (horizontal flight, ascent, and descent), and then designs the UAV flight path based on the maximization of the global value function. The experimental results show that the performance of the Trans-UTPA algorithm is further improved compared with the USCTP algorithm in terms of the success rate of each UAV reaching the target position, the number of collisions, and the average reward of the algorithm. Among them, the average reward of the algorithm exceeds the USCTP algorithm by 13%, and the number of collisions is reduced by 60%. Compared with the heuristic algorithm, it can cover more target-POIs, and has less energy consumption than the heuristic algorithm.",

            "abstract": "In the emergency rescue scenario where the communication infrastructure is damaged, Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) networking communication, as a part of the 6G air-space-ground integrated network system, plays a huge role in the establishment of the emergency communication network. In this paper, we fully consider the distribution of rescue areas, the type of tasks and the characteristics of UAVs, and design the TaskPOI-based multi-UAVs collaborative trajectory planning algorithm (TMCTP) based on regional tasks, aiming to improve the completed efficiency of rescue tasks and the utilization rate of energy consumption in the UAV backbone network. Firstly, we filter the population-intensive points of interest (PiPOI) region based on the location heat map of population density distribution and use the K-means clustering algorithm to generate task points of interest (TaskPOI) and use the neural collaborative filtering algorithm to determine the task priority and different priorities correspond to different task types. Then, we design a single UAV flight model and a multi-UAVs cooperative flight model. At the same time, considering the flight energy consumption, communication energy consumption and data acquisition energy consumption of UAV, the energy consumption equilibrium distribution model is designed to ensure that multi-UAVs have low energy consumption and balance the residual energy distribution while completing various levels of tasks. Finally, based on UAV flight model, energy consumption equilibrium distribution model, and combined with task priority of TaskPOI, TMCTP algorithm for the trajectory planning of the UAV group is designed by using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. The experimental results show that in the TMCTP algorithm, the success rate of the UAV arriving at the goal and the completed rate of the action are converged to 1, the times of collisions is converged to 0, and the average reward, the loss of algorithm are all converged to a good degree, and the PiPOI coverage rate in the area exceeds 60%. In terms of energy consumption, the difference between the energy consumption of each UAV is small, and compared with the average residual energy using GP3, the difference is not large, indicating that the algorithm can improve the PiPOI coverage of the entire rescue area without generating a large energy consumption. In this way, the UAV group after arriving at the goal will provide communication services for the rescue area and improve the connectivity and life cycle of the 6G air network.",

            "abstract": "As a core component of the Internet of Vehicles, reasoning about the trajectory of pedestrians or vehicles in complex road conditions plays a critical role in autonomous driving and socially aware robotic navigation. Most existing methods do not adequately consider the effects of heterogeneous traffic agents. Toward this end, we propose the traffic trajectory prediction algorithm based on the convolutional attention network (TraGCAN) to predict the trajectories of heterogeneous traffic agents in dense traffic. The algorithm of the proposed method examines the behavior of different traffic agents in terms of both time and space dimensions to identify their movement patterns and interactions. We construct the spatial relationship of traffic agents as a graph structure and introduce a graph convolutional network to extract spatial interactions. In addition, we design a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively calculate weights for all spatial interactions to capture different influences from neighboring agents. To improve the accuracy of trajectory prediction, the algorithm considers the influence of the heterogeneous characteristics of traffic agents on their motion behaviors. We evaluated the performance of the proposed TraGCAN on heterogeneous traffic data sets, and the results demonstrate that the error of TraGCAN is reduced by 15% compared to existing methods.",

Considering the three levels of identity, data package and path, this paper designs a chain authentication defense scheme. The scheme includes authentication mechanism, transaction information storage mechanism, source IP authenti-cation mechanism and smart contract notification mechanism. The received packets are authenticated by digital signature algorithm, and the trusted identity and location information are stored securely. At the same time, an improved block storage structure is designed to avoid data redundancy, and malicious information is processed by smart contract notification and stream rule installation. The experimental results show that the defense scheme designed in this paper can effectively defend against TPA attacks. Compared with the benchmark mechanism, the deployment of this scheme has less impact on controller performance and less impact on the delay of topology discovery in SDN.",

This article investigates a computation offloading scheduling problem in a dynamic network. The tasks generated by the edge devices can be executed locally or sent to edge servers for execution based on the time-varying MEC network. Moreover, we formulate the computation offloading optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model.

            "title": "An Algorithm with Iteration Uncertainty Eliminate Based on Geomagnetic Fingerprint under Mobile Edge Computing for Indoor Localization",
            "abstract": "Indoor localization problems are difficult due to that the information, such as WLAN and GPS, cannot achieve enough precision for indoor issues. This paper presents a novel indoor localization algorithm, GeoLoc, with uncertainty eliminate based on fusion of acceleration, angular rate, and magnetic field sensor data. The algorithm can be deployed in edge devices to overcome the problems of insufficient computing resources and long delay caused by high complexity of location calculation. Firstly, the magnetic map is built and magnetic values are matched. Secondly, orientation updating and position selection are iteratively executed using the fusion data, which gradually reduce uncertainty of orientation. Then, we filter the trajectory from a path set. By gradually reducing uncertainty, GeoLoc can bring a high positioning precision and a smooth trajectory. In addition, this method has an advantage in that it does not rely on any infrastructure such as base stations and beacons. It solves the common problems regarding the non-uniqueness of the geomagnetic fingerprint and the deviation of the sensor measurement. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves an accuracy of less than 2.5 m in indoor environment, and the positioning results are relatively stable. It meets the basic requirements of indoor location-based services (LBSs).",

            "title": "Heterogeneous Traffic Trajectory Prediction via Spatial Attention Network for Internet of Vehicles",
            "abstract": "There are different types of traffic agents in urban scenes. Their movement behaviors influence each other. Accu-rately predicting trajectories of these traffic agents contributes to the advancement of autonomous driving technology. In recent years, deep learning technology has become a more popular method for extracting motion features. However, most of the studies cannot properly simulate the interaction between agents, which affects the performance of the algorithm. This paper proposes a heterogeneous traffic trajectory prediction algorithm based on spatial attention network. We combine the features of different types of agents to optimize the attention mechanism, so that the algorithm can adaptively extract the spatial relationship between them. In addition, we use LSTM to combine the interaction effects of traffic agents with their own movement patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Finally, the future moving positon sequence of the agent is obtained. We use different datasets to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, and its prediction error is reduced by 15% compared with other methods.",
