            "abstract": "This paper introduces PAG-a novel optimization and decoding approach that guides autoregressive generation of document identifiers in generative retrieval models through simultaneous decoding. To this aim, PAG constructs a set-based and sequential identifier for each document. Motivated by the bag-of-words assumption in information retrieval, the set-based identifier is built on lexical tokens. The sequential identifier, on the other hand, is obtained via quantizing relevance-based representations of documents. Extensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track data reveal that PAG outperforms the state-of-the-art generative retrieval model by a large margin (e.g., 15.6% MRR improvements on MS MARCO), while achieving 22x speed up in terms of query latency.",

            "title": "Towards Unified Multi-Modal Personalization: Large Vision-Language Models for Generative Recommendation and Beyond",
            "abstract": "Developing a universal model that can effectively harness heterogeneous resources and respond to a wide range of personalized needs has been a longstanding community aspiration. Our daily choices, especially in domains like fashion and retail, are substantially shaped by multi-modal data, such as pictures and textual descriptions. These modalities not only offer intuitive guidance but also cater to personalized user preferences. However, the predominant personalization approaches mainly focus on the ID or text-based recommendation problem, failing to comprehend the information spanning various tasks or modalities. In this paper, our goal is to establish a Unified paradigm for Multi-modal Personalization systems (UniMP), which effectively leverages multi-modal data while eliminating the complexities associated with task- and modality-specific customization. We argue that the advancements in foundational generative modeling have provided the flexibility and effectiveness necessary to achieve the objective. In light of this, we develop a generic and extensible personalization generative framework, that can handle a wide range of personalized needs including item recommendation, product search, preference prediction, explanation generation, and further user-guided image generation. Our methodology enhances the capabilities of foundational language models for personalized tasks by seamlessly ingesting interleaved cross-modal user history information, ensuring a more precise and customized experience for users. To train and evaluate the proposed multi-modal personalized tasks, we also introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark covering a variety of user requirements. Our experiments on the real-world benchmark showcase the model's potential, outperforming competitive methods specialized for each task.",

            "abstract": "Developing a universal model that can efficiently and effectively respond to a wide range of information access requests-from retrieval to recommendation to question answering---has been a long-lasting goal in the information retrieval community. This paper argues that the flexibility, efficiency, and effectiveness brought by the recent development in dense retrieval and approximate nearest neighbor search have smoothed the path towards achieving this goal. We develop a generic and extensible dense retrieval framework, called framework, that can handle a wide range of (personalized) information access requests, such as keyword search, query by example, and complementary item recommendation. Our proposed approach extends the capabilities of dense retrieval models for ad-hoc retrieval tasks by incorporating user-specific preferences through the development of a personalized attentive network. This allows for a more tailored and accurate personalized information access experience. Our experiments on real-world e-commerce data suggest the feasibility of developing universal information access models by demonstrating significant improvements even compared to competitive baselines specifically developed for each of these individual information access tasks. This work opens up a number of fundamental research directions for future exploration.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we explore a Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) task, where the collection includes documents in multiple languages. We demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art approaches developed for cross-lingual information retrieval to MLIR tasks leads to sub-optimal performance. This is due to the heterogeneous and imbalanced nature of multilingual collections -- some languages are better represented in the collection and some benefit from large-scale training data. To address this issue, we present KD-SPD, a novel soft prompt decoding approach for MLIR that implicitly \"translates'' the representation of documents in different languages into the same embedding space. To address the challenges of data scarcity and imbalance, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy. The teacher model is trained on rich English retrieval data, and by leveraging bi-text data, our distillation framework transfers its retrieval knowledge to the multilingual document encoder. Therefore, our approach does not require any multilingual retrieval training data. Extensive experiments on three MLIR datasets with a total of 15 languages demonstrate that KD-SPD significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all cases. We conduct extensive analyses to show that our method has less language bias and better zero-shot transfer ability towards new languages.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has shown that transformer networks can be used as differentiable search indexes by representing each document as a sequence of document ID tokens. These generative retrieval models cast the retrieval problem to a document ID generation problem for each query. Despite their elegant design, existing generative retrieval models only perform well on artificially-constructed and small-scale collections. This paper represents an important milestone in generative retrieval research by showing that generative retrieval models can be trained to perform effectively on large-scale standard retrieval benchmarks. In more detail, we propose RIPOR- an optimization framework for generative retrieval that is designed based on two often-overlooked fundamental design considerations. First, RIPOR introduces a novel prefix-oriented ranking optimization algorithm for accurate estimation of relevance score during sequential document ID generation. Second, RIPOR constructs document IDs based on the relevance associations between queries and documents. Evaluation on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track reveals that RIPOR surpasses state-of-the-art generative retrieval models by a large margin (e.g., 30.5% MRR improvements on MS MARCO Dev Set).",

            "title": "Language Models As Semantic Indexers",
            "abstract": "Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step introduces potential information loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing. It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we introduce LMIndexer, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective. We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains.

            "abstract": "State-of-the-art industrial-level recommender system applications mostly adopt complicated model structures such as deep neural networks. While this helps with the model performance, the lack of system explainability caused by these nearly blackbox models also raises concerns and potentially weakens the users\u2019 trust in the system. Existing work on explainable recommendation mostly focuses on designing interpretable model structures to generate model-intrinsic explanations. However, most of them have complex structures, and it is difficult to directly apply these designs onto existing recommendation applications due to the effectiveness and efficiency concerns. However, while there have been some studies on explaining recommendation models without knowing their internal structures (i.e., model-agnostic explanations), these methods have been criticized for not reflecting the actual reasoning process of the recommendation model or, in other words, faithfulness. How to develop model-agnostic explanation methods and evaluate them in terms of faithfulness is mostly unknown. In this work, we propose a reusable evaluation pipeline for model-agnostic explainable recommendation. Our pipeline evaluates the quality of model-agnostic explanation from the perspectives of faithfulness and scrutability. We further propose a model-agnostic explanation framework for recommendation and verify it with the proposed evaluation pipeline. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our model-agnostic framework is able to generate explanations that are faithful to the recommendation model. We additionally provide quantitative and qualitative study to show that our explanation framework could enhance the scrutability of blackbox recommendation model. With proper modification, our evaluation pipeline and model-agnostic explanation framework could be easily migrated to existing applications. Through this work, we hope to encourage the community to focus more on faithfulness evaluation of explainable recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Recent work has shown that more effective dense retrieval models can be obtained by distilling ranking knowledge from an existing base re-ranking model. In this paper, we propose a generic curriculum learning based optimization framework called CL-DRD that controls the difficulty level of training data produced by the re-ranking (teacher) model. CL-DRD iteratively optimizes the dense retrieval (student) model by increasing the difficulty of the knowledge distillation data made available to it. In more detail, we initially provide the student model coarse-grained preference pairs between documents in the teacher's ranking, and progressively move towards finer-grained pairwise document ordering requirements. In our experiments, we apply a simple implementation of the CL-DRD framework to enhance two state-of-the-art dense retrieval models. Experiments on three public passage retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

            "title": "Understanding the Effectiveness of Reviews in E-commerce Top-N Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Modern E-commerce websites contain heterogeneous sources of information, such as numerical ratings, textual reviews and images. These information can be utilized to assist recommendation. Through textual reviews, a user explicitly express her affinity towards the item. Previous researchers found that by using the information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users' explicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement of recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were only utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating prediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as top-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully explored. Seeing this gap, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of textual review information for top-N recommendation under E-commerce settings. We adapt several SOTA review-based rating prediction models for top-N recommendation tasks and compare them to existing top-N recommendation models from both performance and efficiency. We find that models utilizing only review information can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback matrix factorization method. When utilizing review information as a regularizer or auxiliary information, the performance of implicit-feedback matrix factorization method can be further improved. However, the optimal model structure to utilize textual reviews for E-commerce top-N recommendation is yet to be determined.",

            "title": "A Hierarchical Self-attentive Convolution Network for Review Modeling in Recommendation Systems",
            "abstract": "Using reviews to learn user and item representations is important for recommender system. Current review based methods can be divided into two categories: (1) the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based models that extract n-gram features from user/item reviews; (2) the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based models that learn global contextual representations from reviews for users and items. Despite their success, both CNN and RNN based models in previous studies suffer from their own drawbacks. While CNN based models are weak in modeling long-dependency relation in text, RNN based models are slow in training and inference due to their incapability with parallel computing. To alleviate these problems, we propose a new text encoder module for review modeling in recommendation by combining convolution networks with self-attention networks to model local and global interactions in text together.As different words, sentences, reviews have different importance for modeling user and item representations, we construct review models hierarchically in sentence-level, review-level, and user/item level by encoding words for sentences, encoding sentences for reviews, and encoding reviews for user and item representations. Experiments on Amazon Product Benchmark show that our model can achieve significant better performance comparing to the state-of-the-art review based recommendation models.",
