            "abstract": "While the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches often learn high-quality embeddings for high-degree nodes with abundant structural connectivity, the quality of the embeddings for low-degree or tail nodes is often suboptimal due to their limited structural connectivity. While many real-world networks are long-tailed, to date little effort has been devoted to tail node embeddings. In this article, we formulate the goal of learning tail node embeddings as a few-shot regression problem, given the few links on each tail node. In particular, since each node resides in its own local context, we personalize the regression model for each tail node. To reduce overfitting in the personalization, we propose a locality-aware meta-learning framework, called meta-tail2vec, which learns to learn the regression model for the tail nodes at different localities. Moreover, to address the heterogeneity in nodes and edges on heterogeneous information networks (HINs), we further extend the proposed model and formulate meta-tail2vec+, which is based on a dual-adaptation mechanism to facilitate the locality-aware tail node embeddings on HINs. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the promising results of both meta-tail2vec and its extension meta-tail2vec+.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) encounter significant computational challenges when handling large-scale graphs, which severely restricts their efficacy across diverse applications. To address this limitation, graph condensation has emerged as a promising technique, which constructs a small synthetic graph for efficiently training GNNs while retaining performance. However, due to the topology structure among nodes, graph condensation is limited to condensing only the observed training nodes and their corresponding structure, thus lacking the ability to effectively handle the unseen data. Consequently, the original large graph is still required in the inference stage to perform message passing to inductive nodes, resulting in substantial computational demands. To overcome this issue, we propose mapping-aware graph condensation (MCond), explicitly learning the one-to-many node mapping from original nodes to synthetic nodes to seamlessly integrate new nodes into the synthetic graph for inductive representation learning. This enables direct information propagation on the synthetic graph, which is much more efficient than on the original large graph. Specifically, MCond employs an alternating optimization scheme with innovative loss terms from transductive and inductive perspectives, facilitating the mutual promotion between graph condensation and node mapping learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in inductive inference. On the Reddit dataset, MCond achieves up to 121.5\u00d7 inference speedup and 55.9\u00d7 reduction in storage requirements compared with counterparts based on the original graph.",

            "title": "mg2vec: Learning Relationship-Preserving Heterogeneous Graph Representations via Metagraph Embedding",
            "abstract": "Given that heterogeneous information networks (HIN) encompass nodes and edges belonging to different semantic types, they can model complex data in real-world scenarios. Thus, HIN embedding has received increasing attention, which aims to learn node representations in a low-dimensional space, in order to preserve the structural and semantic information on the HIN. In this regard, metagraphs, which model common and recurring patterns on HINs, emerge as a powerful tool to capture semantic-rich and often latent relationships on HINs. Although metagraphs have been employed to address several specific data mining tasks, they have not been thoroughly explored for the more general HIN embedding. In this paper, we leverage metagraphs to learn relationship-preserving HIN embedding in a self-supervised setting, to support various relationship mining tasks. In particular, we observe that most of the current approaches often under-utilize metagraphs, which are only applied in a pre-processing step and do not actively guide representation learning afterwards. Thus, we propose the novel framework of mg2vec, which learns the embeddings for metagraphs and nodes jointly. That is, metagraphs actively participates in the learning process by mapping themselves to the same embedding space as the nodes do. Moreover, metagraphs guide the learning through both first- and second-order constraints on node embeddings, to model not only latent relationships between a pair of nodes, but also individual preferences of each node. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets. Results show that mg2vec significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art baselines in relationship mining tasks including relationship prediction, search and visualization.",
