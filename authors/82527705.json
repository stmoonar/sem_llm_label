            "title": "A Survey on Fairness-aware Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "As information filtering services, recommender systems have extremely enriched our daily life by providing personalized suggestions and facilitating people in decision-making, which makes them vital and indispensable to human society in the information era. However, as people become more dependent on them, recent studies show that recommender systems potentially own unintentional impacts on society and individuals because of their unfairness (e.g., gender discrimination in job recommendations). To develop trustworthy services, it is crucial to devise fairness-aware recommender systems that can mitigate these bias issues. In this survey, we summarise existing methodologies and practices of fairness in recommender systems. Firstly, we present concepts of fairness in different recommendation scenarios, comprehensively categorize current advances, and introduce typical methods to promote fairness in different stages of recommender systems. Next, after introducing datasets and evaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we will delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender systems exert on real-world industrial applications. Subsequently, we highlight the connection between fairness and other principles of trustworthy recommender systems, aiming to consider trustworthiness principles holistically while advocating for fairness. Finally, we summarize this review, spotlighting promising opportunities in comprehending concepts, frameworks, the balance between accuracy and fairness, and the ties with trustworthiness, with the ultimate goal of fostering the development of fairness-aware recommender systems.",

            "title": "Contrastive Graph Similarity Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph similarity learning is a significant and fundamental issue in the theory and analysis of graphs, which has been applied in a variety of fields, including object tracking, recommender systems, similarity search, and so on. Recent methods for graph similarity learning that utilize deep learning typically share two deficiencies: (1) they leverage graph neural networks as backbones for learning graph representations but have not well captured the complex information inside data, and (2) they employ a cross-graph attention mechanism for graph similarity learning, which is computationally expensive. Taking these limitations into consideration, a method for graph similarity learning is devised in this study, namely, Contrastive Graph Similarity Network (CGSim). To enhance graph similarity learning, CGSim makes use of the complementary information of two input graphs and captures pairwise relations in a contrastive learning framework. By developing a dual contrastive learning module with a node-graph matching and a graph-graph matching mechanism, our method significantly reduces the quadratic time complexity for cross-graph interaction modeling to linear time complexity. Jointly learning in an end-to-end framework, the graph representation embedding module and the well-designed contrastive learning module can be beneficial to one another. A comprehensive series of experiments indicate that CGSim outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on six datasets and significantly reduces the computational cost, which demonstrates our CGSim model\u2019s superiority over other baselines.",

            "title": "Dual Intent Enhanced Graph Neural Network for Session-based New Item Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems are essential to various fields, e.g., e-commerce, e-learning, and streaming media. At present, graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendations normally can only recommend items existing in users\u2019 historical sessions. As a result, these GNNs have difficulty recommending items that users have never interacted with (new items), which leads to a phenomenon of information cocoon. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend new items to users. As there is no interaction between new items and users, we cannot include new items when building session graphs for GNN session-based recommender systems. Thus, it is challenging to recommend new items for users when using GNN-based methods. We regard this challenge as \u201cGNN Session-based New Item Recommendation (GSNIR)\u201d. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-intent enhanced graph neural network for it. Due to the fact that new items are not tied to historical sessions, the users\u2019 intent is difficult to predict. We design a dual-intent network to learn user intent from an attention mechanism and the distribution of historical data respectively, which can simulate users\u2019 decision-making process in interacting with a new item. To solve the challenge that new items cannot be learned by GNNs, inspired by zero-shot learning (ZSL), we infer the new item representation in GNN space by using their attributes. By outputting new item probabilities, which contain recommendation scores of the corresponding items, the new items with higher scores are recommended to users. Experiments on two representative real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method. The case study from the real-world verifies interpretability benefits brought by the dual-intent module and the new item reasoning module.",

            "abstract": "Graph similarity learning refers to calculating the similarity score between two graphs, which is required in many realistic applications, such as visual tracking, graph classification, and collaborative filtering. As most of the existing graph neural networks yield effective graph representations of a single graph, little effort has been made for jointly learning two graph representations and calculating their similarity score. In addition, existing unsupervised graph similarity learning methods are mainly clustering-based, which ignores the valuable information embodied in graph pairs. To this end, we propose a contrastive graph matching network (CGMN) for self-supervised graph similarity learning in order to calculate the similarity between any two input graph objects. Specifically, we generate two augmented views for each graph in a pair respectively. Then, we employ two strategies, namely cross-view interaction and cross-graph interaction, for effective node representation learning. The former is resorted to strengthen the consistency of node representations in two views. The latter is utilized to identify node differences between different graphs. Finally, we transform node representations into graph-level representations via pooling operations for graph similarity computation. We have evaluated CGMN on eight real-world datasets, and the experiment results show that the proposed new approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in graph similarity learning downstream tasks.",
