            "abstract": "Since its creation in 2016, the FoodOn food ontology has become an interconnected partner in various academic and government projects that span agricultural and public health domains. This paper examines recent data interoperability capabilities arising from food-related ontologies belonging to, or compatible with, the encyclopedic Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO) ontology platform, and how research organizations and industry might utilize them for their own projects or for data exchange. Projects are seeking standardized vocabulary across many food supply activities ranging from agricultural production, harvesting, preparation, food processing, marketing, distribution and consumption, as well as more indirect health, economic, food security and sustainability analysis and reporting tools. To satisfy this demand for controlled vocabulary requires establishing domain specific ontologies whose curators coordinate closely to produce recommended patterns for food system vocabulary.",

            "abstract": "Background: Ontologies are fundamental components of informatics infrastructure in domains such as biomedical, environmental, and food sciences, representing consensus knowledge in an accurate and computable form. However, their construction and maintenance demand substantial resources and necessitate substantial collaboration between domain experts, curators, and ontology experts. We present Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation of Ontologies using AI (DRAGON-AI), an ontology generation method employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). DRAGON-AI can generate textual and logical ontology components, drawing from existing knowledge in multiple ontologies and unstructured text sources. Results: We assessed performance of DRAGON-AI on de novo term construction across ten diverse ontologies, making use of extensive manual evaluation of results. Our method has high precision for relationship generation, but has slightly lower precision than from logic-based reasoning. Our method is also able to generate definitions deemed acceptable by expert evaluators, but these scored worse than human-authored definitions. Notably, evaluators with the highest level of confidence in a domain were better able to discern flaws in AI-generated definitions. We also demonstrated the ability of DRAGON-AI to incorporate natural language instructions in the form of GitHub issues. Conclusions: These findings suggest DRAGON-AI's potential to substantially aid the manual ontology construction process. However, our results also underscore the importance of having expert curators and ontology editors drive the ontology generation process.",

            "abstract": "The computational modeling of food processing, aimed at various applications including industrial automation, robotics, food safety, preservation, energy conservation, and recipe nutrition estimation, has been ongoing for decades within food science research labs, industry, and regulatory agencies. The datasets from this prior work have the potential to advance the field of data-driven modeling if they can be harmonized, but this requires a standardized language as a starting point. Our primary goal is to explore two interdependent aspects of this language: the granularity of process modeling sub-parts and parameter details and the substitution of compatible inputs and processes. A delicate semantic distinction\u2014categorizing planned processes based on the objectives they seek to fulfill vs. categorizing them by the actions or mechanisms they utilize\u2014helps organize and facilitate this endeavor. To bring an ontological lens to process modeling, we employ the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry ontological framework to organize two main classes of the FoodOn upper-level material processing hierarchy according to objective and mechanism, respectively. We include examples of material processing by mechanism, ranging from abstract ones such as \u201capplication of energy\u201d down to specific classes such as \u201cheating by microwave.\u201d Similarly, material processing by objective\u2014often a transformation to bring about materials with certain qualities or composition\u2014can, for example, range from \u201cmaterial processing by heating threshold\u201d to \u201csteaming rice\u201d.",

            "abstract": "The classification of occupations, key to policy development regarding the economy, education, research, organizational infrastructure, as well as health and safety analysis, has received considerable attention and development over the last half century. However, international and national standardized taxonomies, while very well executed, are dissimilar, dated and could benefit from a new organization employing ontological methods. This paper builds the case for the development of an Occupation Ontology, showing an approach that employs successful methods of the Open Biological and Biomedical (OBO) Foundry. The importance of occupations and their characterization is described, and four popular taxonomies available in English are presented and compared. We selected and transformed the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Standard Occupational Classification into a prototype OBO compliant ontology, designated OccO, to illustrate the presentation of occupational information as an ontology. OccO is then compared to the representation of occupations in the fastest growing semantic web knowledge base, Wikidata, where occupations are organized neither in compliance with any standard taxonomy nor with a consistent upper level ontological framework. We then present the benefits of developing an ontology-driven occupational framework. This development is at the alpha stage, with the hope that the concept of an occupation ontology will gain the support of research organizations who could cooperate to formulate and demonstrate the utility of a well-designed and widely used ontology for occupations.",

            "abstract": "Huge advances in peer-to-peer systems and attempts to develop the semantic web have revealed a critical issue in information systems across multiple domains: the absence of semantic interoperability. Today, businesses operating in a digital environment require increased supply-chain automation, interoperability, and data governance. While research on the semantic web and interoperability has recently received much attention, a dearth of studies investigates the relationship between these two concepts in depth. To address this knowledge gap, the objective of this study is to conduct a review and bibliometric analysis of 3511 Scopus-registered papers on the semantic web and interoperability published over the past two decades. In addition, the publications were analyzed using a variety of bibliometric indicators, such as publication year, journal, authors, countries, and institutions. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation networks were utilized to identify the primary research hotspots and group the relevant literature. The findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate the dominance of conference papers as a means of disseminating knowledge and the substantial contribution of developed nations to the semantic web field. In addition, the keyword co-occurrence network analysis reveals a significant emphasis on semantic web languages, sensors and computing, graphs and models, and linking and integration techniques. Based on the co-citation clustering, the Internet of Things, semantic web services, ontology mapping, building information modeling, bioinformatics, education and e-learning, and semantic web languages were identified as the primary themes contributing to the flow of knowledge and the growth of the semantic web and interoperability field. Overall, this review substantially contributes to the literature and increases scholars\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 awareness of the current knowledge composition and future research directions of the semantic web field.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; card.mcmaster.ca) combines the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) with curated AMR gene (ARG) sequences and resistance-conferring mutations to provide an informatics framework for annotation and interpretation of resistomes. As of version 3.2.4, CARD encompasses 6627 ontology terms, 5010 reference sequences, 1933 mutations, 3004 publications, and 5057 AMR detection models that can be used by the accompanying Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software to annotate genomic or metagenomic sequences. Focused curation enhancements since 2020 include expanded \u03b2-lactamase curation, incorporation of likelihood-based AMR mutations for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, addition of disinfectants and antiseptics plus their associated ARGs, and systematic curation of resistance-modifying agents. This expanded curation includes 180 new AMR gene families, 15 new drug classes, 1 new resistance mechanism, and two new ontological relationships: evolutionary_variant_of and is_small_molecule_inhibitor. In silico prediction of resistomes and prevalence statistics of ARGs has been expanded to 377 pathogens, 21,079 chromosomes, 2,662 genomic islands, 41,828 plasmids and 155,606 whole-genome shotgun assemblies, resulting in collation of 322,710 unique ARG allele sequences. New features include the CARD:Live collection of community submitted isolate resistome data and the introduction of standardized 15 character CARD Short Names for ARGs to support machine learning efforts.",

In this paper, we present a semi-automated ROBOT template-driven approach we designed for aligning FoodOn with the FDA issued 'Seafood List\u2019, together with other established resources e.g., NCBI, ITIS, and Wikipedia. The basic data in the FDA Seafood List, which included Type, Common Name, FDA Law, FDA Acceptable Market Name(s) and Scientific Name was exported in an Excel format. FDA Seafood Labels (Scientific Name) were mapped against NCBITaxons and NCBI GenBank Names using ETE 3 toolkit and around 90% of labels were correctly matched. ITIS TSNs were available for over 85% of seafood labels which were fetched using a locally installed ITIS database. Wikipedia-URL was retrieved as a cross-referenced database using the FoodOn-Wikipedia tool. In some cases, Wikidata was also used as an interface to connect to NCBITaxon. The curated seafood data was then converted from a tab-delimited TSV template file to a Web Ontology Language OWL file format using ROBOT template. This method will not only help FoodOn to regularly update seafood organisms but will also help to maximize the seafood product coverage and data interoperability.",

            "abstract": "Biological ontologies are used to organize, curate, and interpret the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments. While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application, and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology\u2019s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data FAIR.",

            "abstract": "An application ontology often reuses terms from other related, compatible, upper-level or domain-specific ontologies. The extent of this interconnectedness is not readily apparent when browsing through larger textual presentations of term class hierarchies, be it Manchester text format OWL files or as presented in an ontology editor like Stanford Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, where one either mentally notes the location or frequency of ontology prefixes in term identifiers as the encompassing ontology is browsed, or one selects an ontology import file to view individually, out of context of the whole. Interconnectedness may be easier to perceive in two-dimensional hierarchical graphs that visually code ontology term origins, but canvass size and multiple inheritance links that break tree layouts become challenging at scale. We present OntoTrek, a visualization tool that explores the benefits of interactive threedimensional class hierarchy presentation. Our aim is to develop features, such as a consistent visual shape for ontologies based on the upper level ontology they subscribe to, that enable data project stakeholders to more quickly learn and appreciate the content domains of imported terms, ultimately illustrating how projects can describe knowledge through a vocabulary of interwoven communitysupported ontology resources.",
