            "abstract": "The Common European Language Data Space (LDS) is an integral part of the EU data strategy, which aims at developing a single market for data. Its decentralised technical infrastructure and governance scheme are currently being developed by the LDS project, which also has dedicated tasks for proof-of-concept prototypes, handling legal aspects, raising awareness and promoting the LDS through events and social media channels. The LDS is part of a broader vision for establishing all necessary components to develop European large language models.",

We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

We devise five different levels (of increasing complexity) of platform interoperability that we suggest to implement in a wider federation of AI/LT platforms. We illustrate the approach using the five emerging AI/LT platforms AI4EU, ELG, Lynx, QURATOR and SPEAKER.",

            "abstract": "With 24 official EU and many additional languages, multilingualism in Europe and an inclusive Digital Single Market can only be enabled through Language Technologies (LTs). European LT business is dominated by hundreds of SMEs and a few large players. Many are world-class, with technologies that outperform the global players. However, European LT business is also fragmented \u2013 by nation states, languages, verticals and sectors, significantly holding back its impact. The European Language Grid (ELG) project addresses this fragmentation by establishing the ELG as the primary platform for LT in Europe. The ELG is a scalable cloud platform, providing, in an easy-to-integrate way, access to hundreds of commercial and non-commercial LTs for all European languages, including running tools and services as well as data sets and resources. Once fully operational, it will enable the commercial and non-commercial European LT community to deposit and upload their technologies and data sets into the ELG, to deploy them through the grid, and to connect with other resources. The ELG will boost the Multilingual Digital Single Market towards a thriving European LT community, creating new jobs and opportunities. Furthermore, the ELG project organises two open calls for up to 20 pilot projects. It also sets up 32 national competence centres and the European LT Council for outreach and coordination purposes.",

            "abstract": "The current scientific and technological landscape is characterised by the increasing availability of data resources and processing tools and services. In this setting, metadata have emerged as a key factor facilitating management, sharing and usage of such digital assets. In this paper we present ELG-SHARE, a rich metadata schema catering for the description of Language Resources and Technologies (processing and generation services and tools, models, corpora, term lists, etc.), as well as related entities (e.g., organizations, projects, supporting documents, etc.). The schema powers the European Language Grid platform that aims to be the primary hub and marketplace for industry-relevant Language Technology in Europe. ELG-SHARE has been based on various metadata schemas, vocabularies, and ontologies, as well as related recommendations and guidelines.",

Linkzoo is an IT infrastructure for collaborative publishing, annotating and sharing of Data Web resources, and their publication as Linked Data. In this paper, we overview LinkZoo and its main components, and we focus on the search facilities provided to retrieve and explore RDF resources. Two search services are presented: (1) an interactive, two-step keyword search service, where live natural language query suggestions are given to the user based on the input keywords and the resource types they match within LinkZoo, and (2) a keyword search service for exploring remote SPARQL endpoints that automatically generates a set of candidate SPARQL queries, i.e., SPARQL queries that try to capture user\u00e2??s information needs as expressed by the keywords used. Finally, we demonstrate the search functionalities through a use case drawn from the life sciences domain.",

            "abstract": "The Linked Data paradigm involves practices to publish, share, and connect data on the Web. Thus, it is a compelling approach for the dissemination and re-use of scientific data, realizing the vision of the so-called Linked Science. However, by just converting legacy scientific data as Linked Data, we do not fully meet the requirements of data re-use. Scientific data is evolving data. To ensure re-use and allow exploitation and validation of scientific results, several challenges related to scientific data dynamics should be tackled. In this paper, we deal with the publication of diachronic life science linked data. We propose a change model based on RDF to capture versioned entities. Based on this model we convert legacy data from biological databases as diachronic linked data. Our linked data server can assist biologists to explore biological entities and their evolution by either using SPARQL queries or navigating among entity versions.
