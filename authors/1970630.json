            "abstract": "Structured Declarative Language (SDL) emerges as a powerful tool for addressing the complexities of combinatorial search and optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce SDL as a higher-level abstraction that provides a clear and intuitive specification language, with its semantics defined through translation into Answer Set Programming (ASP). SDL offers several advantages over directly writing in ASP, including flexibility in attribute handling, improved code readability, and enhanced error tolerance. Key features of SDL include the irrelevance of attribute order, seamless management of attribute arity changes, and the use of qualifying names for attribute access. Additionally, SDL incorporates features such as automatic attribute tracking and type differentiation, contributing to a more intuitive and reliable problem-solving process.",

The schedule of the patients should consider the different requirements of the patients and the available resources, e.g., varying time required for different diseases and radiopharmaceuticals used, number of injection chairs, and tomographs available.

Being able to efficiently solve such problem is of upmost importance, in particular after the COVID-19 pandemic that significantly increased rehabilitation\u2019s needs. In this paper, we present a two-phase solution to rehabilitation scheduling based on Answer Set Programming, which proved to be an effective tool for solving practical scheduling problems. We first present a general encoding and then add domain-specific optimizations. Results of experiments performed on both synthetic and real benchmarks, the latter provided by ICS Maugeri, show the effectiveness of our solution as well as the impact of our domain-specific optimizations.",

It is a challenging problem given it is subject to many constraints, like to determine the start time of different surgeries and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in different units. In the last years, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has been successfully employed for addressing and solving the ORS problem. However, due to the inherent difficulty of retrieving real data, all the analysis on ORS encodings have been performed on synthetic data so far. In this paper, instead, we deal with the real case of ASL1 Liguria, and present adaptations of the ASP encodings to include real requirements of such case. Further, we analyze the resulting encodings on these real data. Results on some scenarios show that the ASP solutions produce satisfying results also when tested on real, challenging data",

            "abstract": "The scheduling of periodic treatments consists of planning a care path over a period of several weeks, in which patients have to perform different treatments respecting a certain periodicity. Treatments must be assigned to a day taking into account patients\u2019 preferences, operators\u2019 availability, the possibility of needing instruments/machinery, and of having different facilities in which operators can work and move around during the working time. This problem has been formulated to have a certain degree of flexibility and to be suitable for different contexts where periodicity is required, e.g. rehabilitation or planning a cycle of drug therapies. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). We consider two different possible scenarios: scheduling one patient at a time, and scheduling blocks of patients. We have also conducted an experimental analysis showing that ASP is a suitable solution to this problem.",

Although ASP has gained widespread acceptance in academic and industrial contexts, there are certain user groups who may find it more advantageous to employ a higher-level language that closely resembles natural language when specifying ASP programs. In this paper, we propose a novel tool, called CNL2ASP, for translating English sentences expressed in a controlled natural language (CNL) form into ASP. In particular, we first provide a definition of the type of sentences allowed by our CNL and their translation as ASP rules and then exemplify the usage of the CNL for the specification of both synthetic and real-world combinatorial problems. Finally, we report the results of an experimental analysis conducted on the real-world problems to compare the performance of automatically generated encodings with the ones written by ASP practitioners, showing that our tool can obtain satisfactory performance on these benchmarks.",

Vehicles can communicate their destination, and receive an optimised route by traffic controllers. While the benefits of traffic routing are clear, it is also clear that re-routing has the potential to increase risks for vehicles' and passengers' safety due to environmental or urban factors. There is however a lack of work in the area of risk-aware routing. To fill the above-mentioned gap, we introduce a framework to incorporate risk-awareness in the vehicle routing process. The proposed framework provides a principled structure to define and characterise different classes of risk that can arise in a region, allowing to take them into account when generating routes. We show how this framework can be implemented, and we provide an empirical analysis of its performance on two European urban areas.",

            "abstract": "Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative programming language for solving hard combinatorial problems. Albeit ASP has been widely adopted in both academic and industrial contexts, it might be difficult for people who are not familiar with logic programming conventions to use it. In this paper, we propose a translation of English sentences expressed in a controlled natural language (CNL) form into ASP. In particular, we first provide a definition of the type of sentences allowed by our CNL and their translation as ASP rules, and then exemplify the usage of CNL for the specification of well-known combinatorial problems.",
