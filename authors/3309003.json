            "abstract": "Recommender systems significantly impact user experience across diverse domains, yet existing frameworks often prioritize offline evaluation metrics, neglecting the crucial integration of A/B testing for forward-looking assessments. In response, this paper introduces a new framework seamlessly incorporating A/B testing into the Cornac recommendation library. Leveraging a diverse collection of model implementations in Cornac, our framework enables effortless A/B testing experiment setup from offline trained models. We introduce a carefully designed dashboard and a robust backend for efficient logging and analysis of user feedback. This not only streamlines the A/B testing process but also enhances the evaluation of recommendation models in an online environment. Demonstrating the simplicity of on-demand online model evaluations, our work contributes to advancing recommender system evaluation methodologies, underscoring the significance of A/B testing and providing a practical framework for implementation. The framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/PreferredAI/cornac-ab.",

On the one hand, though Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising ability to derive effective embeddings for networked documents, they do not assume latent topics, resulting in uninterpretahle embeddings. On the other hand, topic models can infer interpretable document representations. However, most topic models focus on plain text and fail to leverage network structure across documents. In this paper, we propose a GNN-based topic model that both captures network connection and derives semantically interpretable text representations. For network modeling, we build our model with Optimal Transport Barycenter. For semantic interpretability, we extend optimal transport with pre-trained word embeddings.",

            "abstract": "Question-answering (QA) retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant answer to a given question from a collection of answers. Various approaches to QA retrieval have been developed recently. One successful and popular model is Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT (ColBERT), a transformer-based approach that adopts a query-document scoring mechanism that retains the granularity of transformer matching, whilst improving on efficiency. However, one key limitation is that it requires further fine-tuning for new query or collection types. In this work, we explore and propose several non-parametric retrieval augmentation methods based on explicit signals of term importance that improve over ColBERT's baseline performance. In particular, we consider the QA retrieval task in the context of StackExchange question-answering forum, verifying the effectiveness of our methods in this setting.",

            "abstract": "Similarity joins on multidimensional data are crucial operators for recommendation purposes. The classic \ud835\udf16 -join problem finds all pairs of points within \ud835\udf16 distance to each other among two \ud835\udc51 -dimensional datasets. In this paper, we consider a novel and alternative version of \ud835\udf16 -join named community similarity based on user profile joins (CSJ). The aim of CSJ problem is, given two communities having a set of \ud835\udc51 -dimensional users, to find how similar are the communities by matching every single pair of users (a user can be matched with at most one other user) having an absolute difference of at most \ud835\udf16 per dimension. Each dimension in each user vector stores a counter that measures the number of user preferences to a concrete general topic. CSJ uses low \ud835\udf16 and applies the strict condition per dimension so as to really find similar user profiles among two communities. CSJ applies to a number of cases in which the popular community detection and community search problems do not suit. This happens since CSJ treats existing communities as brands of a specific commercial value and does not search to form general communities as prior works do; these two community types semantically differ. Also, CSJ does not rely its execution on social or/and physical links among community users, instead, it only focus on the similarity of user profiles . We deploy a suite of 6 methods to solve CSJ; 3 approximate and 3 exact algorithms. We evaluate our solutions to meaningful case studies of real and synthetic datasets having different characteristics. Our experimental results show interesting and diverse conclusions of CSJ applicability to realistic scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Text documents are usually connected in a graph structure, resulting in an important class of data named text-attributed graph, e.g., paper citation graph and Web page hyperlink graph. On the one hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) consider text in each document as general vertex attribute and do not specifically deal with text data. On the other hand, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Topic Models (TMs) learn effective document embeddings. However, most models focus on text content in each single document only, ignoring link adjacency across documents. The above two challenges motivate the development of text-attributed graph representation learning, combining GNNs with PLMs and TMs into a unified model and learning document embeddings preserving both modalities, which fulfill applications, e.g., text classification, citation recommendation, question answering, etc. In this lecture-style tutorial, we will provide a systematic review of text-attributed graph, including its formal definition, recent methods, diverse applications, and challenges. Specifically, i) we will formally define text-attributed graph and briefly review GNNs, PLMs, and TMs, which are the fundamentals of some existing methods. ii) We will then revisit the technical details of text-attributed graph models, which are generally split into two categories, PLM-based and TM-based. iii) Besides, we will show diverse applications built on text-attributed graph. iv) Finally, we will discuss some challenges of existing models and propose solutions for future research.",

            "abstract": "How can we adapt the composition of a post over a series of rounds to make it more appealing in a social network? Techniques that progressively learn how to make a fixed post more influential over rounds have been studied in the context of the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which seeks a set of seed users that maximize a post\u2019s influence. However, there is no work on progressively learning how a post\u2019s features affect its influence. In this article, we propose and study the problem of Adaptive Content-Aware Influence Maximization (ACAIM), which calls to find k features to form a post in each round so as to maximize the cumulative influence of those posts over all rounds. We solve ACAIM by applying, for the first time, an Online Learning to Rank (OLR) framework for IM purposes. We introduce the CATRID propagation model, which expresses how posts disseminate in a social network using click probabilities and post visibility criteria and develop a simulator that runs CATRID via a training-testing scheme based on real posts of the VK social network, so as to realistically represent the learning environment. We deploy three learners that solve ACAIM in an online (real-time) manner. We experimentally prove the practical suitability of our solutions via exhaustive experiments on multiple brands (operating as different case studies) and several VK datasets; the best learner is evaluated on 45 separate case studies yielding convincing results.",

            "abstract": "Text documents are often interconnected in a network structure, e.g., academic papers via citations, Web pages via hyperlinks. On the one hand, though Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising ability to derive effective embeddings for such networked documents, they do not assume a latent topic structure and result in uninterpretable embeddings. On the other hand, topic models can infer semantically interpretable topic distributions for documents by associating each topic with a group of understandable key words. However, most topic models mainly focus on plain text within documents and fail to leverage network structure across documents. Network connectivity reveals topic similarity between linked documents, and modeling it could uncover meaningful semantics. Motivated by above two challenges, in this paper, we propose a GNN-based neural topic model that both captures network connectivity and derives semantically interpretable topic distributions for networked documents. For network modeling, we build the model based on the theory of Optimal Transport Barycenter, which captures network structure by allowing the topic distribution of a document to generate the content of its linked neighbors. For semantic interpretability, we extend optimal transport by incorporating semantically related words in the embedding space. Since Dirichlet prior in Latent Dirichlet Allocation successfully improves topic quality, we also analyze Dirichlet as an optimal transport prior distribution to improve topic interpretability. We design rejection sampling to simulate Dirichlet distribution. Extensive experiments on document classification, clustering, link prediction, and topic analysis verify the effectiveness of our model.",

            "abstract": "Variational Autoencoder (VAE) offers a non-linear probabilistic modeling of user's preferences. While it has achieved remarkable performance at collaborative filtering, it typically samples a single vector for representing user's preferences, which may be insufficient to capture the user's diverse interests. Existing solutions extend VAE to model multiple interests of users by resorting a variant of self-attentive method, i.e., employing prototypes to group items into clusters, each capturing one topic of user's interests. Despite showing improvements, the current design could be more effective since prototypes are randomly initialized and shared across users, resulting in uninformative and non-personalized clusters. To fill the gap, firstly, we introduce iterative latent attention for personalized item grouping into VAE framework to infer multiple interests of users. Secondly, we propose to incorporate implicit differentiation to improve training of our iterative refinement model. Thirdly, we study the self-attention to refine cluster prototypes for item grouping, which is largely ignored by existing works. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate stronger performance of our method over those of baselines.",

            "abstract": "A recommender system operates in a dynamic environment where new items emerge and new users join the system, resulting in ever-growing user-item interactions over time. Existing works either assume a model trained offline on a static dataset (requiring periodic re-training with ever larger datasets); or an online learning setup that favors recency over history. As privacy-aware users could hide their histories, the loss of older information means that periodic retraining may not always be feasible, while online learning may lose sight of users\u2019 long-term preferences. In this work, we adopt a continual learning perspective to collaborative filtering, by compartmentalizing users and items over time into a notion of tasks. Of particular concern is to mitigate catastrophic forgetting that occurs when the model would reduce performance for older users and items in prior tasks even as it tries to fit the newer users and items in the current task. To alleviate this, we propose a method that leverages gradient alignment to deliver a model that is more compatible across tasks and maximizes user agreement for better user representations to improve long-term recommendations.",

We leverage textual content as a source of interpretability in content-aware recommender systems. The goal is to characterize user preferences with a set of human-understandable attributes, each is described by a single word, enabling comprehension of user interests behind item adoptions. This is achieved via a dedicated architecture, which is interpretable by design, involving two components for recommendation and interpretation. In particular, we seek an interpreter, which accepts holistic user\u2019s representation from a recommender to output a set of activated attributes describing user preferences. Besides encoding interpretability properties such as fidelity, conciseness and diversity, the proposed memory network-based interpreter enables the generalization of user representation by discovering relevant attributes that go beyond her adopted items\u2019 textual content. We design experiments involving both human- and functionally-grounded evaluations of interpretability. Results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed model not only discovers highly relevant attributes for interpreting user preferences, but also enjoys comparable or better recommendation accuracy than a series of baselines.",
