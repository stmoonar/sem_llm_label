            "title": "2nd International Workshop on Industrial Recommendation Systems (IRS)",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems are used widely across many industries, such as e-commerce, multimedia content platforms and social networks, to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume or connect; thus, improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry and research organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, which has resulted in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on the performance of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, it often neglects key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform in a real-world environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: business metric definition and evaluation, recommendation quality control, data and model scalability, model interpretability, model robustness and fairness, and resource limitations, such as computing and memory resources budgets, engineering workforce cost, etc. The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the broad applicability of many of academia's contributions for industrial recommendation systems. This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia and industry. Its goal is to serve as a venue through which academic researchers become aware of the additional factors that may affect the adoption of an algorithm into real production systems, and how well it will perform if deployed. Industrial researchers will also benefit from sharing the practical insights, approaches, and frameworks as well.",

            "abstract": "AbstractEffective knowledge sharing between communities of knowledge workers impacts the productivity, innovation and competitiveness of organizations. The emergence of Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology has provided some solutions to knowledge sharing amongst peers. In this paper we present a sophisticated Agent-based Semantic Knowledge network\u2014ASKnet\u2014that features a unique combination of mobile agents, semantic web and semantic overlay networks to realize an effective knowledge sharing environment. ASKnet enables the sharing of personalized knowledge repositories\u2014typically documents thematically organized by a knowledge worker\u2014of individual knowledge workers with the entire community. The premise here is that if we trust the intellectual ability of the knowledge worker then his/her personalized knowledge repository can be regarded as a source of best-quality, relevant and validated knowledge for that domain/organization.",
