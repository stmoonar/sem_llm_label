            "title": "Measuring Geographic Diversity of Foundation Models with a Natural Language-based Geo-guessing Experiment on GPT-4",
            "abstract": "Abstract. Generative AI based on foundation models provides a first glimpse into the world represented by machines trained on vast amounts of multimodal data ingested by these models during training. If we consider the resulting models as knowledge bases in their own right, this may open up new avenues for understanding places through the lens of machines. In this work, we adopt this thinking and select GPT-4, a state-of-the-art representative in the family of multimodal large language models, to study its geographic diversity regarding how well geographic features are represented. Using DBpedia abstracts as a ground-truth corpus for probing, our natural language\u2013based geo-guessing experiment shows that GPT-4 may currently encode insufficient knowledge about several geographic feature types on a global level. On a local level, we observe not only this insufficiency but also inter-regional disparities in GPT-4\u2019s geo-guessing performance on UNESCO World Heritage Sites that carry significance to both local and global populations, and the inter-regional disparities may become smaller as the geographic scale increases. Morever, whether assessing the geo-guessing performance on a global or local level, we find inter-model disparities in GPT-4\u2019s geo-guessing performance when comparing its unimodal and multimodal variants. We hope this work can initiate a discussion on geographic diversity as an ethical principle within the GIScience community in the face of global socio-technical challenges.\n",

            "title": "Towards Formalizing Concept Drift and Its Variants: A Case Study Using Past COSIT Proceedings (Short Paper)",
            "abstract": "In the classic Philosophical Investigations , Ludwig Wittgenstein suggests that the meaning of words is rooted in their use in ordinary language, challenging the idea of fixed rules determining the meaning of words. Likewise, we believe that the meaning of keywords and concepts in academic papers is shaped by their usage within the articles and evolves as research progresses. For example, the terms natural hazards and natural disasters were once used interchangeably, but this is rarely the case today. When searching for archived documents, such as those related to disaster relief, choosing the appropriate keyword is crucial and requires a deeper understanding of the historical context. To improve interoperability and promote reusability from a Research Data Management (RDM) perspective, we examine the dynamic nature of concepts, providing formal definitions of concept drift and its variants. By employing a case study of past COSIT (Conference on Spatial Information Theory) proceedings to support these definitions, we argue that a quantitative formalization can help systematically detect subsequent changes and enhance the overall interpretation of concepts. 2012 ACM",

            "title": "A Formal Framework for Disaster Risk Properties",
            "abstract": "Disaster risk properties (or disaster variables) such as intensity, exposure, severity, vulnerability, resilience, and capacity are significant because they provide essential information for understanding and managing disaster risk and cascading effects. While there are an increasing number of datasets that record these properties based on different criteria, such as regional levels (e.g., community resilience at counties vs. census tracts), thematic levels (e.g., social vulnerability based on race vs. socioeconomic status), or even for different hazard types (e.g., disaster risk for earthquakes vs. hurricanes), we lack a formal model that captures the semantics of these properties, i.e., their interactions with one another, and their context. Context is described through relations that constrain each property specific to an entity or as a property of an entity with respect to another entity. For example, intensity is exclusively the property of a disaster event, whereas vulnerability is a property of an element-at-risk concerning a specific hazard type. Here, we propose the Disaster Properties Ontology (DPO) that formalizes seven core properties in the disaster domain. It is built by re-using existing standard ontologies such as OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL, SOSA, and PROV-O. Additionally, DPO is developed as a sub-module of a more comprehensive Disaster Management reference Domain Ontology (DMDO).",

            "abstract": "It is crucial for emergency management organizations to have rapid access to relevant experts who can advise and assist following a disaster. To improve expert-mining and recommendation capabilities, creating a knowledge graph that links experts to their corresponding topics of expertise and other sources of relevant information is a natural choice to capture an integrated network of people and a rich taxonomy of expertise. In this paper, we present an ontology for modeling experts, their expertise topics and relations between them, and their spatiotemporal scoping. We go on to discuss the primary conceptual components and how they can be instantiated, then present overarching examples related to emergency management operations. The ontology synthesizes three different ways to characterize an expert, based on a) identifiable academic expertise; b) voluntary engagements, work-related responsibilities or experience; and c) organization specializations or affiliations.",
