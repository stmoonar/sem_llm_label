            "title": "Time Series Segmentation as a Discovery Tool - A Case Study of the US and Japanese Financial Markets",
            "abstract": "In this paper we explain how the dynamics of a complex system can be understood in terms of the lowdimensional manifolds (phases), described by slowly varying effective variables, it settles onto. We then explain how we can discover these phases by grouping the large number of microscopic time series or time series segments, based on their statistical similarities, into the a small number of time series classes, each representing a distinct phase. We describe a specific recursive scheme for time series segmentation based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and check its performance against artificial time series data. We then apply the method on the high-frequency time series data of various US and Japanese financial market indices, where we found that the time series segments can be very naturally grouped into four to six classes, corresponding roughly with economic growth, economic crisis, market correction, and market crash. From a single time series, we can estimate the lifetimes of these macroeconomic phases, and also identify potential triggers for each phase transition. From a cross section of time series, we can further estimate the transition times, and also arrive at an unbiased and detailed picture of how financial markets react to internal or external stimuli.",
