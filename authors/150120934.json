            "title": "Integrating omics databases for enhanced crop breeding",
            "abstract": "Abstract Crop plant breeding involves selecting and developing new plant varieties with desirable traits such as increased yield, improved disease resistance, and enhanced nutritional value. With the development of high-throughput technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, crop breeding has entered a new era. However, to effectively use these technologies, integration of multi-omics data from different databases is required. Integration of omics data provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes underlying plant traits and their interactions. This review highlights the importance of integrating omics databases in crop plant breeding, discusses available omics data and databases, describes integration challenges, and highlights recent developments and potential benefits. Taken together, the integration of omics databases is a critical step towards enhancing crop plant breeding and improving global food security.",

            "title": "CropGF: a comprehensive visual platform for crop gene family mining and analysis",
            "abstract": "Abstract A gene family refers to a group of genes that share a common ancestry and encode proteins or RNA molecules with similar functions or structural features. Gene families play a crucial role in determining the traits of plants and can be utilized to develop new crop varieties. Therefore, a comprehensive database of gene family is significant for gaining deep insight into crops. To address this need, we have developed CropGF (https://bis.zju.edu.cn/cropgf), a comprehensive visual platform that encompasses six important crops (rice, wheat, maize, barley, sorghum and foxtail millet) and one model plant (Arabidopsis), as well as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data for gene family mining and analysis, covering a total of 314\u2009611 genes and 4399 types of domains. CropGF provides a versatile search system that allows for the identification of gene families and their members in a single crop or multiple crops. Users can customize their search based on gene family domains and/or homology using keywords or BLAST. To enhance usability, we have collected the corresponding ID information from various public databases for both genes and domains. Furthermore, CropGF comprises numerous downstream analysis modules, such as ka/ks analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, subcellular localization analysis and more. These visually-displayed modules provide intuitive insights into gene expression patterns, gene family expansion and functional relationships across different molecular levels and different species. We believe that CropGF will be a valuable resource for deep mining and analysis in future studies of crop gene families. Database URL https://bis.zju.edu.cn/cropgf",
