            "title": "KMF: Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted Representation Learning for Zero-Shot Node Classification",
            "abstract": "Recently, Zero-Shot Node Classification (ZNC) has been an emerging and crucial task in graph data analysis. This task aims to predict nodes from unseen classes which are unobserved in the training process. Existing work mainly utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to associate features' prototypes and labels' semantics thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. However, the multi-faceted semantic orientation in the feature-semantic alignment has been neglected by previous work, i.e. the content of a node usually covers diverse topics that are relevant to the semantics of multiple labels. It's necessary to separate and judge the semantic factors that tremendously affect the cognitive ability to improve the generality of models. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted framework (KMF) that enhances the richness of label semantics via the extracted KG (Knowledge Graph)-based topics. And then the content of each node is reconstructed to a topic-level representation that offers multi-faceted and fine-grained semantic relevancy to different labels. Due to the particularity of the graph's instance (i.e., node) representation, a novel geometric constraint is developed to alleviate the problem of prototype drift caused by node information aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several public graph datasets and design an application of zero-shot cross-domain recommendation. The quantitative results demonstrate both the effectiveness and generalization of KMF with the comparison of state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Online local-life service platforms provide services like nearby daily essentials and food delivery for hundreds of millions of users. Different from other types of recommender systems, local-life service recommendation has the following characteristics: (1) spatiotemporal periodicity, which means a user's preferences for items vary from different locations at different times. (2) spatiotemporal collaborative signal, which indicates similar users have similar preferences at specific locations and times. However, most existing methods either focus on merely the spatiotemporal contexts in sequences, or model the user-item interactions without spatiotemporal contexts in graphs. To address this issue, we design a new method named SPCS in this paper. Specifically, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph transformer (SGT) layer, which explicitly encodes relative spatiotemporal contexts, and aggregates the information from multi-hop neighbors to unify spatiotemporal periodicity and collaborative signal. With extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets, this paper validates the state-of-the-art performance of SPCS.",

Despite the advances in dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs), the rich information and diverse downstream tasks have posed significant difficulties for the practical application of DGNNs in industrial scenarios. To this end, in this paper, we propose to address them by pre-training and present the Contrastive Pre-Training Method for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (CPDG). CPDG tackles the challenges of pre-training for DGNNs, including generalization capability and long-short term modeling capability, through a flexible structural-temporal subgraph sampler along with structural-temporal contrastive pre-training schemes. Extensive experiments conducted on both large-scale research and industrial dynamic graph datasets show that CPDG outperforms existing methods in dynamic graph pre-training for various downstream tasks under three transfer settings.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability.",

            "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is an effective way to alleviate the data sparsity problem. Content-based CDR is one of the most promising branches since most kinds of products can be described by a piece of text, especially when cold-start users or items have few interactions. However, two vital issues are still under-explored: (1) From the content modeling perspective, sufficient long-text descriptions are usually scarce in a real recommender system, more often the light-weight textual features, such as a few keywords or tags, are more accessible, which is improperly modeled by existing methods. (2) From the CDR perspective, not all inter-domain interests are helpful to infer intra-domain interests. Caused by domain-specific features, there are part of signals benefiting for recommendation in the source domain but harmful for that in the target domain. Therefore, how to distill useful interests is crucial. To tackle the above two problems, we propose a metapath and multi-interest aggregated graph neural network (M2GNN). Specifically, to model the tag-based contents, we construct a heterogeneous information network to hold the semantic relatedness between users, items, and tags in all domains. The metapath schema is predefined according to domain-specific knowledge, with one metapath for one domain. User representations are learned by GNN with a hierarchical aggregation framework, where the intra-metapath aggregation firstly filters out trivial tags and the inter-metapath aggregation further filters out useless interests. Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that M2GNN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods and current industrial recommender system in Dianping, respectively. Further analysis shows that M2GNN offers an interpretable recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation is a widely studied paradigm for learning users' dynamic interests from historical interactions for predicting the next potential item. Although lots of research work has achieved remarkable progress, they are still plagued by the common issues: data sparsity of limited supervised signals and data noise of accidentally clicking. To this end, several works have attempted to address these issues, which ignored the complex association of items across several sequences. Along this line, with the aim of learning representative item embedding to alleviate this dilemma, we propose GUESR, from the view of graph contrastive learning. Specifically, we first construct the Global Item Relationship Graph (GIRG) from all interaction sequences and present the Bucket-Cluster Sampling (BCS) method to conduct the sub-graphs. Then, graph contrastive learning on this reduced graph is developed to enhance item representations with complex associations from the global view. We subsequently extend the CapsNet module with the elaborately introduced target-attention mechanism to derive users' dynamic preferences. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated our proposed GUESR could not only achieve significant improvements but also could be regarded as a general enhancement strategy to improve the performance in combination with other sequential recommendation methods.",

With this clear optimization objective, the deduced GNNs architecture has sound theoretical foundation, which is able to flexibly remedy the weakness of GNNs. However, this optimization objective is only proved for GNNs with single-relational graph. Can we infer a new type of GNNs for multi-relational graphs by extending this optimization objective, so as to simultaneously solve the issues in previous multi-relational GNNs, e.g., over-parameterization? In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble multi-relational GNNs by designing an ensemble multi-relational (EMR) optimization objective. This EMR optimization objective is able to derive an iterative updating rule, which can be formalized as an ensemble message passing (EnMP) layer with multi-relations. We further analyze the nice properties of EnMP layer, e.g., the relationship with multi-relational personalized PageRank. Finally, a new multi-relational GNNs which well alleviate the over-smoothing and over-parameterization issues are proposed. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Candidate generation task requires that candidates related to user interests need to be extracted in realtime. Previous works usually transform a user's behavior sequence to a unified embedding, which can not reflect the user's multiple interests. Some recent works like Comirec and Octopus use multi-channel structures to capture users' diverse interests. They cluster users' historical behaviors into several groups, claiming that one group represents one interest. However, these methods have some limitations. First, an item may correspond to multiple interests of users, thereby simply allocating it to just one interest group will make the modeling of users' interests coarse-grained and inaccurate. Second, explaining user interests at the level of items is rather vague and not convincing. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Enhanced Multi-Interest Network: KEMI, which exploits knowledge graphs to help learn users' diverse interest representations via heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) and a novel dual memory network. Specifically, we use HGNNs to capture the semantic representation of knowledge entities and a novel dual memory network to learn a user's diverse interests from his behavior sequence. Through memory slots of the user memory network and the item memory network, we can learn multiple interests for each user and each item. Meanwhile, by binding the entities to the channels of memory networks, we enable it to be explained from the perspective of the knowledge graph, which enhances the interpretability and understanding of user interests. We conduct extensive experiments on two industrial and publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have been a mainstream approach for reasoning over incomplete KGs. However, limited by their inherently shallow and static architectures, they can hardly deal with the rising focus on complex logical queries, which comprise logical operators, imputed edges, multiple source entities, and unknown intermediate entities. In this work, we present the Knowledge Graph Transformer (kgTransformer) with masked pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. We design a KG triple transformation method to enable Transformer to handle KGs, which is further strengthened by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) sparse activation. We then formulate the complex logical queries as masked prediction and introduce a two-stage masked pre-training strategy to improve transferability and generalizability.Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that kgTransformer can consistently outperform both KG embedding-based baselines and advanced encoders on nine in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, kgTransformer can reason with explainability via providing the full reasoning paths to interpret given answers.",

            "abstract": "Cross-domain sentiment classification (CDSC) aims to use the transferable semantics learned from the source domain to predict the sentiment of reviews in the unlabeled target domain. Existing studies in this task attach more attention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich domain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (i.e., the part-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of exploring characteristics of language comprehension, adaptive graph representations have played an essential role in recent years. To this end, in the paper, we aim to explore the possibility of learning invariant semantic features from graph-like structures in CDSC. Specifically, we present Graph Adaptive Semantic Transfer (GAST) model, an adaptive syntactic graph embedding method that is able to learn domain-invariant semantics from both word sequences and syntactic graphs. More specifically, we first raise a POS-Transformer module to extract sequential semantic features from the word sequences as well as the part-of-speech tags. Then, we design a Hybrid Graph Attention (HGAT) module to generate syntax-based semantic features by considering the transferable dependency relations. Finally, we devise an Integrated aDaptive Strategy (IDS) to guide the joint learning process of both modules. Extensive experiments on four public datasets indicate that GAST achieves comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models.",
