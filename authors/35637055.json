            "abstract": "In the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), we tackle Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks using a novel two-pronged approach. We employ the Decision Transformer in an imitation learning paradigm to model human problem-solving, and introduce an object detection algorithm, the Push and Pull clustering method. This dual strategy enhances AI's ARC problem-solving skills and provides insights for AGI progression. Yet, our work reveals the need for advanced data collection tools, robust training datasets, and refined model structures. This study highlights potential improvements for Decision Transformers and propels future AGI research.",

            "abstract": "The task of assigning internationally accepted commodity codes (aka HS codes) to traded goods is a critical function of customs offices. Like court decisions made by judges, this task follows the doctrine of precedent and can be nontrivial even for experienced officers. Together with the Korea Customs Service (KCS), we propose a first-ever explainable decision supporting model that suggests the most likely subheadings (i.e., the first six digits) of the HS code. The model also provides reasoning for its suggestion in the form of a document that is interpretable by customs officers. We evaluated the model using 5,000 cases that recently received a classification request. The results showed that the top-3 suggestions made by our model had an accuracy of 93.9% when classifying 925 challenging subheadings. A user study with 32 customs experts further confirmed that our algorithmic suggestions accompanied by explainable reasonings, can substantially reduce the time and effort taken by customs officers for classification reviews.",

            "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness has become an important machine learning problem, especially for mission-critical Web applications. This work presents a self-supervised model, called DualFair, that can debias sensitive attributes like gender and race from learned representations. Unlike existing models that target a single type of fairness, our model jointly optimizes for two fairness criteria\u2014group fairness and counterfactual fairness\u2014and hence makes fairer predictions at both the group and individual levels. Our model uses contrastive loss to generate embeddings that are indistinguishable for each protected group, while forcing the embeddings of counterfactual pairs to be similar. It then uses a self-knowledge distillation method to maintain the quality of representation for the downstream tasks. Extensive analysis over multiple datasets confirms the model\u2019s validity and further shows the synergy of jointly addressing two fairness criteria, suggesting the model\u2019s potential value in fair intelligent Web applications.",

The CRS is a key source of data for monitoring and evaluating aid flows in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG17 which calls for global partnership and data sharing. To address the challenges of current labor-intensive practices of assigning the code and the related human inefficiencies, we propose a machine learning solution that uses ELECTRA to suggest relevant five-digit purpose codes in CRS for aid activities, achieving an accuracy of 0.9575 for the top-3 recommendations. We also conduct qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with SDG experts who assess the model results and provide feedback. We discuss the policy, practical, and methodological implications of our work and highlight the potential of AI applications to improve routine tasks in the public sector and foster partnerships for achieving the SDGs.",

Federated learning systems are susceptible to poisoning attacks when malicious clients send false updates to the central server. Existing defense strategies are ineffective under non-IID data settings. This paper proposes a new defense strategy, FedCPA (Federated learning with Critical Parameter Analysis). Our attack-tolerant aggregation method is based on the observation that benign local models have similar sets of top-k and bottom-k critical parameters, whereas poisoned local models do not. Experiments with different attack scenarios on multiple datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing defense strategies in defending against poisoning attacks.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning enables learning from decentralized data sources without compromising privacy, which makes it a crucial technique. However, it is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, where malicious clients interfere with the training process. Previous defense mechanisms have focused on the server-side by using careful model aggregation, but this may not be effective when the data is not identically distributed or when attackers can access the information of benign clients. In this paper, we propose a new defense mechanism that focuses on the client-side, called FedDefender, to help benign clients train robust local models and avoid the adverse impact of malicious model updates from attackers, even when a server-side defense cannot identify or remove adversaries. Our method consists of two main components: (1) attack-tolerant local meta update and (2) attack-tolerant global knowledge distillation. These components are used to find noise-resilient model parameters while accurately extracting knowledge from a potentially corrupted global model. Our client-side defense strategy has a flexible structure and can work in conjunction with any existing server-side strategies. Evaluations of real-world scenarios across multiple datasets show that the proposed method enhances the robustness of federated learning against model poisoning attacks.",

            "abstract": "Continual labeling of training examples is a costly task in supervised learning. Active learning strategies mitigate this cost by identifying unlabeled data that are considered the most useful for training a predictive model. However, sample selection via active learning may lead to an exploitation-exploration dilemma. In online settings, profitable items can be neglected when uncertain items are annotated instead. To illustrate this dilemma, we study a human-in-the-loop customs selection scenario where an AI-based system supports customs officers by providing a set of imports to be inspected. If the inspected items are fraud, officers levy extra duties, and these items will be used as additional training data for the next iterations. Inspecting highly suspicious items will inevitably lead to additional customs revenue, yet they may not give any extra knowledge to customs officers. On the other hand, inspecting uncertain items will help customs officers to acquire new knowledge, which will be used as supplementary training resources to update their selection systems. Through years of customs selection simulation, we show that some exploration is needed to cope with the domain shift, and our hybrid strategy of selecting fraud and uncertain items will eventually outperform the performance of the exploitation strategy.",

            "abstract": "The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of citizens worldwide and claimed many lives. This paper examines its impact on the Chinese e-commerce market by analyzing behavioral changes seen from a large online shopping platform. We first conduct a time series analysis to identify product categories that faced the most extensive disruptions. The time-lagged analysis shows that behavioral patterns seen in shopping actions are highly responsive to epidemic development. Based on these findings, we present a consumer demand prediction method by encompassing the epidemic statistics and behavioral features for COVID-19 related products. Experiment results demonstrate that our predictions outperform existing baselines and further extend to the long-term and province-level forecasts. We discuss how our market analysis and prediction can help better prepare for future pandemics by gaining an extra time to launch preventive steps.",

            "abstract": "The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of citizens worldwide and claimed many lives. This pandemic has changed human life in many ways, and the research community is putting efforts to understand these impacts in various sectors. This paper focuses on its impact on the Chinese market by analyzing the e-commerce behavioral changes seen at an online shopping platform before and during the pandemic. We present how the epidemic affected consumer behaviors via time series analysis. We find that disruptions in the supply of essential goods needed during a disaster can be leveraged for epidemic forecasting, and further design a hierarchical attention learning model to predict the newly confirmed cases. Experiment results demonstrate that our predictions outperform existing baselines, which also extends to the long-term and province-level forecasts. We believe models like ours contribute to better preparing for future epidemics by gaining extra time to launch preventive steps.",
