            "title": "Empowering Molecule Discovery for Molecule-Caption Translation with Large Language Models: A ChatGPT Perspective",
            "abstract": "Molecule discovery plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, advancing the design of tailored materials and drugs. However, most of the existing methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessive computational cost, or suffer from sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in various cross-modal tasks due to their powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, generalization, and in-context learning (ICL), which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. Despite several previous works trying to apply LLMs in this task, the lack of domain-specific corpus and difficulties in training specialized LLMs still remain challenges. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based framework (MolReGPT) for molecule-caption translation, where an In-Context Few-Shot Molecule Learning paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery with LLMs like ChatGPT to perform their in-context learning capability without domain-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. MolReGPT leverages the principle of molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their text descriptions from a local database to enable LLMs to learn the task knowledge from context examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT on molecule-caption translation, including molecule understanding and text-based molecule generation. Experimental results show that compared to fine-tuned models, MolReGPT outperforms MolT5-base and is comparable to MolT5-large without additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is the first work to leverage LLMs via in-context learning in molecule-caption translation for advancing molecule discovery. Our work expands the scope of LLM applications, as well as providing a new paradigm for molecule discovery and design.",

            "title": "Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models (LLMs)in Learning on Graphs",
            "abstract": "Learning on Graphs has attracted immense attention due to its wide real-world applications. The most popular pipeline for learning on graphs with textual node attributes primarily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and utilizes shallow text embedding as initial node representations, which has limitations in general knowledge and profound semantic understanding. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to possess extensive common knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities that have revolutionized existing workflows to handle text data. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LLMs in graph machine learning, especially the node classification task, and investigate two possible pipelines: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. The former leverages LLMs to enhance nodes' text attributes with their massive knowledge and then generate predictions through GNNs. The latter attempts to directly employ LLMs as standalone predictors. We conduct comprehensive and systematical studies on these two pipelines under various settings. From comprehensive empirical results, we make original observations and find new insights that open new possibilities and suggest promising directions to leverage LLMs for learning on graphs.

            "abstract": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics brings exciting breakthroughs to single-cell analysis by providing physical locations along with gene expression. However, as a cost of the extremely high spatial resolution, the cellular level spatial transcriptomic data suffer significantly from missing values. While a standard solution is to perform imputation on the missing values, most existing methods either overlook spatial information or only incorporate localized spatial context without the ability to capture long-range spatial information. Using multi-head self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding, transformer models can readily grasp the relationship between tokens and encode location information. In this paper, by treating single cells as spatial tokens, we study how to leverage transformers to facilitate spatial tanscriptomics imputation. In particular, investigate the following two key questions: (1) $\\textit{how to encode spatial information of cells in transformers}$, and (2) $\\textit{ how to train a transformer for transcriptomic imputation}$. By answering these two questions, we present a transformer-based imputation framework, SpaFormer, for cellular-level spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms on three large-scale datasets while maintaining superior computational efficiency.",

Graph generation is a crucial computational task on graphs with numerous real-world applications. It aims to learn the distribution of given graphs and then generate new graphs. Given the great success of diffusion models in image generation, increasing efforts have been made to leverage these techniques to advance graph generation in recent years. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of generative diffusion models on graphs, In particular, we review representative algorithms for three variants of graph diffusion models, i.e., Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics (SMLD), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), and Score-based Generative Model (SGM). Then, we summarize the major applications of generative diffusion models on graphs with a specific focus on molecule and protein modeling. Finally, we discuss promising directions in generative diffusion models on graph-structured data.",

            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions.

However, the analysis of GNN performance with respect to nodes exhibiting different structural patterns, e.g., homophilic nodes in heterophilic graphs, remains rather limited. In the present study, we provide evidence that Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) on node classification typically perform admirably on homophilic nodes within homophilic graphs and heterophilic nodes within heterophilic graphs while struggling on the opposite node set, exhibiting a performance disparity. We theoretically and empirically identify effects of GNNs on testing nodes exhibiting distinct structural patterns. We then propose a rigorous, non-i.i.d PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for GNNs, revealing reasons for the performance disparity, namely the aggregated feature distance and homophily ratio difference between training and testing nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical implications of our new findings via (1) elucidating the effectiveness of deeper GNNs; and (2) revealing an over-looked distribution shift factor on graph out-of-distribution problem and proposing a new scenario accordingly.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the task of graph classification. Typically, we first build a unified GNN model with graphs in a given training set and then use this unified model to predict labels of all the unseen graphs in the test set. However, graphs in the same dataset often have dramatically distinct structures, which indicates that a unified model may be sub-optimal given an individual graph. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop customized graph neural networks for graph classification. Specifically, we propose a novel customized graph neural network framework, i.e., Customized-GNN. Given a graph sample, Customized-GNN can generate a sample-specific model for this graph based on its structure. Meanwhile, the proposed framework is very general that can be applied to numerous existing graph neural network models. Comprehensive experiments on various graph classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "As widely used in data-driven decision-making, recommender systems have been recognized for their capabilities to provide users with personalized services in many user-oriented online services, such as E-commerce (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, etc.) and Social Media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Recent works have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to promote or demote a set of target items. Instead of generating users with fake profiles from scratch, in this article, we introduce a novel strategy to obtain \u201cfake\u201d user profiles via copying cross-domain user profiles, where a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking framework (CopyAttack+) is developed to effectively and efficiently select cross-domain user profiles from the source domain to attack the target system. Moreover, we propose to train a local surrogate system for mimicking adversarial black-box attacks in the source domain, so as to provide transferable signals with the purpose of enhancing the attacking strategy in the target black-box recommender system. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework.",

            "abstract": "With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this emerging field.",
