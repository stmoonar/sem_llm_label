            "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) aims to automatically answer natural language questions related to given image content. Existing VQA methods integrate vision modeling and language understanding to explore the deep semantics of the question. However, these methods ignore the significant syntax information of the question, which plays a vital role in understanding the essential semantics of the question and guiding the visual feature refinement. To fill the gap, we suggested a novel Syntax Tree Constrained Graph Network (STCGN) for VQA based on entity message passing and syntax tree. This model is able to extract a syntax tree from questions and obtain more precise syntax information. Specifically, we parse questions and obtain the question syntax tree using the Stanford syntax parsing tool. From the word level and phrase level, syntactic phrase features and question features are extracted using a hierarchical tree convolutional network. We then design a message-passing mechanism for phrase-aware visual entities and capture entity features according to a given visual context. Extensive experiments on VQA2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.",

            "abstract": "Users\u2019 purchase behaviors are complex and dynamic, which are usually driven by various personal demands evolving with time. According to psychology and economic theories, user demands can be satisfied with a sequence of purchase behaviors, resulting in a basket of items. However, most of the existing works simply predict the next basket from a shallow perspective of (purchase) sequence data modeling without deep insight into the underlying factors which drive user purchase behaviors. In fact, filling a basket with multiple items is a process to incrementally satisfy a user's demand. Therefore, the key challenges to predict a user's next basket lie in (1) how to track the changes of the user's demand, and (2) how to satisfy her demand at a given moment. To this end, we propose an Evolving DEmand SAtisfaction (EvoDESA) model to model a user's demand evolution for next-basket prediction. In EvoDESA, a demand evolution module learns the dynamics of user demand over a sequence of basket-purchase behaviors. Then, a next-basket planning module effectively packs an optimal combination of items to best satisfy the user's current demand. Extensive experiments on three real-world transaction datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of EvoDESA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Skeleton-based human action recognition and analysis have become increasingly attainable in many areas, such as security surveillance and anomaly detection. Given the prevalence of skeleton-based applications, tampering attacks on human skeletal features have emerged very recently. In particular, checking the temporal inconsistency and/or incoherence (TII) in the skeletal sequence of human action is a principle of forgery detection. To this end, we propose an approach to self-supervised learning of the temporal causality behind human action, which can effectively check TII in skeletal sequences. Especially, we design a multilevel skeleton-based forgery detection framework to recognize the forgery on frame level, clip level, and action level in terms of learning the corresponding temporal-causal skeleton representations for each level. Specifically, a hierarchical graph convolution network architecture is designed to learn low-level skeleton representations based on physical skeleton connections and high-level action representations based on temporal-causal dependencies for specific actions. Extensive experiments consistently show state-of-the-art results on multilevel forgery detection tasks and superior performance of our framework compared to current competing methods.",

            "abstract": "Abstractive related work generation has attracted increasing attention in generating coherent related work that better helps readers grasp the background in the current research. However, most existing abstractive models ignore the inherent causality of related work generation, leading to low quality of generated related work and spurious correlations that affect the models' generalizability. In this study, we argue that causal intervention can address these limitations and improve the quality and coherence of the generated related works. To this end, we propose a novel Causal Intervention Module for Related Work Generation (CaM) to effectively capture causalities in the generation process and improve the quality and coherence of the generated related works. Specifically, we first model the relations among sentence order, document relation, and transitional content in related work generation using a causal graph. Then, to implement the causal intervention and mitigate the negative impact of spurious correlations, we use do-calculus to derive ordinary conditional probabilities and identify causal effects through CaM. Finally, we subtly fuse CaM with Transformer to obtain an end-to-end generation model. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that causal interventions in CaM can effectively promote the model to learn causal relations and produce related work of higher quality and coherence.",

            "abstract": "Fashion recommendation (FR) has received increasing attention in the research of new types of recommender systems. Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has caused tremendous effects on information propagation, raising extreme challenges in detecting rumors. Existing rumor detection methods typically exploit the reposting propagation of a rumor candidate for detection by regarding all reposts to a rumor candidate as a temporal sequence and learning semantics representations of the repost sequence. However, extracting informative support from the topological structure of propagation and the influence of reposting authors for debunking rumors is crucial, which generally has not been well addressed by existing methods. In this article, we organize a claim post in circulation as an ad hoc event tree, extract event elements, and convert it into bipartite ad hoc event trees in terms of both posts and authors, i.e., author tree and post tree. Accordingly, we propose a novel rumor detection model with hierarchical representation on the bipartite ad hoc event trees called BAET. Specifically, we introduce word embedding and feature encoder for the author and post tree, respectively, and design a root-aware attention module to perform node representation. Then we adopt the tree-like RNN model to capture the structural correlations and propose a tree-aware attention module to learn tree representation for the author tree and post tree, respectively. Extensive experimental results on two public Twitter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BAET in exploring and exploiting the rumor propagation structure and the superior detection performance of BAET over state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting penetrates various aspects of our economy and society, whose roles become increasingly recognized. However, often MTS forecasting is unfair, not only degrading their practical benefits but even incurring potential risk.

            "abstract": "Case-based Reasoning (CBR) on high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is a trending yet challenging and computationally expensive task in the real world. A promising approach is to obtain low-dimensional hash codes representing cases and perform a similarity retrieval of cases in a Hamming space. However, previous methods based on data-independent hashing rely on random projections or manual construction, inapplicable to address specific data issues (e.g., high-dimensionality and heterogeneity) due to their insensitivity to data characteristics. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel deep hashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient case retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR. Specifically, we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous features and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings, which effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality and sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then, we feed the case embeddings into fully-connected layers, and subsequently a hash layer generates hash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss during relaxation. To cater for incremental learning of CBR, we further propose an adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function. Extensive experiments on public datasets show HeCBR greatly reduces storage and significantly accelerates the case retrieval. HeCBR achieves desirable performance compared with the state-of-the-art CBR methods and performs significantly better than hashing-based CBR methods in classification. typical CBR models to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed HeCBR. All experimental results demonstrate that our HeCBR significantly outperforms the hashing-enabled methods in terms of classification tasks and achieves desirable performance compared with typical CBR methods. Theoretical and empirical analysis show that HeCBR can greatly reduce storage cost and significantly improve efficiency in relation to typical CBR models.",

            "abstract": "Building on deep representation learning, deep supervised hashing has achieved promising performance in tasks like similarity retrieval. However, conventional code balance constraints (i.e., bit balance and bit uncorrelation) imposed on avoiding overfitting and improving hash code quality are unsuitable for deep supervised hashing owing to their inefficiency and impracticality of simultaneously learning deep data representations and hash functions. To address this issue, we propose probabilistic code balance constraints on deep supervised hashing to force each hash code to conform to a discrete uniform distribution. Accordingly, a Wasserstein regularizer aligns the distribution of generated hash codes to a uniform distribution. Theoretical analyses reveal that the proposed constraints form a general deep hashing framework for both bit balance and bit uncorrelation and maximizing the mutual information between data input and their corresponding hash codes. Extensive empirical analyses on two benchmark datasets further demonstrate the enhancement of compactness and informativeness of hash codes for deep supervised hash to improve retrieval performance (code available at: https://github.com/mumuxi/dshwr).",

            "abstract": "Document-level sentiment classification is a process that aims to predict the sentiment rating of a particular document. The most popular methods take word embeddings as the inputs of a neural network. However, there are many different senses that coexist in a word embedding; such ambiguous word representation will cause models to misunderstand a text, which will result in predicting the sentiment incorrectly. Accordingly, to make the information in the text representation more explicit, we propose a Bidirectional Selection Mechanism (Bi-SM), which filters out redundancy from different perspectives by alternately selecting salient information contained in the text representation and the category representation. Bi-SM mainly contains two parts-Selection and Back Selection. At the word level, the Selection module uses the category of each word to \u201cfilter\u201d out redundant senses. Meanwhile, the category will be enriched in this module for further being used in the Back Selection module. Subsequently, the Back Selection module uses the \u201cfiltered\u201d word information to \u201cselect\u201d the salient \u201cenriched category\u201d, which is further used at the sentence level to \u201cfilter\u201d out redundancy in the sentence representation. The same thing happened at the sentence level. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models can achieve consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
