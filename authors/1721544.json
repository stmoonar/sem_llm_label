            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles as base stations (UAV-BSs) are recognized as effective means for tackling eruptive communication service requirements especially when terrestrial infrastructures are unavailable. Quality of service (QoS) received by ground terminals (GTs) highly depends on the spatial movement of UAV-BSs. In this paper, we investigate the cooperative trajectory design problem of multiple UAV-BSs towards fair throughput maximization of GTs. Considering the restriction of coverage and sensing, we first propose a heterogeneous-graph-based formulation of relations between GTs and UAV-BSs. Subsequently, we design a framework named graph vision and communication (GVis&Comm) to 1) let each UAV-BS efficiently manage time-varying local observations; 2) facilitate cooperation between UAV-BSs through explicit information exchange. To further reduce the overhead of over-the-air cooperation, we realize discretization of the message passing process among UAV-BSs while still enabling end-to-end training. By leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), UAV-BSs as agents learn a distributed trajectory design policy. Extensive numerical simulation shows that our framework on the one hand achieves remarkable efficiency in processing local observations of each UAV-BS, and on the other improves the overall network performance via close cooperation among UAV-BSs.",

            "abstract": "With innovative applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks in various areas, their demands on broad bandwidth, large capacity and low latency become prominent. The combination of millimeter wave, directional antenna and time division multiple access techniques, which enables concurrent transmissions, is promising to deal with it. In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem in UAV ad hoc networks. Specifically, the slot assignment, antenna boresight and transmit power are jointly optimized to promote the network capacity. First, we formulate the optimization problem as the maximization of the fairness-weighted network capacity, subject to the constraint on priority guarantee. Then, because the formulated problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard, two algorithms called dual-based iterative search algorithm (DISA) and sequential exhausted allocation algorithm (SEAA) are respectively proposed to efficiently solve it with acceptable complexity. DISA slacks the MINLP into a continuous-variable optimization problem and solves it with the Lagrangian dual method in an iterative manner. As a heuristic method, SEAA schedules links sequentially, i.e., from high-priority to low-priority ones. Numerical results demonstrate that both DISA and SEAA can efficiently allocate resources for UAVs, while guaranteeing the fairness and priority of links.",

Due to limited computing capability of IoT devices, mobile edge computing (MEC) is applied to reduce packet calculation time and improve packet freshness. In this paper, we investigate a MEC system for sharing vehicle status information and use the age-of-information (AoI) to define the freshness of information in the MEC system. The whole system is modeled as a two-stage tandem queue model with multi source-destination pairs. We derive the closed-form expression for the average AoI of partial computing and analyze the impact of system parameters on the average AoI, which provides guidance on how to set parameters to maximize the information freshness of the MEC system. As a more flexible scheme, partial computing we used reduces the AoI of the MEC system compared to remote computing. Numerical analysis validates our theory.",

            "abstract": "Standard digital communication techniques allow us to set aside the meaning of the messages to concentrate on the transmission of bits efficiently and reliably. However, with the integration of artificial intelligence into communications technology and the merging of communication and computation within devices, increasing evidence suggests that the semantic aspect of communication cannot be set aside. We propose a part-of-speech-based encoding strategy and context-based decoding strategies, in which various deep learning models are presented to learn the semantic and contextual features as background knowledge. With the background knowledge, our strategies can be applied to some non-jointly-designed communication scenarios with uncertainty. We compare the performances of two proposed decoding strategies, the deep learning models of which are different, to provide model-choice design guidelines in accordance with specific communication conditions. Further, we discuss the impact of several parameters on the performance of our strategies, such as the size of the context window and the size of the feature window. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness and the reliability of our strategies in terms of decreasing the number of bits used to transmit messages and increasing the semantic accuracy between transmitted messages and recovered messages.",

            "abstract": "Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based physical layer communication techniques have attracted considerable interest. Although their potential to enhance communication systems and superb performance have been validated by simulation experiments, little attention has been paid to the theoretical analysis. Specifically, most studies in the physical layer have tended to focus on the application of DNN models to wireless communication problems but not to theoretically understand how does a DNN work in a communication system. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively analyze why DNNs can achieve comparable performance in the physical layer comparing with traditional techniques, and also drive their cost in terms of computational complexity. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the encoding performance of a DNN-based transmitter and compare it to a traditional one. And then, we theoretically analyze the performance of DNN-based estimator and compare it with traditional estimators. Third, we investigate and validate how information is flown in a DNN-based communication system under the information theoretic concepts. Our analysis develops a concise way to open the \u201cblack box\u201d of DNNs in physical layer communication, which can be applied to support the design of DNN-based intelligent communication techniques and help to provide explainable performance assessment.",

            "abstract": "The power-delay profile (PDP) estimation of wireless channels is an important step to generate a channel correlation matrix for channel linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation. Estimated channel frequency response can be used to obtain time dispersion characteristics that can be exploited by adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this paper, a joint estimator for PDP and LMMSE channel estimation is proposed. For LMMSE channel estimation, we apply a candidate set of frequency-domain channel correlation functions (CCF) and select the one that best matches the current channel to construct the channel correlation matrix. The initial candidate set is generated based on the traditional CCF calculation method for different scenarios. Then, the result of channel estimation is used as an input for the PDP estimation whereas the estimated PDP is further used to update the candidate channel correlation matrix. The enhancement of LMMSE channel estimation and PDP estimation can be achieved by the iterative joint estimation procedure. Analysis and simulation results show that in different communication scenarios, the PDP estimation error of the proposed method can approach the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound (CRLB) after a finite number of iterations. Moreover, the mean square error of channel estimation is close to the performance of accurate PDP-assisted LMMSE.",

            "abstract": "Semantic communication is a promising technology used to overcome the challenges of large bandwidth and power requirements caused by the data explosion. Semantic representation is an important issue in semantic communication. The knowledge graph, powered by deep learning, can improve the accuracy of semantic representation while removing semantic ambiguity. Therefore, we propose a semantic communication system based on the knowledge graph. Specifically, in our system, the transmitted sentences are converted into triplets by using the knowledge graph. Triplets can be viewed as basic semantic symbols for semantic extraction and restoration and can be sorted based on semantic importance. Moreover, the proposed communication system adaptively adjusts the transmitted contents according to channel quality and allocates more transmission resources to important triplets to enhance communication reliability. Simulation results show that the proposed system significantly enhances the reliability of the communication in the low signal-to-noise regime compared to the traditional schemes.",

            "abstract": "A joint channel estimation and message passing (MP) data detection receive scheme is proposed for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system in this paper. First, in order to mitigate inter-Doppler interference, we treat the interference from data as Gaussian variables, whose means and variances are fed back from MP detector. Secondly, based on the priori information on the channel, we derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) delay-Doppler bins detection method to extract the proper position of the channel taps. Thirdly, in order to circumvent the performance loss incurred by the conventional least squares channel estimation, a novel minimum mean square error (MMSE) delay-Doppler domain channel estimator is constructed, which utilized the information both from the channel power delay profile and the Doppler spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the conventional algorithm in literature both in terms of the channel estimation accuracy and the bit error rate performance at the cost of less guard symbols.",
