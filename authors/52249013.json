            "title": "Creating Custom Event Data Without Dictionaries: A Bag-of-Tricks",
            "abstract": "Event data, or structured records of ``who did what to whom'' that are automatically extracted from text, is an important source of data for scholars of international politics. The high cost of developing new event datasets, especially using automated systems that rely on hand-built dictionaries, means that most researchers draw on large, pre-existing datasets such as ICEWS rather than developing tailor-made event datasets optimized for their specific research question. This paper describes a ``bag of tricks'' for efficient, custom event data production, drawing on recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) that allow researchers to rapidly produce customized event datasets. The paper introduces techniques for training an event category classifier with active learning, identifying actors and the recipients of actions in text using large language models and standard machine learning classifiers and pretrained ``question-answering'' models from NLP, and resolving mentions of actors to their Wikipedia article to categorize them. We describe how these techniques produced the new POLECAT global event dataset that is intended to replace ICEWS, along with examples of how scholars can quickly produce smaller, custom event datasets. We publish example code and models to implement our new techniques.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting of geopolitical events is a notoriously difficult task, with experts failing to significantly outperform a random baseline across many types of forecasting events. One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

            "abstract": "Using updated Archigos Data, as well as structural and event data, we construct a split-population duration model of irregular leadership changes. These are leadership changes that occur outside of the normal, legal framework for leadership transitions. Our model was estimated in March 2014 and produced probability estimates of leadership changes in many countries in the world. We used a wisdom-of-the-crowds approach to combining estimates from various different models. Ukraine and Thailand are among those in which we had the highest predictions for irregular change of leaders.",
