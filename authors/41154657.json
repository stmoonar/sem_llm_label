            "abstract": "E-Commerce size and fit recommendations can be improved by using customer images to estimate body measurements. We are developing a body measurement fairness evaluation to determine if Zalando\u2019s AI/ML driven body measurement pipelines systematically underperform for customers of certain gender, body shape, or skin tone. The fairness evaluation produces four unfairness scores. The first is a gender unfairness score: the difference in average performance between genders. The second and third are body shape and skin tone unfairness scores: the difference in average performance between smallest and largest bodies, and lightest and deepest skin tones, respectively. The fourth is an intersectional unfairness score: the number of customers that are members of clusters associated with significant underperformance. We demonstrate the fairness pipeline on one body measurement pipeline candidate in the development stage showing that body shape receives the most significant unfairness score. This work allows us to catch unfair body measurement pipelines during experimentation and development stages to help our team avoid deploying unfair models into production.",

            "abstract": "Fair and trustworthy AI is becoming ever more important in both machine learning and legal domains. One important consequence is that decision makers must seek to guarantee a 'fair', i.e., non-discriminatory, algorithmic decision procedure. However, there are several competing notions of algorithmic fairness that have been shown to be mutually incompatible under realistic factual assumptions. This concerns, for example, the widely used fairness measures of 'calibration within groups' and 'balance for the positive/negative class'. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm (FAir Interpolation Method: FAIM) for continuously interpolating between these three fairness criteria. Thus, an initially unfair prediction can be remedied to, at least partially, meet a desired, weighted combination of the respective fairness conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm when applied to synthetic data, the COMPAS data set, and a new, real-world data set from the e-commerce sector. Finally, we discuss to what extent FAIM can be harnessed to comply with conflicting legal obligations. The analysis suggests that it may operationalize duties in traditional legal fields, such as credit scoring and criminal justice proceedings, but also for the latest AI regulations put forth in the EU, like the Digital Markets Act and the recently enacted AI Act.",

            "abstract": "Ranking, recommendation, and retrieval systems are widely used in online platforms and other societal systems, including e-commerce, media-streaming, admissions, gig platforms, and hiring. In the recent past, a large \u201cfair ranking\u201d research literature has been developed around making these systems fair to the individuals, providers, or content that are being ranked. Most of this literature defines fairness for a single instance of retrieval, or as a simple additive notion for multiple instances of retrievals over time. This work provides a critical overview of this literature, detailing the often context-specific concerns that such approaches miss: the gap between high ranking placements and true provider utility, spillovers and compounding effects over time, induced strategic incentives, and the effect of statistical uncertainty. We then provide a path forward for a more holistic and impact-oriented fair ranking research agenda, including methodological lessons from other fields and the role of the broader stakeholder community in overcoming data bottlenecks and designing effective regulatory environments.",

[2], which did not work for very short rankings in combination with a low minimum proportion p for the protected group. We show how the minimum number of protected candidates per ranking position can be calculated exactly and provide a mapping from the continuous space of significance levels (\u03b1) to a discrete space of tables, which allows us to find \u03b1corr using a binary search heuristic. In this report we describe a correction of the significance adjustment procedure from [2], which did not work for very small k and \u03b1 . For binomial distributions, i.e. where only one protected and one non-protected group is present, the inverse CDF can be stored as a simple table, which we compute using Algorithm 1. We will call such a table mTable. Algorithm 1: Algorithm ConstructMTable computes the data structure to efficiently verify or construct a ranking that satisfies binomial ranked group fairness. input :k , the size of the ranking to produce; p , the expected proportion of protected elements; \u03b1corr, the significance for each individual test. output :mTable: A list that contains the minimum number of protected candidates required at each position of a ranking of size k . 1 mTable\u2190 [k] // list of size k 2 for i \u2190 1 to k do 3 mTable[i] \u2190 F\u22121 (i, p, \u03b1corr) // the inverse binomial cdf 4 end 5 return mTable Table 1 shows an example of mTables for different k and p , using \u03b1 = 0.1. For instance, for p = 0.5 we see that at least 1 candidate from the protected group is needed in the top 4 positions, and 2 protected candidates in the top 7 positions. Figure 1 shows that we need a correction for \u03b1 as we are testing multiple hypothesis in the ranked group fairness test, namely k of them (note that the scale is logarithmic). In the following, we show that the special case of having only one protected group offers possibilities for verifying ranked group fairness efficiently. A key advantage of considering just one protected group, rather than multiple, is that we can calculate the exact failure probability Pfail (i.e. a fair ranking gets rejected by the ranked group fairness test), which results in an efficient binary search for \u03b1corr. First we introduce the necessary notation for the binomial case and describe how we calculate the exact Pfail. Then we show that we can divide the continuum of possible \u03b1 values in discrete .

            "abstract": "Increasingly, scholars seek to integrate legal and technological insights to combat bias in AI systems. In recent years, many different definitions for ensuring non-discrimination in algorithmic decision systems have been put forward. In this paper, we first briefly describe the EU law framework covering cases of algorithmic discrimination. Second, we present an algorithm that harnesses optimal transport to provide a flexible framework to interpolate between different fairness definitions. Third, we show that important normative and legal challenges remain for the implementation of algorithmic fairness interventions in real-world scenarios. Overall, the paper seeks to contribute to the quest for flexible technical frameworks that can be adapted to varying legal and normative fairness constraints.",
