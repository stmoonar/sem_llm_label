            "title": "A Change Language for Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs) are general-purpose computable representations of some domain, such as human anatomy, and are frequently a crucial part of modern information systems. Most of these structures change over time, incorporating new knowledge or information that was previously missing. Managing these changes is a challenge, both in terms of communicating changes to users, and providing mechanisms to make it easier for multiple stakeholders to contribute. To fill that need, we have created KGCL, the Knowledge Graph Change Language, a standard data model for describing changes to KGs and ontologies at a high level, and an accompanying human-readable controlled natural language. This language serves two purposes: a curator can use it to request desired changes, and it can also be used to describe changes that have already happened, corresponding to the concepts of\"apply patch\"and\"diff\"commonly used for managing changes in text documents and computer programs. Another key feature of KGCL is that descriptions are at a high enough level to be useful and understood by a variety of stakeholders--for example, ontology edits can be specified by commands like\"add synonym 'arm' to 'forelimb'\"or\"move 'Parkinson disease' under 'neurodegenerative disease'\". We have also built a suite of tools for managing ontology changes. These include an automated agent that integrates with and monitors GitHub ontology repositories and applies any requested changes, and a new component in the BioPortal ontology resource that allows users to make change requests directly from within the BioPortal user interface. Overall, the KGCL data model, its controlled natural language, and associated tooling allow for easier management and processing of changes associated with the development of ontologies and KGs.",

            "abstract": "Scientists increasingly recognize the importance of providing rich, standards-adherent metadata to describe their experimental results. Despite the availability of sophisticated tools to assist in the process of data annotation, investigators generally seem to prefer to use spreadsheets when supplying metadata, despite the limitations of spreadsheets in ensuring metadata consistency and compliance with formal specifications. In this paper, we describe an end-to-end approach that supports spreadsheet-based entry of metadata, while ensuring rigorous adherence to community-based metadata standards and providing quality control. Our methods employ several key components, including customizable templates that capture metadata standards and that can inform the spreadsheets that investigators use to author metadata, controlled terminologies and ontologies for defining metadata values that can be accessed directly from a spreadsheet, and an interactive Web-based tool that allows users to rapidly identify and fix errors in their spreadsheet-based metadata. We demonstrate how this approach is being deployed in a biomedical consortium known as HuBMAP to define and collect metadata about a wide range of biological assays.",

            "abstract": "With the global increase in experimental data artifacts, harnessing them in a unified fashion leads to a major stumbling block - bad metadata. To bridge this gap, this work presents a Natural Language Processing (NLP) informed application, called FAIRMetaText, that compares metadata. Specifically, FAIRMetaText analyzes the natural language descriptions of metadata and provides a mathematical similarity measure between two terms. This measure can then be utilized for analyzing varied metadata, by suggesting terms for compliance or grouping similar terms for identification of replaceable terms. The efficacy of the algorithm is presented qualitatively and quantitatively on publicly available research artifacts and demonstrates large gains across metadata related tasks through an in-depth study of a wide variety of Large Language Models (LLMs). This software can drastically reduce the human effort in sifting through various natural language metadata while employing several experimental datasets on the same topic.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Knowledge graphs (KGs) are being adopted in industry, commerce and academia. Biomedical KG presents a challenge due to the complexity, size and heterogeneity of the underlying information. Results In this work, we present the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a biomedical KG connecting millions of concepts via semantically meaningful relationships. SPOKE contains 27 million nodes of 21 different types and 53 million edges of 55 types downloaded from 41 databases. The graph is built on the framework of 11 ontologies that maintain its structure, enable mappings and facilitate navigation. SPOKE is built weekly by python scripts which download each resource, check for integrity and completeness, and then create a \u2018parent table\u2019 of nodes and edges. Graph queries are translated by a REST API and users can submit searches directly via an API or a graphical user interface. Conclusions/Significance: SPOKE enables the integration of seemingly disparate information to support precision medicine efforts. Availability and implementation The SPOKE neighborhood explorer is available at https://spoke.rbvi.ucsf.edu. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Trust in ontologies is a central issue for their application. For example, machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis may rely on the correctness of ontologies and could potentially deliver false results. For enhancing trust, we developed a WebProt\u00b4eg\u00b4e plugin for the decentralized attestation and ver-i\ufb01cation to the integrity and validity of ontologies using the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchains are an immutable, tamper-resistant and decentralized storage where all transactions are digitally signed. Thus, they permit tracing the provenance of concepts and identify responsible actors. For a \ufb01rst experimental evaluation, we evaluated the transaction costs for attesting to the provenance of ontologies.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAlthough social and environmental factors are central to provider-patient interactions, the data that reflect these factors can be incomplete, vague, and subjective. We sought to create a conceptual framework to describe and classify data about presence, the domain of interpersonal connection in medicine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOur top-down approach for ontology development based on the concept of \"relationality\" included the following: 1) a broad survey of the social sciences literature and a systematic literature review of >20 000 articles around interpersonal connection in medicine, 2) relational ethnography of clinical encounters (n\u2009=\u20095 pilot, 27 full), and 3) interviews about relational work with 40 medical and nonmedical professionals. We formalized the model using the Web Ontology Language in the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ontology editor. We iteratively evaluated and refined the Presence Ontology through manual expert review and automated annotation of literature.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe Presence Ontology facilitates the naming and classification of concepts that would otherwise be vague. Our model categorizes contributors to healthcare encounters and factors such as communication, emotions, tools, and environment. Ontology evaluation indicated that cognitive models (both patients' explanatory models and providers' caregiving approaches) influenced encounters and were subsequently incorporated. We show how ethnographic methods based in relationality can aid the representation of experiential concepts (eg, empathy, trust). Our ontology could support investigative methods to improve healthcare processes for both patients and healthcare providers, including annotation of videotaped encounters, development of clinical instruments to measure presence, or implementation of electronic health record-based reminders for providers.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Presence Ontology provides a model for using ethnographic approaches to classify interpersonal data.",

            "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) aims to create a comprehensive high-resolution atlas of all the cells in the healthy human body. Multiple laboratories across the United States are collecting tissue specimens from different organs of donors who vary in sex, age, and body size. Integrating and harmonizing the data derived from these samples and 'mapping' them into a common three-dimensional (3D) space is a major challenge. The key to making this possible is a 'Common Coordinate Framework' (CCF), which provides a semantically annotated, 3D reference system for the entire body. The CCF enables contributors to HuBMAP to 'register' specimens and datasets within a common spatial reference system, and it supports a standardized way to query and 'explore' data in a spatially and semantically explicit manner. [...] This paper describes the construction and usage of a CCF for the human body and its reference implementation in HuBMAP. The CCF consists of (1) a CCF Clinical Ontology, which provides metadata about the specimen and donor (the 'who'); (2) a CCF Semantic Ontology, which describes 'what' part of the body a sample came from and details anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B); and (3) a CCF Spatial Ontology, which indicates 'where' a tissue sample is located in a 3D coordinate system. An initial version of all three CCF ontologies has been implemented for the first HuBMAP Portal release. It was successfully used by Tissue Mapping Centers to semantically annotate and spatially register 48 kidney and spleen tissue blocks. The blocks can be queried and explored in their clinical, semantic, and spatial context via the CCF user interface in the HuBMAP Portal.",
