            "title": "Understanding GasToken Adoption in the Ethereum Blockchain",
            "abstract": "GasTokens are created by smart contracts executing in the Ethereum blockchain to support a form of transaction fee pre-payment. Even though GasTokens had a period of significant activity on Ethereum (regularly surpassing half of the overall weekly smart contract creation and destruction activities), few systematic studies have been conducted on GasToken usage and its effect on the blockchain network. This paper focuses on understanding the adoption of GasTokens on Ethereum since May of 2020. We first analyze the usage patterns, including the creation, destruction, and holding of GasTokens, then report several price findings related to GasTokens, and compare the fees paid by users submitting transactions that create and destroy GasTokens to the fees paid by all the transactions in the network over different time periods. We characterize the benefits obtained by GasToken transaction senders and report the impact of GasToken creations and destructions on the major mining pools.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the problem of building a suffix array substring index for inputs significantly larger than main memory. This problem is especially important in the context of biological sequence analysis, where biological polymers can be thought of as very large contiguous strings. The objective is to index every substring of these long strings to facilitate efficient queries. We propose a new simple, scalable, and inherently parallelizable algorithm for building a suffix array for out-of-core strings. Our new algorithm, Suffix Rank, scales to arbitrarily large inputs, using disk as a memory extension. It solves the problem in just O(log n) scans over the disk-resident data. We evaluate the practical performance of our new algorithm, and show that for inputs significantly larger than the available amount of RAM, it scales better than other state-of-the-art solutions, such as eSAIS, SAscan, and eGSA.",

            "title": "An Empirical Analysis of GraphQL API Schemas in Open Code Repositories and Package Registries",
            "abstract": "GraphQL is a query language for APIs that has been increasingly adopted by Web developers since its specification was open sourced in 2015. The GraphQL framework lets API clients tailor data requests by using queries that return JSON objects described using GraphQL Schema. We present initial results of an exploratory empirical study with the goal of characterizing GraphQL Schemas in open code repositories and package registries. Our first approach identifies over 20 thousand GraphQL-related projects in publicly accessible repositories hosted by GitHub. Our second, and complementary, approach uses package registries to find over 37 thousand dependent packages and repositories. In addition, over 2 thousand schema files were loaded into the GraphQL-JS reference implementation to conduct a detailed analysis of the schema information. Our study provides insights into the usage of different schema constructs, the number of distinct types and the most popular types in schemas, as well as the presence of cycles in schemas. 1 Motivation and Approach The schema of a GraphQL API describes the data and the types of queries supported by the API. An empirical study of the GraphQL schemas used by open source projects, therefore, provides useful information about the characteristics of data interfaces. Currently, there is no comprehensive collection of such schemas or a tool that helps gather schemas from GraphQL APIs. The goal of the work presented in this paper is i) to establish a method to extract schemas into a single collection for analyses and ii) to conduct an empirical analysis of the schemas. 1.1 Data Collection Method APIs-guru has the most comprehensive list of public GraphQL APIs with links to endpoints and their documentation. By using APIs-guru, combined with manual effort through keyword searching, we collected 67 schemas of distinct APIs. Authentication requirements for most publicly available APIs hindered the efficiency and possible automation of schema extraction. Hence, we decided to take a different approach by extracting schemas from open source repositories from GitHub and used three sources to identify GraphQL repositories.",

            "abstract": "The increasing number of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) available today calls for powerful query languages that can strike a balance between expressiveness and complexity of query evaluation and, that can be easily integrated into existing query processing infrastructures. We present Extended Property Paths (EPPs), a significant enhancement of Property Paths (PPs), the navigational core included in the SPARQL query language. We introduce the EPPs syntax, which allows to capture in a succinct way a larger class of navigational queries than PPs and other navigational extensions of SPARQL, and provide formal semantics. We describe a translation from non-recursive EPPs (nEPPs) into SPARQL queries and provide novel expressiveness results about the capability of SPARQL sub-languages to express navigational queries. We prove that the language of EPPs is more expressive than that of PPs; using EPPs within SPARQL allows to express things that cannot be expressed when only using PPs. We also study the expressiveness of SPARQL with EPPs in terms of reasoning capabilities. We show that SPARQL with EPPs is expressive enough to capture the main RDFS reasoning functionalities and describe how a query can be rewritten into another query enhanced with reasoning capabilities. We complement our contributions with an implementation of EPPs as the SPARQLindependent iEPPs language and an implementation of the translation of nEPPs into SPARQL queries. What sets our approach apart from previous research on querying KGs is the possibility to evaluate both nEPPs and SPARQL with nEPPs queries under the RDFS entailment regime on existing query processors. We report on an experimental evaluation on a variety of real KGs.",

            "abstract": "GitHub, the largest code hosting site (with 25 million public active repositories and contributions from 6 million active users), provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe the collaboration patterns of software developers. Understanding the patterns behind the social coding phenomena is an active research area where the insights gained can guide the design of better collaboration tools, and can also help to identify and select developer talent. In this paper, we present a large-scale analysis of the co-commit patterns in GitHub. We analyze 10 million commits made by 200 thousand developers to 16 thousand repositories, using 17 of the most popular programming languages over a period of 3 years. Although a large volume of data is included in our study, we pay close attention to the participation criteria for repositories and developers. We select repositories by reputation (based on star ranking), and we introduce the notion of active developer in GitHub (observing that a limited subset of developers is responsible for the vast majority of the commits). Using co-authorship networks, we analyze the co-commit patterns of the active developer network for each programming language. We observe that the active developer networks are less connected and more centralized than the general GitHub developer networks, and that the patterns vary significantly among languages. We compare our results to other collaborative environments (Wikipedia and scientific research networks), and we also describe the evolution of the co-commit patterns over time.",

            "abstract": "Bisimulation summaries of graph data have multiple applications, including facilitating graph exploration and enabling query optimization techniques, but efficient, scalable, summary construction is challenging. The literature describes parallel construction algorithms using message-passing, and these have been recently adapted to MapReduce environments. The fixpoint nature of bisimulation is well suited to iterative graph processing, but the existing MapReduce solutions do not drastically decrease per-iteration times as the computation progresses. In this paper, we focus on leveraging parallel multi-core graph frameworks with the goal of constructing summaries in roughly the same amount of time that it takes to input the data into the framework (for a range of real world data graphs) and output the summary. To achieve our goal we introduce a singleton optimization that significantly reduces per-iteration times after only a few iterations. We present experimental results validating that our scalable GraphChi implementation achieves our goal with bisimulation summaries of million to billion edge graphs.",

The construction component adds a novel optimization to a parallel bisimulation algorithm implemented on a multi-core graph processing framework. We show that for several large, disk resident, real world graphs, full summary construction can be completed in roughly the same time as the data load. The query translation component supports Extended Property Paths (EPPs), an enhancement of SPARQL 1.1 property paths that can express a significantly larger class of navigational queries. EPPs are implemented via rewritings into a widely used SPARQL subset. The optimization component can (transparently to users) translate EPPs defined on instance graphs into EPPs that take advantage of bisimulation summaries. S+EPPs combines the query and optimization translations to enable summary-based optimization of graph traversal queries on top of off-the-shelf SPARQL processors. The demonstration showcases the construction of bisimulation summaries of graphs (ranging from millions to billions of edges), together with the exploration benefits and the navigational query speedups obtained by leveraging summaries stored alongside the original datasets.",

            "abstract": "We introduce divergent designs as a novel tuning paradigm for database systems that employ replication. A divergent design installs a different physical configuration (e.g., indexes and materialized views) with each database replica, specializing replicas for different subsets of the workload. At runtime, queries are routed to the subset of the replicas configured to yield the most efficient execution plans. When compared to uniformly designed replicas, divergent replicas can potentially execute their subset of the queries significantly faster, and their physical configurations could be initialized and maintained(updated) in less time. However, the specialization of divergent replicas limits the ability to load-balance the workload at runtime. We formalize the divergent design problem, characterize the properties of good designs, and analyze the complexity of identifying the optimal divergent design. Our paradigm captures the trade-off between load balancing among all n replicas vs. load balancing among m \u2264 n specialized replicas. We develop an effective algorithm (leveraging single-node-tuning functionality) to compute good divergent designs for all the points of this trade-off. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrate that divergent designs can substantially improve workload performance.",

Our research proposes a model (and the associated tooling) that fills the gap between the end-user privacy intentions and what PHR systems offer as privacy features. We develop a privacy goals and settings mediator model based on an existing agent and goal-oriented modeling approach. Our proposed model is capable of encoding the accumulated privacy knowledge of the privacy experts during design-time, and offers privacy setting options that best match the users' intentions during run-time.

In this demonstration we present a tool, ExpLOD, that supports exploring summaries of RDF usage and interlinking among datasets from the Linked Open Data cloud. ExpLOD\u2019s summaries are based on a novel mechanism that combines text labels and bisimulation contractions. The labels assigned to resources in RDF graphs are hierarchical, enabling summarization at different granularities. The bisimulation contractions are applied to subgraphs dened via queries, providing for summarization of arbitrary large or small graph neighbourhoods. Our tool also generates SPARQL queries from summaries.",

Thanks in part to new data processing paradigms designed with the Cloud in mind (such as MapReduce[1], HDFS[2], Cassandra[3], etc), it is quickly gaining acceptance as a viable platform for organizations that need to store, process, and publish large amounts of data. MapReduce is attractive for processing data on the Cloud, to a large extent, because of its simplicity and flexibility. Implementations of MapReduce usually include a simple API used to describe which part of the processing is done in parallel (Map phase), and which part of the processing is done after grouping data on a single machine (Reduce phase). It does not rely on a pre-existing data model, making it possible to process any kind of information independently of the model. Cloud applications have notably been used to perform off-line analytical processing such as analyzing web request logs, computing user recommendations, and understanding scenes in images [4].",

            "abstract": "As Web applications mature and evolve, the nature of the semistructured data that drives these applications also changes. An important trend is the need for increased flexibility in the structure of Web documents. Hence, applications cannot rely solely on schemas to provide the complex knowledge needed to visualize, use, query and manage documents. Even when XML Web documents are valid with regard to a schema, the actual structure of such documents may exhibit significant variations across collections for several reasons: the schema may be very lax (e.g., RSS feeds), the schema may be large and different subsets of it may be used in different documents (e.g., industry standards like UBL), or open content models may allow arbitrary schemas to be mixed (e.g., RSS extensions like those used for podcasting). For these reasons, many applications that incorporate XPath queries to process a large Web document collection require an understanding of the actual structure present in the collection, and not just the schema.\n To support modern Web applications, we introduce DescribeX, a powerful framework that is capable of describing complex XML summaries of Web collections. DescribeX supports the construction of heterogenous summaries that can be declaratively defined and refined by means of axis path regular expression (AxPREs). AxPREs provide the flexibility necessary for declaratively defining complex mappings between instance nodes (in the documents) and summary nodes. These mappings are capable of expressing order and cardinality, among other properties, which can significantly help in the understanding of the structure of large collections of XML documents and enhance the performance of Web applications over these collections. DescribeX captures most summary proposals in the literature by providing (for the first time) a common declarative definition for them. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of DescribeX summary operations (summary creation, as well as refinement and stabilization, two key enablers for tailoring summaries) on multi-gigabyte Web collections.",

            "abstract": "Structured documents (predominantly encoded in XML) utilize markup dialects for several purposes, such as conveying logical structure, or providing rendering instructions. XML structure can also help users to navigate within documents to satisfy their information needs. However, including the user's structural preferences in the ranking of retrieved elements remains a key challenge in XML retrieval. In this paper, we propose an approach for including structural preferences in the ranking of XML elements by improving the structural relevance (SR) of results. SR is an evaluation measure which relies on graphical navigation models to capture the structural preferences of users. We propose several algorithms to post-process search engine output to improve the SR of the output. Experimental results (using data, assessments, and search engines from INEX 2007 and 2008) demonstrate the effect of different combinations of post-processing algorithms and navigation models on the effectiveness of systems.",

The framework is based on a model of tree retrieval, evaluated using a novel extension of the Structural elevance (SR) measure. The measure replaces the assumption of independence in traditional information retrieval (IR) with a notion of redundancy that takes into account the user navigation inside documents while seeking relevant information. Unlike existing metrics for SDR, our proposed framework does not require the computation of an ideal ranking which has, thus far, prevented the practical application of such measures. Instead, SR builds on a Markovian model of user navigation that can be estimated through the use of structural summaries. The results of this paper (supported by experimental validation using INEX data) show that SR defined over a tree retrieval model can provide a common basis for the evaluation of SDR approaches across various structured search tasks.",

This emerging Web of linked data is closely intertwined with the existing Web, since structured data items can be embedded into Web documents (e.g., RDFa or microformat encoded data), and RDF links can reference classic Web pages. Abundant linked data justifies extending the capabilities of Web browsers and search engines, and enables new usage scenarios, novel applications and sophisticated mashups.This promising direction for publishing data on the Web brings forward a number of challenges. While existing data management techniques can be leveraged to address the challenges, there are unique aspects to managing Web scale interlinking. In this presentation, we describe two specific challenges; achieving and managing dense interlinking, and describing data, metadata, and interlinking within and among linked Web datasets. Approaches to solve these challenges are showcased in the context of LinkedMDB, the first open linked dataset for movies. LinkedMDB has a large number of interlinks (over a quarter of a million) to other open linked datasets, as well as RDF links to movie-related Webpages.",

            "abstract": "Retrieval queries that combine structural constraints with keyword search represent a significant challenge to XML data management systems. Queries are expected to be answered as efficiently and effectively as in traditional keyword search, while satisfying additional constraints. Several XML-retrieval systems support answering queries exhaustively by storing both structural indexes and a keyword index. Other systems answer top-k queries efficiently by constructing indexes in which keyword scores, for some structural elements, are stored in relevance order, enabling approaches such as the threshold algorithm (TA). In this paper we describe TReX an XML retrieval system that can exploit multiple structural summaries (including newly defined ones). TReX can also self-manage small, redundant, indexes to speed up the evaluation of workloads of top-k queries. The redundant indexes are maintained to enable TReX to select an evaluation strategies among three (and potentially more) retrieval methods. We provide experimental evidence that using several strategies improves the efficiency of query evaluation, since none of the retrieval methods outperforms the others in all cases.",

            "abstract": "We present DescribeX, a tool for exploring and visualizing the structural patterns present in collections of XML documents. DescribeX can be employed by developers to interactively discover those XPath expressions that will actually return elements present in a collection of XML files. The element structure of many collections of XML documents present in the Web can be fairly unpredictable. This is the case even when the documents are validated by a schema, and can happen for two main reasons. First, the documents may follow a schema that allows many elements to occur almost anywhere in the document (e.g., by extensive use of in XML schema). Second, the default namespace and corresponding schema can be extended by incorporating elements from other namespaces with corresponding schemas (e.g., by using the XML Schema construct to allow open content models). A collection of RSS files provides a good example of the situations described above. The RSS schema is fairly permissive of where the basic elements occur. Multiple feed schemas can be present in the collection because of multiple versions (e.g. RSS 0.91 or 2.0) or formats (e.g. Atom, or RSS 1.0/RDF). Finally, RSS encourages the use of extensions so elements from several namespaces will be present (e.g. Dublin core, iTunes podcast, Microsoft Simple List Extensions). Other web collections for which the XML element structure can be fairly unpredictable are traces generated by web services requests and also XML-ized versions of wikis (and Wikipedia, in particular). A major challenge in working with these kinds of web collections is to understand enough about their structure to be able to pose meaningful queries employing XPath patterns.",

            "abstract": "The world of data has been developed from two main points of view: the structured relational data model and the unstructured text model. The two distinct cultures of databases and information retrieval now have a natural meeting place in the Web with its semi-structured XML model. Data in Digital Libraries and in Enterprise Environments also shares many of the semi-structured characteristics of web data. As web-style searching becomes an ubiquitous tool, the need for integrating these two viewpoints becomes even more important. \n \nIn particular, we consider the application of DB and IR research to querying Web data in the context of online communities. With Web 2.0, the question arises: how can search interfaces remain simple when users are allowed to contribute content (Wikipedia), share it (Flickr), and rate it (YouTube)? When they can decide who their friends are (del.icio.us), what they like to see, and how they want it to look like (MySpace)? While we want to keep the user interface simple (keyword search), we would like to study the applicability of querying structure and content to a context where new forms of data-driven dynamic web content (e.g. user feed-back, tags, contributed multimedia) are provided. \n \nThis tutorial will provide an overview of the different issues and approaches put forward by the IR and DB communities and survey the DB-IR integration efforts as they focus in the problem of retrieval from XML content. In particular, the context of querying content in online communities is an excellent example of such an application. Both earlier proposals as well as recent ones will be discussed. A variety of application scenarios for XML Retrieval will be covered, including examples of current tools and techniques.",

While many public databases support the standard, there is a degree of heterogeneity in the way the proposed XML schema is interpreted and instantiated by different data providers. Analysis of schema instantiation in large collections of XML data is a challenging task that is unsupported by existing tools. In this study we use DescribeX, a novel visualization technique of (semi-)structured XML formats, to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze PSI-MI XML collections at the instance level with the goal of gaining insights about schema usage and to study specific questions such as: adequacy of controlled vocabularies, detection of common instance patterns, and evolution of different data collections. Our analysis shows DescribeX enhances understanding the instance-level structure of PSI-MI data sources and is a useful tool for standards designers, software developers, and PSI-MI data providers.",

How to access and retrieve the XML data is crucial to these applications. There are two standard ways for accessing and manipulating XML data, the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, when an application needs to traverse through XML data, it is not easy to retrieve the required data with these two standard ways. XML data is impossible to be retrieved back and forth by SAX, and the graph-oriented DOM notation is not easy to work with. With such limitation, the W3C supervises the development of three important languages: XPath [3], XQuery and XSLT for exploring and querying XML. Among these three languages, XPath is the key and cornerstone language for the other two. XPath defines expressions for traversing an XML document and specifies the set of nodes (XPath 1.0) or the sequence of nodes (XPath 2.0) in the XML document.",

Recently, a number of autonomic features have been incorporated into commercial RDBMS; tools for recommending database configurations (i.e., indexes, materialized views, partitions) for a given workload are prominent examples of this promising trend.In this paper, we introduce a flexible characterization of the performance goals of configuration recommenders and develop an experimental evaluation approach to benchmark the effectiveness of these autonomic tools. We focus on exploratory queries and present extensive experimental results using both real and synthetic data that demonstrate the validity of the approach introduced. Our results identify a specific index configuration based on single-column indexes as a very useful baseline for comparisons in the exploratory setting.

The comparison shows that low-cost path summaries combined with optimization strategies achieve essentially the same benefits as more expensive index structures.",

            "abstract": "Run overview We participated in Shot Boundary Detection and Story Segmentation. This page provides a summary of: (1) the approaches tested in the submitted runs; (2) differences in results between the runs; (3) the overall relative contribution of the techniques; and, (4) our overall conclusions. Our approach uses the moving query window technique [12, 13, 14]. 1. We submitted ten runs using only visual features and varied parameters for gradual transition detection as follows: We added a new postprocessing step to our gradual transition detection scheme that was not applied in TREC 2003. We submitted ten additional runs \u2014 numbered rmit11 through rmit20 \u2014 using asr and identical parameters to those above. The asr information is used in a postprocessing step to remove gradual transitions that coincide with spoken words. 2. The threshold level trades between recall and precision: low thresholds favour recall, high thresholds favour precision. Compared to a long history length, a short history length generally improves gradual transition recall with no or little negative effect on precision. Our asr filtering was ineffective. 3. Threshold level has a significant effect on our results , varying recall between 86% and 91.5%, and precision between 82.9% and 90% overall. Increasing history length decreases overall recall and precision by 1%\u20132%. Postprocessing with asr data dramatically reduces recall while precision practically remains. 4. Our new postprocessing step for gradual transitions \u2014 discussed in detail in the paper \u2014 is highly effective. Our exploration of parameters has identified settings that are optimal for television news. We have concluded that threshold settings of 1.7 or 1.8, and a history length of 1 works best. 1. We submitted six runs, with variations of a moving window size: 2. Runs for conditions 1 and 3 have reasonable recall but low precision, while runs in condition 2 have better precision but low recall. 3. Using conditions 1 and 3, we truncate stories: the result is reasonable recall but high false positives. Under condition 2, our results are better. 4. Our technique does not combine evidence well, but is a reasonable first attempt. We are continuing our work for TREC 2005. pre frames post frames moving window current frame frame number 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Figure 1: Moving query window with \u2026",

            "abstract": "The W3C XQuery language recommendation, based on a hierarchical and ordered document model, supports a wide variety of constructs and use cases. There is a diversity of approaches and strategies for evaluating XQuery expressions, in many cases only dealing with limited subsets of the language. In this paper we describe an implementation approach that handles XQuery with arbitrarily-nested FLWR expressions, element constructors and built-in functions (including structural comparisons). Our proposal maps an XQuery expression to a single equivalent SQL query using a novel dynamic interval encoding of a collection of XML documents as relations, augmented with information tied to the query evaluation environment. The dynamic interval technique enables (suitably enhanced) relational engines to produce predictably good query plans that do not preclude the use of sort-merge join query operators. The benefits are realized despite the challenges presented by intermediate results that create arbitrary documents and the need to preserve document order as prescribed by semantics of XQuery. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that (native or relational) XML systems can benefit from the above technique to avoid a quadratic scale up penalty that effectively prevents the evaluation of nested FLWR expressions for large documents.",

The challenge is becoming more relevant due to increased availability of documents in digital form. Document data has a natural hierarchical structure, which may be made explicit due to the use of markup conventions (as with SGML). An important aspect of managing structured and semistructured textual data consists of supporting the efficient retrieval of text components based both on their content and on their structure. In this paper we study issues related to the expressive power and optimization of a class of algebras that support combining string (or pattern) searches with queries on the hierarchical structure of the text. Theregion algebrastudied is a set-at-a-time algebra for manipulatingtext regions(substrings of the text) that supports finding out nesting and ordering properties of the text regions. This algebra is part of the language in use in commercial text retrieval systems and can form the basis for supporting SQL-like access to textual data. By presenting a close relationship between the region algebra and the monadic first order theory of finite binary trees, we show that queries in the algebra can be optimized, in the sense that equivalence to less expensive expressions can be tested. This optimization can be difficult (co-NP-hard in the general case), but there is an important class of queries that can be optimized in polynomial time. On the negative side, we show that the language is incapable of capturing some important properties of the text structure, related to the nesting and ordering of text regions. We conclude by suggesting possible extensions to increase the expressive power of the language and consider one such example.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing need to develop tools that are able to retrieve relevant textual information rapidly, to present textual information in a meaningful way, and to integrate textual information with related data retrieved from other sources. These tools are critical to support applications within corporate intranets and across the rapidly evolving World Wide Web. This paper introduces a framework for modelling structured text and presents a small set of operations that may be applied against such models. Using these operations structured text may be selected, marked, fragmented, and transformed into relations for use in relational and object-oriented database systems. The extended functionality has been accepted for inclusion within the SQL/MM standard, and a prototype database engine has been implemented to support SQL with the proposed extensions. This prototype serves as a proof of concept intended to address industrial concerns, and it demonstrates the power of the proposed abstract data type for structured text. 1. The challenge Database technology is essential to the operation of conventional business enterprises, and it is becoming increasingly important in the development of distributed information systems. However, most database systems, and in particular relational database systems, provide few facilities for effectively managing the vast body of electronic information embedded within text. Many customers require that large texts be searched both vertically, with respect to their internal structure, and horizontally, with respect to their textual content [Wei85]. Texts often need to be fragmented at appropriate structural boundaries. Sometimes selected text needs to be extracted as separate units, but often the appropriate context surrounding selected text must be recovered, and thus the selected text needs to be marked in some manner, so that it can be subsequently located within a potentially much larger context.",

Hygraphs, a new visual formalism, provides a precise characterization of the diagrammatic visualizations considered. This simple formalism is a convenient abstraction for both graph-based and form-based (or tabular) presentations.

            "abstract": "What kinds of tools should we build to give software engineers better ways of designing, maintaining, and generally understanding large software systems? We claim that software engineers need (among other things) database facilities that support query, exploration, and visualization of software system structure and behaviour. Furthermore, we believe these facilities should be visual, they should be based on formalisms with precise semantics, and they should concentrate on relationships among software objects not on the objects themselves. In recent years, much attention has been paid to the virtues of object-oriented databases to support software engineering and other new applications of database technology (see e.g. [LH91]). The object paradigm emphasizes encapsulation: hiding implementation details behind inviolable interfaces. However, object-oriented systems tend to de-emphasize relationships among objects. Relationships among objects are inherently non-local and non-encapsulated, and therefore they are a strong source of complexity in system design. This high degree of interconnectivity happens both in the large, as interrelations among components of large systems, and in the small, where complex data structures are needed to describe object relationships. Therefore, instead of looking to the OO world for inspiration, we base our approach on the relational model, where relationships are the central concept, and where a universally understood formal model already exists, unlike the chaotic situation in the OO world. Our approach will be to represent software structures with mathematical relations or predicates and to use a formal language to define new predicates and to query the collection of predicates of interest.

            "abstract": "The complexity of managing and controlling large heterogeneous networks requires the availability of management stations equipped with sophisticated tools. A fundamental feature of an advanced network management station is the capability to present to the human manager a comprehensible picture of the relevant scenarios. The tools present at the station must allow the manager specify management functionalities in a graceful manner. But the overwhelming volume and complexity of the information involved in network management poses a major challenge. In this paper we show how the Hy + visual database system fulllls the information presentation and speciication requirements of advanced network management stations. A visual database system is capable of manipulating data visualizations through visually expressed queries. The Hy + system provides a uniform framework for hygraph based data visualizations, queries, and their results. Visual queries, expressed in the GraphLog language, are interpreted as patterns that match existing visualizations and create new ones. A prime example of the functionality supported by the system consists of describing a query that lters a large visu-alization to retain the portion that is of interest for the network manager in the context of a particular task. Examples of data visualizations that are relevant for network management are the network topology at diierent levels of abstraction, the presentation of network connguration information, and the display of management information bases and their history traces. Employing a fault management scenario as motivation, we demonstrate how the Hy + system deals with all of the above visualizations and several of their combinations, as well as entirely new ones generated through ad-hoc visual queries. With the aid of this system a network manager can also specify network management functionalities as declarative GraphLog queries, for example, deene alerts.",

The Hy+ visualization system and GraphLog query language provide these facilities. They support not just a fixed way of visualizing data, but visualizations that can be specified and manipulated through declarative queries, like data are manipulated in a database. In this paper we show how the Hy+/GraphLog system can be used by network managers or distributed debuggers to meet their information manipulation and visualization goals.With the aid of this system, a network manager can specify network management functions as declarative data manipulation statements (GraphLog queries), for example, to define alerts. The manager can also filter network management information and control the layout and aspect of the resulting visualizations.In the same way, the Hy+/GraphLog system can be used for debugging of distributed and parallel applications by specifying normal or abnormal patterns that the programmer is looking for as declarative GraphLog queries and manipulating the resulting visualizations to understand the behavior of the program.",

Hy+ provides a user interface with extensive support for visualizing structural (or relational) data as hygraphs (of which labelled graphs are a special case). Hygraphs, defined in [Con92], are a hybrid between Harel\u2019s higraphs [Har88] and directed hypergraphs. Hygraphs constitute a convenient abstraction that generalizes several diagrammatic notations. The Hy+ system supports visualizations of the actual database instances, and not just diagrammatic representations of the database schema, Given the large volume of data that the system must present to the user, it is fundamental to provide her with two fundamental capabilities. The first one is the ability to define new relationships by using queries. This is pretty much the traditional way of using database queries: the newly defined relationship either gives a direct answer to a user question, or it provides a new view on the existing data. The derived data can later be presented visually by the system. The second capability is an innovative way of using queries to decide what data to show. Using this capability the user can selectively restrict the amount of information to be displayed, This filtering of relevant information is fundamental if one is to have any hope of conveying manageable volumes of visual information to the user. Selective data visualization can be used to locate relevant data and to restrict visualization to interesting portions of it (i.e., deciding what data to present), and can also be used to control the level of detail at which the data is presented (i.e., choosing how to see the data). To describe queries, Hy+ relies on a visual pattern-based notation. The patterns are expressions of the GraphLog query language [Con89, CM90b]. Overall, the system supports query visualization (i.e., presenting the description of the",

            "abstract": "The video presentation \u201cThe G+/GraphLog Visual Query System\u201d gives an overview of the capabilities of the ongoing implementation of the G+ Visual Query System for visualizing both data and queries as graphs. The system provides an environment for expressing queries in GraphLog [Con89, CM89, CM90], as well as for browsing, displaying and editing graphs. The visual query system also supports displaying the answers in several different ways.\nGraphs are a very natural representation for data in many application domains, for example, transportation networks, project scheduling, parts hierarchies, family trees, concept hierarchies, and Hypertext. From a broader perspective, many databases can be naturally viewed as graphs. In particular, any relational database in which we can identify one or more sets of objects of interest and relationships between them can be represented by mapping these objects into nodes and relationships into edges. In the case of semantic and object-oriented databases, there is a natural mapping of objects to nodes and attributes to edges.\nGraphLog is a visual query language, based on a graph representation of both data and queries, that has evolved from the earlier language G+ [CMW87, CMW89, MW89]. GraphLog queries ask for patterns that must be present or absent in the database graph. Each such pattern, called a query graph, defines new edges that are added to the graph whenever the pattern is found. GraphLog queries are sets of query graphs, called graphical queries. If, when looking at a query graph in a graphical query, we do not find an edge label in the database, then there must exist another query graph in the graphical query defining that edge. The language also supports computing aggregate functions and summarizing along paths.\nThe G+ Visual Query System is currently implemented in Smalltalk-80#8482;, and runs on Sun 3, Sun 4 and Macintosh II workstations. A Graph Editor is available for editing query graphs and displaying database graphs. It supports graph \u201ccutting and pasting\u201d, as well as text editing of node and edge labels, node and edge repositioning and re-shaping, storage and retrieval of graphs as text files, etc. Automatic graph layout is also provided. For editing collections of graphs (such as graphical queries) a Graph Browser is available.\nThe first answer mode supported by the G+ Visual Query System is to return as the result of a GraphLog query a graph with the new edges defined by the graphical query added to the database graph.\nAn alternative way of visualizing answers is by high-lighting on the database graph, one at a time, the paths (or just the nodes) described by the query. This mode is particularly useful to locate interesting starting points for browsing.\nRather than viewing the answers superimposed on the database graph, the user may choose to view them in a Graph Browser. The Graph Browser contains the set of subgraphs of the database graph that were found to satisfy the query.\nFinally, the user may select to collect all the subgraphs of the database graph that satisfy the query together into one new graph. This graph (as well as any other result graph from any of the above mentioned answer modes) in turn may be queried, providing a mechanism for iterative filtering of irrelevant information until a manageable subgraph is obtained.",

            "title": "Expressing structural hypertext queries in graphlog",
            "abstract": "GraphLog is a visual query language in which queries are formulated by drawing graph patterns. The hyperdocument graph is searched for all occurrences of these patterns. The language is powerful enough to allow the specification and manipulation of arbitrary subsets of the network and supports the computation of aggregate functions on subgraphs of the hyperdocument. It can support dynamically defined structures as well as inference capabilities, going beyond current static and passive hypertext systems. The expressive power of the language is a fundamental issue: too little power limits the applications of the language, while too much makes efficient implementation difficult and probably affects ease of use. The complexity and expressive power of GraphLog can be characterized precisely by using notions from deductive database theory and descriptive complexity. In this paper, from a practical point of view, we present examples of GraphLog queries applied to several different hypertext systems, providing evidence for the expressive power of the language, as well as for the convenience and naturalness of its graphical representation. We also describe an ongoing implementation of the language.",
