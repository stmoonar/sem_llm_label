            "abstract": "Transport infrastructure is a fundamental component of the whole infrastructure system and socio-economic development. However, it is still a challenge to identify factors affecting large-scale infrastructure due to the lack of high-quality data and inconsistent methods. To address this issue, this study developed a comparison of data- and knowledge-driven approaches in exploring factors affecting road infrastructure performance in Western Australia using network-level high-resolution road defects data. In data-driven analysis, an optimal parameters-based geographical detectors (OPGD) model, developed based on spatial heterogeneity, was developed to investigate the contributions of explanatory factors from a spatial data perspective. In knowledge-driven analysis, a questionnaire survey was performed through group interviews with regional road management teams to analyze potential explanatory factors. A spatial analytic hierarchy process (S-AHP) approach was implemented to quantify the contributions of factors based on the survey. Finally, the consistency and difference between data- and knowledge-driven approaches are evaluated based on contributions of factors and the predictions of defect risks across the road network. The results indicate that the contributions of factors tend to be similar in both approaches, and the spatial distributions of defect risks predicted by both approaches are highly correlated. The factors and risks analyzed using both methods in rural areas are more consistent than those in urban areas due to the complexity and uncertainty of road defects. Findings from this study are critical to understanding data- and knowledge-driven approaches in transport infrastructure management and determining reasonable approaches for decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring the fatigue of construction equipment operators (CEOs) is critical for preventing accidents and ensuring precision construction occupational health and safety (COHS). However, there exists a theoretical dilemma between centralized technical efficiency and decentralized data privacy. Thus, this study introduces smart work package learning (SWPL), a decentralized deep learning approach to monitor CEOs\u2019 fatigue without privacy exposure risks. To illustrate the feasibility of SWPL as the fatigue classifier, this study implements fatigue monitoring through noninvasive facial images, and SWPL merges the updated parameters of the model from each smart work package (SWP). These updates are then validated by SWPs in the blockchain network and stored on the blockchain. More than 356 videos were derived from 124 operators. The results present that SWPL on decentralized SWP networks outperforms the deep learning model on individual SWP. The computational novelty is SWPL's dynamic parameter aggregation mechanism to avoid parameter exposure in centralized or fixed aggregators. The proposed SWPL will open up advanced developments in precision COHS.",

            "abstract": "Energy consumption in buildings depends on several physical factors, including its physical characteristics, various building services systems/appliances used, and the outdoor environment. However, the occupants\u2019 behavior that determines and regulates the building energy conservation also plays a critical role in the buildings\u2019 energy performance. Compared to physical factors, there are relatively fewer studies on occupants\u2019 behavior. This paper reports a systematic review analysis on occupant behavior and different modeling approaches using the Scopus and Science Direct databases. The comprehensive review study focuses on the current understanding of occupant behavior, existing behavior modeling approaches and their limitations, and key influential parameters on building energy conservation. Finally, the study identifies six significant research gaps for future development: occupant-centered space layout deployment; occupant behavior must be understood in the context of developing or low-income economies; there are higher numbers of quantitative occupant behavior studies than qualitative; the extensive use of survey or secondary data and the lack of real data used in model validation; behavior studies are required for diverse categories building; building information modeling (BIM) integration with existing occupant behavior modeling/simulation. These checklists of the gaps are beneficial for researchers to accomplish the future research in the built environment.",

            "abstract": "Energy efficient building is enhancing a worldwide movement as a policy to lessen the carbon footprint. With the intention of zero energy building in sub-tropical climates, exertion should be placed to minimize the overall energy usage to the greatest scope by incorporating apposite construction skills into the whole design process. Suitable building envelope resources is one of the most effective ways to manage energy flows, minimize energy loss, and maintain a comfortable environment for occupants. In the present paper, a conventional building (Educational) in Hong Kong is considered and the goal is to identify and prioritize the potential energy saving opportunities through the implications of multiple envelopes (walls, windows, etc.) fabric using dynamic BIM-BPS process for potential retrofitting. A conceptual framework is proposed for comprehensive energy assessment using BIM (e.g. Revit 2019) and BPS tools (e.g. e-QUEST) to simulate the energy performance of the building. Using a calibrated model, several high performances envelop fabric are considered to perform a parametric investigation (e.g. walls, windows) through active simulation process. In order to achieve more realistic conditioning, an assumed occupancy profile also considered during the energy analysis. Results have shown that a significant saving of 11.45% in yearly entailed total building energy. The study can help with the decision-making analysis regarding future retrofitting opportunities in a sub-tropical climate.",

            "abstract": "\u2013 Crane operators fatigue is one of the significant constraints should be monitored. Otherwise, it may lead to inefficient crane operations and safety issues. Recently, many deep neural networks have been developed for fatigue monitoring of vehicle drivers by processing the image or video data. However, the challenge is to distinguish the slight variations of facial features among still and motion frames (e.g., nodding and head tilt, yawning and talking). It can be exacerbated in the scenarios for crane operators due to their constant head moving to track the loads\u2019 position and recurrent communication (talking) with crane banksman. In contrast to previous approaches, which models spatial information and traditional temporal information for sequential processing, this study proposes a hybrid model can not only extract the spatial features by customized convolutional neural networks (CNN) but also enrich the modeling dynamic motions in the temporal dimension through the deep bidirectional long short-term memory (DB-LSTM). This hybrid model is trained and evaluated on the very popular dataset NTHU-DDD, and the results show that the proposed architecture achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and outperform the previous models in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Remote building information modeling (BIM) model review collaboration is the trend in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Virtual communication environment is a key factor in a successful collaboration. However, the proper environment has yet to be fully revealed. Therefore, this study aims to identify the effective environment. We identified the environment with three main types and then proposed and developed the corresponding environment namely BIM-based, PC-based virtual BIM reviewer (VBR), and VRbased VBR. A user test has been conducted to evaluate their performance and task loading in finding issues and reaching consensus. In the test, the participants were asked to find four kinds of issues and determine the top five issues and their solutions. The result shows that in finding issues, the average of issues they found in BIM-based, PC-based VBR, and VR-based VBR are 6.57, 9.77, and 9.91. The performance of PC-based VBR and VR-based VBR are no significant difference (\u03b1 = 0. 461462 ) but both of them are significantly better than BIM-based ( \u03b1 = 0. 000339 and 0. 004431 ). However, the averages of task loading in finding issues are 899.50, 813.84, 807.00 with no significant difference. In reaching consensus, the averages of seconds they used are 740.67, 682.93, and 724.40 with no significant difference. However, the averages of task loading in both of PC-based VBR (\u03bc = 721. 00) and VR-based VBR (\u03bc = 718. 10) are significantly lower than BIM-based ( \u03bc = 867. 00, \u03b1 = 0. 009610 and 0. 013879) . In overall, both PCbased VBR and VR-based VBR have better performance in finding issues and lower task loading in reaching consensus.",

            "abstract": "Scaffolding tasks are the most significant workitems in Liquefied Nature Gas (LNG) plant maintenance projects and an effective progress monitoring approach can be beneficial to stakeholders through the better control to the budget and schedule of the entire project. This research is focused on discussing findings and lesson learnt from the scaffolding progress monitoring case study of a LNG plant maintenance project. A novel approach by using Building Information Modelling (BIM) and image processing technologies to automatically estimate scaffolding progress through site photos is being developing. The case study by adopting the developing approach at a real LNG plant is currently carried on. The collected scaffolding photos have been used to iteratively improve the developing approach. The plan of the case execution is outlined and introduced in the paper including the development of an image recognition algorithm for scaffolding progress estimations and a Navisworks plug-in for productivity analysis in terms of cost and schedule. By going through site data collections, observations, data analysis and discussions with related contractors and the operator at site, the feasibility of the approach adoption and related implementation issues are identified. The feedback from industry partners can be summarized into five perspectives: (1) the complexity of scaffolding structure affects the performance of the proposed recognition algorithm a lot; (2) the proposed approach is considered reliable if the average accuracy of the progress estimation can be slightly higher than that of the conventional way; (3) a guideline for data collection process is necessary; (4) reduce site work and shift the work load back to the office is preferred and; (5) the proposed approach benefits implementation contractors the most. It is expected that these findings among the ongoing study can further adjust the development direction and identify following studies for the proposed approach in the future.",

Although notable work has been conducted in the as-built modeling field, the level of automation and ability for programs to recognize semantic information is low. Semantic information, such as an installation schedule for industrial components, is vital for identifying actual construction progress. Unfortunately, as the current practices lack the ability to use robust process mapping to turn such information into corresponding as-built models, the current successful rate of recognition remains low. To fill these gaps, this article describes a new as-built modeling process for industrial components by incorporating segmentation and three-dimensional object recognition techniques from computer vision fields. Following the generation of the as-built model, the tracking process is able to identify schedule delays through deviation analysis between the as-built and four-dimensional as-designed models. The modeling process can be integrated in a concurrent construction environment, which provides precise feedback for planners and site managers to simultaneously maintain the quality of construction plans. A case study is conducted, which demonstrates that the developed process enables as-built modeling with semantic information and automatic construction progress tracking. With a certain number of as-built components of a dehydration module being captured, a successful recognition rate of over 90% is achieved. Furthermore, the processing time of the case study lies within an acceptable time period, which supports efficient progress tracking. The results show the feasibility of the developed process, which promises to save time and labor costs during construction.",

Recent investigations into the potentials of tele-operation have revealed that risks to human safety at the jobsite can be reduced drastically with the removal of the need for many personnel to be physically onsite. This research focused on the interface design of a tele-operated crane considering human attention by using markerless augmented reality (AR) technologies. The attention-based interface has been designed with consideration of how the users\u2019 attention is divided into three view types: focused views, ambient views, and alert views. To verify the usability of the interface, a user test is conducted in a simulated environment using a robot arm. The results indicate that the interface prevented 57% of collisions possibility. The authors also found that the interface resulted in high levels of user satisfaction. The utility rate of the...",
