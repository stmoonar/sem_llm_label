            "abstract": "Testing is one of the most important steps in software development\u2013it ensures the quality of software. Continuous Integration (CI) is a widely used testing standard that can report software quality to the developer in a timely manner during development progress. Performance, especially scalability, is another key factor for High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. There are many existing profiling and performance tools for HPC applications, but none of these are integrated into CI tools. In this work, we propose BeeSwarm, an HPC container based parallel scaling performance system that can be easily applied to the current CI test environments. BeeSwarm is mainly designed for HPC application developers who need to monitor how their applications can scale on different compute resources. We demonstrate BeeSwarm using three different HPC applications: CoMD, LULESH and NWChem. We utilize GitHub Actions and provision resources from Google Compute Engine. Our results show that BeeSwarm can be used for scalability and performance testing of a variety of HPC applications, allowing developers to monitor application performance over time.",

            "abstract": "Computational and data-enabled science and engineering are revolutionizing advances throughout science and society, at all scales of computing. For example, teams in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Exascale Computing Project have been tackling new frontiers in modeling, simulation, and analysis by exploiting unprecedented exascale computing capabilities\u2014building an advanced software ecosystem that supports next-generation applications and addresses disruptive changes in computer architectures. However, concerns are growing about the productivity of the developers of scientific software. Members of the Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software project serve as catalysts to address these challenges through fostering software communities, incubating and curating methodologies and resources, and disseminating knowledge to advance developer productivity and software sustainability. This article discusses how these synergistic activities are advancing scientific discovery\u2014mitigating technical risks by building a firmer foundation for reproducible, sustainable science at all scales of computing, from laptops to clusters to exascale and beyond.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

Continuous Integration (CI) is a widely used testing standard that can report software quality to the developer in a timely manner during development progress. Performance, especially scalability, is another key factor for High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. There are many existing profiling and performance tools for HPC applications, but none of these are integrated into CI tools. In this work, we propose BeeSwarm, an HPC container based parallel scaling performance system that can be easily applied to the current CI test environments. BeeSwarm is mainly designed for HPC application developers who need to monitor how their applications can scale on different compute resources. We demonstrate BeeSwarm using a multi-physics HPC application with Travis CI, GitLab CI and GitHub Actions while using ChameleonCloud and Google Compute Engine as the compute backends. Our results show that BeeSwarm can be used for scalability and performance testing of HPC applications.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a workflow orchestration system that is able to run workflows on both HPC systems and in the cloud using HPC containers. Most existing workflow orchestration systems are only able to run workflows on one system at a time, and thus may be unable to run workflows that require more resources than what some platforms provide, and may also be unable to handle validation and fault tolerance requirements. Users may have access to a number of different systems, perhaps a mix of HPC systems and private and public clouds, but currently are only able to utilize one system at a time for running complex workflows. Utilizing HPC containers, such as Charliecloud, and a subset of the Common Workflow Language (CWL) for representing workflows, we extend the BEE Orchestration System to allow for possible scheduling of complex workflows across resources. We design and implement a scheduling component and a component for interacting with OpenStack-based HPC clusters and Google Compute Engine clouds to allow for communication between any combination of Cloud and HPC components. We demonstrate how BEE orchestrates workflows across systems, making it possible to run complex scientific applications across all systems that are available to a user. These results also show that BEE will become a viable alternative to other workflow orchestration systems.",

The code uses the portable C++ parallel programming model that is embodied in the HPX library and being incorporated into the ISO C++ standard. The model represents a significant shift from existing bulk synchronous parallel programming models under consideration for exascale systems. Through the use of the Futurization technique, seemingly sequential code is transformed into wait-free asynchronous tasks. We demonstrate the potential of our model by showing results from strong scaling runs on National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\u2019s Cori system (658,784 Intel Knight\u2019s Landing cores) that achieve a parallel efficiency of 96.8% using billions of asynchronous tasks.",

            "abstract": "Computer architects have been utilizing cache hierarchies to improve performance by minimizing latency of main memory accesses via caching frequently used data closer to the core. The majority of prior research focuses on measuring cache hit rates and data movement for the entire run of an application. We present cache performance metrics as they vary with the execution progression of the application, and show how these metrics can provide improved insight about application behavior. In this work, we present runtime cache utilization, as well as, conventional performance metrics that illustrate a holistic understanding of cache behavior. We built and incorporated a memory simulator into the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST). We measure and analyze the performance for several scientific mini-applications from the APEX and Mantevo suites. This characterization can help identify the critical program points in benchmarks that may reduce the overall simulation time while testing new designs. Moreover, this introductory work enables us to quantify cache behavior for our work that proposes an on-chip memory with dynamic adaptive cache line size that is expected to reduce power consumption.",
