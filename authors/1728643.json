            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications can significantly reduce the cost and timeframe of providing their benefits by taking advantage of the billions of existing IoT sensors and other IoT devices that have been deployed by others in IoT. This paper proposes a self-managed Sensor Sharing Marketplace (SenShaMart) that allows IoT applications to discover, integrate, and pay for the use of sensors that are managed by different parties. In addition to being a self-managed IoT marketplace, SenShaMart is fully autonomic and cannot be controlled by any specific party. IoT applications and IoT sensor providers interact via SenShaMart provided services for semantic description of IoT sensors and their data, semantic query processing, automatic integration of sensors and their data, and IoT sensor payment transactions that control the access to the flow of sensor data according to the sensor payment terms. Self-management and full autonomy are achieved via a specialized SenShaMart blockchain that keeps and manages all data needed by the SenShaMart services that encapsulate it. The paper presents the SenShaMart architecture and service organization, its specialized blockchain, as well as its current performance characteristics and future research.",

Our system allocates operations in the daily time-slots considering devices\u2019 energy bounds to minimize the imported energy from the grid, exploit self-consumption and maximize users\u2019 comfort. We demonstrate GreenCap using a complete prototype system available on Raspberry Pi, developed in Laravel using MariaDB and linked to openHAB framework. In our demonstration scenario, attendees will be able to observe through mobile devices the benefits of GreenCap by simulating its execution with real data for one week, using pre-configured or custom rules.",

            "abstract": "Energy efficiency has become a primary optimization objective due to the global energy crisis and high levels of CO2 emissions. Climate and energy targets have been leading to a growing utilization of solar photovoltaic power generation in residential buildings. As the number of IoT devices drastically increases, their automation through an intelligent home energy management system can provide energy and peak demand savings. The planning optimization of devices can be very challenging due to the unsophisticated user-defined preference rules. Existing solutions face convergence difficulties due to the management of multiple IoT devices tackling multiobjective problems. In this paper, we propose an innovative IoT data system, coined GreenCap, which utilizes a Green Planning evolutionary algorithm for load shifting of IoT-enabled devices, considering the integration of renewable energy sources, multiple constraints, peak-demand times, and dynamic pricing. We have implemented a complete prototype system available on Raspberry Pi and linked with openHAB framework. Our experimental evaluation with extensive real traces shows that the GreenCap prototype system efficiently generates a sustainable plan obtaining high levels of user comfort 92-99% along with \u224852% of self-consumption, while reducing \u224835% of the imported energy from the grid and \u224840% of CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "The exposure to viral airborne diseases is higher in crowded and congested spaces, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need of pedestrian recommendation systems that can recommend less congested paths which minimize exposure to infectious crowd diseases in general. In this paper, we introduce ASTRO-C, an extension of previous work ASTRO, which optimizes for minimum congestion. To our knowledge, ASTRO-C is the only solution to this problem of constraint-satisfying, indoor-outdoor, congestion-based path finding. Our experimental evaluation using randomly generated Indoor-Outdoor graphs with varying constraints matching various real-world scenarios, show that ASTRO-C is able to recommend paths with, on average a 0.62X reduction in average congestion, while on average, total travel time increases by 1.06X and never exceeds 1.10X compared to ASTRO.",

            "title": "Towards a Signature Based Compression Technique for Big Data Storage",
            "abstract": "Although the volume of stored data doubles every year, storage capacity costs decline only at a rate of less than 1/5 per year. At the same time, data is stored in multiple physical locations and remotely retrieved from multiple sites. Thus, minimizing data storage costs while maintaining data fidelity and efficient retrieval is still a key challenge in database systems. In addition to the raw big data, its associated metadata and indexes equally demand tremendous storage that impacts the I/O footprint of data centers. In this vision paper, we propose a new signature-based compression (SIBACO) technique that is able to: (i) incrementally store big data in an efficient way; and (ii) improve the retrieval time for data-intensive applications. SIBACO achieves higher compression ratios by combining and compressing columns differently based on the type and distribution of data and can be easily integrated with column and hybrid stores. We evaluate our proposed tool using real datasets showing that SIBACO outperforms \"monolithic\" compression schemes in terms of storage cost.",

This is achieved by answering a new spatio-temporal query, dubbed ST-Aggregate Join, which calculates the COVID-19 exposure risk of an individual on their devices. It utilizes a special-purpose access structure to record the trajectories of users on their devices and optimize the ST-Aggregate Join processing. We demonstrate interactively using a smartphone application how our system can provide effective contact tracing within a university campus. We also illustrate how our new module is working through an intuitive web interface that shows the exposure risk of a person by coloring the trajectory of the infected person and the person(s) in high risk in a preloaded real dataset.",

            "abstract": "The advancement of renewable energy infrastructure in smart buildings (e.g., photovoltaic) has highlighted the importance of energy self-consumption by energy-demanding IoT-enabled devices (e.g., heating/cooling, electromobility, and appliances), which refers to the process of intelligently consuming energy at the time it is available. This stabilizes the energy grid, minimizes energy dissipation on power lines but more importantly is good for the environment as energy from fossil sources with a high CO2 footprint is minimized. On the other hand, user comfort levels expressed in the form of Rule Automation Workflows (RAW), are usually not aligned with renewable production patterns. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, coined IoT Meta-Control Firewall (IMCF+), which aims to bridge this gap and balance the trade-off between comfort, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. The IMCF+ framework incorporates an innovative Green Planner (GP) algorithm, which is an AI-inspired algorithm that schedules energy consumption with a variety of amortization strategies. We have implemented IMCF+ and GP as part of a complete IoT ecosystem in openHAB and our extensive evaluation shows that we achieve a CO2 reduction of 45\u201359% to satisfy the comfort of a variety of user groups with only a moderate \u2248 3% in reducing their comfort levels.",

In developing CAPRIO, our personalized path recommendation system, usability was a design principle for its interface and accessibility was central in its path-finding algorithm, which currently considers user mobility constraints. Motivated by the recent discussions on algorithm biases as well as diversity and inclusion, we have examined the meaning of accessibility under the lens of inclusion and its role in enhancing CAPRIO's development. In this vision paper we discuss how a system like CAPRIO can become fully inclusive that it benefits users from all backgrounds.",
