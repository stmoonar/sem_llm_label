            "title": "FREME: Multilingual Semantic Enrichment with Linked Data and Language Technologies",
            "abstract": "In the recent years, Linked Data and Language Technology solutions gained popularity. Nevertheless, their coupling in real-world business is limited due to several issues. Existing products and services are developed for a particular domain, can be used only in combination with already integrated datasets or their language coverage is limited. In this paper, we present an innovative solution FREME - an open framework of e-Services for multilingual and semantic enrichment of digital content. The framework integrates six interoperable e-Services. We describe the core features of each e-Service and illustrate their usage in the context of four business cases: i) authoring and publishing; ii) translation and localisation; iii) cross-lingual access to data; and iv) personalised Web content recommendations. Business cases drive the design and development of the framework.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces the FREME project, a new Horizon 2020 innovation action. It aims at building an open framework of e-Services for multilingual and semantic enrichment of digital content, based on a reusable set of open Application Programme Interfaces and Graphical User Interfaces to FREME enrichment services. In addition, the paper discusses how the project deploys Linguistic Linked Data (LLD), especially existing LLD resources, LLD best practices and the LLD reference architecture.",

            "abstract": "We describe translation effects that have been studied in the automated text classification literature. We expand on a point within this research space, quality effects, with our own work in this area. We present an efficient method for evaluating text quality on the basis of reference texts. The method, which is general to text classification problems more widely construed, is related to the background literature and argued to be effective on the strength of the fact that it enables quality checking of amounts of text that exceed what is humanly feasible to verify. The method partially automates the process: in processing the entirety of a translated corpus being probed, it ranks items for stylistic conformity with a reference corpus, and the least conforming ranks are indicated as the items most likely to require human intervention.",
