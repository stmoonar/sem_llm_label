            "title": "RU-AI: A Large Multimodal Dataset for Machine Generated Content Detection",
            "abstract": "The recent advancements in generative AI models, which can create realistic and human-like content, are significantly transforming how people communicate, create, and work. While the appropriate use of generative AI models can benefit the society, their misuse poses significant threats to data reliability and authentication. However, due to a lack of aligned multimodal datasets, effective and robust methods for detecting machine-generated content are still in the early stages of development. In this paper, we introduce RU-AI, a new large-scale multimodal dataset designed for the robust and efficient detection of machine-generated content in text, image, and voice. Our dataset is constructed from three large publicly available datasets: Flickr8K, COCO, and Places205, by combining the original datasets and their corresponding machine-generated pairs. Additionally, experimental results show that our proposed unified model, which incorporates a multimodal embedding module with a multilayer perceptron network, can effectively determine the origin of the data (i.e., original data samples or machine-generated ones) from RU-AI. However, future work is still required to address the remaining challenges posed by RU-AI. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhihaoZhang97/RU-AI.",

            "title": "Game-MUG: Multimodal Oriented Game Situation Understanding and Commentary Generation Dataset",
            "abstract": "The dynamic nature of esports makes the situation relatively complicated for average viewers. Esports broadcasting involves game expert casters, but the caster-dependent game commentary is not enough to fully understand the game situation. It will be richer by including diverse multimodal esports information, including audiences' talks/emotions, game audio, and game match event information. This paper introduces GAME-MUG, a new multimodal game situation understanding and audience-engaged commentary generation dataset and its strong baseline. Our dataset is collected from 2020-2022 LOL game live streams from YouTube and Twitch, and includes multimodal esports game information, including text, audio, and time-series event logs, for detecting the game situation. In addition, we also propose a new audience conversation augmented commentary dataset by covering the game situation and audience conversation understanding, and introducing a robust joint multimodal dual learning model as a baseline. We examine the model's game situation/event understanding ability and commentary generation capability to show the effectiveness of the multimodal aspects coverage and the joint integration learning approach.",
