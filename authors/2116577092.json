            "abstract": "In channel-hopping (CH)-based distributed cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the time duration that secondary users (SUs) spend for establishing communication links is called access delay. To evaluate access delay, we propose an access delay model by jointly considering imperfect spectrum sensing and multi-channel multi-SU transmission, from the cross-layer perspective. The model considers two typical scenarios. The first scenario assumes that the SUs do not use contention scheme (CS) which indicates that the time slot is relatively shorter to just allow a transmission. The second scenario assumes that the SUs employ CS [i.e., modified Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)-based Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) in this paper], which indicates that the time slot is long enough to regulate multiple transmissions. We then propose a bio-inspired algorithm for the first scenario and a self-adaptive step-length algorithm for the second scenario to search for the optimal values of spectrum sensing parameters. The theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the proposed access delay model and show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the most redundant computation. They also show that the optimization of cross-layer parameters can significantly decrease SUs\u2019 access delay. Moreover, we conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the performance of the two scenarios.",

We further analyze the access delay model and compute the optimal parameter combination (e.g., sensing duration and access contention duration) to build a communication link within minimum time duration Theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the proposed optimization approach and show that the optimization of cross-layer parameters can significantly decrease SUs' access delay.

            "abstract": "The tradeoff between decreasing the interference to primary user (PU) and increasing secondary users\u2019 (SUs\u2019) achievable throughput is an important problem in cognitive radio networks. Heterogeneous fading channels from PU to multiple SUs, PU\u2019s traffic distribution, limited SU\u2019s power and multiple SUs\u2019 access contention impact both these two conflicting objectives. In this paper, we study the joint impact of these four factors on the tradeoff. More specifically, we consider that the channels from PU to SUs are exposed to non-identically independent free space path losses, PU\u2019s traffic randomly arrives and departs from the channel, every SU\u2019s average power consumption is limited, while multiple SUs contend to transmit. We first model the impact of these factors on SUs\u2019 spectrum sensing and data transmission. Then, we formulate the tradeoff aiming at maximizing SUs\u2019 aggregated throughput under two constraints: 1) interference probability to PU and 2) SUs\u2019 average power consumption. To solve the optimization problem, we design a novel cluster based particle swarm optimization (C-PSO) algorithm. By iteratively updating the particles in a cluster based on the comparison of their fitnesses, the cluster converges to the optimal solution rapidly. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the C-PSO algorithm and the outperformance of our proposal compared against related contributions which consider the homogeneous fading channel. They also show how the optimal solution varies with path losses and PU\u2019s traffic distribution.",

Non-ideal spectrum sensing in PHY and multiple SUs' access contention in MAC jointly impact SUs' transmission and the tradeoff. In this study, the authors investigate the joint impact from a cross-layer perspective. First, they quantify the reliability of cooperative sensing and compute SUs' transmission probability under the conditions of non-ideal sensing and access contention. Closed-form expressions of the interference probability to PU and SUs' throughput are derived. Specially, two widely-used contention-based MAC protocols, i.e. slotted Aloha and distributed coordination function, are studied. Then, they formulate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem by using interference probability to PU, rather than the detection probability, as the constraint. Finally, a 2-dimension search algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution, including the optimal fusion rule, sensing duration and detection threshold. Simulation results validate the outperformance of the cross-layer scheme. They also demonstrate how the optimal solution varies with some key parameters, i.e. PU's signal-to-noise ratio and the number of contending SUs.",

            "abstract": "Densely deployed WiFi networks will play a crucial role in providing the capacity for next generation mobile internet. However, due to increasing interference, overlapped channels in WiFi networks and throughput efficiency degradation, densely deployed WiFi networks is not a guarantee to obtain higher throughput. An emergent challenge is how to efficiently utilize scarce spectrum resources, by matching physical layer resources to traffic demand. In this aspect, access control allocation strategies play a pivotal role but remain too coarse-grained. As a solution, this research proposes a flexible framework for fine-grained channel width adaptation and multi-channel access in WiFi networks. This approach, named SFCA (Sub-carrier Fine-grained Channel Access), adopts DOFDM (Discontinuous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) at the PHY layer. It allocates the frequency resource with a sub-carrier granularity, which facilitates the channel width adaptation for multi-channel access and thus brings more flexibility and higher frequency efficiency. The MAC layer uses a frequency-time domain backoff scheme, which combines the popular time-domain BEB scheme with a frequency-domain backoff to decrease access collision, resulting in higher access probability for the contending nodes. SFCA is compared with FICA (an established access scheme) showing significant outperformance. Finally we present results for next generation 802.11ac WiFi networks.",

Both imperfect spectrum sensing and multi-channel access contention impact the tradeoff. In this paper, jointly considering imperfect spectrum sensing and multi-channel access contention from cross-layer perspective, we obtain the expressions of interference probability to PUs' and SUs' throughput for both slotted Aloha and distributed coordination function-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. Compared against related contributions, which use detection probability as constraint, we formulate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem by taking the interference probability as the optimization constraint. We further propose to use the access strategies set and exhaustive search on sensing duration to jointly optimize spectrum sensing parameters and access parameters with the objective of a completely cross-layer design. Numerical results show that the proposed cross-layer method can improve SUs' throughput performance significantly by relaxing the requirement of sensing reliability. Moreover, SUs' throughput performance when the realistic multi-channel scenario is taken into account is worse than the predicted performance in related contributions assuming single-channel scenario. In addition, the optimal solution varies with the number of divided sub-channels and frame duration, and thus needs to be carefully designed.",

            "title": "A cross-layer aware sensing-throughput tradeoff in cooperative sensing for cognitive radio networks",
            "abstract": "From cross-layer perspective, the impact of imperfect spectrum sensing and access contention on the cooperative sensing in cognitive radio networks is investigated in the context of the tradeoff between interferences to PUs and aggregated secondary throughput. Jointly considering imperfect spectrum sensing and access contention, we reformulate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem via taking the interference probability, rather than the detection probability, as the optimization constraint, and further obtain the optimal combination of fusion rule, sensing duration and detection threshold to maximize the secondary throughput under the interference probability constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed cross-layer method can improve the secondary throughput performance significantly, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio.",
