            "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a novel 4-DOF two-limb gripper mechanism with a simple design that offers high adaptability for different objects. The mechanism integrates a three-finger end effector and employs a 2-DOF driving system in both serial kinematic chains mounted on the base, addressing performance problems caused by moving actuators. First, the architecture of the gripper mechanism is described, and its mobility is verified. Next, the inverse and forward kinematic problems are solved, and the Jacobian matrix is derived to analyze the singularity conditions. The inverse and forward singularity surfaces are plotted. The workspace is investigated using a search method, and two indices, manipulability and dexterity, are studied. The proposed manipulator\u2019s parameters are optimized for improved dexterity. The novel gripper mechanism has high potential for grasping different types of parts within a large workspace, making it a valuable addition to the field of robotics.",

            "title": "Improved Fragmentation Looped-Functional for Synchronization of Chaotic Lur\u2019e Systems",
            "abstract": "This brief investigates the synchronization problem of chaotic Lur\u2019e systems by employing sampled-data control. First of all, a new fragmentation approach is provided based on two partition coefficients, which can divide the sampling interval into four parts. Next, taking the fragmented states into account, a novel fragmentation looped-functional is constructed. Then, not only the fragmented states, but also the fragmented state system equations are utilized in the sufficient synchronization conditions. Moreover, according to the transformed free-matrix-based integral inequality (TFMBII) and Schur complement, the synchronization criterion is presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Eventually, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed criterion are illustrated through a benchmark numerical example.",
