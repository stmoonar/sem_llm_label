            "abstract": "RAWGraphs is an open source web application for the creation of static data visualisations that are designed to be further modified. Originally conceived for graphic designers to provide a series of tasks not available with other tools, it evolved into a platform that provides simple ways to map data dimensions onto visual variables. It presents a chart-based approach to data visualisation: each visual model is an independent module exposing different visual variables that can be used to map data dimensions. Consequently, users can create complex data visualisations. Finally, the tool is meant to produce outputs that are open, that is, not subjected to proprietary solutions, which can be further edited.",

            "abstract": "The authors' CitySensing system captures at places social media streams and anonymous Call Data Records (CDR) during city-scale events. It semantically annotates the social media streams before fusing it with privacy-preserving aggregates of CDR. The result is analysed and repurposed to feed a public installation where visual story telling assumes a leading role in allowing the audience to perceive emerging patterns and to observe their dynamics. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the visualization on the real-world data of two editions of Milan Design Week. This article is part of a special issue on social multimedia and storytelling.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents digital methods for city analytics, applied to the mapping and activation of an urban area in the city of Amsterdam called the Knowledge Mile. Firstly, we map companies registered in the area and analyse their connections through online hyperlinking. Secondly, we use Instagram, Panoramio and Google Search data to map mostshared photos and high-ranked images of the area. Lastly, we use Foursquare data to map most-shared locations. The produced maps visualize the online presence and resonance of an urban area that is an axis cutting through the city center and crossing many district and neighborhood \u2018borders\u2019. The maps have been used as navigational tools and conversation pieces during workshops and participatory design sessions with local stakeholders.",

City Data Fusion project investigates techniques to visualise the pulse of our cities in real-time by fusing and making sense of all those information flows. It exploits visual data analytics, semantic technologies, and streaming databases. In this poster, we offer insights on City Sensing: an early result of City Data Fusion that allows to visually analyse city scale events such as Milano Design Week.",
