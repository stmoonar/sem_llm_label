            "abstract": "Generating trajectory data is among promising solutions to addressing privacy concerns, collection costs, and proprietary restrictions usually associated with human mobility analyses. However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.",

            "abstract": "The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.",

            "abstract": "Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) are extensively applied across various domains to predict users' next interaction by modeling their interaction sequences. However, these systems typically grapple with the long-tail problem, where they struggle to recommend items that are less popular. This challenge results in a decline in user discovery and reduced earnings for vendors, negatively impacting the system as a whole. Large Language Model (LLM) has the potential to understand the semantic connections between items, regardless of their popularity, positioning them as a viable solution to this dilemma. In our paper, we present LLMEmb, an innovative technique that harnesses LLM to create item embeddings that bolster the performance of SRS. To align the capabilities of general-purpose LLM with the needs of the recommendation domain, we introduce a method called Supervised Contrastive Fine-Tuning (SCFT). This method involves attribute-level data augmentation and a custom contrastive loss designed to tailor LLM for enhanced recommendation performance. Moreover, we highlight the necessity of incorporating collaborative filtering signals into LLM-generated embeddings and propose Recommendation Adaptation Training (RAT) for this purpose. RAT refines the embeddings to be optimally suited for SRS. The embeddings derived from LLMEmb can be easily integrated with any SRS model, showcasing its practical utility. Extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets has shown that LLMEmb significantly improves upon current methods when applied across different SRS models.",

            "abstract": "With the deployment of GPS-enabled devices and data acquisition technology, the massively generated GPS trajectory data provide a core support for advancing spatial-temporal data mining research. Nonetheless, GPS trajectories comprise personal geo-location information, rendering inevitable privacy concerns on plain data. One promising solution to this problem is trajectory generation, replacing the original data with the generated privacy-free ones. However, owing to the complex and stochastic behavior of human activities, generating high-quality trajectories is still in its infancy. To achieve the objective, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory generation (Diff-Traj) framework, effectively integrating the generation capability of the diffusion model and learning from the spatial-temporal features of trajectories. Specifically, we gradually convert real trajectories to noise through a forward trajectory noising process. Then, Diff-Traj reconstructs forged trajectories from the noise by a reverse trajectory denoising process. In addition, we design a trajectory UNet (Traj-UNet) structure to extract trajectory features for noise level prediction during the reverse process. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Diff-Traj can be intuitively applied to generate high-quality trajectories while retaining the original distribution.",

            "abstract": "\u2014The recent surge in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant attention in numerous domains. In order to tailor an LLM to a specific domain such as a web-based healthcare system, fine-tuning with domain knowledge is necessary. However, two issues arise during fine-tuning LLMs for medical applications. The first is the problem of task variety, where there are numerous distinct tasks in real-world medical scenarios. This diversity often results in suboptimal fine-tuning due to data imbalance and seesawing problems. Additionally, the high cost of fine-tuning can be prohibitive, impeding the application of LLMs. The large number of parameters in LLMs results in enormous time and computational consumption during fine-tuning, which is difficult to justify. To address these two issues simultaneously, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-task medical applications called MOELoRA. The framework aims to capitalize on the benefits of both MOE for multi-task learning and LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To unify MOE and LoRA, we devise multiple experts as the trainable parameters, where each expert consists of a pair of low-rank matrices to maintain a small number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we propose a task-motivated gate function for all MOELoRA layers that can regulate the contributions of each expert and generate distinct parameters for various tasks. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on a public multi-task Chinese medical dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that MOELoRA outperforms existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

            "title": "Enhancing Traffic Prediction with Learnable Filter Module",
            "abstract": "Modeling future traffic conditions often relies heavily on complex spatial-temporal neural networks to capture spatial and temporal correlations, which can overlook the inherent noise in the data. This noise, often manifesting as unexpected short-term peaks or drops in traffic observation, is typically caused by traffic accidents or inherent sensor vibration. In practice, such noise can be challenging to model due to its stochastic nature and can lead to overfitting risks if a neural network is designed to learn this behavior. To address this issue, we propose a learnable filter module to filter out noise in traffic data adaptively. This module leverages the Fourier transform to convert the data to the frequency domain, where noise is filtered based on its pattern. The denoised data is then recovered to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform. Our approach focuses on enhancing the quality of the input data for traffic prediction models, which is a critical yet often overlooked aspect in the field. We demonstrate that the proposed module is lightweight, easy to integrate with existing models, and can significantly improve traffic prediction performance. Furthermore, we validate our approach with extensive experimental results on real-world datasets, showing that it effectively mitigates noise and enhances prediction accuracy.",

            "title": "SynMob: Creating High-Fidelity Synthetic GPS Trajectory Dataset for Urban Mobility Analysis",
            "abstract": "Urban mobility analysis has been extensively studied in the past decade using a vast amount of GPS trajectory data, which reveals hidden patterns in movement and human activity within urban landscapes. Despite its significant value, the availability of such datasets often faces limitations due to privacy concerns, proprietary barriers, and quality inconsistencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a synthetic trajectory dataset with high fidelity, offering a general solution to these data accessibility issues. Specifically, the proposed dataset adopts a diffusion model as its synthesizer, with the primary aim of accurately emulating the spatial-temporal behavior of the original trajectory data. These synthesized data can retain the geo-distribution and statistical properties characteristic of real-world datasets. Through rigorous analysis and case studies, we validate the high similarity and utility between the proposed synthetic trajectory dataset and real-world counterparts. Such validation underscores the practicality of synthetic datasets for urban mobility analysis and advocates for its wider acceptance within the research community. Finally, we publicly release the trajectory synthesizer and datasets, aiming to enhance the quality and availability of synthetic trajectory datasets and encourage continued contributions to this rapidly evolving field. The dataset is released for public online availability https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SynMob.",
