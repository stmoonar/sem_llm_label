            "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Ship Location Estimation using Multiple Cameras in Coastal Areas",
            "abstract": "Recent advances, especially in deep learning, allow to effectively detect ship targets in surveillance videos. However, the translation of these detections to the real-world locations of ships has not been sufficiently explored. The common approach in the literature is using a transformation matrix to convert a pixel to a real-world coordinate. However, this approach has three shortcomings: first, a set of reference point pairs has to be manually prepared to establish the matrix; second, the matrix always maps a pixel to the same real-world coordinate, ignoring that there is no one-to-one correspondence between discrete pixel coordinates and continuous real-world coordinates; third, this approach can only work with one camera. In light of this, we propose a technique PixelToRegion that explicitly takes into account the uncertainty in coordinate conversion by mapping each pixel to a spatial polygon. Next, we propose a new algorithm MCbSLE that can estimate ship locations using pixel sets from multiple cameras. The precision of location estimation by MCbSLE is enhanced through spatial intersection between polygons from different cameras. Experiments are conducted under 16 carefully designed multi-camera settings to evaluate MCbSLE w.r.t. four factors: different ports, the number of cameras, the distance between cameras, and camera headings. Results on one-day ship trajectory data show that (1) an 79.8% accuracy in the number of coordinates can be achieved by MCbSLE when there are no more than 10 ships in camera views; (2) using multiple cameras can improve the precision of location estimation by one order of magnitude compared with using one camera.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of shipping CO2 emissions is important for developing regulations to combat the greenhouse effect. Many shipping CO2 emissions models have been proposed in the past decades. However, most of them are only validated for a few specific ships, and there is a lack of data-driven validation and comparison of these models on a large scale. To fill this gap, this study proposes a general evaluation framework to quantitatively validate and compare different emission models. This framework is based on data integration of three types of data sources: ship technical details, AIS trajectory, and weather. Along with emission models, these data are fed into three carefully-designed modules that perform analysis at both grid and trajectory level as well as use annually aggregated fuel consumption ground truth. Extensive experiments are conducted on one-month data from 1,571 ships passing Danish waters to demonstrate the utility of the framework and insights into the accuracy of five popular CO2 emission models are presented.",

            "abstract": "Detection of fishing activities in trajectory data is important for authorities to develop fishery management policies and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing at sea. However, the complex movement patterns of fishing activities challenge existing trajectory segmentation approaches, which may not identify complete fishing activities. In light of this, we propose a window-based trajectory segmentation algorithm which aims to detect fishing activities as completely as possible. Firstly, we introduce a visualization-based technique TPoSTE to help design features characterizing different movement patterns. Secondly, a window-based segmentation algorithm WBS-RLE is proposed to split a trajectory into fishing and non-fishing segments. WBS-RLE first utilizes a pre-trained classifier to label windows in a trajectory as fishing or non-fishing, then it uses the run-length encoding technique to merge those labeled windows into complete fishing activities. The effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over existing approaches are evaluated on a real-world trajectory dataset.",
