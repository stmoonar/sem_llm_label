            "title": "Representative and Back-In-Time Sampling from Real-world Hypergraphs",
            "abstract": "Graphs are widely used for representing pairwise interactions in complex systems. Since such real-world graphs are large and often evergrowing, sampling subgraphs is useful for various purposes, including simulation, visualization, stream processing, representation learning, and crawling. However, many complex systems consist of group interactions (e.g., collaborations of researchers and discussions on online Q&A platforms) and thus are represented more naturally and accurately by hypergraphs than by ordinary graphs. Motivated by the prevalence of large-scale hypergraphs, we study the problem of sampling from real-world hypergraphs, aiming at answering (Q1) how can we measure the goodness of sub-hypergraphs, and (Q2) how can we efficiently find a \u201cgood\u201d sub-hypergraph. Regarding Q1, we distinguish between two goals: (a) representative sampling, which aims at capturing the characteristics of the input hypergraph, and (b) back-in-time sampling, which aims at closely approximating a past snapshot of the input time-evolving hypergraph. To evaluate the similarity of the sampled sub-hypergraph to the target (i.e., the input hypergraph or its past snapshot), we consider 10 graph-level, hyperedge-level, and node-level statistics. Regarding Q2, we first conduct a thorough analysis of various intuitive approaches using 11 real-world hypergraphs. Then, based on this analysis, we propose MiDaS and MiDaS-B, designed for representative sampling and back-in-time sampling, respectively. Regarding representative sampling, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that MiDaS, which employs a sampling bias toward high-degree nodes in hyperedge selection, is (a) Representative: finding overall the most representative samples among 15 considered approaches, (b) Fast: several orders of magnitude faster than the strongest competitors, and (c) Automatic: automatically tuning the degree of sampling bias. Regarding back-in-time sampling, we demonstrate that MiDaS-B inherits the strengths of MiDaS despite an additional challenge\u2014the unavailability of the target (i.e., past snapshot). It effectively handles this challenge by focusing on replicating universal evolutionary patterns, rather than directly replicating the target.",

            "title": "Graphlets over Time: A New Lens for Temporal Network Analysis",
            "abstract": "Graphs are widely used for modeling various types of interactions, such as email communications and online discussions. Many of such real-world graphs are temporal, and specifically, they grow over time with new nodes and edges. Counting the instances of each graphlet (i.e., an induced subgraph isomorphism class) has been successful in characterizing local structures of graphs, with many applications. While graphlets have been extended for temporal graphs, the extensions are designed for examining temporally-local subgraphs composed of edges with close arrival times, instead of long-term changes in local structures. In this paper, as a new lens for temporal graph analysis, we study the evolution of distributions of graphlet instances over time in real-world graphs at three different levels (graphs, nodes, and edges). At the graph level, we first discover that the evolution patterns are significantly different from those in random graphs. Then, we suggest a graphlet transition graph for measuring the similarity of the evolution patterns of graphs, and we find out a surprising similarity between the graphs from the same domain. At the node and edge levels, we demonstrate that the local structures around nodes and edges in their early stage provide a strong signal regarding their future importance. In particular, we significantly improve the predictability of the future importance of nodes and edges using the counts of the roles (a.k.a., orbits) that they take within graphlets.",

            "title": "Classification of Edge-dependent Labels of Nodes in Hypergraphs",
            "abstract": "A hypergraph is a data structure composed of nodes and hyperedges, where each hyperedge is an any-sized subset of nodes. Due to the flexibility in hyperedge size, hypergraphs represent group interactions (e.g., co-authorship by more than two authors) more naturally and accurately than ordinary graphs. Interestingly, many real-world systems modeled as hypergraphs contain edge-dependent node labels, i.e., node labels that vary depending on hyperedges. For example, on co-authorship datasets, the same author (i.e., a node) can be the primary author in a paper (i.e., a hyperedge) but the corresponding author in another paper (i.e., another hyperedge). In this work, we introduce a classification of edge-dependent node labels as a new problem. This problem can be used as a benchmark task for hypergraph neural networks, which recently have attracted great attention, and also the usefulness of edge-dependent node labels has been verified in various applications. To tackle this problem, we propose WHATsNet, a novel hypergraph neural network that represents the same node differently depending on the hyperedges it participates in by reflecting its varying importance in the hyperedges. To this end, WHATsNet models the relations between nodes within each hyperedge, using their relative centrality as positional encodings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that WHATsNet significantly and consistently outperforms ten competitors on six real-world hypergraphs, and we also show successful applications of WHATsNet to (a) ranking aggregation, (b) node clustering, and (c) product return prediction.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world interactions (e.g., researcher collaborations and email communication) occur among multiple entities. These group interactions are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. In graphs, transitivity is helpful to understand the connections between node pairs sharing a neighbor, and it has extensive applications in various domains. Hypergraphs, an extension of graphs, are designed to represent group relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no examination regarding the transitivity of real-world group interactions. In this work, we investigate the transitivity of group interactions in real-world hypergraphs. We first suggest intuitive axioms as necessary characteristics of hypergraph transitivity measures. Then, we propose a principled hypergraph transitivity measure HyperTrans, which satisfies all the proposed axioms, with a fast computation algorithm Fast-HyperTrans. After that, we analyze the transitivity patterns in real-world hypergraphs distinguished from those in random hypergraphs. Lastly, we propose a scalable hypergraph generator THera. It reproduces the observed transitivity patterns by leveraging community structures, which are pervasive in real-world hypergraphs.

            "abstract": "Sequences of group interactions, such as emails, online discussions, and co-authorships, are ubiquitous; and they are naturally represented as a stream of hyperedges (i.e., sets of nodes). Despite its broad potential applications, anomaly detection in hypergraphs (i.e., sets of hyperedges) has received surprisingly little attention, compared to anomaly detection in graphs. While it is tempting to reduce hypergraphs to graphs and apply existing graph-based methods, according to our experiments, taking higher-order structures of hypergraphs into consideration is worthwhile. We propose HashNWalk, an incremental algorithm that detects anomalies in a stream of hyperedges. It maintains and updates a constant-size summary of the structural and temporal information about the input stream. Using the summary, which is the form of a proximity matrix, HashNWalk measures the anomalousness of each new hyperedge as it appears. HashNWalk is (a) Fast: it processes each hyperedge in near real-time and billions of hyperedges within a few hours, (b) Space Efficient: the size of the maintained summary is a user-specific constant, (c) Effective: it successfully detects anomalous hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs.",

            "abstract": "Hypergraphs, a generalization of graphs, naturally represent groupwise relationships among multiple individuals or objects, which are common in many application areas, including web, bioinformatics, and social networks. The flexibility in the number of nodes in each hyperedge, which provides the expressiveness of hypergraphs, brings about structural differences between graphs and hypergraphs. Especially, the overlaps of hyperedges lead to complex high-order relations beyond pairwise relations, raising new questions that have not been considered in graphs: How do hyperedges overlap in real-world hypergraphs? Are there any pervasive characteristics? What underlying process can cause such patterns? In this work, we closely investigate thirteen real-world hypergraphs from various domains and share interesting observations of the overlaps of hyperedges. To this end, we define principled measures and statistically compare the overlaps of hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs and those in null models. Additionally, based on the observations, we propose , a realistic hypergraph generative model. is (a) Realistic: it accurately reproduces overlapping patterns of real-world hypergraphs, (b) Automatically Fittable: its parameters can be tuned automatically using to generate hypergraphs particularly similar to a given target hypergraph, (c) Scalable: it generates and fits a hypergraph with 0.7 billion hyperedges within few hours.",
