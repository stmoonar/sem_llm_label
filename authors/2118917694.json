            "title": "Robust Angular Synchronization via Directed Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_n\\in[0, 2\\pi)$ from $m$ noisy measurements of their offsets $\\theta_i-\\theta_j \\;\\mbox{mod} \\; 2\\pi.$ Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed $k$-synchronization) is to estimate $k$ groups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existing methods for angular synchronization usually perform poorly in high-noise regimes, which are common in applications. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for the angular synchronization problem, and its heterogeneous extension, by proposing GNNSync, a theoretically-grounded end-to-end trainable framework using directed graph neural networks. In addition, new loss functions are devised to encode synchronization objectives. Experimental results on extensive data sets demonstrate that GNNSync attains competitive, and often superior, performance against a comprehensive set of baselines for the angular synchronization problem and its extension, validating the robustness of GNNSync even at high noise levels.",

            "abstract": "Spectral methods for graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success. Despite their success, many works have shown that existing approaches are mainly focused on low-frequency information which may not be pertinent to the task at hand. Recent efforts have been made to design new graph filters for wider frequency profiles, but it remains an open problem how to learn multi-scale disentangled node embeddings in the graph Fourier domain. In this paper, we propose a graph (signal) sampling and filtering framework, entitled Pyramid Graph Neural Network (PyGNN), which follows the Downsampling-Filtering-Upsampling-Decoding scheme. To be specific, we develop an \u03c9-bandlimited downsampling approach to split input graph into subgraphs for the reduction of high-frequency components, then perform spectral graph filters on subgraphs to achieve node embeddings with different frequency bands, and propose a Laplacian smoothing-based upsampling approach to extrapolate the node embedding on subgraphs to the full set of vertices on the original graph. In the end, we add frequency-aware gated units to decode node embeddings of different frequencies for downstream tasks. Results on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Many real world applications can be formulated as event forecasting on Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) where the occurrence of a timed event between two entities is represented as an edge along with its occurrence timestamp in the graphs.However, most previous works approach the problem in compromised settings, either formulating it as a link prediction task on the graph given the event time or a time prediction problem given which event will happen next. In this paper, we propose a novel model combining Graph Neural Networks and Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) that jointly forecasts multiple link events and their timestamps on communities over a CTDG. Moreover, to scale our model to large graphs, we factorize the jointly event prediction problem into three easier conditional probability modeling problems.To evaluate the effectiveness of our model and the rationale behind such a decomposition, we establish a set of benchmarks and evaluation metrics for this event forecasting task. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model in terms of both model accuracy and training efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Recovering global rankings from pairwise comparisons has wide applications from time synchronization to sports team ranking. Pairwise comparisons corresponding to matches in a competition can be construed as edges in a directed graph (digraph), whose nodes represent e.g. competitors with an unknown rank. In this paper, we introduce neural networks into the ranking recovery problem by proposing the so-called GNNRank, a trainable GNN-based framework with digraph embedding. Moreover, new objectives are devised to encode ranking upsets/violations. The framework involves a ranking score estimation approach, and adds an inductive bias by unfolding the Fiedler vector computation of the graph constructed from a learnable similarity matrix. Experimental results on extensive data sets show that our methods attain competitive and often superior performance against baselines, as well as showing promising transfer ability.

We then use this matrix to construct a novel efficient spectral GNN architecture and conduct extensive experiments on both node clustering and link prediction tasks. In these experiments, we consider tasks related to signed information, tasks related to directional information, and tasks related to both signed and directional information. We demonstrate that our proposed spectral GNN is effective for incorporating both signed and directional information, and attains leading performance on a wide range of data sets. Additionally, we provide a novel synthetic network model, which we refer to as the Signed Directed Stochastic Block Model, and a number of novel real-world data sets based on lead-lag relationships in financial time series.",

In particular, node clustering is an important problem in network analysis. Signed and directed networks are important types of networks that are linked to many real-world problems; their asymmetry provides a challenge for many clustering methods. We propose two graph neural network models for node clustering in signed networks and directed networks, respectively. The methods are end-to-end in combining embedding generation and clustering without an intermediate step. Experimental results on a synthetic signed stochastic block model, a polarized version of it, and real-world data at different scales, demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve comparable or better results than state-of-the-art node clustering methods, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels. The introduced models complement existing well-performing methods through the possibility of including exogenous information, in the form of node-level features or labels.",

In this paper, we propose MagNet, a GNN for directed graphs based on a complex Hermitian matrix known as the magnetic Laplacian. This matrix encodes undirected geometric structure in the magnitude of its entries and directional information in their phase. A \"charge\" parameter attunes spectral information to variation among directed cycles. We apply our network to a variety of directed graph node classification and link prediction tasks showing that MagNet performs well on all tasks and that its performance exceeds all other methods on a majority of such tasks.

            "title": "DIGRAC: Digraph Clustering Based on Flow Imbalance",
            "abstract": "Node clustering is a powerful tool in the analysis of networks. We introduce a graph neural network framework, named DIGRAC, to obtain node embeddings for directed networks in a self-supervised manner, including a novel probabilistic imbalance loss, which can be used for network clustering. Here, we propose \\textit{directed flow imbalance} measures, which are tightly related to directionality, to reveal clusters in the network even when there is no density difference between clusters. In contrast to standard approaches in the literature, in this paper, directionality is not treated as a nuisance, but rather contains the main signal. DIGRAC optimizes directed flow imbalance for clustering without requiring label supervision, unlike existing graph neural network methods, and can naturally incorporate node features, unlike existing spectral methods. Extensive experimental results on synthetic data, in the form of directed stochastic block models, and real-world data at different scales, demonstrate that our method, based on flow imbalance, attains state-of-the-art results on directed graph clustering when compared against 10 state-of-the-art methods from the literature, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels, graph structures, and topologies, and even outperforms supervised methods.",
