            "title": "Cooperative Partial Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for IIoT Based on Decentralized Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Edge computing has become increasingly important to fulfill the diversified Quality-of-Service (QoS) or Quality-of-Experience (QoE) demands for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, such as machine condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, intelligent production scheduling, and production quality control. Due to the heterogeneity of IIoT systems, it is of urgent necessity to concentrate on the cloud\u2013edge\u2013end cooperative partial task offloading and resource allocation (CPTORA) problem for realizing workload balancing, efficient resource utilization, and better QoS/QoE of IIoT applications. However, the challenge lies in how to make real-time, accurate, decentralized task offloading (TO) and resource allocation (RA) decisions for dynamic and device-intensive IIoT. Therefore, this work examines the CPTORA problem for IIoT, aiming at minimizing its long-run overall delay and energy costs. To lower the problem complexity, this problem is decomposed into the TO subproblem and the RA subproblem. Then, an improved soft actor\u2013critic-based decentralized multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm is proposed to address the TO subproblem, where each IIoT device can learn its globally optimal policy and make its decisions independently. This algorithm innovatively combines the divergence regularization, the distributional reinforcement learning, and the value function decomposition methods to improve convergence speed and accuracy of the existing MADRL methods. After receiving the TO decisions of every IIoT device, every edge server employs the Lagrange multiplier method and Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker condition to solve its RA subproblem. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm decreases the overall delay and energy costs more effectively, compared to the other state-of-the-art MADRL approaches.",

            "abstract": "Thickness of thermal barrier coating (TBC) plays an important role in the insulation property of coating. Eddy current (EC) testing could be used to measure the thickness of ceramic coating (TC) for TBCs. However, previous EC testing has made it difficult to decouple the relationship between TC, bond coating (BC), and substrate. In this study, an accurate and simple method of TC thickness measurement is proposed based on the mutual inductance and the transformer model, which is immune to the BC and the substrate. First, an EC system is analyzed using the transformer model. Second, mutual inductance is formulated with the Neumann formula and the Taylor series, and the coupling coefficient is established according to the approximate and simplified mutual inductance expression. Third, the coupling relationship is revealed, and the combination of the change in inductance and the phase signature serves as the new feature to characterize the thickness of TC immune to the variation in BC and substrate. Finally, an EC detection system is designed, and experiments are carried out to evaluate the thickness of TC. The results show that the relative errors are less than 5% and the method has a good inhibition effect on the change in temperature.",

            "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has a great practical value in remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation because the instance-level annotations are not required. The multiple instance learning based methods are mainstream, and two problems should be addressed. First of all, the majority of methods usually detect discriminative parts rather than the whole object. Secondly, the quantity of easy instances is much greater than that of hard instances, which restricts the improvement of WSOD methods. To address the first problem, a multiscale image splitting based feature enhancement (MSFE) module is proposed. The MSFE module splits the input RSI in multiple scales, afterwards, the spatial attention maps (SAMs) are generated from the feature maps of each proposal corresponding to different splitting scales, and are used to calculate the maximum spatial attention map (MSAM). Each SAM is required to approach MSAM, which enforces the MSFE module to learn the feature maps which can highlight the whole object for each positive proposal. To address the second problem, an instance difficulty aware training (IDAT) strategy is proposed. The difficulty of each instance can be quantitatively measured, and is used as the weight of each instance in the training loss. Consequently, the hard instances will be focused in the training process. The ablation study demonstrates the validity of MSFE module and IDAT strategy. The comparisons with nine advanced methods on two RSI benchmarks further validate the overall effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Identification of abnormal and malicious traffic in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) network is critical for IoT security. However, it is worth noting that the majority of recent efforts demand a large amount of tagged traffic to train a machine-learning model. In this paper, we develop MetaIoT, an intelligent approach for identifying malicious traffic. MetaIoT is more accurate and more difficult for attackers to circumvent by taking into account both the local attributes of each traffic source and their global relationships. In MetaIoT, we begin by considering the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of traffic. Then, we introduce a heterogeneous graph (HG) to model the relationships between traffic and employ a relation-based heterogeneous graph attention network to learn node (i.e., traffic) representations over the built HG. Alternatively, MetaIoT addresses the issue of needing enough data for model training through the meta-learning technique. After conducting a comprehensive comparison with the baseline through experiments, our model demonstrated superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios, obtaining an accuracy score of 91.65% and an F1 score of 90.33%. When compared with current state-of-the-art IoT traffic detection models, our model showed the best results.",

            "abstract": "Achieving efficient and robust multi-channel data learning is a challenging task in data science. By exploiting low-rankness in the transformed domain, i.e., transformed low-rankness, tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) has achieved extensive success in multi-channel data representation and has recently been extended to function representation such as Neural Networks with t-product layers (t-NNs). However, it still remains unclear how t-SVD theoretically affects the learning behavior of t-NNs. This paper is the first to answer this question by deriving the upper bounds of the generalization error of both standard and adversarially trained t-NNs. It reveals that the t-NNs compressed by exact transformed low-rank parameterization can achieve a sharper adversarial generalization bound. In practice, although t-NNs rarely have exactly transformed low-rank weights, our analysis further shows that by adversarial training with gradient flow (GF), the over-parameterized t-NNs with ReLU activations are trained with implicit regularization towards transformed low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. We also establish adversarial generalization bounds for t-NNs with approximately transformed low-rank weights. Our analysis indicates that the transformed low-rank parameterization can promisingly enhance robust generalization for t-NNs.",

Such a sensitive frequency-shift scheme is very attractive for fast and highly sensitive terahertz (THz) detection. The MEMS resonator absorbs THz radiation and induces a temperature rise, leading to a shift in its resonance frequency. This frequency shift is proportional to the amount of THz radiation absorbed by the resonator and can be detected and quantified, thereby allowing the THz radiation to be measured. In this review, we present an overview of the THz bolometer based on the doubly clamped MEMS beam resonators in the aspects of working principle, readout, detection speed, sensitivity, and attempts at improving the performance.

            "abstract": "Driver distraction causes a significant number of traffic accidents every year, resulting in economic losses and casualties. Currently, the level of automation in commercial vehicles is far from completely unmanned, and drivers still play an important role in operating and controlling the vehicle. Therefore, driver distraction behavior detection is crucial for road safety. Presently, driver distraction detection primarily relies on traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and supervised learning methods. However, there are still challenges, such as the high cost of labeled data sets, limited ability to capture high-level semantic information, and weak generalization performance. In order to solve these problems, this article proposes a new self-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling (MIM) for driver distraction behavior detection. First, a self-supervised learning framework for MIM is introduced to solve the serious human and material consumption issues caused by data set labeling. Second, the Swin Transformer is employed as an encoder. Performance is enhanced by reconfiguring the Swin Transformer block and adjusting the distribution of the number of window multihead self-attention (W-MSA) and shifted W-MSA (SW-MSA) detection heads across all stages, which leads to model more lightening. Finally, various data augmentation strategies are used along with the best random masking strategy to strengthen the model\u2019s recognition and generalization ability. Test results on a large-scale driver distraction behavior data set show that the self-supervised learning method proposed in this article achieves an accuracy of 99.60%, approximating the excellent performance of advanced supervised learning methods.

In addition, we introduce a novel grounding model GroundNLQ, which employs a multi-modal multi-scale grounding module for effective video and text fusion and various temporal intervals, especially for long videos.

            "abstract": "In the ramp merging area, the forced merging behavior of ramp vehicles will lead to the emergency deceleration of vehicles in the main lane, affecting the normal traffic flow. Based on the technical framework of the Internet of Vehicles and edge computing, this paper proposes a ramp merging algorithm for coordinated control of main lane change and speed planning of multilane highways to improve passenger comfort and reduce traffic congestion in the ramp merge area. The research results show that compared with the uncontrolled natural confluence, the algorithm proposed in this paper significantly improved stationary speed and traffic efficiency. At the same time, the vehicle track is optimized, and the ride comfort is enhanced by smoothing the speed curve.",

            "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of non-stationary narrow-beam channel characteristics is the prerequisite of applying dynamic beamforming technology in high-mobility communication scenarios. This paper proposes a three-dimensional geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for non-stationary narrow-beam channels in high-mobility communication scenarios. In the proposed GBSM, the impact of antenna pattern on angular distribution and the birth-death process of clusters in space-time-frequency (STF) domain are considered. Statistical properties of the proposed model are derived, including STF correlation function and multi-link spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), and the corresponding numerical results are analyzed. Moreover, the proposed model is verified by channel measurements in two high-mobility communication scenarios, such as vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario and high-speed railway scenario, in terms of temporal autocorrelation function, frequency correlation function and multi-link spatial CCF. It shows a good agreement between the measurement and model results, which confirms the reliability of the proposed model.",
