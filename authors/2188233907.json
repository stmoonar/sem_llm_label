            "abstract": "Guiding robots, in the form of canes or cars, have recently been explored to assist blind and low vision (BLV) people. Such robots can provide full or partial autonomy when guiding. However, the pros and cons of different forms and autonomy for guiding robots remain unknown. We sought to fill this gap. We designed autonomy-switchable guiding robotic cane and car. We conducted a controlled lab-study (N=12) and a field study (N=9) on BLV. Results showed that full autonomy received better walking performance and subjective ratings in the controlled study, whereas participants used more partial autonomy in the natural environment as demanding more control. Besides, the car robot has demonstrated abilities to provide a higher sense of safety and navigation efficiency compared with the cane robot. Our findings offered empirical evidence about how the BLV community perceived different machine forms and autonomy, which can inform the design of assistive robots.",

            "abstract": "\u2014Bionic robots are generally considered to have strong \ufb02exibility, adaptability, and stability. Their bionic forms are more likely to interact emotionally with people, which means obvious advantages as socially assistive robots. However, it has not been widely concerned and veri\ufb01ed in the blind and low vision community. In this paper, we explored the guiding performance and experience of bionic quadruped robots compared to wheeled robots. We invited visually impaired participants to complete a) the indoor straight & turn task and obstacle avoidance task in a laboratory environment; b) the outdoor real and complex environment. With the transition from indoor to outdoor, we found that the workload of the bionic quadruped robots changed to insigni\ufb01cant. Moreover, obvious temporal demand indoors changed to signi\ufb01cant mental demand outdoors. Also, there was no signi\ufb01cant advantage of quadruped robots in usability, trust, or satisfaction, which was ampli\ufb01ed outdoors. We concluded that walking noise and the gait of quadruped robots would limit the guiding effect to a certain extent, and the empathetic effect of its zoomorphic form for visually impaired people could not be fully re\ufb02ected. This paper provides evidence for the empirical research of bionic quadruped robots in the \ufb01eld of guiding VI people, pointing out their shortcomings in guiding performance and experience, and has good instructive value for the design of bionic guided robots in the future.",

            "abstract": "Quadruped robots have the potential to guide blind and low vision (BLV) people due to their highly flexible locomotion and emotional value provided by their bionic forms. However, the development of quadruped guide robots rarely involves BLV users' participatory designs and evaluations. In this paper, we conducted two empirical experiments both in indoor controlled and outdoor field scenarios, exploring the benefits and drawbacks of quadruped guide robots. The results show that the nowadays commercial quadruped robots exposed significant disadvantages in usability and trust compared with wheeled robots. It is concluded that the moving gait and walking noise of quadruped robots would limit the guiding effectiveness to a certain extent, and the empathetic effect of its bionic form for BLV users could not be fully reflected. Based on the findings of wheeled robots and quadruped robots' advantages, we discuss the design implications for the future guide robot design for BLV users. This paper reports the first empirical experiment about quadruped guide robots with BLV users and preliminary explores their potential improvement space in substituting guide dogs, which can inspire the further specialized design of quadruped guide robots.",

            "abstract": "Aerial dispersal miniature reconnaissance robots can be used in many areas such as natural disasters, man-power disasters, military reconnaissance and so on. Due to its characteristics of fast response, long detection distance and large coverage area, aerial dispersal miniature reconnaissance robots are suitable for these situations mentioned above. However, aerial dispersal miniature reconnaissance robots demand a portable system which is easy to operate. Moreover, another crucial problem from the aerial dispersal miniature reconnaissance robot is that it demands excellent anti-impact property so that it can be thrown from high altitude. To solve the problems above, this paper presents a framework of this aerial dispersal miniature reconnaissance robot launch module. In addition, the mechanical design of each part of this launch module is presented in this paper. Finally, both simulation and experiments showed that this aerial dispersal miniature reconnaissance robot launch module is reliable and practical.",
