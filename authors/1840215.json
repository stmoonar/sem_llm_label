            "title": "Operational Collective Intelligence of Humans and Machines",
            "abstract": "We explore the use of aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) as a mechanism to help operationalize ``collective intelligence'' of human-machine teams for coordinated actions. We adopt the definition for Collective Intelligence as: ``A property of groups that emerges from synergies among data-information-knowledge, software-hardware, and individuals (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that enables just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone.'' Collective Intelligence emerges from new ways of connecting humans and AI to enable decision-advantage, in part by creating and leveraging additional sources of information that might otherwise not be included. Aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) is a recent key advancement towards Collective Intelligence wherein predictions (X\\% probability that Y will happen) and rationales (why I believe it is this probability that X will happen) are elicited independently from a diverse crowd, aggregated, and then used to inform higher-level decision-making. This research asks whether ACF, as a key way to enable Operational Collective Intelligence, could be brought to bear on operational scenarios (i.e., sequences of events with defined agents, components, and interactions) and decision-making, and considers whether such a capability could provide novel operational capabilities to enable new forms of decision-advantage.",

            "abstract": "While the similarity between two concept words has been evaluated and studied for decades, much less attention has been devoted to algorithms that can compute the similarity of nodes in very large knowledge graphs, like Wikidata. To facilitate investigations and head-to-head comparisons of similarity algorithms on Wikidata, we present a user-friendly interface that allows flexible computation of similarity between Qnodes in Wikidata. At present, the similarity interface supports four algorithms, based on: graph embeddings (TransE, ComplEx), text embeddings (BERT), and class-based similarity. We demonstrate the behavior of the algorithms on representative examples about semantically similar, related, and entirely unrelated entity pairs. To support anticipated applications that require efficient similarity computations, like entity linking and recommendation, we also provide a REST API that can compute most similar neighbors for any Qnode in Wikidata.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting of geopolitical events is a notoriously difficult task, with experts failing to significantly outperform a random baseline across many types of forecasting events. One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

Earlier work on topical user profiling has been directed at enhancing search and personalization functionality, but making such profiles useful for human consumption presents new challenges. With this work, we have taken a first step toward a semantic layout method for topical user profiles. We have developed a topical generalization approach which forms clusters of topics, based on their association with broader topics in the Wikipedia category graph. This approach was evaluated with a task-based user study that reveals several of its current limitations, and indicates directions for its improvement.",

            "abstract": "Fine-grained user profile generation approaches have made it increasingly feasible to display on a profile page in which topics a user has expertise or interest. Earlier work on topical user profiling has been directed at enhancing search and personalization functionality, but making such profiles useful for human consumption presents new challenges. With this work, we have taken a first step toward a semantic layout mode for topical user profiles. We have developed a topical generalization approach which finds coherent groups of topics and adds labels to them, based on their association with broader topics in the Wikipedia category graph. A nested layout mode, employing topical generalization, is compared with a simpler flat layout mode in our user study. The results indicate that users favor the nested structure over flat profiles, but tend to overlook the specific topics on the lower level. We propose a third layout mode to address this issue.",

            "title": "Discovering and Visualising Stories in News",
            "abstract": "Daily news streams often revolve around topics that span over a longer period of time such as the global financial crisis or the healthcare debate in the US. The length and depth of these stories can be such that they become difficult to track for information specialists who need to reconstruct exactly what happened for policy makers and companies. We present a framework to model stories from news: we describe the characteristics that make up interesting stories, how these translate to filters on our data and we present a first use case in which we detail the steps to visualising story lines extracted from news articles about the global automotive industry.",
