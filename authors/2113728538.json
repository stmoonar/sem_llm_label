            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the interactive relations of terrorist organizations is quite helpful for the security department in counter-terrorism. Emerging researches have studied the consequence and influential factors of these relations based on cross-sectional data. However, the dynamic changing of relations between different terrorist organizations over time has not yet been addressed adequately. Longitudinal Network Analysis is considered as an effective method in the studies of political violence, especially based on the Big Data from open source intelligence. In this paper, a framework is proposed for the quantitative analysis of the dynamic change of cooperation relations based on the longitudinal network model. The results have shown that more and more cooperation can be seen between terrorist organizations over time. Although the networks are loosely connected, the rapid expansion of the network scale will have a threat on the international society and lead to the explosion of global terrorist attacks. Important organizations actively involved in cooperation in recent years have also been identified.",

            "abstract": "Behavior analysis and events detection of insurgent organization are important issues in intelligence information research and public security management. Due to the covertness of insurgent activities, the relationships between organization and events are hard to detect. Using open source data provides an effective way to obtain information of organizational activities. One important issue in this field is mining hidden frequency pattern with noisy or incomplete information. In this paper, we study the activities of insurgent organization and related event with news data mined from insurgent website. A covert behavior mining method is proposed to process the open source data and analyze news release behaviors. The method can mine frequency pattern of news releasing in the case of losing part of news information. Three methods are employed to detect the events based on the processed data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through real data. With the results, we show how this method can be used to improve the events detection and surveillance of insurgent organizational activities.",

            "abstract": "Terrorist organizations are not completely independent, however, they frequently interact with each other. Emerging researches have studied the consequence and influential factors of these relationships. But there have rarely been given precise empirical analysis on its interactive strength and effectiveness. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is considered as an effective method to quantify and analyze relationship between different social actors. In this paper, our focus is the cooperation relations between terrorist organizations. Based on the terrorist incident dataset from 1970 to 2014, this paper establishes the cooperation network of terrorist organizations and studies its structural characteristic. The results have shown that both the states of cohesion and separated can be found in the cooperation network. The relationship between organizations is more closely in the central part of the network, and the organizations within the same subgroups have obvious similarities in political goals and activity regions. Additionally, some important organizations in the operational cooperation have been identified. The removing of these organizations will have a significant impact on the cooperation network structure.",
