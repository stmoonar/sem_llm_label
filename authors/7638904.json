            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) is a formidable deep learning framework that enables the analysis and modeling of intricate relationships present in data structured as graphs. In recent years, a burgeoning interest has arisen in exploiting the latent capabilities of GNN for healthcare-based applications, capitalizing on their aptitude for modeling complex relationships and unearthing profound insights from graph-structured data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has systemically reviewed the GNN studies conducted in the healthcare domain. This study has furnished an all-encompassing and erudite overview of the prevailing cutting-edge research on GNN in healthcare. Through analysis and assimilation of studies, current research trends, recurrent challenges, and promising future opportunities in GNN for healthcare applications have been identified. China emerged as the leading country to conduct GNN-based studies in the healthcare domain, followed by the USA, UK, and Turkey. Among various aspects of healthcare, disease prediction and drug discovery emerge as the most prominent areas of focus for GNN application, indicating the potential of GNN for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This study proposed research questions regarding diverse aspects of GNN in the healthcare domain and addressed them through an in-depth analysis. This study can provide practitioners and researchers with profound insights into the current landscape of GNN applications in healthcare and can guide healthcare institutes, researchers, and governments by demonstrating the ways in which GNN can contribute to the development of effective and efficient healthcare systems.",

            "abstract": "In the construction sector, ensuring worker safety is of the utmost significance. In this study, a deep learning-based technique is presented for identifying safety gear worn by construction workers, such as helmets, goggles, jackets, gloves, and footwears. The recommended approach uses the YOLO v7 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to precisely locate these safety items. The dataset utilized in this work consists of labeled images split into training, testing and validation sets. Each image has bounding box labels that indicate where the safety equipment is located within the image. The model is trained to identify and categorize the safety equipment based on the labeled dataset through an iterative training approach. We used custom dataset to train this model. Our trained model performed admirably well, with good precision, recall, and F1-score for safety equipment recognition. Also, the model's evaluation produced encouraging results, with a mAP@0.5 score of 87.7\\%. The model performs effectively, making it possible to quickly identify safety equipment violations on building sites. A thorough evaluation of the outcomes reveals the model's advantages and points up potential areas for development. By offering an automatic and trustworthy method for safety equipment detection, this research makes a contribution to the fields of computer vision and workplace safety. The proposed deep learning-based approach will increase safety compliance and reduce the risk of accidents in the construction industry",

            "abstract": "Voice based applications are ruling over the era of automation because speech has a lot of factors that determine a speakers information as well as speech. Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a blessing in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for efficient communication among humans and devices using Artificial Intelligence technology. Speech is one of the easiest mediums of communication because it has a lot of identical features for different speakers. Nowadays it is possible to determine speakers and their identity using their speech in terms of speaker recognition. In this paper, we presented a method that will provide a speakers geographical identity in a certain region using continuous Bengali speech. We consider eight different divisions of Bangladesh as the geographical region. We applied the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Delta features on an Artificial Neural Network to classify speakers division. We performed some preprocessing tasks like noise reduction and 8-10 second segmentation of raw audio before feature extraction. We used our dataset of more than 45 hours of audio data from 633 individual male and female speakers. We recorded the highest accuracy of 85.44%.",

            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the digital world has propelled sentiment analysis into a critical tool across diverse sectors such as marketing, politics, customer service, and healthcare. While there have been significant advancements in sentiment analysis for widely spoken languages, low-resource languages, such as Bangla, remain largely under-researched due to resource constraints. Furthermore, the recent unprecedented performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications highlights the need to evaluate them in the context of low-resource languages. In this study, we present a sizeable manually annotated dataset encompassing 33,606 Bangla news tweets and Facebook comments. We also investigate zero- and few-shot in-context learning with several language models, including Flan-T5, GPT-4, and Bloomz, offering a comparative analysis against fine-tuned models. Our findings suggest that monolingual transformer-based models consistently outperform other models, even in zero and few-shot scenarios. To foster continued exploration, we intend to make this dataset and our research tools publicly available to the broader research community.",

Additionally, we applied zero-shot learning and utilized a feed-forward network with embeddings for unimodal content. For subtask 1A submission, we used combined BERT-based models (BERT and BERT multilingual), ResNet50, and Feed Forward network and we ranked as 3 rd (Arabic) and 5 th (English). We used feed forward network with embeddings for subtask 1B submission and ranked as 3 rd in Arabic and 6 th in both English and Spanish.

            "abstract": "LSTMs are a type of RNN cell that regulates incoming and outgoing information using text-processing-specific gates. Online retailers, as we all know, have been extremely popular in recent years. Many social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are increasingly used by online shops. As a result, market monitoring is critical. We can monitor user reviews and satisfaction levels using machine learning and deep learning methods. Many projects have been completed in various languages in the past. We use LSTM to work with Bangla text reviews in our research. We acquire an accuracy of 88 percent with this model.",
