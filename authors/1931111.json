            "abstract": "A growing awareness of multi-view learning as an important component in data science and machine learning is a consequence of the increasing prevalence of multiple views in real-world applications, especially in the context of networks. In this paper we introduce a new scalability framework for multi-view subspace clustering. An efficient optimization strategy is proposed, leveraging kernel feature maps to reduce the computational burden while maintaining good clustering performance. The scalability of the algorithm means that it can be applied to large-scale datasets, including those with millions of data points, using a standard machine, in a few minutes. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world benchmark networks of various sizes in order to evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art multi-view subspace clustering methods and attributed-network multi-view approaches.",

            "abstract": "Data clustering and representation learning play an indispensable role in data science. They are very useful to explore massive data in many fields, including information retrieval, natural language processing, bioinformatics, recommender systems, and computer vision. Despite their success, most existing clustering methods are severely challenged by the data generated by modern applications, which are typically high dimensional, noisy, heterogeneous, and sparse or even collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple views where each describes a perspective of the data. This has driven many researchers to investigate new effective clustering models to overcome these difficulties. One promising category of such models relies on representation learning. Indeed, learning a good data representation is crucial for clustering algorithms, and combining the two tasks is a common way of exploring this type of data. The idea is to embed the original data into a low dimensional latent space and then perform clustering on this new space. However, both tasks can be carried out sequentially or jointly. Many clustering algorithms, including deep learning versions, are based on these two modes of combining the two tasks.",

            "abstract": "Subspace clustering seeks to cluster high-dimensional data lying in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in image clustering, but text clustering of document-term matrices, has proved more impervious to advances with this approach, even though text data satisfies the assumptions of subspace clustering. We hypothesize that this is because such matrices are generally sparser and higher-dimensional than images. This, combined with the complexity of subspace clustering, which is generally cubic in the number of inputs, makes its use impractical in the context of text. Here we address these issues with a view to leveraging subspace clustering for networked (or not) text data. We first extend the concept of subspace clustering to co-clustering, which is suitable to deal with document-term matrices because of the interplay engendered between the document and word representations. We then address the sparsity problem through bilateral graph convolution, which promotes the grouping effect that has been credited for the effectiveness of some subspace clustering models. The proposed formulation results in an algorithm that is computationally/spatially efficient. Experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance, in terms of document clustering, word clustering, and computational efficiency, of our proposed approach over the baselines and comparable methods.",

            "abstract": "A common way of partitioning graphs is through minimum cuts. One drawback of classical minimum cut methods is that they tend to produce small groups, which is why more balanced variants such as normalized and ratio cuts have seen more success. However, we believe that with these variants, the balance constraints can be too restrictive for some applications like for clustering of imbalanced datasets, while not being restrictive enough for when searching for perfectly balanced partitions. Here, we propose a new graph cut algorithm for partitioning graphs under arbitrary size constraints. We formulate the graph cut problem as a Gromov-Wasserstein with a concave regularizer problem. We then propose to solve it using an accelerated proximal GD algorithm which guarantees global convergence to a critical point, results in sparse solutions and only incurs an additional ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$ compared to the classical spectral clustering algorithm but was seen to be more efficient.",

            "abstract": "Over the last few years, various multi-view graph clustering methods have shown promising performances. However, we argue that these methods can have limitations. In particular, they are often unnecessarily complex, leading to scalability problems that make them prohibitive for most real-world graph applications. Furthermore, many of them can handle only specific types of multi-view graphs. Another limitation is that the process of learning graph representations is separated from the clustering process, and in some cases these methods do not even learn a graph representation, which severely restricts their flexibility and usefulness. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective linear model that addresses the dual tasks of multi-view attributed graph representation learning and clustering in a unified framework. The model starts by performing a first-order neighborhood smoothing step for the different individual views, then gives each one a weight corresponding to its importance. Finally, an iterative process of simultaneous clustering and representation learning is performed w.r.t. the importance of each view, yielding a consensus embedding and partition of the graph. Our model is generic and can deal with any type of multi-view graph. Finally, we show through extensive experimentation that this simple model consistently achieves competitive performances w.r.t. state-of-the-art multi-view attributed graph clustering models, while at the same time having training times that are shorter, in some cases by orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Representation learning is a central problem of attributed networks (ANs) data analysis in a variety of fields. Given an attributed graph, the objectives are to obtain a representation of nodes and a partition of the set of nodes. Usually, these two objectives are pursued separately via two tasks that are performed sequentially, and any benefit that may be obtained by performing them simultaneously is lost. In this brief, we propose a power-attributed graph embedding and clustering (PAGEC for short) in which the two tasks, embedding and clustering, are considered together. To jointly encode data affinity between node links and attributes, we use a new powered proximity matrix. We formulate a new matrix decomposition model to obtain node representation and node clustering simultaneously. Theoretical analysis shows the close connections between the new proximity matrix and the random walk theory on a graph. Experimental results demonstrate that the PAGEC algorithm performs better, in terms of clustering and embedding, than state-of-the-art algorithms including deep learning methods designed for similar tasks in relation to attributed network datasets with different characteristics.",
