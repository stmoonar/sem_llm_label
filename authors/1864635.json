            "abstract": "HODI is a new shared task for the automatic detection of homotransphobia in Italian presented at EVALITA 2023. The challenge is organized into two subtasks: Subtask A focuses on the binary textual classification of homotransphobic tweets, while Subtask B is concerned with the identification of \u201drationales\u201d for explainability in the form of textual spans of text. We have received a total of 19 runs for Subtask A and 5 runs for Subtask B from a total of 8 participating teams from 6 different countries. We present here an overview of the HODI shared task, the datasets, the evaluation methodology, the results obtained by the participants, and a discussion of the methodology adopted by the teams.

            "abstract": "Despite the importance of understanding causality, corpora addressing causal relations are limited. There is a discrepancy between existing annotation guidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus more on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only explicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an annotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We annotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether it contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News Corpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model performed well with 81.20% F1 score on test set, and 83.46% in 5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora: CausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of these external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64% F1 on the CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an effective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora. Lastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a crowd-sourced annotation exercise. Our annotated corpus is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for causal text mining researchers.",

            "abstract": "The Event Causality Identification Shared Task of CASE 2022 involved two subtasks working on the Causal News Corpus. Subtask 1 required participants to predict if a sentence contains a causal relation or not. This is a supervised binary classification task. Subtask 2 required participants to identify the Cause, Effect and Signal spans per causal sentence. This could be seen as a supervised sequence labeling task. For both subtasks, participants uploaded their predictions for a held-out test set, and ranking was done based on binary F1 and macro F1 scores for Subtask 1 and 2, respectively. This paper summarizes the work of the 17 teams that submitted their results to our competition and 12 system description papers that were received. The best F1 scores achieved for Subtask 1 and 2 were 86.19% and 54.15%, respectively. All the top-performing approaches involved pre-trained language models fine-tuned to the targeted task. We further discuss these approaches and analyze errors across participants\u2019 systems in this paper.",

Task 1 asked to predict which posts in a Twitter stream are worth fact-checking, focusing on COVID-19 and politics in six languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, English, Spanish, and Turkish. A total of 19 teams participated and most submissions managed to achieve sizable improvements over the baselines using Transformer-based models such as BERT and GPT-3. Across the four subtasks, approaches that targetted multiple languages (be it individually or in conjunction, in general obtained the best performance. We describe the dataset and the task setup, including the evaluation settings, and we give a brief overview of the participating systems. As usual in the CheckThat! lab, we release to the research community all datasets from the lab as well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research on finding relevant tweets that can help different stakeholders such as fact-checkers, journalists, and policymakers. \u00a9 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",

            "abstract": "Microaggressions are subtle manifestations of bias (Breitfeller et al., 2019). These demonstrations of bias can often be classified as a subset of abusive language. However, not as much focus has been placed on the recognition of these instances. As a result, limited data is available on the topic, and only in English. Being able to detect microaggressions without the need for labeled data would be advantageous since it would allow content moderation also for languages lacking annotated data. In this study, we introduce an unsupervised method to detect microaggressions in natural language expressions. The algorithm relies on pre-trained wordembeddings, leveraging the bias encoded in the model in order to detect microaggressions in unseen textual instances. We test the method on a dataset of racial and gender-based microaggressions, reporting promising results. We further run the algorithm on out-of-domain unseen data with the purpose of bootstrapping corpora of microaggressions \u201cin the wild\u201d, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive set of probing experiments using a multilingual language model, XLM-R, for temporal relation classification between events in four languages. Results show an advantage of contextualized embeddings over static ones and a detrimen- tal role of sentence level embeddings. While obtaining competitive results against state-of-the-art systems, our probes indicate a lack of suitable encoded information to properly address this task.",

Benchmark datasets, however, are intimately tied to the corpus used for their creation questioning their reliability as well as the robustness of automatic methods. This contribution investigates these aspects showing the impact of unforeseen social and cultural dimensions. We also identify a set of additional issues (OCR quality, named entities) that impact the performance of the automatic methods, especially when used to discover LSC.",
