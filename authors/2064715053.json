            "abstract": "Timely and accurately seizure detection is of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy patients. Existing seizure detection models are often complex and time-consuming, highlighting the urgent need for lightweight seizure detection. Additionally, existing methods often neglect the key characteristic channels and spatial regions of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To solve these issues, we propose a lightweight EEG-based seizure detection model named lightweight inverted residual attention network (LRAN). Specifically, we employ a four-stage inverted residual mobile block (iRMB) to effectively extract the hierarchical features from EEG. The convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is introduced to make the model focus on important feature channels and spatial information, thereby enhancing the discrimination of the learned features. Finally, convolution operations are used to capture local information and spatial relationships between features. We conduct intra-subject and inter-subject experiments on a publicly available dataset. Intra-subject experiments obtain 99.25% accuracy in segment-based detection and 0.36/h false detection rate (FDR) in event-based detection, respectively. Inter-subject experiments obtain 84.32% accuracy. Both sets of experiments maintain high classification accuracy with a low number of parameters, where the multiply accumulate operations (MACs) are 25.86[Formula: see text]M and the number of parameters is 0.57[Formula: see text]M.",

            "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is of great importance in aiding the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy due to the advantages of convenience and economy. Existing seizure detection methods are usually patient-specific, the training and testing are carried out on the same patient, limiting their scalability to other patients. To address this issue, we propose a cross-subject seizure detection method via unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method aims to obtain seizure specific information through shallow and deep feature alignments. For shallow feature alignment, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract seizure-related features. The distribution gap of the shallow features between different patients is minimized by multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancies (MK-MMD). For deep feature alignment, adversarial learning is utilized. The feature extractor tries to learn feature representations that try to confuse the domain classifier, making the extracted deep features more generalizable to new patients. The performance of our method is evaluated on the CHB-MIT and Siena databases in epoch-based experiments. Additionally, event-based experiments are also conducted on the CHB-MIT dataset. The results validate the feasibility of our method in diminishing the domain disparities among different patients.",

            "abstract": "Epilepsy is one kind of neurological disease characterized by recurring seizures. Recurrent seizures can cause ongoing negative mental and cognitive damage to the patient. Therefore, timely diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy are crucial for patients. Manual electroencephalography (EEG) signals analysis is time and energy consuming, making automatic detection using EEG signals particularly important. Many deep learning algorithms have thus been proposed to detect seizures. These methods rely on expensive and bulky hardware, which makes them unsuitable for deployment on devices with limited resources due to their high demands on computer resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight neural network for seizure detection using pure convolutions, which is composed of inverted residual structure and multi-scale channel attention mechanism. Compared with other methods, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, making it possible to deploy on low-cost portable devices for seizures detection. We conduct experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset and achieves 98.7% accuracy, 98.3% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity with 2.68[Formula: see text]M multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and only 88[Formula: see text]K parameters.",

            "abstract": "Seizure prediction can improve the quality of life for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. With the rapid development of deep learning, lots of seizure prediction methods have been proposed. However, seizure prediction based on single convolution models is limited by the inherent defects of convolution itself. Convolution pays attention to the local features while underestimates the global features. The long-term dependence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) data cannot be captured. In view of these defects, a hybrid model called STCNN based on Swin transformer (ST) and 2D convolutional neural network (2DCNN) is proposed. Time-frequency features extracted by short-term Fourier transform (STFT) are taken as the input of STCNN. ST blocks are used in STCNN to capture the global information and long-term dependencies of EEGs. Meanwhile, the 2DCNN blocks are adopted to capture the local information and short-term dependent features. The combination of the two blocks can fully exploit the seizure-related information thus improve the prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. The average seizure prediction sensitivity, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the false positive rate (FPR) are 92.94%, 95.56% and 0.073, respectively.",

            "abstract": "At present, many flight tests of the new aircraft must be carried out by means of structural strength test. The method of resistance strain gauge is the effective method to measure strain in the flight test. However, the resistance strain gauge is used to measure strain, some questions occur. The workload of patch, welding line and sealing sheet is large and the efficiency is relatively low. When there are a large number of test points, the number of sensors and power supply wiring is relatively large, and the number of test channels is inevitably increased, resulting in the increase of the volume and weight of the test system. In addition, the resistance strain measurement method is greatly affected by environmental conditions, which affect the measurement accuracy and reliability. These problems are not well solved in the flight test. In the work, fiber Bragg grating sensors and resistance strain gauge are used to jointly monitor and compare the body strain in the loading process of unmanned aerial vehicle loading. The test shows that the fiber Bragg grating sensors can accurately monitor the strain of the unmanned aerial vehicle body with small errors, which demonstrate great potential in combat missions.",
