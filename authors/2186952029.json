            "title": "Construction of Social Community Knowledge Graph from Wikipedia",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have become a fundamental trend in the fields of healthcare, education, finance, ICT, science, engineering, society, politics, and tourism, etc. The community knowledge graph aims to explore the composition of communities and their relationships through visual social network analysis. However, the process of unstructured data like text raises challenges for knowledge extraction. To automatically build a knowledge graph, this study applies natural language processing and technology of knowledge graph creation. This paper proposes a novel method, Augmented Word Vectors (AWV), which is a word vector representation with lexical features and part-of-speech (POS) features. This work evaluates the performance of AWV on various deep learning models, and the experimental results show that AWV is effective for improving word embedding in the task of named entity recognition. Furthermore, an unsupervised approach based on rules and dependency semantics was applied to extract relations. Specifically, this method achieves high productivity by mapping sentences as dependency trees to extract relations mediated by verbs or nouns. We build a community knowledge graph for Hong Kong political groups by applying our method to the Chinese Wikipedia, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "title": "Sessionvideo: A Novel Approach for Encrypted Traffic Classification via 3D-CNN Model",
            "abstract": "Today encrypted traffic has been used widely on the internet, such as HTTPS and SSH. Network traffic classification plays an important role in network resource management and cyberspace security, and previous machine learning methods face the challenge of identifying and classifying the encrypted traffic. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method based on a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), called SessionVideo. The new approach integrates traffic payload and time feature extraction for application classification. Specifically, our proposed scheme converts the raw traffic into a simple grayscale video, which enables the model to capture the temporal characteristics of the traffic. To verify the effectiveness of this scheme, we build a traffic dataset of 20 applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our 3D-CNN model achieves an accuracy of 97.89% and a weighted average precision of 97.96%. Further, the evaluation metrics of the 3D-CNN model significantly outperform 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN models in the comparison experiments.",

            "title": "Knowledge Distillation based Contextual Relevance Matching for E-commerce Product Search",
            "abstract": "Online relevance matching is an essential task of e-commerce product search to boost the utility of search engines and ensure a smooth user experience. Previous work adopts either classical relevance matching models or Transformer-style models to address it. However, they ignore the inherent bipartite graph structures that are ubiquitous in e-commerce product search logs and are too inefficient to deploy online. In this paper, we design an efficient knowledge distillation framework for e-commerce relevance matching to integrate the respective advantages of Transformer-style models and classical relevance matching models. Especially for the core student model of the framework, we propose a novel method using $k$-order relevance modeling. The experimental results on large-scale real-world data (the size is 6$\\sim$174 million) show that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction accuracy in terms of human relevance judgment. We deploy our method to the anonymous online search platform. The A/B testing results show that our method significantly improves 5.7% of UV-value under price sort mode.",
