            "title": "Towards Graph Machine Learning for Smart Grid Knowledge Graphs in Industrial Scenarios",
            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) demonstrated promising application perspective in different scenarios, especially when combined with Graph Machine Learning (GML) techniques able to interpret and infer over facts. Given the natural network structures of Smart Grid equipment and the exponential growth of electric power data, Smart Grid Knowledge Graphs (SGKGs) provides unprecedented opportunities to manage massive power resources and provide intelligent applications. However, a single representation of the SGKGs is never sufficient to properly exploit GML techniques that leverage different aspects of the KG for various objectives. In this work, we provide a methodology to extract various significant views of the SGKG by iteratively applying a series of transformation to the description of the power network in the IEC CIM standard. Our implementation is based on a declarative approach to guarantee easier portability, and we deploy the transformations as a stateless microservice, facilitating modular integration with the rest of the Smart Grid Semantic Platform. Experimental evaluation on two real power distribution networks demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in highlighting important topological information, without discarding precious additional knowledge present in the SGKG.",

            "abstract": "Recent innovations in Information Technology, Cloud Computing, Big Data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling technological solutions that were previously unimaginable, or usually available only for big IT companies, with impacts in both industry and services. The demonstrator named Smart Grid Semantic Platform (SGSP) has been created using these technologies integrating several aspects of the management of an electricity distribution network. The services deployed on the platform concern the visualization of the topographic data and electricity grid assets, as well as the processing and displaying of historical data related to the operation of the networks and/or the result of Big Data analysis. This paper demonstrates how useful the synergy is between the standard semantic model of the electric network (IEC CIM 61968) and the historical data of the time series of medium voltage electricity consumption analyzed using a Big Data platform. Specifically it illustrates the realization of a use case about the calculation of a load index of the electric lines.",

One of the main outcomes of the project is the development of the Web-of-Cells (WoC) concept for the operation of the future power system characterized by an extremely high penetration of distributed and renewable energy sources. According to the WoC the power system is split into control cells. A cell is defined as a portion of the power grid able to maintain an agreed power exchange at its boundaries by using the internal flexibility of any type available from flexible generators, loads and storage systems. The total amount of internal flexibility in each cell shall be at least enough to compensate the cell generation and load uncertainties in normal operation. In this paper we present the main features of the WoC and some other related aspects of this new control concept together with the main results of from the ELECTRA activity.",

            "abstract": "It is expected that future power systems will be characterized by a high share of renewables. Nowadays, a shift from conventional dispatchable bulk generators to intermittent converter-coupled generation units can be observed. This trend, that will be always more significant in future, will affect the operation of the underlying power systems. Advanced automation and control concepts have the potential to address these challenges by providing new intelligent solutions and products. A proper validation of these new technologies is needed before their field installation. However, suitable development and testing approaches and the corresponding tools able to address system-level issues are partly missing until now. The aim of this paper is to discuss some experiences which have been made with simulation-based approaches in the EU-funded ELECTARA IRP project during the development and testing of a sophisticated distributed real-time control concept and its corresponding functions.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in the future power systems operation is their ability to host high amounts of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). To cope with this, various research activities such as the ELECTRA Integrated Research Project (IRP) propose solutions that can increase the hosting capacity of power systems. Inside ELECTRA a new control framework has been proposed, the Web-of-Cells (WoC), in which the power system is divided into smaller subsystems (cells) and reorganized in new roles and responsibilities. Each cell has to contribute to balance/frequency and voltage controls and it is responsible for its behavior at its boundaries. In this paper, the results of the analysis that was conducted in the frame of the ELECTRA Researcher Exchange (REX) program are presented about the modelling and simulation of the MV reference grid proposed by CIGRE in combination with two of the control Use Cases (UCs) proposed inside ELECTRA, namely Frequency Containment Control (FCC) and Balance Restoration Control (BRC). The control scheme under study makes use of a novel strategy that adaptively allows the cell controller to detect the location of an imbalance and adjust the primary reserves contribution so that local reserves activations take always priority. Simulation results show that the modelling approach presents good accuracy and overall performance, while the controller implemented shows benefits for the system operation.",

The work targets the 2-40 MHz band, and focuses on the average channel gain (ACG), the root-mean-square delay spread (RMS-DS) and the coherence bandwidth. Furthermore, the work presents the relation between the ACG, the RMS-DS and the network topology, and it infers the capacity as a function of the transmission bandwidth under power spectral density or total power constraints.

Among these solutions, the most important are the PoweRline Intelligent Metering Evolution (PRIME), the ERDF G3-PLC, and the G3-FCC.",
