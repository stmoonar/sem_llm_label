            "abstract": "Property Graphs (PGs) are an attractive data model both for business users, and for developers of data management tools. They combine the internal structure helpful in relational databases, where each record has a clearly identified set of attributes, with the flexible structure and support for heterogeneity, common in graph databases. Several useful and/or interesting datasets are available in non-PG data models. These include legacy databases, created before the advent of the PG standards, as well as well-known benchmarks based on real and synthetic data, Open Data published in other formats such as XML, JSON or RDF, etc. Converting such datasets to Property Graphs would enable their exploitation under the PG model. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe an approach to derive, from any (semi)-structured dataset, a PG schema consisting of node types, edge types, and a graph type. Our approach builds on $(i)$ ConnectionLens, a tool for converting (semi)structured datasets into simple data graphs, and $(ii)$ Abstra, which, in a ConnectionLens graph, identifies a set of entities and relationships. This work is the first step towards a universal data migration tool from (semi)-structured data, to PGs.",

The choice we make is to integrate data of any model by migrating (transforming) it into a graph, consisting simply of labeled nodes and edges. Such graphs are much simpler than Property Graphs and more basic even than RDF graphs, since we do not require URI labels on internal nodes. This experience paper gives an overview of our research efforts towards querying, understanding, and exploring the resulting graphs. The contributions we brought are in the areas of data integration, graph exploration, graph querying, and go towards managing semistructured data lakes.",

            "abstract": "Graph databases are enjoying enormous popularity, through both their RDF and Property Graphs (PG) incarnations, in a variety of applications. To query graphs, query languages provide structured, as well as unstructured primitives. While structured queries allow expressing precise information needs, they are unsuited for exploring unfamiliar datasets, as they require prior knowledge of the schema and structure of the dataset. Prior research on keyword search in graph databases do not suffer from this limitation. However, keyword queries do not allow expressing precise search criteria when users do know some.\n \n This tutorial (1.5 hours) builds a continuum between structured graph querying through languages such as SPARQL and GPML, a recently proposed standard for PG querying, on one hand, and graph keyword search, on the other hand. In this space between querying and information retrieval, we analyze the features of modern query languages that go toward unstructured search, discuss their strength, limitations, and compare their computational complexity. In particular, we focus on (\n i\n ) lessons learned from the rich literature of graph keyword search, in particular with respect to result scoring; (\n ii\n ) language mechanisms for integrating\n both\n complex structured querying and powerful methods to search for connections users do not know in advance. We conclude by discussing the open challenges and future work directions.\n",

Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "When graph database users explore unfamiliar graphs, potentially with heterogeneous structure, users may need to find how two or more groups of nodes are connected in a graph, even when users are not able to describe the connections. This is only partially supported by existing query languages, which allow searching for paths, but not for trees connecting three or more node groups.In this work, we formally show how to integrate connecting tree patterns (CTPs, in short) with a graph query language such as GPML [1], SPARQL or Cypher, leading to Extended Queries (or EQs, in short). We then study a set of algorithms for evaluating CTPs; we generalize prior keyword search work to be complete, most importantly by (i) considering bidirectional edge traversal, (ii) allowing users to select any score function for ranking CTP results and (iii) returning all results. To cope with very large search spaces, we propose efficient pruning techniques and formally establish a large set of cases where our best algorithm, MOLESP, is complete even with pruning. Our experiments validate the performance of our algorithms on many synthetic and real-world workloads.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are used to store heterogenous information in the form of graphs. One flexible and non-expert way to query these KGs is to use relationship queries or keyword search. The user can specify a query using keywords referring to entities in the graph. The system then returns a set of relationships among the queried entities. However, effectively querying these graphs is still challenging for a new user. She is not familiar with the entities and relationships in the graph and hence, her queries could often return empty or too few answers. We demonstrate a system called Insta-Search which facilitates effective exploration of KGs using relationship queries. Insta-Search helps the user by giving autocomplete keyword suggestions for partially typed words. It also displays an estimated number of answers that the current query would fetch along with few approximate top-scoring answers. The users also get entity suggestions so that they can iteratively reformulate the query until they find the query with the expected results. On submitting the query, the system returns ranked query results, grouped on the basis of similar information content to enhance result interpretation. No prerequisite knowledge of the data is required by the user to be able to use the system.",

            "abstract": "Graph structured data on the web is now massive as well as diverse, ranging from social networks, web graphs to knowledge-bases. Effectively querying this graph structured data is non-trivial. We are concerned with a class of queries called relationship queries, which are usually expressed as a set of keywords (each keyword denoting a named entity). The results returned are a set of ranked trees, each of which denotes relationships among the various keywords. The result list typically consists of hundreds to thousands of answers. A drawback of showing the entire list to the user is that it hinders result analysis and leads to a bad user experience. We propose KlusTree, which presents clustered results to the users instead of a list of all the results and thus, improves result interpretation and increases diversity in the top results. In our approach, the result trees are represented using language models and are clustered using JS divergence as a distance measure. We compare KlusTree with the well-known approaches based on isomorphism and tree-edit distance based clustering. The user evaluations show that KlusTree outperforms the other two in providing better clustering, thereby enriching user experience, revealing interesting patterns and improving result interpretation by the user.",

            "abstract": "Organisations store huge amounts of data from multiple heterogeneous sources in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). One of the ways to query these KGs is to use SPARQL queries over a database engine. Since SPARQL follows exact match semantics, the queries may return too few or no results. Recent works have proposed query relaxation where the query engine judiciously replaces a query predicate with similar predicates using weighted relaxation rules mined from the KG. The space of possible relaxations is potentially too large to fully explore and users are typically interested in only top-k results, so such query engines use top-k algorithms for query processing. However, they may still process all the relaxations, many of whose answers do not contribute towards top-k answers. This leads to computation overheads and delayed response times. \nWe propose Spec-QP, a query planning framework that speculatively determines which relaxations will have their results in the top-k answers. Only these relaxations are processed using the top-k operators. We, therefore, reduce the computation overheads and achieve faster response times without adversely affecting the quality of results. We tested Spec-QP over two datasets - XKG and Twitter, to demonstrate the efficiency of our planning framework at reducing runtimes with reasonable accuracy for query engines supporting relaxations.",
