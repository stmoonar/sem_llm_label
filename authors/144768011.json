The integration of such disparate disciplines and techniques give the richness to Knowledge Graphs, but also present the challenge to practitioners and theoreticians to know how current advances develop from early techniques in order, on one hand, take full advantage of them, and on the other, avoid reinventing the wheel. This tutorial will provide a historical context on the roots of Knowledge Graphs grounded in the advancements of Logic, Data and the combination thereof.",

            "abstract": "The semantic network of a dictionary is a mathematical structure that represents relationships among words of a language. In this work, we study the evolution of the semantic network of the Spanish dictionary during the last century, beginning in 1925 until 2014. We analysed the permanence and changes of its structural properties, such as size of components, average shortest path length, and degree distribution. We found that global structural properties of the Spanish dictionary network are remarkably stable. In fact, if we remove all the labels from the network, networks from different editions of the Spanish dictionary are practically indistinguishable. On the other hand, local properties change over the years offering insights about the evolution of lexicon. For instance, the neighbourhood of a single word or the shared neighbourhood between a pair of words. This paper presents preliminary evidence that dictionary networks are an interesting language tool and good proxies to study semantic clouds of words and their evolution in a given language.",

Data from all fields of knowledge are shared publicly and interconnected in active initiatives such as Linked Open Data. However, despite the increasing availability of applications managing large-scale RDF information such as RDF stores and reasoning tools, little attention has been given to the structural features emerging in real-world RDF data. Our work addresses this issue by proposing specific metrics to characterise RDF data. We specifically focus on revealing the redundancy of each data set, as well as common structural patterns. We evaluate the proposed metrics on several data sets, which cover a wide range of designs and models. Our findings provide a basis for more efficient RDF data structures, indexes and compressors.",

            "abstract": "Federated SPARQL queries give unified answers from multiple and distributed SPARQL endpoints. A good example may be the collection of stops from different transport companies in the same city to create a route planning application. The performance of the evaluation of these types of queries is usually poor, a fact that makes difficult their use in real-life applications that need good performance requirements. In this paper we present a preliminary analysis on the improvement that can be achieved by using the GRAPH clause in federated SPARQL queries. The main goal is to reduce the search space of such queries by setting the NAMED GRAPH to the graph pattern where the corresponding patterns should be evaluated. We perform a preliminary comparison between a federated query and a rewriting that uses systematically the GRAPH clause. These experiments show that the inclusion of the GRAPH clause may only improve performance of query evaluation between 5% and 10%. These early findings suggest that, although the GRAPH clause may indeed play a role in speeding up federated SPARQL queries, hurdles are yet to be overcome when using the GRAPH clause as named graphs are semantically ambiguous.",

On this line, we propose a data structure that captures a document's fine-grained history and an organic visualization that serves as an interface to it. We evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of the system through a pilot study using documents written by students at a public university.

In fact, implementations as Fuseki and Virtuoso assume different semantics. \nIn this technical report, we provide a semantics of correlation and substitution following the classic philosophy of substitution and correlation in logic, programming languages and SQL. We think this proposal not only fix the current ambiguities and problems, but helps to set a safe formal base to further extensions of the language. \nThis work is part of an ongoing work of Daniel Hernandez. These anomalies in the W3C Specification of SPARQL 1.1 were detected early and reported no later than 2014, when two erratas were registered (cf. this https URL and this https URL).",

We live in the digital era and similarly to the Earth, the Web is simply too large and its interrelations too complex for anyone to grasp much of it through direct observation. Thus, the problem of applying cartographic principles also to digital landscapes is intriguing. We introduce a mathematical formalism that captures the general notion of map of a graph and enables its development and manipulation in a semi-automated way. We describe an implementation of our formalism on the Web of Linked Data graph and discuss algorithms that efficiently generate and combine (via an algebra) regions and maps.

This new environment calls for formal languages and tools to automatize navigation across datasources (nodes in such graph) and enable semantic-aware and Web-scale search mechanisms. In this article we introduce a declarative navigational language for the Web of Linked Data graph called NautiLOD. NautiLOD enables one to specify datasources via the intertwining of navigation and querying capabilities. It also features a mechanism to specify actions (e.g., send notification messages) that obtain their parameters from datasources reached during the navigation. We provide a formalization of the NautiLOD semantics, which captures both nodes and fragments of the Web of Linked Data. We present algorithms to implement such semantics and study their computational complexity. We discuss an implementation of the features of NautiLOD in a tool called swget, which exploits current Web technologies and protocols. We report on the evaluation of swget and its comparison with related work. Finally, we show the usefulness of capturing Web fragments by providing examples in different knowledge domains.",

We argue that new protocols and query languages need to be investigated and dene eight desiderata that an access method should meet in order to be considered sustainable for a mature Web of Data. A reader familiar with the Linked Data literature will already know about the hundreds of Linked Datasets published on the Web: they are mentioned in the introduction to almost every research paper written in the area. They will likewise be familiar with the ubiquitous LOD Cloud, often cited as the realisation of a new emerging \\Web of Data\".

Applications like the Google Knowledge Graph (KG) [227] and the Facebook Graph (FG) [192] build large graphs of entities (e.g., people, places) and their semantic relations (e.g., born in, located in). The KG, by matching keywords in a search request against entities in the graph, enhances Google\u2019s results with structured data in the same spirit of Wikipedia info boxes. The FG by looking at semantic relations between Facebook entities enables searching within this huge social graph. However, both approaches adopt proprietary architectures with idiosyncratic data models and limited support in terms of APIs to access their data and querying capabilities. A precursor of these applications is the Linked Open Data project [275] (see Section 1.6 in Chapter 1). The openness of data and the ground on Web technologies are among the driving forces of Linked Open Data. There is an active community of developers that build applications and APIs both to convert and consume linked data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard data format. These initiatives, which maintain structured information at each node in the Web graph and semantic links between nodes, are making the Web evolve toward a Web of Data (WoD). Fig. 11.1 provides a pictorial representation of the traditional Web and the WoD by looking at the latter from the Linked Open Data perspective. Although sharing a graph-like nature, there are some",

RDF Schema (RDFS) [6] defines the most simple inference in RDF introducing a vocabulary with predefined semantics to describe relationships such as typing of entities and hierarchy relations in classes and properties. This vocabulary allows one to infer new facts, not originally explicit in the RDF graph, by means of a process called RDFS entailment. Traditionally, two types of solutions tackle RDFS entailment. On the one hand, all facts which can be inferred from an RDF graph can be materialized and added to the graph. This is referred to as the graph closure, which allows to easily check if a triple is inferred from the graph. However, the closure can be of size quadratic in the size of the initial graph which is not a practical bound from a database point of view [9]. Although some approaches can compute huge closures on the basis of distributed systems [11, 12], the final (potentially massive) closure has to be still managed and queried, paying costly latencies. On the other hand, one could maintain the original graph and check the entailment on-demand. Unfortunately, these solutions have to pay a potentially large number of I/O accesses at huge scale [5], which disregard a broader adoption whenever a fast response prevails. This scenario claims for forms of lightweight entailment which could make reasoning feasible at Web scale. Solutions will necessarily involve finding space/ time tradeoffs that (i) save storage requirements, and (ii) minimize I/O costs. Some clever form of compression would address both issues which are closely related. In fact, an in-memory solution enables these two objectives to be achieved if the compressed data can be directly accessed without prior decompression, optimizing the memory footprint. This solution would dissuade to maintain graph closures and allows to design an efficient on demand algorithm which performs triple checking in main memory. Our ongoing work, described in the next section, follows the above ideas by compressing the RDF graph using RDF/HDT [3], a data structure known to assure a reduced memory footprint while providing fast triple pattern resolution in main memory [8, 4].",

            "abstract": "Censuses are one of the most relevant types of statistical data, allowing analyses of the population in terms of demography, economy, sociology, and culture. For fine\u2010grained analysis, census agencies publish census microdata that consist of a sample of individual records of the census containing detailed anonymous individual information. Working with microdata from different censuses and doing comparative studies are currently difficult tasks due to the diversity of formats and granularities. In this article, we show that novel data processing techniques can be applied to make census microdata interoperable and easy to access and combine. In fact, we demonstrate how Linked Open Data principles, a set of techniques to publish and make connections of (semi\u2010)structured data on the web, can be fruitfully applied to census microdata. We present a step\u2010by\u2010step process to achieve this goal and we study, in theory and practice, two real case studies: the 2001 Spanish census and a general framework for Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS\u2010I).",

            "abstract": "The massive semantic data sources linked in the Web of Data give new meaning to old features like navigation; introduce new challenges like semantic specification of Web fragments; and make it possible to specify actions relying on semantic data. In this paper we introduce a declarative language to face these challenges. Based on navigational features, it is designed to specify fragments of the Web of Data and actions to be performed based on these data. We implement it in a centralized fashion, and show its power and performance. Finally, we explore the same ideas in a distributed setting, showing their feasibility, potentialities and challenges.",

In addition to the intrinsic challenges of querying graph data is the requirement that networks be restructured, and thus that new values be created. To address these, we introduce a dedicated data model and query \nlanguage, SNQL, founded on previous research on graph databases and on the experience of SN researchers. Technically, it is based in GraphLog and second-order tuple generating dependencies, allowing expressiveness for graph querying and node creation as required by SN, while keeping the complexity of query evaluation in NLOGSPACE.",

This intuition, already advanced by the theories of Autopoiesis and (M,R)-systems, can be mathematically framed in a weird looking equation, full of implications and potentialities: f(f) = f . This equation (here referred as Ouroboros equation), arises in apparently dissimilar contexts, like Robert Rosen\u2019s synthetic view of metabolism, hyperset theory and, importantly, untyped lambda calculus. In this paper we survey how Ouroboros equation appeared in those contexts, with emphasis on Rosen\u2019s (M,R)-systems and Dana Scott\u2019s work on reflexive domains, and explore different approaches to construct solutions to it. We envision that the ideas behind this equation, a unique kind of mathematical concept, initially found in biology, would play an important role towards the development of a true systemic theoretical biology.",

            "abstract": "Publishing open data is going mainstream. There are diverse initiatives, ranging from international agencies to local governments, exposing data publicly in standard formats to foster transparency, innovation and public scrutiny. Nevertheless, the publishing of statistical data still presents huge challenges. Statistical modeling, privacy concerns, statistical secrecy, business models, etc., are still barriers to publishing massive amounts of statistical data without a corresponding requirement for significantly large processing. To date, access is usually restricted to limited views of the data. This paper presents a proposal for publishing census data, by using (1) the W3C open standard RDF; and (2) the design principles of Linked Data. The advantages of such an approach include the flexibility of the data which allows any user to adapt it to diverse applications for disparate purposes; the discovery of new relationships among the data; the accessibility of pieces and views of the data; the possibility of integrating it with other data; and last but not least, the possibility of providing simple services for complex querying, demos and visualizations.",

In this chapter, we examine the problems encountered when handling structural heterogeneity in OLAP and survey techniques that have been proposed to solve them. We show how to incorporate structural heterogeneity in the design of OLAP models. We explain why structural heterogeneity weakens aggregate navigation, the framework that guides users to formulate correct OLAP operations and systems to efficiently process them. We survey different techniques to deal with heterogeneity, including the modeling of heterogeneity by unbalanced dimensions, the solution proposed by Kimball, and the use of null elements to fix heterogeneity. Finally, we present a class of integrity constraints to model structural heterogeneity, called dimension constraints, introduced in previous work of the authors. We show the practical application of dimen-sion constraints to support aggregate navigation and some of the aforementioned techniques for dealing with the problem.",

This paper presents a framework to incorporate temporal reasoning into RDF, yielding temporal RDF graphs. We present a semantics for these kinds of graphs which includes the notion of temporal entailment and a syntax to incorporate this framework into standard RDF graphs, using the RDF vocabulary plus temporal labels. We give a characterization of temporal entailment in terms of RDF entailment and show that the former does not yield extra asymptotic complexity with respect to nontemporal RDF graphs. We also discuss temporal RDF graphs with anonymous timestamps, providing a theoretical framework for the study of temporal anonymity. Finally, we sketch a temporal query language for RDF, along with complexity results for query evaluation that show that the time dimension preserves the tractability of answers",

For instance, there are no standard storage formats promoting reuse, sharing or combination of data sets from dierent sources, and available formats require adjustment of collected data to their representational capabilities, often excluding potentially useful data. In this work we show the necessity and possibility of enhancing data management for social networks. The main technical challenge comes from the very nature of networked data and of the queries and analysis involved. We present preliminary results towards a data storage and manipulation model for social networks which natively supports attributed and dynamic multinets, using the full potentialities of standard database techniques. Following Freeman\u2019s ideas on methodological aspects of social network analysis and based on current practices, we determine requirements, describe a suitable data workflow, and detect current limitations and needs. As a case-study we use DBLP, an online network of computer science authors and publications.",

Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries.",

It is known that the semantics of updates for data models becomes unclear when the model turns, even slightly, more general than a simple relational structure. Using the framework of KatsunoMendelzon, we define a semantics for updates in RDF. Particularly we explore the behavior of this semantics for the \u201cerase\u201d operator (which in general is not expressible in RDF). Our results include a proposal of sound semantics for RDF updates, a characterization of the maximal RDF graph which captures exactly all consequences of the erase operation expressible in RDF, and complexity results about the computation of this graph and updates in RDF in general.",

            "abstract": "In multidimensional data models intended for online analytic processing (OLAP), data are viewed as points in a multidimensional space. Each dimension has structure, described by a directed graph of categories, a set of members for each category, and a child/parent relation between members. An important application of this structure is to use it to infer summarizability, that is, whether an aggregate view defined for some category can be correctly derived from a set of precomputed views defined for other categories. A dimension is called structurally heterogeneous if two members in a given category are allowed to have ancestors in different categories. In this article, we propose a class of integrity constraints, dimension constraints, that allow us to reason about summarizability in heterogeneous dimensions. We introduce the notion of frozen dimensions which are minimal homogeneous dimension instances representing the different structures that are implicitly combined in a heterogeneous dimension. Frozen dimensions provide the basis for efficiently testing the implication of dimension constraints and are a useful aid to understanding heterogeneous dimensions. We give a sound and complete algorithm for solving the implication of dimension constraints that uses heuristics based on the structure of the dimension and the constraints to speed up its execution. We study the intrinsic complexity of the implication problem and the running time of our algorithm.",

            "abstract": "We prove that the computational complexity of the problem of deciding if an equation in a free group has a solution is PSPACE. The problem was proved decidable in 1982 by Makanin, w h o s e algorithm was proved later to be non primitive recursive: this was the best upper bound known for this problem. Our proof consists in reducing equations in free groups to equations in free semigroups with antiinvolution, and presenting an algorithm for deciding equations in free semigroups with antiinvolution.",
