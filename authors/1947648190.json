            "title": "Using health information technology to support the needs of Children with Medical Complexity: Mapping review of consumer informatics applications",
            "abstract": "Background Children with medical complexity (CMC) are fragile populations that require continuous care and supervision. CMC family caregivers experience many challenges trying to address CMC patients' needs which puts these caregivers in a stressful situation that may negatively impact the care of CMC patients. Consumer informatics might help these caregivers in coordinating care. However, few consumer informatics applications explicitly focus on supporting CMC caregivers' needs. Objective This systematic mapping literature review aims to provide an overview and a structured understanding of the consumer informatics designed for CMC and their caregivers. Methods We followed a systematic mapping literature review process to provide an overview of the existing Consumer Informatics literature for CMC, which is the scope of our study. We screened IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PubMed databases using a preset list of mesh terms that cover the use of medical informatics by children with medical complexities and their caregivers. The selected articles are peer-reviewed English publications that were empirically validated from January 2002 to January 2022. After selecting and filtering the articles, we analyzed them based on the preset mapping questions using the following criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, the need addressed, target audience, technology users, and consumer informatics' type. Results The initial search resulted in a number of (N\u2009=\u20092,275) articles, and 17 selected publications were included. The results showed an increasing interest in CMC consumer informatics publications over time. Most of the studies were published in 2021, and feasibility research is the dominant research type. The most used technology was telehealth and telemedicine, followed by mobile health. The technologies addressed various needs, including; coordination & follow-up, medical safety, education & social support, daily living activities, shared decision making, information seeking, and emotional support. Most of the efforts were focused on ensuring good coordination and follow-up. Conclusions CMC consumer informatics is a promising research field to present novel initiatives and approaches to manage the caregivers' workload. Future research should be shifted toward providing more evidence-based studies to examine the effectiveness of CMC consumer informatics solutions and identify the related challenges and limitations.",

            "abstract": "Patients suffer disparities, higher mortality, and unmet medical need due to communication issues with doctors in cancer care. Medical errors are also driving patients to lose trust in their healthcare providers. We need to better analyze and improve patient experience in cancer care. This paper emphasizes on the fact that all components of a complex system are interrelated and interdependent and the behavior of the system depends on these interdependencies. A healthcare system as decorticated in this article is complex and new initiatives like technology adoption are not easily embedded and accepted by all stakeholders. We use the Lean Six Sigma approach (L6S) to show how continuous improvement system thinking methods can help achieve better quality, value chain and performance in healthcare in addition to the organizations\u2019 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) used.",

            "title": "Using Text Mining to Analyze Doctor-Patient Verbal Communication: A Geriatric Depression Case Study",
            "abstract": "Doctor-patient communication has been one of the main areas of research within the healthcare domain. The impact of doctor-patient communication on patient satisfaction and health outcomes has been acknowledged in the literature. The dynamics of doctor-patient communication in a geriatric setting is unique due to the limited physical and cognitive ability of elderly patients; communicating with them requires more attention, patience, and involvement. Geriatric providers are expected to be trained well to communicate with elderly patients with various levels of mental health conditions. In this study, we explored doctor-patient verbal communication patterns using text mining measures and identified differences between depression and non-depression visits. We analyzed a total of 42 doctor-patient encounters. Doctors in the visit were not aware of patients\u2019 depression status before and during the visit. Findings showed that doctors had more feelings linked to anger, fear, and sadness when they saw depressed patients. On the other hand, non-depressed patients used more anger-related communication compared to depressed patients. In conclusion, this study states that different communication strategies and training materials should be developed to accommodate depressed geriatric patients and geriatric providers.",

            "title": "Impact of Gender on Doctor-Patient Communication and Emotion: Exploratory Analysis",
            "abstract": "Doctor-patient communication is one of the essential precursors of patient-centered care. The quality of this communication is influenced by several factors, including providers' communication style and the use of existing technologies. In our previous studies, we measured the impact of health information technology on doctor-patient communication. In this study, we used sentiment analysis to understand the impact of doctor-patient gender dyads on verbal communication. The findings showed a noticeable difference in the communication pattern between the same (concordance) and opposite gender dyads (discordance). The findings of this study also indicate that male doctors tend to talk more and in detail with their patients ($p= 0.01$ for gender concordance; $p=0.01$ during gender discordance) than female doctors did with their patients ($p=0.33$ for gender concordance; $p=0.41$ during gender discordance), irrespective of doctor-patient gender dyads. No significant differences were observed in doctor-patient sentiments and emotions. However, we observed more trust in gender concordance (20.9% & 17.6% of the time). In contrast, gender discordance resulted in more sadness (15.5% & 19.8% of the time), anticipation (17.3%), and joy (16.1% of the time). In conclusion, our study indicates that gender influences doctor-patient verbal communication. Further research with larger sample size is required to thoroughly understand the role of gender in overall healthcare communication.",

In this study, we emphasize on verbal communication and conduct an exploratory analysis to understand how the presence of double screen EHR impacts doctor-patient verbal communication across different races. We use sentiment as a measure of double screen EHR sharing, where positive sentiment indicates preference towards EHR sharing using a double screen and negative sentiment indicates otherwise.
