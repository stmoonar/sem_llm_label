            "title": "Fairness in AI: challenges in bridging the gap between algorithms and law",
            "abstract": "In this paper we examine algorithmic fairness from the perspective of law aiming to identify best practices and strategies for the specification and adoption of fairness definitions and algorithms in real-world systems and use cases. We start by providing a brief introduction of current anti-discrimination law in the European Union and the United States and discussing the concepts of bias and fairness from an legal and ethical viewpoint. We then proceed by presenting a set of algorithmic fairness definitions by example, aiming to communicate their objectives to non-technical audiences. Then, we introduce a set of core criteria that need to be taken into account when selecting a specific fairness definition for real-world use case applications. Finally, we enumerate a set of key considerations and best practices for the design and employment of fairness methods on real-world AI applications.",
