            "title": "Multi-View Fuzzy Classification With Subspace Clustering and Information Granules",
            "abstract": "Multi-view learning becomes increasingly attractive and promising because multimodal or multi-view data are commonly encountered in real-world applications. In this study, we develop a novel multi-view Takagi\u2013Sugeno\u2013Kang (TSK) fuzzy system framework to handle classification problems for such data. We propose an anchor and graph subspace clustering strategy to discover and represent the actual latent data distribution for each view separately. In this way, the discriminate anchors (landmarks) are learned to capture the main structure of the multi-view data. This strategy also provides a computationally efficient clustering algorithm with respect to the number of instances. These resulting anchors are formed as the prototypes of information granules (IGs) for fuzzy modeling. Then we construct an information-granule-based multi-view TSK fuzzy classification model inherited from the natural interpretability of fuzzy rule-based systems. Concretely, the relationship between the multi-view input and label output spaces is depicted by IGs-oriented fuzzy rules. The experimental studies involve various commonly used benchmark datasets, which indicate that our proposed method achieves comparable or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "A coupled multimodal emotional feature analysis (CMEFA) method based on broad\u2013deep fusion networks, which divide multimodal emotion recognition into two layers, is proposed. First, facial emotional features and gesture emotional features are extracted using the broad and deep learning fusion network (BDFN). Considering that the bi-modal emotion is not completely independent of each other, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to analyze and extract the correlation between the emotion features, and a coupling network is established for emotion recognition of the extracted bi-modal features. Both simulation and application experiments are completed. According to the simulation experiments completed on the bimodal face and body gesture database (FABO), the recognition rate of the proposed method has increased by 1.15% compared to that of the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) (without considering the unbalanced contribution of features). Moreover, by using the proposed method, the multimodal recognition rate is 21.22%, 2.65%, 1.61%, 1.54%, and 0.20% higher than those of the fuzzy deep neural network with sparse autoencoder (FDNNSA), ResNet-101 + GFK, C3D + MCB + DBN, the hierarchical classification fusion strategy (HCFS), and cross-channel convolutional neural network (CCCNN), respectively. In addition, preliminary application experiments are carried out on our developed emotional social robot system, where emotional robot recognizes the emotions of eight volunteers based on their facial expressions and body gestures.",

            "abstract": "The introduction of domain knowledge opens new horizons to fuzzy clustering. Then knowledge-driven and data-driven fuzzy clustering methods come into being. To address the challenges of inadequate extraction mechanism and imperfect fusion mode in such class of methods, we propose the Knowledge-induced Multiple Kernel Fuzzy Clustering (KMKFC) algorithm. First, to extract knowledge points better, the Relative Density-based Knowledge Extraction (RDKE) method is proposed to extract high-density knowledge points close to cluster centers of real data structure, and provide initialized cluster centers. Moreover, the multiple kernel mechanism is introduced to improve the adaptability of clustering algorithm and map data to high-dimensional space, so as to better discover the differences between the data and obtain superior clustering results. Second, knowledge points generated by RDKE are integrated into KMKFC through a knowledge-influence matrix to guide the iterative process of KMKFC. Third, we also provide a strategy of automatically obtaining knowledge points, and thus propose the RDKE with Automatic knowledge acquisition (RDKE-A) method and the corresponding KMKFC-A algorithm. Then we prove the convergence of KMKFC and KMKFC-A. Finally, experimental studies demonstrate that the KMKFC and KMKFC-A algorithms perform better than thirteen comparison algorithms with regard to four evaluation indexes and the convergence speed.",

            "abstract": "Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a clustering algorithm based on partition of the universe. However, the partition generated by an equivalence relation is strict in practical application and exhibits relatively poor fault-tolerant mechanism. In this article, a novel binary relation based on improved FCM with the principle of refined justifiable granularity is presented. Different expressions of the proposed binary relation under different values of weight parameter are discussed, and the changes of the properties of the binary relation under different parameter values are provided. By measuring the significance of attributes in the feature space, a feature selection method, called forward heuristic feature selection (FHFS), is designed to construct the low-dimension feature space based on maximizing the original data and information retention through the defined degrees of aggregation and dispersion. It is shown how the results of feature selection and classification performance vary when the values of the weight factor locate in different ranges. To illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed FHFS algorithm, nine high-dimensional datasets and eight image datasets from University of California-Irvine (UCI) repository are used and compared with other feature selection methods, respectively. The results of experimental evaluation and the significance test show that the proposed learning mechanism is a superior algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Generally, fuzzy models, especially rule-based models, are designed in a monolithic manner, meaning that all data are used en bloc to design the model. At the same time, there is a visible need to cope with the ever-increasing volumes of data (both in terms of the number of data and their dimensionality) as well as being faced with distributed data located at various locations. The objective of this article is to develop a concept and provide a design framework as well as assess its performance for constructing a collection of rule-based models on a basis of a randomly sampled repository of data and then realize their aggregation. More specifically, for the sampled data, the design of each model is carried out in a standard way as commonly encountered in the case of Takagi\u2013Sugeno (TS) rule-based models and next augmented by gradient boosting. The aggregation is realized by optimizing a weighting scheme applied to the results of the individual models. Our intent is also to carefully demonstrate the performance offered by the mechanisms of machine learning applied in the setting of rule-based models, which is an original task completed before. A number of high-dimensional data are used in the experimental studies to complete a thorough assessment. A comparative performance analysis is reported with respect to the monolithically developed TS models.",

Soon, autonomous bus operations will be common in urban areas, which will improve sustainability, safety, and the city\u2019s technology. These buses have different operation types. Each operation has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the goal of this study is to serve as a guide for decision-makers during the transition to autonomous buses. Four alternatives are evaluated based on eleven criteria organized under four main aspects, namely autonomous buses for special uses, autonomous buses for last-mile uses, autonomous cars in mixed traffic, and autonomous buses in closed systems. We propose an Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) method for determining the criteria weights and application of fuzzy Dombi Bonferroni (DOBI) methodology for the evaluation of alternatives. When compared to the other three alternatives in this study, the results show that deploying autonomous buses in mixed traffic is the most advantageous option.",

            "abstract": "In group decision making (GDM), consensus level is regarded as a critical criterion to measure the effectiveness and availability of the final group decision solution. Consensus model is aimed at conducting the decision group to reach agreement through the process of group negotiation, advice feedback, and opinion modification, which is time-consuming and rests with the willingness and behavior of individual decision makers. Thus, to guide the shift in the opinions of decision makers within a limited time, it is essential to design an effective, interpretable, and fair consensus mechanism in GDM, which is particularly vital when a mass of decision makers (e.g., more than 30) are involved in the decision process, viz., we encounter a large-scale GDM (LSGDM). With the involvement of information granulation, this study presents a rule-based consensus model in LSGDM by optimally allocating the level of information granularity to each decision maker. The opinions of decision makers in LSGDM are divided into different clusters by engaging the fuzzy $C$ -means method. Inspired by a generic fuzzy rule-based model, the radius of the individual preference granule (PG) is calculated by a weighted linear combination of the granularity levels allocated to the clusters. Then, a consensus model with the optimal allocation of information granularity (CMOIG) is built to determine the granularity level for each cluster by minimizing the sum of radii of individual PG. An interactive consensus reaching process is proposed with the proposed CMOIG and fuzzy modification rules. The CMOIG and fuzzy modification rules simultaneously guarantees high efficiency and interpretability, and the generation method of PGs leads to high fairness due to low discrepancy among the decision group. Finally, numerical and comparative experiments are conducted in detail to verify the validity and superiority of the presented models in terms of the efficiency, interpretability, and fairness.",

            "abstract": "At present, independent scheduling of Earth-observation resources (EORs) is usually difficult to satisfy diverse observation requirements and cannot realize the full potential of space\u2013air resource networks. To utilize EORs comprehensively, this study constructs a divide-and-conquer framework (DCF) for a coordinated scheduling of air and space observation resources (i.e., satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles). The DCF can decompose the original scheduling problem into a task allocation subproblem and multiple task scheduling subproblems that can be solved using a coordination planner and subplanners, respectively. For the task allocation subproblem, we propose a simulated annealing algorithm combined with variable neighborhood adjustment (SA-VNA) method, where a solution variation strategy (SVS) is designed. The SVS iteratively adjusts the task allocation scheme according to the coordinated scheduling result of the last iteration. Based on the allocation scheme, multiple task scheduling subproblems are generated, and existing effective algorithms are used to resolve them. Extensive experiments and comparative analysis show that SA-VNA outperforms several peer algorithms overall, indicating that DCF plus SA-VNA can significantly improve the efficiency of space\u2013air resource networks.",

            "title": "Accelerated Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Based on New Affinity Filtering and Membership Scaling",
            "abstract": "Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a widely used clustering method. However, FCM and its many accelerated variants have low efficiency in the mid-to-late stage of the clustering process. In this stage, all samples are involved in updating their non-affinity centers, and the membership grades of most samples, whose assignments remain unchanged, are still updated by calculating the sample-center distances. All these factors lead to the algorithms converging slowly. In this paper, a new affinity filtering technique is developed to recognize a complete set of non-affinity centers for each sample with low computations. Then, a new membership scaling technique is suggested to set the membership grades between each sample and its non-affinity centers to 0 and maintain the fuzzy membership grades for others. By integrating these two techniques, FCM based on new affinity filtering and membership scaling (AMFCM) is proposed to accelerate the whole convergence process of FCM. Numerous experimental results performed on synthetic and real-world data sets have shown the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, AMFCM is significantly faster and more effective. For example, AMFCM reduces the number of FCM iterations by 80<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zhou-ieq1-3273274.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> on average.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents action research to analyze an approach for assessment of the alleged agile transformation. This approach was implemented at AK Bars Digital Technologies, an IT spin-off of one of the largest banks in Russia using the Scaled Agile Framework. The approach is based on the Goal-Question-Metric approach, non-invasive measurement collection, and systemic analysis. It uses data from several different sources, including interviews, code repositories, user ratings in the play stores, and templates for agile assessment. The effectiveness of the approach is subjectively validated by the adoption of the proposed recommendations by the banks\u2019 senior management. Details are provided on the approach, the required effort from the side of both those assessing and of the people being assessed and the results. The final part of the paper is devoted to the discussion of its generalizability and the plan for future experimentation and refinement.",
