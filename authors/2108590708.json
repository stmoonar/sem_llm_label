            "abstract": "In this article, a novel attention-based reinforced interval type-2 fuzzy clustering neural network (ARIT2FCN) is developed to improve the generalization performance of fuzzy clustering-based neural networks (FCNNs). Commonly, fuzzy rules in FCNNs are generated through the clustering-based rule generator. However, the generated fuzzy rules may not be able to fully describe the given data, because the clustering-based rule generator does not simultaneously consider the intracluster homogeneity and intercluster heterogeneity for both of data characteristics and label information when defining membership functions (MFs) of fuzzy rules. This negatively affects fuzzy rules to accurately quantify the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity and degrades the performance of FCNNs. The ARIT2FCN is proposed with the aid of the attention-based clustering mechanism and the successive learning method. The attention-based clustering mechanism is designed to define MFs by simultaneously considering data characteristics and label information. The successive learning method is adopted to construct the desired fuzzy rules that can capture the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity. Moreover, L$_{2}$ norm regularization is used to alleviate the overfitting effect. The performance of ARIT2FCN is evaluated on machine learning datasets with 16 comparative methods. In addition, two real-world problems are adopted to validate the effectiveness of ARIT2FCN. Experimental results demonstrate that the ARIT2FCN outperforms the comparative methods, and the statistical tests also support the superiority of ARIT2FCN.",

            "abstract": "A novel fuzzy adaptive knowledge-based inference neural network (FAKINN) is proposed in this study. Conventional fuzzy cluster-based neural networks (FCBNNs) suffer from the challenge of a direct extraction of fuzzy rules that can capture and represent the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity when the data possess complex structures. Moreover, the capability of the cluster-based rule generator in FCBNNs may decrease with the increase of data dimensionality. These drawbacks impede the generation of desired fuzzy rules, and affect the inference results depending on the fuzzy rules, thereby limiting their generalization ability. To address these drawbacks, an adaptive knowledge generator (AKG), consisting of the observation paradigm (OP) and clustering strategy (CS), is effectively designed to improve the generalization ability in FAKINN. The OP distills the characteristic information (CI) from data to highlight the homogeneity and heterogeneity of objects, and the CS, viz., the weighted condition-driven fuzzy clustering method (WCFCM), is proposed to summarize the CI to construct fuzzy rules. Moreover, the feedback between the OP and CS can control the dimensionality of CI, which endows FAKINN with the potential to tackle high-dimensional data. The main originality of the study focuses on the AKG and WCFCM that are proposed to develop the structural design methodology of FNNs. The performance of FAKINN is evaluated on various benchmarks with 27 comparative methods, and two real-world problems are adopted to validate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that FAKINN outperforms the comparison methods.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a novel semantic concept-based inference neural network (SCINN) is proposed to develop a design methodology for the explainable deep neuro-fuzzy models and improve their generalization performance in high-dimensional problems. Traditional neuro-fuzzy models exhibit outstanding interpretability in the problems of lower dimensionality. However, when faced with high-dimensional scenarios, the long rule and rule explosion problems damage their interpretability and result in poor generalization performance, even making them unusable. Although deep neuro-fuzzy models show enhanced performance in handling high-dimensional problems compared to traditional counterparts, they often come at the expense of interpretability. To establish a neuro-fuzzy model that can address high-dimensional problems while preserving the interpretability, the SCINN is proposed with the aid of the concept-based measure generation paradigm (CMGP) and the multi-view information augmentation strategy (MIAS). The CMGP is designed to adaptively define the membership functions (MFs) that correspond to the human-understandable concepts based on the given data; the defined MFs contribute to the construction of the explainable fuzzy rule that can directly process high-dimensional data. The MIAS is structured to develop a unified paradigm for implementing consequence functions in the fuzzy rules, which enhances the approximation ability of the SCINN. The performance of SCINN is evaluated on various image datasets against different competitors, including neuro-fuzzy-based approaches and deep structure-based neural networks. A real-world application is adopted to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that SCINN outperforms the compared neuro-fuzzy models and is comparable to the deep structure-based neural networks.",

            "title": "A Novel Grades Prediction Method for Undergraduate Students by Learning Explicit Conditional Distribution",
            "abstract": "Educational data mining (EDM) offers an effective solution to predict students\u2019 course grades in the next term. Conventional grade prediction methods can be viewed as regressing an expectation of the probability distribution of the student's grade, typically called single-value grade prediction. The reliable prediction outcomes of these methods depend on the complete input information related to students. However, next-term grade prediction often encounters the challenge of incomplete input information due to the inaccessibility of future data and the privacy of data. In this scenario, single-value grade prediction struggles to assess students\u2019 academic status, as it may not be represented and assessed by relying on a singular expectation value. This limitation increases the risk of misjudgment, and may lead to errors in educational decision-making. Considering the challenge of collecting complete input information, we shift from traditional single-value predictions to forecasting the explicit probability distribution of the course grade. The probability distribution of the grade can assess the students\u2019 academic status by providing probabilities corresponding to all possible grade values rather than relying solely on an expectation value, which offers the foundation to support the educators\u2019 decision-making. In this article, the course grade distribution prediction (CGDP) model is proposed, aiming to estimate an explicit conditional probability distribution of course grades in the next term. This model can identify at-risk students, offering comprehensive decision-making information for educators and students. To ensure precise distribution predictions, a calibration method is also employed to improve the alignment between predicted and actual probabilities. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in early grade warning for undergraduates, based on real university data.",

            "abstract": "Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are concerned with finding the best solutions for problems with missing analytical details. Most classical methods for such problems are based on strong and fixed a priori assumptions, such as Gaussianity.

In this study, we propose a generative adversarial net-based broad-spectrum global optimizer (OPT-GAN) which estimates the distribution of optimum gradually, with strategies to balance exploration-exploitation trade-off. It has potential to better adapt to the regularity and structure of diversified landscapes than other methods with fixed prior, e.g., Gaussian assumption or separability. \nExperiments on diverse BBO benchmarks and high dimensional real world applications exhibit that OPT-GAN outperforms other traditional and neural net-based BBO algorithms.

However, the insertion model generating linear coding in NEEP breaks the coherence of linear coding of RNNs, because the resulting symbols tend to be cluttered when RNNs learn the incoherent sequence relationships. Meanwhile, the redundancy phenomenon that different RNNs generate the same code results in that lots of solutions with the same performance exist in the search space, and causes the decrease for search efficiency. To address these problems, the linear-dependent multi-interpretation NEEP(LM-NEEP) is proposed in this research. LM-NEEP tackles the incoherence problem by employing a linear dependence strategy, and the multi-interpretation strategy is adopted to deal with the redundancy problem in search space. The capability of LM-NEEP is estimated on several symbolic regression problems. The experimental results display that the LM-NEEP significantly outperforms NEEP and some classical genetic programming methods.",

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel velocity reinforced mechanism (VR) for solving m-conditional problems. Two implementations of the mechanism, velocity reinforced particle swarm optimization and velocity reinforced search, are introduced in this paper. VR updates its velocity by learning and correcting best velocity directly, instead of using classical best position-guided updating rules. In this way, it increases the possibility that finds better directions for m-conditional problems. Experiments indicate that the novel approaches improve the final results and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In this article, a fuzzy floating centroids method (FFCM) is proposed, which uses a fuzzy strategy and the concept of floating centroids to enhance the performance of the neural-network classifier. The decision boundaries in the traditional floating centroids neural-network (FCM) classifier are \u201chard.\u201d These hard boundaries force a point, such as noisy or boundary point, to be assigned to a class exclusively, thereby frequently resulting in misclassification and influencing the performance of optimization methods to train the neural network. A fuzzy strategy combined with floating centroids is introduced to produce \u201csoft\u201d boundaries to handle noisy and boundary points, which increases the chance of discovering the optimal neural network during optimization. In addition, the FFCM adopts a weighted target function to correct the preference to majority classes for imbalanced data. The performance of FFCM is compared with ten classification methods on 32 benchmark datasets by using indicators: average $F$ -measure (Avg.FM) and generalization accuracy. Also, the proposed FFCM is applied to nondestructively estimate the strength grade of cement specimens based on microstructural images. In the experimental results, FFCM achieves the optimal generalization accuracy and Avg.FM on 17 datasets and 21 datasets, respectively; FFCM balances precision and recall better than its competitors for the estimation of cement strength grade.",

However, these methods ignore the influence of monitoring perspective and local crowd distribution in the selection and processing of area. In this paper, we propose a crowd density estimation method based on the floor area, which can accurately estimate the density of low and medium density crowd. Based on crowd density estimation, we propose a new division method of crowd density rank, which can effectively judge the crowd density rank at each moment. The proposed method is executed by the data sets of Mall, Smarty City and USCD. The experimental results show that proposed method can effectively estimate the crowd density value in the low and medium density crowd.",
