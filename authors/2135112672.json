Our contribution consists of a sequence of experiments using BERT, starting with a baseline, strengthening it by spell-correcting the TOEFL corpus, followed by a multi-task learning setting, where one of the tasks is the token-level metaphor classification as per the shared task, while the other is meant to provide additional training that we hypothesized to be relevant to the main task. In one case, out-of-domain data manually annotated for metaphor is used for the auxiliary task; in the other case, in-domain data automatically annotated for idioms is used for the auxiliary task. Both multi-task experiments yield promising results.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of predicting missing relationships between entities in knowledge graphs through learning their representations. Currently, the majority of existing link prediction models employ simple but intuitive scoring functions and relatively small embedding size so that they could be applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. However, these properties also restrict the ability to learn more expressive and robust features. Therefore, diverging from most of the prior works which focus on designing new objective functions, we propose, DeCom, a simple but effective mechanism to boost the performance of existing link predictors such as DistMult, ComplEx, etc, through extracting more expressive features while preventing overfitting by adding just a few extra parameters. Specifically, embeddings of entities and relationships are first decompressed to a more expressive and robust space by decompressing functions, then knowledge graph embedding models are trained in this new feature space. Experimental results on several benchmark knowledge graphs and advanced link prediction systems demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method. Especially, RESCAL + DeCom achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FB15k-237 benchmark across all evaluation metrics. In addition, we also show that compared with DeCom, explicitly increasing the embedding size significantly increase the number of parameters but could not achieve promising performance improvement.",

We present a joint statistical model to simultaneously link all mentions that appear in one table. The framework is based on neural networks, aiming to bridge the language gap by vector space transformation and a coherence feature that captures the correlations between entities in one table. Experimental results report that our approach improves the accuracy of cross-lingual table linking by a relative gain of 12.1%. Detailed analysis of our approach also shows a positive and important gain brought by the joint framework and coherence feature.\n \n",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of discovering the structured knowledge representation of binary nat-ural language relations. The representation, known as the schema, generalizes the traditional path of predicates to support more complex semantics. We present a search algorithm to generate schemas over a knowledge base, and propose a data-driven learning approach to discover the most suitable representations to one relation. Evaluation results show that inferred schemas are able to represent precise semantics, and can be used to enrich manually crafted knowledge bases. 1",
