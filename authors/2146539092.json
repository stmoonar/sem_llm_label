            "abstract": "AI-as-a-Service has emerged as an important trend for supporting the growth of the digital economy. Digital service providers make use of their vast amount of customer data to train AI models (such as image recognition, financial modelling and pandemic modelling etc) and offer them as a service on the cloud. While there are convincing advantages for using such third-party models, the fact that model users are required to upload their data to the cloud is bound to raise serious privacy concerns, especially in the face of increasingly stringent privacy regulations and legislation. To promote the adoption of AI-as-a-Service while addressing privacy issues, we propose a practical approach for constructing privacy-enhanced neural networks by designing an efficient implementation of fully homomorphic encryption. With this approach, an existing neural network can be converted to process FHE-encrypted data and produce encrypted output which are only accessible by the model users, and more importantly, within an operationally acceptable time (e.g., within 1 s for facial recognition in typical border control systems). Experimental results show that in many practical tasks such as facial recognition, text classification and so on, we obtained the state-of-the-art inference accuracy in less than one second on a 16 cores CPU.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has great potential to transform transportation systems by enhancing road safety, reducing traffic congestion, and improving user experience through onboard infotainment applications. Decentralized data sharing can improve security, privacy, reliability, and facilitate infotainment data sharing in IoVs. However, decentralized data sharing may not achieve the expected efficiency if there are IoV users who only want to consume the shared data but are not willing to contribute their own data to the community, resulting in incomplete information observed by other vehicles and infrastructure, which can introduce additional transmission latency. Therefore, in this article, by modeling the data sharing ecosystem as a data trading market, we propose a decentralized data-sharing incentive mechanism based on multi-intelligent reinforcement learning to learn the supply-demand balance in markets and minimize transmission latency. Our proposed mechanism takes into account the dynamic nature of IoV markets, which can experience frequent fluctuations in supply and demand. We propose a time-sensitive Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) mechanism coupled with Named Data Networking (NDN) to protect data in IoVs, which adds a layer of security to our proposed solution. Additionally, we design a decentralized market for efficient data sharing in IoVs, where continuous double auctions are adopted. The proposed mechanism based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can learn the supply-demand equilibrium in markets, thus improving the efficiency and sustainability of markets. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed learning-based incentive mechanism outperforms baselines by 10% in determining the equilibrium of supply and demand while reducing transmission latency by 20%.",

            "abstract": "Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) is an emerging paradigm that enables the outsourcing of a complex task to a group of mobile devices. The ability to utilize the collective power of mobile devices and human intelligence makes MCS a significant tool in various scenarios. Nevertheless, it faces practical challenge in protecting user privacy due to the sensitive nature of information collected by mobile devices. Additionally, the inherent openness of MSC and the heterogeneity of mobile devices raise reliability concerns among participants. To address these challenges, by integrating federated learning (FL) with the pairwise additive masking technique and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving FL (BPFL) framework for MCS, which allows mobile participants to collaboratively solve a crowdsourced machine learning task while preserving privacy. Besides, it employs blockchain technology to record the training process in a transparent and tamper-proof ledger. This ledger guarantees the verifiability of aggregation results and the fair distribution of training rewards, thereby enhancing trust and fairness. We prove that our BPFL supports privacy protection and trust mechanism simultaneously and resists inference and collusion attacks. Experimental results show that our BPFL can achieve high performance in terms of computation cost, communication cost and model accuracy, which is friendly for mobile users with resource-constrained devices in MCS ecosystems.",

            "title": "Authentication and Key Agreement Based on Three Factors and PUF for UAV-Assisted Post-Disaster Emergency Communication",
            "abstract": "For unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted post-disaster emergency communication networks, UAVs serve as relay nodes of air-based backup network to support transmission of rescue messages to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), while ECVs provide on-site ground communication and connectivity to the command center (CC) of the rescue operation. Existing works seldom emphasize communication security, such as authenticity of communicating parties and integrity of message content. In this connection, authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols are promising solutions for achieving communication security. However, the traditional approaches to endpoint security and entity authentication of principals may not be practical in emergency situations, in which network equipment and security modules are exposed to an open and untrusted physical environment. Besides, there is a lack of attention to the study of privacy impacts resulted from the physical loss of UAVs. More importantly, cyber attacks and excessive overhead may deteriorate AKA availability. Motivated by the above challenges, we propose an AKA protocol, namely, AKAEC, which is based on three-factor (i.e., smart card, biometrics, and password) and physically unclonable function (PUF) for protecting UAVs-assisted emergency communication. Specifically, AKAEC includes ECV-to-UAV (E2U) and UAV-to-UAV (U2U), where the former achieves secure emergency communication between ECV and UAV, while the latter realizes secure emergency communication between UAV and UAV. We then provide a formal security proof under the real-or-random (ROR) model and formal security verification by automated validation of Internet security protocol and application. This is followed by a security analysis to show that AKAEC meets the security goals defined for emergency situations. Finally, the performance of AKAEC is evaluated from communication overhead and computational overhead.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Transfer has received much attention for its ability to transfer knowledge, rather than data, from one application task to another. In order to comply with the stringent data privacy regulations, privacy-preserving knowledge transfer is highly desirable. The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) scheme is one promising approach to address this privacy concern while supporting knowledge transfer from an ensemble of \"teacher\" models to a \"student\" model under the coordination of an aggregator. To further protect the data privacy of the student node, the privacy-enhanced version of PATE makes use of cryptographic techniques at the expense of heavy computation overheads at the teacher nodes. However, this inevitably hinders the adoption of knowledge transfer due to the highly disparate computational capability of teachers. Besides, in real-life systems, participating teachers may drop out of the system at any time, which causes new security risks for adopted cryptographic building blocks. Thus, it is desirable to devise privacy-enhanced knowledge transfer that can run on teacher nodes with relatively fewer computational resources and can preserve privacy with dropped teacher nodes. In this connection, we propose a dropout-resilient and privacy-enhanced knowledge transfer scheme, Collaborative Split learning over Teacher Ensembles (CSTE), that supports the participating teacher nodes to train and infer their local models using split learning. CSTE not only allows the compute-intensive processing to be performed at a split learning server, but also protects the data privacy of teacher nodes from collusion between the student node and aggregator. Experimental results showed that CSTE achieves significant efficiency improvement from existing schemes.",

            "abstract": "In order to remain competitive, Internet companies collect and analyse user data for the purpose of the improvement of user experiences. Frequency estimation is a widely used statistical tool, which could potentially conflict with the relevant privacy regulations. Privacy preserving analytic methods based on differential privacy have been proposed, which require either a large user base or a trusted server. Although the requirements for such solutions may not be a problem for larger companies, they may be unattainable for smaller organizations. To address this issue, we propose a distributed privacy-preserving sampling-based frequency estimation method which has high accuracy even in the scenario with a small number of users while not requiring any trusted server. This is achieved by combining multi-party computation and sampling techniques. We also provide a relation between its privacy guarantee, output accuracy, and the number of participants. Distinct from most existing methods, our methods achieve centralized differential privacy guarantee without the need of any trusted server. We established that, even for a small number of participants, our mechanisms can produce estimates with high accuracy and hence they provide smaller companies with more opportunity for growth through privacy-preserving statistical analysis. We further propose an architectural model to support weighted aggregation in order to achieve a higher accuracy estimate to cater for users with varying privacy requirements. Compared to the unweighted aggregation, our method provides a more accurate estimate. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

            "abstract": "Bitcoin is gaining ever increasing popularity. However, professional skills are required if people want to check bitcoin transaction information from the blockchain. As pointed out in a recent study, there is a lack of tools to support effective interactive investigation of bitcoin transactions. Therefore, we present a novel visualization system, BitAnalysis, for interactive bitcoin wallet investigation. The analytical and visualization functions of BitAnalysis are defined and developed by following the advice and requirements of a group of entrepreneurs and regulators of bitcoin-related business. BitAnalysis provides a rich set of functions and intuitive visual interfaces for the users, such as law-enforcement officers and regulators, to effectively visualize and analyze the transactions of a bitcoin wallet (i.e., a cluster of bitcoin addresses) and its related wallets, to track the flow of bitcoins, and to identify wallet correlation using our novel clustering functions. To achieve these functions, we have designed new visualization techniques for presenting bitcoin transactions information and introduced the connection diagram and bitcoin flow map as new ways of analyzing, tracking and monitoring the trading activities of a cluster of closely related wallets. We also present an extensive user study that validated the effectiveness and usability of BitAnalysis.",

            "title": "Separate-and-Aggregate: A Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model for Knowledge Graph Completion",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of inferencing missing facts from any given knowledge graphs (KG). Previous KGC methods typically represent knowledge graph entities and relations as trainable continuous embeddings and fuse the embeddings of the entity $h$ (or $t$) and relation $r$ into hidden representations of query $(h, r, ?)$ (or $(?, r, t$)) to approximate the missing entities. To achieve this, they either use shallow linear transformations or deep convolutional modules. However, the linear transformations suffer from the expressiveness issue while the deep convolutional modules introduce unnecessary inductive bias, which could potentially degrade the model performance. Thus, we propose a novel Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model (PatReFormer) for KGC. PatReFormer first segments the embedding into a sequence of patches and then employs cross-attention modules to allow bi-directional embedding feature interaction between the entities and relations, leading to a better understanding of the underlying KG. We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n. Our analysis first verifies the effectiveness of our model design choices in PatReFormer. We then find that PatReFormer can better capture KG information from a large relation embedding dimension. Finally, we demonstrate that the strength of PatReFormer is at complex relation types, compared to other KGC models",
