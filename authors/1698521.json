            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) problem, which focuses on next-item prediction for anonymous users, has received increasingly more attention from researchers. Existing graph-based SBR methods all lack the ability to differentiate between sessions with the same last item, and suffer from severe popularity bias. Inspired by nowadays emerging contrastive learning methods, this paper presents a Simple Contrastive Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation (SimCGNN). In SimCGNN, we first obtain normalized session embeddings on constructed session graphs. We next construct positive and negative samples of the sessions by two forward propagation and a novel negative sample selection strategy, and then calculate the constructive loss. Finally, session embeddings are used to give prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-word datasets show our SimCGNN achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "\u2014The purpose of the Session-Based Recommendation System is to predict the user\u2019s next click according to the previous session sequence. The current studies generally learn user preferences according to the transitions of items in the user\u2019s session sequence. However, other effective information in the session sequence, such as user pro\ufb01les, are largely ignored which may lead to the model unable to learn the user\u2019s speci\ufb01c preferences. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based session recommendation method, named SR-HetGNN, which can learn session embeddings by heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN), and capture the speci\ufb01c preferences of anonymous users. Speci\ufb01cally, SR-HetGNN \ufb01rst constructs heterogeneous graphs containing various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can capture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN captures the complex transitions between items and learn the item embeddings containing user information. Finally, to consider the in\ufb02uence of users\u2019 long and short-term preferences, local and global session embeddings are combined with the attentional network to obtain the \ufb01nal session embedding. SR-HetGNN is shown to be superior to the existing state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods through extensive experiments over two real large datasets Diginetica and Tmall.",

The majority of existing graph neural networks (GNNs) have limited power in capturing position information for a given node. The idea of positioning nodes with selected anchors has been exploited, yet mainly relying on explicit labeling of distance information. Here we propose Graph Inference Representation (GIR), an anchor based GNN model encoding path information related to pre-selected anchors for each node. Abilities to get position-aware embeddings are theoretically and experimentally investigated on GIR and its core variants. Further, the complementarity between GIRs and typical GNNs is demonstrated. We show that GIRs get outperformed results in position-aware scenarios, and performances on typical GNNs could be improved by fusing GIR embeddings.",

            "abstract": "Automatic image annotation is one of the research fields helping to extract the meaning of images, which aims at the production of a set of semantic annotations for an image to help better present the concept. Over the past few decades, researchers have developed many approaches for automatic image annotation. Nevertheless, previous studies have not fully accounted for visual features and annotated features. Therefore, it is still possible to achieve a better annotation performance by combining visual and annotated information. In this study, we aim to associate multiple semantic tags with a given image. In particular, we detect how to obtain the image annotation by utilizing visual and annotated information. To take advantage of visual information, we first designed a modified neural network method to acquire the features of the image content. In addition, to obtain the annotated features, we exploit an aggregated network embedding approach that consists of annotation embedding, social embedding, profile embedding, and semantic embedding. Finally, to produce an accurate image annotation, we integrate the two aforementioned methods, that is, combining the visual and annotated information, to build a unified cooperative training framework. The experimental results on three real-world datasets clarify that our presented method is superior to the currently popular image annotation approaches.",

In spite of the progress in deep-learning algorithms within natural language processing domain, the methods in line with human cognition are absent.

There are four major modules established in BSSCN, which are left hemisphere semantic activation (LH-SA), semantic selection (SS) module, semantic integration (SI) module and right hemisphere semantic activation (RH-SA).

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received much attention in the graph deep learning domain. However, recent research empirically and theoretically shows that deep GNNs suffer from over-fitting and over-smoothing problems. The usual solutions either cannot solve extensive runtime of deep GNNs or restrict graph convolution in the same feature space. We propose the Adaptive Graph Diffusion Networks (AGDNs) which perform multi-layer generalized graph diffusion in different feature spaces with moderate complexity and runtime. Standard graph diffusion methods combine large and dense powers of the transition matrix with predefined weighting coefficients. Instead, AGDNs combine smaller multi-hop node representations with learnable and generalized weighting coefficients. We propose two scalable mechanisms of weighting coefficients to capture multi-hop information: Hop-wise Attention (HA) and Hop-wise Convolution (HC). We evaluate AGDNs on diverse, challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets with semi-supervised node classification and link prediction tasks. Until the date of submission (Aug 26, 2022), AGDNs achieve top-1 performance on the ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-proteins and ogbl-ddi datasets and top-3 performance on the ogbl-citation2 dataset. On the similar Tesla V100 GPU cards, AGDNs outperform Reversible GNNs (RevGNNs) with 13% complexity and 1% training runtime of RevGNNs on the ogbn-proteins dataset. AGDNs also achieve comparable performance to SEAL with 36% training and 0.2% inference runtime of SEAL on the ogbl-citation2 dataset.",

            "abstract": "Many studies utilized machine learning schemes to improve network intrusion detection systems recently. Most of the research is based on manually extracted features, but this approach not only requires a lot of labor costs but also loses a lot of information in the original data, resulting in low judgment accuracy and cannot be deployed in actual situations. This paper develops a DL-IDS (deep learning-based intrusion detection system), which uses the hybrid network of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to extract the spatial and temporal features of network traffic data and to provide a better intrusion detection system. To reduce the influence of an unbalanced number of samples of different attack types in model training samples on model performance, DL-IDS used a category weight optimization method to improve the robustness. Finally, DL-IDS is tested on CICIDS2017, a reliable intrusion detection dataset that covers all the common, updated intrusions and cyberattacks. In the multiclassification test, DL-IDS reached 98.67% in overall accuracy, and the accuracy of each attack type was above 99.50%.",

            "abstract": "With the development of Internet lending, the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) as a new financial credit model has been increasing in China. However, this rapid development has led to a major potential risk. A few P2P enterprises operate well in the beginning but close within a short period because of the suspension of business, fraud, illegal fundraising, and blind expansion. Effective supervision of the P2P industry is an urgent problem. Trading volume reflects the operation stability of P2P platforms. Hence, predicting the volume of the P2P market is an important research topic. This paper first analyzes the trading data of a P2P platform. It is found that the sentiment of investor comments is related to the trading volume of the P2P platform. Then, we use the TextCNN model to classify the sentiment of investor comments and obtain the time series of changes in sentiment. It is verified that the time series of change in sentiment and the P2P volume index has statistical causality and a strong correlation. This paper proposes a model that uses the trend of change in investor sentiment to predict P2P trading volume. This model uses the historical time series change in investor sentiment, the P2P volume index, and WeekDay characteristics to predict future P2P trading volume. The experimental results show that the proposed model is better than a few existing baseline methods. Compared with baseline regression, the Pearson coefficient of the predicted and actual values of the proposed model is increased by 13.26%, the mean squared error is decreased by 27.62%, and the R-squared value is increased by 28.48%.",

            "abstract": "In order to solve problems of stubborn cold start, data sparseness and shortage of each single recommendation algorithm in the music recommendation, Online-Nearline-Offline hybrid MRS is used in this paper. By mixing collaborative filtering and PersonalRank algorithm according to their different characteristics, ONO hybrid model can rationally make up for the shortage reciprocally. Moreover, specific rules for cold start and K-Means for data sparseness are also put forward. For illustration, an entirely new user is utilized to go through the recommendation process both in single algorithm model and ONO hybrid model. The results show that the measured MAE reflecting the satisfaction is the most smooth and the lowest under the condition of hybrid MRS. The ONO hybrid MRS is superior in solving cold star problem, taking the capacity of data in each period into accounts and making up for the single algorithm shortages.",
