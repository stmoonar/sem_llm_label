            "title": "Time-Slotted Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Cloud-Edge-End Cooperative Computing Networks",
            "abstract": "In time-slotted edge computing systems, task scheduling is conducted at the end of each time slot to make task offloading decisions and resource allocation for all the tasks pending for scheduling during the time slot. However, the existing works omitted the task scheduling delay, which is a period that a task has to wait from the task generation time point to the end of the current time slot. Such simplification is impractical in real scenarios because the task scheduling delay is a non-negligible part of the task processing delay, which was understood by existing works as the sum of only the task transmission and computing delays. In this paper, a novel time-slotted task offloading and resource allocation scheme for cloud-edge-end cooperative computing networks is proposed to realize the total task processing delay minimization for all the devices under the energy consumption constraint of each device. Our scheme makes task-offloading decision for each device from local processing, offloading to its affiliated base station (BS), to another BS, and to the cloud server. Besides, transmit power allocation, transmission rate allocation, and computing resource allocation are also jointly optimized in our optimization problem. We consider the impact of the task scheduling delay and design a two-stage distributed algorithm to decrease the negative impact by dividing the algorithm into a device-side part and a network-side part. The advantages of our scheme are validated by extensive simulations, where 4 reference schemes are compared in 8 different scenarios.",

            "abstract": "In an edge-cloud cooperative computing network, the task offloading performance can be further improved by the edge-cloud and edge-edge cooperation, in which the tasks can be offloaded from an edge server to the cloud server or another edge server. Such edge-cloud cooperative task offloading can jointly utilize the resources of all the edge servers and the cloud server. This paper proposes a collaborative service placement, task scheduling, computing resource allocation, and transmission rate allocation scheme for a multi-task and multi-service scenario with edge-cloud cooperation. The objective of our optimization problem is to minimize the total task processing delay while guaranteeing long-term task queuing stability. Considering the high complexity of the original optimization problem, we transform the problem into a deterministic problem for each time slot based on the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we design an iterative algorithm to obtain the whole solution to the problem efficiently based on a hybrid method using multiple numerical techniques. Further, considering the inherent difference in the optimization periods of the service placement, resource allocation, and task scheduling sub-problems, we design a multi-timescale algorithm to solve the sub-problems with different optimization periods. The complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, and extensive simulations are conducted by varying multiple crucial parameters. The superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparison with 4 other schemes.",

            "title": "Joint Task Offloading and Service Caching for Multi-Access Edge Computing in WiFi-Cellular Heterogeneous Networks",
            "abstract": "Enabled by Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) in a WiFi-cellular heterogeneous network, the tasks of mobile terminals (MTs) can be offloaded via the cellular network to the MEC servers or cloud server, or via the WiFi network to alleviate transmission congestion of the cellular network. The MEC also enables service caching to cache the programs/libraries/databases of the tasks to avoid repeated input data uploading. Existing research works lack joint optimization on the task offloading and service caching for MEC in the WiFi-cellular heterogeneous network. In this paper, a novel resource management scheme for joint task offloading and service caching is proposed to maximize the energy consumption benefits of all the MTs covered by a WiFi-cellular heterogeneous network while guaranteeing the task processing delay tolerance of each MT. We consider the constraints on limited computing and storage resources of the MEC servers equipped on the cellular base station and the WiFi access point, and we also consider cellular channel allocation for the task offloading. We design an iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization technique to solve the proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming problem efficiently. Extensive simulations are conducted in multiple scenarios by varying different crucial parameters. The numerical results demonstrate that our scheme can largely improve the system performance in all the scenarios, and energy consumption reduction optimized by our scheme is 16.24%-43.09% higher than those by the comparative works.",
