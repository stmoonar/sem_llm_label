            "title": "An Optophone Based on Raspberry Pi and Android Wireless Communication",
            "abstract": "This paper presents an optophone which aims to make the sight-disabled people have the same reading view as normal people. The complete set of equipment includes a Raspberry Pi, a camera and an Android App. We connected the CSI camera to the raspberry PI interface to complete the image acquisition of physical paper reading materials and connected the playback device to the Raspberry Pi audio interface to provide users with reading services. The Android app communicates with the Raspberry Pi to control the Raspberry Pi\u2019s actions, including recognizing images to generate text, selecting the appropriate reading file, and choosing to play or pause of file reading. Unlike such devices developed in the past, the service is made easier by the fact that visually impaired people can operate this optophone directly from their phones. The technical overview of each subsystem of the optophone is presented and discussed.",
