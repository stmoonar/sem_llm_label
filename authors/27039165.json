            "abstract": "The entity resolution problem requires finding pairs across datasets that belong to different owners but refer to the same entity in the real world. To train and evaluate solutions (either rule-based or machine-learning-based) to the entity resolution problem, generating a ground truth dataset with entity pairs or clusters is needed. However, such a data annotation process involves humans as domain oracles to review the plaintext data for all candidate record pairs from different parties, which inevitably infringes the privacy of data owners, especially in privacy-sensitive cases like medical records. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on privacy-preserving ground truth dataset generation, especially in the domain of entity resolution. We propose a novel blind annotation protocol based on homomorphic encryption that allows domain oracles to collaboratively label ground truths without sharing data in plaintext with other parties. In addition, we design a domain-specific easy-to-use language that hides the sophisticated underlying homomorphic encryption layer. Rigorous proof of the privacy guarantee is provided and our empirical experiments via an annotation simulator indicate the feasibility of our privacy-preserving protocol (f-measure on average achieves more than 90\\% compared with the real ground truths).",

            "abstract": "Entity resolution is the task of disambiguating records that refer to the same entity in the real world. In this work, we explore adapting one of the most efficient and accurate Jaccard-based entity resolution algorithms - PPJoin, to the private domain via homomorphic encryption. Towards this, we present our precise adaptation of PPJoin (HE-PPJoin) that details certain subtle data structure modifications and algorithmic additions needed for correctness and privacy. We implement HE-PPJoin by extending the PALISADE homomorphic encryption library and evaluate over it for accuracy and incurred overhead. Furthermore, we directly compare HE-PPJoin against P4Join, an existing privacy-preserving variant of PPJoin which uses fingerprinting for raw content obfuscation, by demonstrating a rigorous analysis of the efficiency, accuracy, and privacy properties achieved by our adaptation as well as a characterization of those same attributes in P4Join.",

            "title": "AMPPERE: A Universal Abstract Machine for Privacy-Preserving Entity Resolution Evaluation",
            "abstract": "Entity resolution is the task of identifying records in different datasets that refer to the same entity in the real world. In sensitive domains (e.g. financial accounts, hospital health records), entity resolution must meet privacy requirements to avoid revealing sensitive information such as personal identifiable information to untrusted parties. Existing solutions are either too algorithmically-specific or come with an implicit trade-off between accuracy of the computation, privacy, and run-time efficiency. We propose AMMPERE, an abstract computation model for performing universal privacy-preserving entity resolution. AMMPERE offers abstractions that encapsulate multiple algorithmic and platform-agnostic approaches using variants of Jaccard similarity to perform private data matching and entity resolution. Specifically, we show that two parties can perform entity resolution over their data, without leaking sensitive information. We rigorously compare and analyze the feasibility, performance overhead and privacy-preserving properties of these approaches on the Sharemind multi-party computation (MPC) platform as well as on PALISADE, a lattice-based homomorphic encryption library. The AMMPERE system demonstrates the efficacy of privacy-preserving entity resolution for real-world data while providing a precise characterization of the induced cost of preventing information leakage.",
