            "abstract": "The prevalence of smart devices with the ability to capture moments in multiple modalities has enabled users to experience multimodal information online. However, large Language (LLMs) and Vision models (LVMs) are still limited in capturing holistic meaning with cross-modal semantic relationships. Without explicit, common sense knowledge (e.g., as a knowledge graph), Visual Language Models (VLMs) only learn implicit representations by capturing high-level patterns in vast corpora, missing essential contextual cross-modal cues. In this work, we design a framework to couple explicit commonsense knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs with large VLMs to improve the performance of a downstream task, predicting the effectiveness of multi-modal marketing campaigns. While the marketing application provides a compelling metric for assessing our methods, our approach enables the early detection of likely persuasive multi-modal campaigns and the assessment and augmentation of marketing theory.",

            "abstract": "During Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Telegram became an essential social media platform for Kremlin-sponsored propaganda dissemination. Over time, Anti-Kremlin Russian opposition channels have also emerged as a prominent voice of dissent against the state-sponsored propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of Anti-Kremlin content on Telegram over seven phases of the invasion, inspired by the concept of breach in narrative theory. A data-driven, computational analysis of emerging topics revealed the Russian economy, combat updates, international politics, and Russian domestic affairs, among others. Using a common set of statistical contrasts by phases of the invasion, a longitudinal analysis of topic prevalence allowed us to examine associations with documented offline events and viewer reactions, suggesting an adaptive breach-oriented communications strategy that maintained viewer interest. Viewer approval of those events that threaten Kremlin control suggests that Telegram levels the online playing field for the opposition, surprising given the Kremlin's suppression of free speech offline.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The rise of online platforms as a communication tool for individuals worldwide has brought an increase in their misuse and abuse. Social platforms have been implicated in promoting and amplifying hate speech, misinformation, extremism, harassment, cyberbullying, human trafcking, drug dealing, gender-based stereotyping, and other forms of violence. These cyber social threats are inherently multifaceted, entailing signifcant implications for both individuals and communities, which make them challenging to combat while crucial to address. We are pleased to present the proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats held on April 30, 2023, in Austin, Texas, U.S. The goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers from various disciplines to explore the complex problems that accompany digital platforms. Given the importance of accurate and reliable information in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global crises, the spotlight topic for this year\u2019s workshop was \"Information Integrity during Crises.\"",

            "abstract": "As Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been essential in identifying critical elements of unstructured content, generic NER tools remain limited in recognizing entities specific to a domain, such as drug use and public health. For such high-impact areas, accurately capturing relevant entities at a more granular level is critical, as this information influences real-world processes. On the other hand, training NER models for a specific domain without handcrafted features requires an extensive amount of labeled data, which is expensive in human effort and time. In this study, we employ distant supervision utilizing a domain-specific ontology to reduce the need for human labor and train models incorporating domain-specific (e.g., drug use) external knowledge to recognize domain specific entities. We capture entities related the drug use and their trends in government epidemiology reports, with an improvement of 8% in F1-score.",

            "abstract": "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S (1999-2019). However, predicting when someone will attempt suicide has been nearly impossible. In the modern world, many individuals suffering from mental illness seek emotional support and advice on well-known and easily-accessible social media platforms such as Reddit. While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated the ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and temporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have enormous clinical potential\u2014most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to employ timely and targeted interventions (i.e., voluntary and involuntary psychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this knowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in terms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep learning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level suicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a clinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the C-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the time-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and supportive behaviors (AUC:0.78), while the time-invariant model performed better in predicting suicide-related behaviors and suicide attempt (AUC:0.64). The proposed approach can be integrated with clinical diagnostic interviews for improving suicide risk assessments.",

Its insidious impact has been observed in events related to health, disaster recovery, elections, \ufb01 nance, climate communication, and terrorism. These trends have led to a rising prominence of social media analytics in academia, public health, politics, and homeland security, using computational techniques. In the pursuit of understanding online malevolent behavior, research in social media analytics has seen signi \ufb01 cant development of advanced techniques. 1 Yet, it has been challenging to detect, monitor, counter, and overcome the malevolent behavior by ill-intentioned actors due to the complex nature of social media, and other large-scale sociotechnical infrastructures. 2 As harmful content is rich in subjectivity and emotion, it is challenging to understand individual messages in terms of its features and the human decision-making processes that foster its diffusion. Hence, the meaning of language varies depending on the source \u2019 s intent and the state of the target \u2019 s belief system, allowing the bad to be perceived as good due to positive social construction and vice versa. 3 Additional complexity arises when bad actors use coordinated actions with intentions for harming other individuals for a variety of goals from manipulation to harassment. This becomes even more dangerous if malicious groups or state actors orchestrate their actions, 4 involving bots 5 and human actors, to disseminate misinformation and persuade individuals on its truthfulness by malicious groups, threatening an individual, our society, or democratic institutions at large. 6 These efforts have",

            "abstract": "the third international Workshop on emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media (iCWSM)1 was held on the eighth of June 2020 as a half-day online meeting. this workshop brought together computer and social science researchers as well as leading industry practitioners to discuss and exchange ideas on understanding social, cultural, communicative, and linguistic roles of emoji while leading the discussions on building novel computational methods to understand them. \uf06e The workshop program of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence\u2019s Fourteenth International Conference on Web and Social Media was held June 8 to 20, 2020. The conference venue, which had originally been Atlanta, Georgia, USA, had to be revamped into a virtual edition, due to the 2019 Corona Virus Disease pandemic. There were five full-day workshops in the program. They included Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media (W1), Social Sensing: Narrative Analysis on Social Media (W2), News and Public Opinion (W3), Cyber Social Threats (W4), and Mediate: Social and News Media Misinformation (W5). This report contains summaries of all five workshops.

            "title": "Knowledge-infused Deep Learning",
            "abstract": "Deep Learning has shown remarkable success during the last decade for essential tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. Yet, challenges remain in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models in real-world cases, such as dependence on extensive data and trust, explainability, traceability, and interactivity. These challenges are amplified in high-risk fields, including healthcare, cyber threats, crisis response, autonomous driving, and future manufacturing. On the other hand, symbolic computing with knowledge graphs has shown significant growth in specific tasks with reliable performance. This tutorial (a) discusses the novel paradigm of knowledge-infused deep learning to synthesize neural computing with symbolic computing (b) describes different forms of knowledge and infusion methods in deep learning, and (c) discusses application-specific evaluation methods to assure explainability and reasoning using benchmark datasets and knowledge-resources. The resulting paradigm of \"knowledge-infused learning'' combines knowledge from both domain expertise and physical models. A wide variety of techniques involving shallow, semi-deep, and deep infusion will be discussed along with the corresponding intuitions, limitations, use cases, and applications.
