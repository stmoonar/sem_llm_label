            "abstract": "The proliferation of real-time information on social media opens up unprecedented opportunities for situation awareness that arise from extracting unfolding physical events from their social media footprints. The paper describes experiences with a new social media analysis toolkit for detecting and tracking such physical events. A key advantage of the explored analysis algorithms is that they require no prior training, and as such can operate out-of-the-box on new languages, dialects, jargon, and application domains (where by \"new\", we mean new to the machine), including detection of protests, natural disasters, acts of terror, accidents, and other disruptions. By running the toolkit over a period of time, patterns and anomalies are also detected that offer additional insights and understanding. Through analysis of contemporary political, military, and natural disaster events, the work explores the limits of the training-free approach and demonstrates promise and applicability.",

Specifically, we focus on content shared by users on Twitter and Instagram in order to design a system capable of fusing data across multiple networks. Past work has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to detect physical events using various social network platforms. However, many of these signals need corroboration in order to handle events that lack proper support within a single network. We leverage this insight to design an unsupervised approach that can correlate event signals across multiple social networks. Our algorithm can detect events and identify the location of the event occurrence. We evaluate our algorithm using both simulations and real world datasets collected using Twitter and Instagram.

We choose picture-oriented networks because taking a picture requires physical proximity, thereby revealing the location of the photographed event. Furthermore, most modern cell phones are equipped with GPS, making picture location, and time metadata commonly available. We consider Instagram as the social network of choice and limit ourselves to urban events (noting that the majority of the world population lives in cities). The paper introduces a new adaptive localization algorithm that does not require the user to specify manually tunable parameters. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm for various real-world datasets, comparing it against a few baseline methods. The results show that our method achieves the best recall, the fewest false positives, and the lowest average error in localizing urban events.",

            "abstract": "Some of the most widely deployed IoT devices in urban areas are smartphones in the possession of urban individuals. Their proliferation has led to the emergence of crowdsensing/crowdsourcing services, where humans collect data about their environment (using phones), and servers aggregate the data for various application purposes of interest. With the emergence of social media, a common alternative form of human data entry has become media posts (e.g., on Twitter). This leads to the prospect of building crowdsensing services on top of social media content, exploiting humans as ``sensors\". In this paper, we develop one such service, called {\\em StoryLine}. The service detects and tracks physical urban events of interest to the user, such as car accidents, infrastructure damage (in the aftermath of a natural disaster), or instances of civil unrest. It offers an interface to client-side software that allows browsing such events in real time, as well as an interface for software applications to a structured representation of the events and their related statistics. The service embodies novel algorithms for real-time detection, demultiplexing, and tracking of physical events using social media data. In our evaluation with Twitter feeds, we show that our service outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in event detection and demultiplexing. We also conduct two case-studies to show the effectiveness of the real-time event detection capability and event tracking performance of our system.",

Empirical data suggests that event detection from Instagram streams errs on the false-negative side due to the relative sparsity of Instagram data (compared to Twitter data), whereas event detection from Twitter can suffer from false-positives, at least if not paired with careful analysis of tweet content. To tackle both problems simultaneously, we design a unified unsupervised algorithm that fuses events detected originally on Instagram (called I-events) and events detected originally on Twitter (called T-events), that occur in adjacent periods, in an attempt to combine the benefits of both sources while eliminating their individual disadvantages. We evaluate the proposed framework with real data crawled from Twitter and Instagram. The results indicate that our algorithm significantly improves tracking accuracy compared to baselines.",

            "abstract": "Cloud computing is the protracted revelation of computing as effectiveness, where data owners can remotely store their data. The essential service presents by the Cloud is Data Storage. On the other hand, it is a tricky task for sharing data in multi-owner manner anywhere group admin and all group members can store and alter data while protecting data and identity privacy from an untrusted cloud server, due to the frequent change of the membership. So secure multi-owner data sharing scheme for dynamic groups in the cloud computing have been projected which absorb addition of group signature and broadcast encryption techniques. However this system also recognized some boundaries in terms of competence and security. since multi-owner data storing and sharing in a dynamic surroundings dumps enormous amount of data files in the cloud, which leftovers in cloud for imprecise period of time. The confidential information stored may changed by service providers. To maintain cloud file\u2019s security and privacy regular elimination of unwanted files is needed. To determine this drawback we propose new framework which is Reliable and Scalable Secure Method to Store and Share Secrete Data for groups in Cloud i.e\u00a0 MONA that remove unnecessary files automatically when the predefined time period for sharing specified by data owner has been run out which improve performance of the system in terms of security and efficiency. Also this method decreases the overhead at the time of upload and download file in the cloud. At last proposed method by name Multi Owner Data Sharing Over Cloud (MODOC) declares required efficiency and most importantly security. We apply a working prototype of the MODOC method and assess its performance based on the time addicted during various operations The results give you an idea about that MODOC has the prospective to be effectively used for secure data sharing in the cloud.",

This paper describes the exploitation of these signal processing techniques to extract information from social networks, such as Twitter and Instagram. Specifically, we view social networks as noisy sensors that report events in the physical world. We then present a data processing stack for detection, localization, tracking, and veracity analysis of reported events using social network data. We show using a controlled experiment that the behavior of social sources as information relays varies dramatically depending on context. In benign contexts, there is general agreement on events, whereas in conflict scenarios, a significant amount of collective filtering is introduced by conflicted groups, creating a large data distortion. We describe signal processing techniques that mitigate such distortion, resulting in meaningful approximations of actual ground truth, given noisy reported observations. Finally, we briefly present an implementation of the aforementioned social network data processing stack in a sensor network analysis toolkit, called Apollo. Experiences with Apollo show that our techniques are successful at identifying and tracking credible events in the physical world.",
