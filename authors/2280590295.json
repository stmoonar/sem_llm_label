            "abstract": "Temporal changes in data set the need for the development of knowledge representation techniques able to capture these dynamics. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) have emerged as a reference tool to represent dynamic, structured and machine-interpretable knowledge that evolves over time. However, characterizing the evolution of TKGs in a meaningful and human-understandable way remains a significant challenge. In this short paper, we argue that Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), with its expressive temporal constructs, is a promising approach for capturing a wide range of temporal behaviors and high-level evolutionary patterns occurring in TKGs.",
