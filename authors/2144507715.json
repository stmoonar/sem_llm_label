            "title": "Rapid Localization and Extraction of Street Light Poles in Mobile LiDAR Point Clouds: A Supervoxel-Based Approach",
            "abstract": "This paper presents a supervoxel-based approach for automated localization and extraction of street light poles in point clouds acquired by a mobile LiDAR system. The method consists of five steps: preprocessing, localization, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. First, the raw point clouds are divided into segments along the trajectory, the ground points are removed, and the remaining points are segmented into supervoxels. Then, a robust localization method is proposed to accurately identify the pole-like objects. Next, a localization-guided segmentation method is proposed to obtain pole-like objects. Subsequently, the pole features are classified using the support vector machine and random forests. The proposed approach was evaluated on three datasets with 1,055 street light poles and 701 million points. Experimental results show that our localization method achieved an average recall value of 98.8%. A comparative study proved that our method is more robust and efficient than other existing methods for localization and extraction of street light poles.",

            "title": "COSS: Content-Based Subscription as an IoT Service",
            "abstract": "Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems are widely used in numerous Internet-Of-Things (IoT) applications such as environment monitoring, supply chain tracing, healthcare, and vehicle networks. In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.",

            "title": "MapReduce Based Personalized Locality Sensitive Hashing for Similarity Joins on Large Scale Data",
            "abstract": "Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has been proposed as an efficient technique for similarity joins for high dimensional data. The efficiency and approximation rate of LSH depend on the number of generated false positive instances and false negative instances. In many domains, reducing the number of false positives is crucial. Furthermore, in some application scenarios, balancing false positives and false negatives is favored. To address these problems, in this paper we propose Personalized Locality Sensitive Hashing (PLSH), where a new banding scheme is embedded to tailor the number of false positives, false negatives, and the sum of both. PLSH is implemented in parallel using MapReduce framework to deal with similarity joins on large scale data. Experimental studies on real and simulated data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed PLSH technique, compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
