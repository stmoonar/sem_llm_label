            "abstract": "This study proposes the use of Machine Learning models to predict the early onset of sepsis using deidentified clinical data from Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, NY, USA. A supervised learning approach was adopted, wherein an XGBoost model was trained utilizing 80\\% of the train dataset, encompassing 107 features (including the original and derived features). Subsequently, the model was evaluated on the remaining 20\\% of the test data. The model was validated on prospective data that was entirely unseen during the training phase. To assess the model's performance at the individual patient level and timeliness of the prediction, a normalized utility score was employed, a widely recognized scoring methodology for sepsis detection, as outlined in the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge paper. Metrics such as F1 Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Flag Rate were also devised. The model achieved a normalized utility score of 0.494 on test data and 0.378 on prospective data at threshold 0.3. The F1 scores were 80.8\\% and 67.1\\% respectively for the test data and the prospective data for the same threshold, highlighting its potential to be integrated into clinical decision-making processes effectively. These results bear testament to the model's robust predictive capabilities and its potential to substantially impact clinical decision-making processes.",

We describe how the EEKG model dramatically simplifies the representation of patient data, facilitates temporal queries, enables a 360 view of patients and promotes scalability by partitioning patient data into shards. We solved the practical problem that not all clinical data and life science knowledge can be sharded. The solution is to federate each individual shard with common shared data in a knowledge graph. One such shared data source is the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) knowledge base, which contains genetic, drug clinical trials and Metathesaurus data that we link to individual patient records. We report on several use cases including EMR patient retrieval, matching patients with clinical trials, patient control group selection, and care quality measures.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMaintaining patient privacy is a challenge in large-scale observational research. To assist in reducing the risk of identifying study subjects through publicly available data, we introduce a method for obscuring date information for clinical events and patient characteristics.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe method, which we call Shift and Truncate (SANT), obscures date information to any desired granularity. Shift and Truncate first assigns each patient a random shift value, such that all dates in that patient's record are shifted by that amount. Data are then truncated from the beginning and end of the data set.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe data set can be proven to not disclose temporal information finer than the chosen granularity. Unlike previous strategies such as a simple shift, it remains robust to frequent - even daily - updates and robust to inferring dates at the beginning and end of date-shifted data sets. Time-of-day may be retained or obscured, depending on the goal and anticipated knowledge of the data recipient.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe method can be useful as a scientific approach for reducing re-identification risk under the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and may contribute to qualification for the Safe Harbor implementation.",

            "abstract": "Although the decentralized and autonomous implementation of health information systems has made it possible to extend the reach of surveillance systems to a variety of contextually disparate domains, public health use of data from these systems is not primarily anticipated. The Semantic Web has been proposed to address both representational and semantic heterogeneity in distributed and collaborative environments. We introduce a semantic approach for the integration of health data using the Resource Definition Framework (RDF) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) developed by the Semantic Web community.",

            "title": "Services Oriented Architectures and Rapid Deployment of Ad-Hoc Health Surveillance Systems: Lessons from Katrina Relief Efforts",
            "abstract": "During the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, a new city was born overnight within the City of Houston to provide accommodation and health services for thousands of evacuees deprived of food, rest, medical attention, and sanitation. The hurricane victims had been exposed to flood water, toxic materials, physical injury, and mental stress. This scenario was an invitation for a variety of public health hazards, primarily infectious disease outbreaks. Early detection and monitoring of morbidity and mortality among evacuees due to unattended health conditions was an urgent priority and called for deployment of real-time surveillance to collect and analyze data at the scene, and to enable and guide appropriate response and planning activities. The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHSC) and the Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) deployed an ad hoc surveillance system overnight by leveraging Internet-based technologies and Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). The system was post-coordinated through the orchestration of Web Services such as information integration, natural language processing, syndromic case finding, and online analytical processing (OLAP). Here we will report the use of Internet-based and distributed architectures in providing timely, novel, and customizable solutions on demand for unprecedented events such as natural disasters.",
