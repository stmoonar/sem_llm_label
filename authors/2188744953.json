            "title": "Domain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey",
            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing a highly useful, task-agnostic foundation for a wide range of applications. However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging direction critical for large language model applications. First, we propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes the LLM domain-specialization techniques based on the accessibility to LLMs and summarizes the framework for all the subcategories as well as their relations and differences to each other. Second, we present an extensive taxonomy of critical application domains that can benefit dramatically from specialized LLMs, discussing their practical significance and open challenges. Last, we offer our insights into the current research status and future trends in this area.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge-enhanced neural machine reasoning has garnered significant attention as a cutting-edge yet challenging research area with numerous practical applications. Over the past few years, plenty of studies have leveraged various forms of external knowledge to augment the reasoning capabilities of deep models, tackling challenges such as effective knowledge integration, implicit knowledge mining, and problems of tractability and optimization. However, there is a dearth of a comprehensive technical review of the existing knowledge-enhanced reasoning techniques across the diverse range of application domains. This survey provides an in-depth examination of recent advancements in the field, introducing a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing knowledge-enhanced methods into two primary categories and four subcategories. We systematically discuss these methods and highlight their correlations, strengths, and limitations. Finally, we elucidate the current application domains and provide insight into promising prospects for future research.",

            "abstract": "Offline policy evaluation (OPE) aims to accurately estimate the performance of a hypothetical policy using only historical data, which has drawn increasing attention in a wide range of applications including recommender systems and personalized medicine. With the presence of rising granularity of consumer data, many industries started exploring larger action candidate spaces to support more precise personalized action. While inverse propensity score (IPS) is a standard OPE estimator, it suffers from more severe variance issues with increasing action spaces. To address this issue, we theoretically prove that the estimation variance can be reduced by merging actions into groups while the distinction among these action effects on the outcome can induce extra bias. Motivated by these, we propose a novel IPS estimator with outcome-oriented action Grouping (GroupIPS), which leverages a Lipschitz regularized network to measure the distance of action effects in the embedding space and merges nearest action neighbors. This strategy enables more robust estimation by achieving smaller variances while inducing minor additional bias. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

Graph neural networks, also known as deep learning on graphs, graph representation learning, or geometric deep learning, have become one of the fastest-growing research topics in machine learning, especially deep learning. However, as the field rapidly grows, it has been extremely challenging to gain a global perspective of the developments of GNNs. Therefore, we feel the urgency to bridge the above gap and have a comprehensive tutorial on this fast-growing yet challenging topic. This tutorial of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Foundation, Frontiers and Applications will cover a broad range of topics in graph neural networks, by reviewing and introducing the fundamental concepts and algorithms of GNNs, new research frontiers of GNNs, and broad and emerging applications with GNNs. In addition, rich tutorial materials will be included and introduced to help the audience gain a systematic understanding by using our recently published book - Graph Neural Networks (GNN): Foundation, Frontiers and Applications, one of the most comprehensive book for researchers and practitioners for reading and studying in GNNs.",

            "abstract": "Event data are often dirty owing to various recording conventions or simply system errors. These errors may cause serious damage to real applications, such as inaccurate provenance answers, poor profiling results, or concealing interesting patterns from event data. Cleaning dirty event data is strongly demanded. While existing event data cleaning techniques view event logs as sequences, structural information does exist among events, such as the task passing relationships between staffs in workflow or the invocation relationships among different micro-services in monitoring application performance. We argue that such structural information enhances not only the accuracy of repairing inconsistent events but also the computation efficiency. It is notable that both the structure and the names (labeling) of events could be inconsistent. In real applications, while an unsound structure is not repaired automatically (which requires manual effort from business actors to handle the structure error), it is highly desirable to repair the inconsistent event names introduced by recording mistakes. In this article, we first prove that the inconsistent label repairing problem is NP-complete. Then, we propose a graph repair approach for (1) detecting unsound structures, and (2) repairing inconsistent event names. Efficient pruning techniques together with two heuristic solutions are also presented. Extensive experiments over real and synthetic datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.",

            "title": "Distilling Causal Metaknowledge from Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the explosive increase of information facilitates the massive knowledge graphs, which in turn increase burden of people to understand and leverage the regularity behind these superficial facts. Therefore, the metaknowledge, defined as the knowledge about knowledge, is proposed to identify complex processes of knowledge production and consumption. Unfortunately, even though the current correlation-based rule mining methods in knowledge graph distill the rule-formed metaknowledge, they can not explain the processes of knowledge production. In this paper, we focus on capturing the metaknowledge with causality which is generally regarded as one of the most promising techniques to reveal the interactions between components in the complex system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to interpret the knowledge graph from the causal perspective. For this purpose, we propose a causal metaknowledge method for link prediction, which achieves entity-level link prediction by discovering concept-level topological causality. Specifically, we first formalize causal metaknowledge as causal rule, following the form of logical rule. Then, we transform the relational data into propositional data to learn the causal relationships between topological structures. And an efficient algorithm for discovering local causal relationships is proposed using the d -seperation criterion. Eventually, the causal rules generated based on the mined relationships are used for link prediction. Both simulation-based and real data-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially under the Out-of-Distribution(OoD) settings.",
