            "abstract": "Nowadays, the integrity of online conversations is faced with a variety of threats, ranging from hateful content to manufactured media. In such a context, Internet Memes make the scalable automation of moderation interventions increasingly more challenging, given their inherently complex and multimodal nature. Existing work on Internet Meme classification has focused on black-box methods that do not explicitly consider the semantics of the memes or the context of their creation. This paper proposes a modular and explainable architecture for Internet Meme classification and understanding. We design and implement multimodal classification methods that perform exampleand prototype-based reasoning over training cases, while leveraging both textual and visual SOTA models to represent the individual cases. We study the relevance of our modular and explainable models in detecting harmful memes on two existing tasks: Hate Speech Detection and Misogyny Classification. We compare the performance between exampleand prototype-based methods, and between text, vision, and multimodal models, across different categories of harmfulness (e.g., stereotype and objectification). We devise a user-friendly interface that facilitates the comparative analysis of examples retrieved by all of our models for any given meme, informing the community about the strengths and limitations of these explainable methods.",

            "abstract": "Modern systems and applications generate and consume an enormous amount of data from different sources, including mobile edge computing and IoT systems. Our ability to locate and analyze these massive amounts of data will shape the future, building next-generation Big Data Analytics (BDA) and artificial intelligence systems in critical domains. Traditionally, big data materialize in a centralized repository (e.g., the cloud) for running sophisticated analytics using decent computation. Nevertheless, many modern applications and critical domains require low-latency data analysis with the right decision at the right time standard for building trust. With the advent of edge computing, that traditional deployment model shifted closer to the data sources at the network\u2019s edge. Such a shift was motivated by minimized latency, increased uptime, and enhanced efficiencies. This paper studies the BDA building blocks, analyzes the deployment requirements for edge-based BDA QoS, and drafts future trends. It also discusses critical open issues and further research directions for the next step of edge-based BDA.",

            "title": "IMKG: The Internet Meme Knowledge Graph",
            "abstract": ". Internet Memes (IMs) are creative media that combine text and vision modalities that people use to describe their situation by reusing an existing, familiar situation. Prior work on IMs has focused on analyzing their spread over time or high-level classification tasks like hate speech detection, while a principled analysis of their stratified semantics is missing. Hypothesizing that Semantic Web technologies are appropriate to help us bridge this gap, we build the first Internet Meme Knowledge Graph (IMKG) : an explicit representation with 2 million edges that capture the semantics encoded in the text, vision, and metadata of thousands of media frames and their adaptations as memes. IMKG is designed to fulfil seven requirements derived from the inherent characteristics of IMs. IMKG is based on a comprehensive semantic model, it is populated with data from representative IM sources, and enriched with entities extracted from text and vision connected through background knowledge from Wikidata. IMKG integrates its knowledge both in RDF and as a labelled property graph. We provide insights into the structure of IMKG, analyze its central concepts, and measure the effect of knowledge enrichment from different information modalities. We demonstrate its ability to support novel use cases, like querying for IMs that are based on films, and we provide insights into the signal captured by the structure and the content of its nodes. As a novel publicly available resource, IMKG opens the possibility for further work to study the semantics of IMs, develop novel reasoning tasks, and improve its quality.",

            "abstract": "Online conformance checking deals with finding discrepancies between real-life and modeled behavior on data streams. The current state-of-the-art output of online conformance checking is a prefix-alignment, which is used for pinpointing the exact deviations in terms of the trace and the model while accommodating a trace's unknown termination in an online setting. Current methods for producing prefix-alignments are computationally expensive and hinder the applicability in real-life settings. This paper introduces a new approximate algorithm - I Will Survive (IWS). The algorithm utilizes the trie data structure to improve the calculation speed, while remaining memory-efficient. Comparative analysis on real-life and synthetic datasets shows that the IWS algorithm can achieve an order of magnitude faster execution time while having a smaller error cost, compared to the current state of the art. In extreme cases, the IWS finds prefix-alignments roughly three orders of magnitude faster than previous approximate methods. The IWS algorithm includes a discounted decay time setting for more efficient memory usage and a look-ahead limit for improving computation time. Finally, the algorithm is stress tested for performance using a simulation of high-traffic event streams.",

            "abstract": "Prescriptive Performance Analysis (PPA) has shown to be more useful than traditional descriptive and diagnostic analyses for making sense of Big Data (BD) frameworks' performance. In practice, when processing large (RDF) graphs on top of relational BD systems, several design decisions emerge and cannot be decided automatically, e.g., the choice of the schema, the partitioning technique, and the storage formats. PPA, and in particular ranking functions, helps enable actionable insights on performance data, leading practitioners to an easier choice of the best way to deploy BD frameworks, especially for graph processing. However, the amount of experimental work required to implement PPA is still huge. In this paper, we present PAPyA 1, a library for implementing PPA that allows (1) preparing RDF graphs data for a processing pipeline over relational BD systems, (2) enables automatic ranking of the performance in a user-defined solution space of experimental dimensions; (3) allows user-defined flexible extensions in terms of systems to test and ranking methods. We showcase PAPyA on a set of experiments based on the SparkSQL framework. PAPyA simplifies the performance analytics of BD systems for processing large (RDF) graphs.We provide PAPyA as a public open-source library under an MIT license that will be a catalyst for designing new research prescriptive analytical techniques for BD applications.",

            "abstract": "The scientific community has been studying graph data models for decades. Their high expressiveness and elasticity led the scientific community to design a variety of graph data models and graph query languages, and the practitioners to use them to model real-world cases and extract useful information. Recently, property graphs and, in particular, Cypher 9 (the first open version of the well-known Neo4j Inc.'s language) are gaining popularity. Practitioners find Cypher useful and applicable in many scenarios. However, we are living in a streaming world where data continuously flows. A growing number of Cypher's users show interest in continuously querying graph data to act in a timely fashion. Indeed, Cypher lacks the features for dealing with streams of (graph) data and continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, an extension of Cypher, as a first attempt to introduce streaming features in the context of property graph query languages. Specifically, we define Seraph semantics, we propose a first version of Seraph syntax, and we discuss the potential impacts from a user perspective.",

            "abstract": "Social Media Analysis, Internet of Things, and Fake News detection have unveiled the relevance of real-time analytics on the Web. As a consequence, the Web infrastructure is evolving to enable continuous and reactive data access. Since data streams available on the Web originate from a variety of sources, they are highly heterogeneous. Indeed, addressing data variety and velocity simultaneously is inevitable. Stream Reasoning is the research field that studies how to combine data integration techniques with stream processing technologies. In particular, solutions for RDF Stream Processing (RSP) combine stream processing notions with data integration standards. This tutorial paper presents RSP4J, a innovative API that aims at fostering the adoption of RSP by simplifying the usage, benchmarking, and fast prototyping of Web Stream Processing applications.",
