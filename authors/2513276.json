            "abstract": "Abstract Crop plant breeding involves selecting and developing new plant varieties with desirable traits such as increased yield, improved disease resistance, and enhanced nutritional value. With the development of high-throughput technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, crop breeding has entered a new era. However, to effectively use these technologies, integration of multi-omics data from different databases is required. Integration of omics data provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes underlying plant traits and their interactions. This review highlights the importance of integrating omics databases in crop plant breeding, discusses available omics data and databases, describes integration challenges, and highlights recent developments and potential benefits. Taken together, the integration of omics databases is a critical step towards enhancing crop plant breeding and improving global food security.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Bacillus strains are ubiquitous in the environment and are widely used in the microbiological industry as valuable enzyme sources, as well as in agriculture to stimulate plant growth. The Bacillus genus comprises several closely related groups of species. The rapid classification of these remains challenging using existing methods. Techniques based on MALDI-TOF MS data analysis hold significant promise for fast and precise microbial strains classification at both the genus and species levels. In previous work, we proposed a geometric approach to Bacillus strain classification based on mass spectra analysis via the centroid method (CM). One limitation of such methods is the noise in MS spectra. In this study, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAE) to improve bacteria classification accuracy under noisy MS spectra conditions. We employed a denoising autoencoder approach to convert noisy MS spectra into latent variables representing molecular patterns in the original MS data, and the Random Forest method to classify bacterial strains by latent variables. Comparison of the DAE-RF with the CM method using the artificially noisy test samples showed that DAE-RF offers higher noise robustness. Hence, the DAE-RF method could be utilized for noise-robust, fast, and neat classification of Bacillus species according to MALDI-TOF MS data.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been associated with hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection as a potential risk factor. Nonetheless, the precise genetic regulatory mechanisms triggered by the virus, leading to virus-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, remain unclear. We hypothesized that HCV proteins might modulate the activity of aberrantly methylated HCC genes through regulatory pathways. Virus-host regulatory pathways, interactions between proteins, gene expression, transport, and stability regulation, were reconstructed using the ANDSystem. Gene expression regulation was statistically significant. Gene network analysis identified four out of 70 HCC marker genes whose expression regulation by viral proteins may be associated with HCC: DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID \u2013 1 (ID1), flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). It suggested the following viral protein effects in HCV/human protein heterocomplexes: HCV NS3(p70) protein activates human STAT3 and NOTC1; NS2-3(p23), NS5B(p68), NS1(E2), and core(p21) activate SETD2; NS5A inhibits SMYD3; and NS3 inhibits CCN2. Interestingly, NS3 and E1(gp32) activate c-Jun when it positively regulates CDKN2A and inhibit it when it represses TERT. The discovered regulatory mechanisms might be key areas of focus for creating medications and preventative therapies to decrease the likelihood of HCC development during HCV infection.",

            "abstract": "This special issue is based on the results of a German-Russian-Ukrainian project supported by the VolkswagenStiftung to analyze the biological mechanisms of co-morbid multifactorial diseases. One of the most urgent problems of modern medicine is related to the identification of molecular targets of drugs for the treatment of co-morbid diseases in humans. Achievements in various omics technologies have made it possible to study risks of diseases of interest at different molecular levels. Therefore, systems biology is developed to determine the effect of combined molecular pathways to build the causal link between genotype and phenotype. Such work showed that the diseases tend to exhibit co-morbidity if they share susceptibility genes. In this project the focus is hypertension and bronchial asthma as an example of common co-morbid diseases. Shared genes associated with the development of hypertension and asthma are identified, such as ADRB2, TNF, NOS, and many others. The goal of this project was to expand the knowledge on the mechanism and identify new drug targets for co-morbid diseases in humans using such frequently co-morbid observed pathologies as asthma and hypertension. The project partner from Novosibirsk identified important genes that are involved in co-morbid links between asthma and hypertension by using textand data-mining techniques. The result of this work is presented in Saik et al. relevant targets have been prioritized using well-known methods (ToppGene and Endeavor) and a cross-talk centrality criterion, calculated by analysis of associative gene networks from ANDSystem. Top 100 prioritized genes were found to exhibit significant positive dynamics in the frequency of mentioning them in scientific publications, suggesting increasing interest in the studies of these genes. The clinical and genetic data for this project came from the project partner of Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Therefore, Bragina et al. are describing a genetic aspect of different clinical phenotypes. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the identified genes by using bioinformatics approach were studied in patients with isolated and co-morbid diseases. It has been established that SNPs associated with comorbidity differs from SNPs associated with isolated asthma and hypertension. Molecular links of comorbidity of asthma and hypertension may be due to genes TLR4, CAT, ANG. Furthermore, based on the clinical data and semi-automatic data mining approaches a new database was developed and implemented, which presents the positive and negative drug list for asthma and hypertension. This new database is presented in Shoshi et al. A web-based implementation of this database allows the access to this information via internet. Finally, Drevytska et al. present pilot experiments and results about experimentally confirmed functionality changes of the target which was predicted in silico (Saik et al.) to be associated with both asthma and hypertension.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Comorbidity, a co-incidence of several disorders in an individual, is a common phenomenon. Their development is governed by multiple factors, including genetic variation. The current study was set up to look at associations between isolated and comorbid diseases of bronchial asthma and hypertension, on one hand, and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with regulation of gene expression (eQTL), on the other hand. A total of 96 eQTL SNPs were genotyped in 587 Russian individuals. Bronchial asthma alone was found to be associated with rs1927914 (TLR4), rs1928298 (intergenic variant), and rs1980616 (SERPINA1); hypertension alone was found to be associated with rs11065987 (intergenic variant); rs2284033 (IL2RB), rs11191582 (NT5C2), and rs11669386 (CARD8); comorbidity between asthma and hypertension was found to be associated with rs1010461 (ANG/RNASE4), rs7038716, rs7026297 (LOC105376244), rs7025144 (intergenic variant), and rs2022318 (intergenic variant). The results suggest that genetic background of comorbidity of asthma and hypertension is different from genetic backgrounds of both diseases manifesting isolated.",

The molecular mechanisms for the development of comorbidities need to be investigated. For this purpose, a workflow system was developed to aggregate data on biomedical entities from heterogeneous data sources. The process of integrating and merging all data sources of the workflow system was implemented as a semi-automatic pipeline that provides the import, fusion, and analysis of the highly connected biomedical data in a Neo4j database GenCoNet. As a starting point, data on the common comorbid diseases essential hypertension and bronchial asthma was integrated. GenCoNet (https://genconet.kalis-amts.de) is a curated database that provides a better understanding of hereditary bases of comorbidities.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Comorbid states of diseases significantly complicate diagnosis and treatment. Molecular mechanisms of comorbid states of asthma and hypertension are still poorly understood. Prioritization is a way for identifying genes involved in complex phenotypic traits. Existing methods of prioritization consider genetic, expression and evolutionary data, molecular-genetic networks and other. In the case of molecular-genetic networks, as a rule, protein-protein interactions and KEGG networks are used. ANDSystem allows reconstructing associative gene networks, which include more than 20 types of interactions, including protein-protein interactions, expression regulation, transport, catalysis, etc. In this work, a set of genes has been prioritized to find genes potentially involved in asthma and hypertension comorbidity. The prioritization was carried out using well-known methods (ToppGene and Endeavor) and a cross-talk centrality criterion, calculated by analysis of associative gene networks from ANDSystem. The identified genes, including IL1A, CD40LG, STAT3, IL15, FAS, APP, TLR2, C3, IL13 and CXCL10, may be involved in the molecular mechanisms of comorbid asthma/hypertension. An analysis of the dynamics of the frequency of mentioning the most priority genes in scientific publications revealed that the top 100 priority genes are significantly enriched with genes with increased positive dynamics, which may be a positive sign for further studies of these genes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract One of the most common comorbid pathology is asthma and arterial hypertension. For experimental modeling of comorbidity we have used spontaneously hypertensive rats with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, OVA-induced asthma group; OVA-induced asthma + IL10 shRNA interference group. Target gene (IL10) was predicted by ANDSystem. We have demonstrated that RNA-interference of IL10 affected cardiovascular (tested using Millar microcatheter system) as well as respiratory functions (tested using force-oscillation technique, Flexivent) in rats. We have shown that during RNA-interference of IL10 gene in vivo there were changes in both cardiac and lung function parameters. These changes in the cardiovascular parameters can be described as positive. But the more intensive heart workload can lead to exhaust and decompensation of the heart functions. Knockdown of IL10 gene in asthma modeling induces some positive changes in respiratory functions of asthmatic animals such as decreased elastance and increased compliance of the lungs, as well as less pronounced pathomorphological changes in the lung tissue. Thus, we provide the data about experimentally confirmed functionality changes of the target which was in silico predicted to be associated with both asthma and hypertension \u2013 in our new experimental model of comorbid pathology.",

            "title": "DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS FOR AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF KNOWLEDGE FROM TEXTS OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS FOR THE CREATION OF A KNOWLEDGE BASE SOLANUM TUBEROSUM",
            "abstract": "Currently there are hundreds of scientific journals that publish research results in various fields of plant biology and agrobiology. Hundreds of thousands of international patents contain a variety of information on agricultural biotechnology. The number of articles and patents is increasing over time in an exponential progression. For example, there are more than 1.5 million publications devoted to the study of Solanum tuberosum that is one of the most important crops in the world. Analysis of such huge number of experimental facts presented in text sources (scientific publications and patents), requires the use of automated methods for knowledge extraction (text-mining). Intelligent automatic text analysis techniques are already widely used in biology and medicine to extract information about the properties and functions of molecular genetic objects. Unlike search engines such as Google, Yandex and others, that search documents by keywords, such text-mining methods are aimed at the automatic extraction of knowledge presented in the documents, knowledge integration and formalization according to the defined ontology. Among the known systems for intelligent knowledge extraction from scientific publications STRING, LMMA, ConReg, GeneMania and others can be listed. For the first time in Russia, we have previously developed a system, named ANDSystem, for automatic intelligent knowledge extraction in biomedicine. ANDSystem contains more than 10 million facts about molecular-genetic interactions extracted from more than 25 million scientific publications. For knowledge extraction in ANDSystem, specially developed semantic and linguistic rules are used for recognition of interactions between biological objects such as, proteins, genes, metabolites, drugs, mi\u0441roRNA, biological processes, diseases and others in natural language texts. However, the problem of development of methods for automatic knowledge extraction from the texts in plant biology, agrobiology and agrobiotechnology remains still unsolved and has a high relevance. The aim of this work was to adapt the methods of automatic knowledge extraction, presented in ANDSystem, to the field of crop production and to create on this basis a SOLANUM TUBEROSUM knowledge base, containing information on genetics, markers, breeding and selection of potatoes, its pathogens and pests, storage and processing technologies and others. The knowledge base ontology contains dictionaries, corresponding to more than 20 types of objects, including molecular genetic objects (proteins, genes, metabolites, microRNA, biological processes, biomarkers, etc.), potato varieties and their phenotypic traits, diseases and pests of potato, biotic and abiotic environmental factors, biotechnologies of cultivation, processing and storage of potato, and others. Also, the ontology contains more than 25 types of interactions that describe various relationships between the above listed objects, including molecular interactions, regulatory events and associative links. More than 5 thousand semantic templates were created to extract information about the interactions. The accuracy and recall of knowledge extraction by the developed method were assessed with the expert manual analysis of the text corpus and reached more than 65 % and 70 %, respectively. The full-scale version of the knowledge base SOLANUM TUBEROSUM will be created on the basis of the developed approaches.",

It allows for the study of complex genetic systems function, including so-called mosaic gene networks, which consist of functionally interacting subnetworks. We conducted a study of a mosaic gene networks modeling method based on integration of models of gene subnetworks by linear control functionals. An automatic modeling of 10,000 synthetic mosaic gene regulatory networks was carried out using computer experiments on gene knockdowns/knockouts. Structural analysis of graphs of generated mosaic gene regulatory networks has revealed that the most important factor for building accurate integrated mathematical models, among those analyzed in the study, is data on expression of genes corresponding to the vertices with high properties of centrality.",
