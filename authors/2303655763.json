            "abstract": "We consider the problem of all-or-nothing resource allocation for tasks with diverse resource demands in resource-constrained heterogeneous systems. We observed that allocation approaches based on max-min fairness or admission control, despite their desirable properties, may fall short of satisfying task demands and utilizing the full potential of the heterogeneous system. This becomes particularly clear in high-demand scenarios where certain resource types may be insufficient to satisfy all task demands. We present Pricefair, a new all-or-nothing resource allocation mechanism for task demands in heterogeneous systems. The key contribution of Pricefair lies in its approach to high-demand scenarios when specific types of resources are exhausted. Rather than denying those tasks, Pricefair tries to allocate the surplus of that type of resource to less-loaded, better-performing, although more expensive, nodes in the cluster. In such instances, to maintain fairness, Pricefair employs a dynamic pricing model. By using the concept of price parity, Pricefair ensures that all users with resources in the exhausted tiers share the price increase and pay proportionally based on their resource requests. Through our experimental evaluation in realistic, high-demand scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of Pricefair.",

            "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations have emerged as an important tool to understand, debug, and audit complex machine learning models. To offer global counterfactual explainability, state-of-the-art methods construct summaries of local explanations, offering a trade-off among conciseness, counterfactual effectiveness, and counterfactual cost or burden imposed on instances. In this work, we provide a concise formulation of the problem of identifying global counterfactuals and establish principled criteria for comparing solutions, drawing inspiration from Pareto dominance. We introduce innovative algorithms designed to address the challenge of finding global counterfactuals for either the entire input space or specific partitions, employing clustering and decision trees as key components. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, considering various instances of the problem and comparing our proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the consistent capability of our algorithms to generate meaningful and interpretable global counterfactual explanations.",

            "abstract": "The radical advances in mobile computing, the IoT technological evolution along with cyberphysical components (e.g., sensors, actuators, control centers) have led to the development of smart city applications that generate raw or preprocessed data, enabling workflows involving the city to better sense the urban environment and support citizens\u2019 everyday lives. Recently, a new era of Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) infrastructures has emerged to support smart city applications that aim to address the challenges raised due to the spatio-temporal dynamics of the urban crowd as well as bring scalability and on-demand computing capacity to urban system applications for timely response. In these, resource capabilities are distributed at the edge of the network and in close proximity to end-users, making it possible to perform computation and data processing at the network edge. However, there are important challenges related to real-time execution, not only due to the highly dynamic and transient crowd, the bursty and highly unpredictable amount of requests but also due to the resource constraints imposed by the Mobile Edge Cloud environment. In this paper, we present TIMBER, our framework for efficiently supporting mobile daTa processing pIpelines in MoBile cloud EnviRonments that effectively addresses the aforementioned challenges. Our detailed experimental results illustrate that our approach can reduce the operating costs by 66.245% on average and achieve up to 96.4% similar throughput performance for agnostic workloads.",

            "title": "LHC hadronic jet generation using convolutional variational autoencoders with normalizing flows",
            "abstract": "In high energy physics, one of the most important processes for collider data analysis is the comparison of collected and simulated data. Nowadays the state-of-the-art for data generation is in the form of Monte Carlo (MC) generators. However, because of the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there will not be enough computational power or time to match the amount of needed simulated data using MC methods. An alternative approach under study is the usage of machine learning generative methods to fulfill that task. Since the most common final-state objects of high-energy proton collisions are hadronic jets, which are collections of particles collimated in a given region of space, this work aims to develop a convolutional variational autoencoder (ConVAE) for the generation of particle-based LHC hadronic jets. Given the ConVAE\u2019s limitations, a normalizing flow (NF) network is coupled to it in a two-step training process, which shows improvements on the results for the generated jets. The ConVAE+NF network is capable of generating a jet in 18.30\u00b10.04\u03bcs , making it one of the fastest methods for this task up to now.",
