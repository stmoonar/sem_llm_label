            "abstract": "We present Re-weighted Gradient Descent (RGD), a novel optimization technique that improves the performance of deep neural networks through dynamic sample importance weighting. Our method is grounded in the principles of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) with Kullback-Leibler divergence. RGD is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and compatible with widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam. We demonstrate the broad applicability and impact of RGD by achieving state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks, including improvements of +0.7% (DomainBed), +1.44% (tabular classification), +1.94% (GLUE with BERT), and +1.01% (ImageNet-1K with ViT).",

            "abstract": "Recent studies show that task distribution plays a vital role in the meta-learner's performance. Conventional wisdom is that task diversity should improve the performance of meta-learning. In this work, we find evidence to the contrary; (i) our experiments draw into question the efficacy of our learned models: similar manifolds can be learned with a subset of the data (lower task diversity). This finding questions the advantage of providing more data to the model, and (ii) adding diversity to the task distribution (higher task diversity) sometimes hinders the model and does not lead to a significant improvement in performance as previously believed. To strengthen our findings, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence.",

            "abstract": "Experience replay-based sampling techniques are essential to several reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms since they aid in convergence by breaking spurious correlations. The most popular techniques, such as uniform experience replay (UER) and prioritized experience replay (PER), seem to suffer from sub-optimal convergence and signi\ufb01cant bias error, respectively. To alleviate this, we introduce a new experience replay method for reinforcement learning, called Introspective Experience Replay (IER). IER picks batches corresponding to data points consecutively before the \u2018surprising\u2019 points. Our proposed approach is based on the theoretically rigorous reverse experience replay (RER), which can be shown to remove bias in the linear approximation setting but can be sub-optimal with neural approximation. We show empirically that IER is stable with neural function approximation and has a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques like uniform experience replay (UER), prioritized experience replay (PER), and hindsight experience replay (HER) on the majority of tasks.",

Our method builds upon the theoretically sound reverse experience replay (RER) technique, which has been shown to reduce bias in the output of Q-learning-type algorithms with linear function approximation.

            "abstract": "Darknet crypto markets are online marketplaces using crypto currencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero) and advanced encryption techniques to offer anonymity to vendors and consumers trading for illegal goods or services. The exact volume of substances advertised and sold through these crypto markets is difficult to assess, at least partially, because vendors tend to maintain multiple accounts (or Sybil accounts) within and across different crypto markets. Linking these different accounts will allow us to accurately evaluate the volume of substances advertised across the different crypto markets by each vendor. In this paper, we present a multi-view unsupervised framework (eDarkFind) that helps modeling vendor characteristics and facilitates Sybil account detection. We employ a multi-view learning paradigm to generalize and improve the performance by exploiting the diverse views from multiple rich sources such as BERT, stylometric, and location representation. Our model is further tailored to take advantage of domain-specific knowledge such as the Drug Abuse Ontology to take into consideration the substance information. We performed extensive experiments and demonstrated that the multiple views obtained from diverse sources can be effective in linking Sybil accounts. Our proposed eDarkFind model achieves an accuracy of 98% on three real-world datasets which shows the generality of the approach.",

            "abstract": "Internet Of Things (IoT) has evolved as a computational platform which can facilitate large scale computing using smart devices which are connected to each other over the Internet backbone. The increasing presence of the IoT along with its processing capabilities make this environment a common target of IoT malware attacks. In recent years, many malware detection models have come up which use techniques like machine learning and deep learning. IoT malwares can be detected using either a signature-based approach or by using a behavior-based approach. Although, the signature based approach works well in the detection of known threats, it is not very effective in detecting unknown threats. Most signature based approaches require one to have the domain knowledge and the need to use various pre-processing steps before detecting the malwares. This is not suitable for real time malware detection. In this work, we build a model to tackle the malware detection problem in IoT, using the raw byte-sequences which eliminates the need for domain specific knowledge. This allows us to perform real time malware detection with lesser computational requirements. In this paper, we discuss the various challenges in creating a neural network model and propose ways to address these challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed system can classify the IoT binaries as malware or benign with an accuracy of 99.01%.",
