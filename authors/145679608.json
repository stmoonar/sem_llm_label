            "abstract": "The explosion in the size and the complexity of the available Knowledge Graphs on the web has led to the need for efficient and effective methods for their understanding and exploration. Semantic summaries have recently emerged as methods to quickly explore and understand the contents of various sources. However in most cases they are static not incorporating user needs and preferences and cannot scale. In this paper we present iSummary a novel scalable approach for constructing personalized summaries. As the size and the complexity of the Knowledge Graphs for constructing personalized summaries prohibit efficient summary construction, in our approach we exploit query logs. The main idea behind our approach is to exploit knowledge captured in existing user queries for identifying the most interesting resources and linking them constructing as such highquality personalized summaries. We present an algorithm with theoretical guarantees on the summarys quality linear in the number of queries available in the query log. We evaluate our approach using three realworld datasets and several baselines showing that our approach dominates other methods in terms of both quality and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents ComDeX, a context-aware federated architecture and IoT platform for enabling data exchange between IoT-enhanced communities. Today, such smart communities are highly heterogeneous and siloed as they can offer IoT applications and services only to their local community inhabitants. ComDeX uses property graphs to represent smart community entities and automatically maps them to context-aware publish/subscribe messages. Such messages can be discovered and exchanged between communities via a hierarchical federated topology and an advertisement-based mechanism. The ComDeX prototype is implemented using well-known IoT technologies such as MQTT and NGSI-LD. ComDeX is evaluated using a realistic smart port scenario and compared against different federation topologies. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing NGSI-LD solutions in realistic IoT scenarios with synthetically generated workloads, with low impact in larger deployments where the number of hops between brokers of the federation increases.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a model-based approach to facilitate the development of IoT applications in Transportation Systems. Existing public transportation services are provided by relying on standard data models such as GTFS. However, such models are limited in representing IoT-based infrastructures and the locations that IoT devices cover (e.g., bus seating areas). We introduce a context-aware publish/subscribe IoT platform that supports synchronous data requests, asynchronous notifications and analytics applications. Data requests are created using the system\u2019s context, which in our case is based on a transport bus system. Both static and dynamic context properties are modeled by extending the NGSI smart data models. We then introduce a GTFS-to-NGSI mapping tool to enable the enhancement of existing GTFS-based transportation systems with IoT capabilities. We develop a prototype of our platform and we demonstrate the applicability of our approach using open data from the Roma Mobilit\u00e0 bus transportation system.",

            "abstract": ": While the pandemic of COVID-19 has proved a global challenge for humanity, it has also provided an un-precedented opportunity to study infectious diseases because of the globally coordinated effort to collect daily data and make it publicly available. As a result, it is possible to access data and try to improve on models and approaches. It is probably, so far, the largest effort to conduct testing on population at a global scale for an infectious disease. The aim of this project is to report on the relationship between the daily values of the test samples, the con\ufb01rmed cases and the positive rate for COVID-19 in Greece. A discussion on the volatility of the reported metrics by media coverage is carried out, to highlight the potential pitfalls of using the con\ufb01rmed cases or positive rate in isolation. For the case of Greece, a dependence in the number of tests and con\ufb01rmed cases on the weekdays is identi\ufb01ed. That dependence seemed to decrease with increasing number of tests. A comparison takes place between Greece and Austria which is a country with a similar size and also data regarding the RT-PCR tests and antigen tests are publicly available.",

Political sentiment analysis is used when a data analyst wants to determine the opinion of different users on social media platforms regarding a politician or a political event. This paper presents Athena Political Popularity Analysis (AthPPA), a tool for identifying political popularity over Twitter. AthPPA is able to collect in-real-time tweets and for each tweet to extract metadata such as number of likes, retweets per tweet etc. Then it processes their text in order to calculate their overall sentiment. For the calculation of sentiment analysis, we have implemented a sentiment analyzer that is able to identify the grammatical issues of a sentence as well as a lexicon of negative and positive words designed specifically for political sentiment analysis. An analytic engine processes the collected data and provides different visualizations that provide additional insights on the collected data. We show how we applied our framework to the three most prominent Greek political leaders in Greece and present our findings there.",

Second, we leverage these NMT models to produce English translations of Greek text as input for our NLP pipeline, to which we apply a series of pre-processing and triple extraction tasks. Finally, we back-translate the extracted triples to Greek. We conduct an evaluation of both our NMT and OIE methods on benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art for the Greek natural language.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things and the proliferation of easily compromisable IoT devices has led to a drastic increase in the occurrence of IoT-based botnet attacks. Hackers are keen on exploiting the vulnerabilities of smart devices, which are seen as easy targets often lacking robust security mechanisms. Identifying botnet activity is an active research topic and remains a challenging task due to the continuous evolution of botnet families that employ a large number of attack vectors. Traditional rule-based approaches which rely on signature matching, heuristics and behavioral profiling are always lagging one step behind the attacker, leading researchers to the development of machine and deep learning methods for the detection of compromised IoT device behaviour. In this paper, we model botnet traffic identification as an anomaly detection task, aiming at establishing a baseline of benign traffic, in order to detect unusual behavior using Netflow data. We propose a feature engineering and deep learning-based detection framework based on two Autoencoder architectures: (i) a vanilla implementation of a deep Autoencoder and (ii) GANomaly which has never been used in the context of network traffic analysis before. We validate the performance of the proposed methodology on the CICIDS2017 dataset which has been widely used for cybersecurity benchmarks and show that it is possible to induce highly accurate unsupervised learning models to detect previously unseen botnet behaviour.",

Knowledge graphs have now become common on the web, ranging from small taxonomies for categorizing web sites, to large knowledge bases that contain a vast amount of structured content. To enable their quick understanding and exploration semantic summaries have been proposed. A key issue of structural semantic summaries is the identification of the most important nodes. Works in the area, usually employ a single centrality measure, capturing a specific perspective on the notion of a node\u2019s importance. However, combining multiple centrality measures could give a more objective view, on which nodes should be selected as the most important ones. In this paper, we present Sum-MER, a novel framework that explores machine learning techniques for optimally combining multiple centrality measures for selecting the most important nodes. The experiments performed show the benefit of our approach, effectively increasing the quality of the generated summaries.",

In this maze of change, governments around the world cannot remain indifferent. Public administration is evolving and taking on a new form through e-government. A large number of organizations have set up websites, establishing an online interface with the citizens and businesses with which it interacts. However, most organizations, especially the decentralized agencies of the ministries and local authorities, do not offer their information electronically despite the fact that they provide many information services that are not integrated with other e-government services. Besides, these services are mainly focused on serving citizens and businesses and less on providing services to employees. In this paper, we describe the process of developing an ontology to support the administrative procedures of decentralized government organizations. Finally, we describe the development of an e-government portal that provides employees services that are processed online, using the above ontology for modeling and data management.",

INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "Introduction This was a feasibility pilot study aiming to develop and validate an activity recognition system based on a custom-made body-fixed sensor and driven by an algorithm for recognising basic kinetic movements in military personnel. The findings of this study are deemed essential in informing our development process and contributing to our ultimate aim which is to develop a low-cost and easy-to-use body-fixed sensor for military applications. Methods Fifty military participants performed a series of trials involving walking, running and jumping under laboratory conditions in order to determine the optimal, among five machine learning (ML), classifiers. Thereafter, the accuracy of the classifier was tested towards the prediction of these movements (15\u2009183 measurements) and in relation to participants\u2019 gender and fitness level. Results Random forest classifier showed the highest training and validation accuracy (98.5% and 92.9%, respectively) and classified participants with differences in type of activity, gender and fitness level with an accuracy level of 83.6%, 70.0% and 62.2%, respectively. Conclusions The study showed that accurate prediction of various dynamic activities can be achieved with high sensitivity using a low-cost easy-to-use sensor and a specific ML model. While this technique is in a development stage, our findings demonstrate that our body-fixed sensor prototype alongside a fully trained validated algorithm can strategically support military operations and offer valuable information to commanders controlling operations remotely. Further stages of our developments include the validation of our refined technique on a larger range of military activities and groups by combining activity data with physiological variables to predict phenomena relating to the onset of fatigue and performance decline.",

            "abstract": "Sentiment analysis over social media platforms has been an active case of study for more than a decade. This occurs due to the constant rising of Internet users over these platforms, as well as to the increasing interest of companies for monitoring the opinion of customers over commercial products. Most of these platforms provide free, online services such as the creation of interactive web communities, multimedia content uploading, etc. This new way of communication has affected human societies as it shaped the way by which an opinion can be expressed, sparking the era of digital revolution. One of the most profound examples of social networking platforms for opinion mining is Twitter as it is a great source for extracting news and a platform which politicians tend to use frequently. In addition to that, the character limitation per posted tweet (maximum of 280 characters) makes it easier for automated tools to extract its underlying sentiment. In this review paper, we present a variety of lexicon-based tools as well as machine learning algorithms used for sentiment extraction. Furthermore, we present additional implementations used for political sentiment analysis over Twitter as well as additional open topics. We hope the review will help readers to understand this scientifically rich area, identify best options for their work and work on open topics.",

            "abstract": "The usefulness of automated information extraction tools in generating structured knowledge from unstructured and semi-structured machine-readable documents is limited by challenges related to the variety and intricacy of the targeted entities, the complex linguistic features of heterogeneous corpora, and the computational availability for readily scaling to large amounts of text. In this paper, we argue that the redundancy and ambiguity of subject\u2013predicate\u2013object (SPO) triples in open information extraction systems has to be treated as an equally important step in order to ensure the quality and preciseness of generated triples. To this end, we propose a pipeline approach for information extraction from large corpora, encompassing a series of natural language processing tasks. Our methodology consists of four steps: i. in-place coreference resolution, ii. extractive text summarization, iii. parallel triple extraction, and iv. entity enrichment and graph representation. We manifest our methodology on a large medical dataset (CORD-19), relying on state-of-the-art tools to fulfil the aforementioned steps and extract triples that are subsequently mapped to a comprehensive ontology of biomedical concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our information extraction method by comparing it in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score with state-of-the-art OIE engines and demonstrate its capabilities on a set of data exploration tasks.",

            "abstract": "Chatbots, also known as conversation agents, are programs that are able to simulate and reproduce an intelligent conversation with humans. Although this type of program is not new, the explosion of the available information and the rapid increase of the users seeking this information have renewed the interest in their development. In this paper, we present R2D2, an intelligent chatbot relying on semantic web technologies and offering an intelligent controlled natural language interface for accessing the information available in DBpedia. The chatbot accepts structured input, allowing users to enter triple-pattern like queries, which are answered by the underlying engine. While typing, an auto-complete service guides users on creating the triple patterns, suggesting resources available in the DBpedia. Based on user input (in the form of triple-pattern like queries), the corresponding SPARQL queries are automatically formulated. The queries are submitted to the corresponding DBpedia SPARQL endpoint, and then the result is received by R2D2 and augmented with maps and visuals and eventually presented to the user. The usability evaluation performed shows the advantages of our solution and its usefulness.",

The paper presents the systems used and the results of this analysis, which was performed on social media posts from Twitter and Reddit. To achieve this, a specialized lexicon of terms was used to query social media content from the dedicated application programming interfaces (APIs) that the aforementioned social media platforms provide. The captured posts were then analyzed using a sentiment analysis framework, developed using state-of-the-art deep machine learning (ML) models. This framework provides labeling for the captured posts based on their content (i.e., classifies them as positive or negative opinions). The results of this classification were used to identify fears and autonomous mobility aspects that affect negative opinions. This method can provide a more realistic view of the general public\u2019s perception of automated mobility, as it has the ability to analyze thousands of opinions and encapsulate the users\u2019 opinion in a semi-automated way.",

The model \u201clearns\u201d the semantic correlations between word pairs in the training samples. When presented with trial greeklish text, the model uses this knowledge to disambiguate between all the possible transliterations of each greeklish word, by selecting the transliterations that have the highest learned correlation.

As a result they return several noisy data in most searches, leading to low precision and recall. Furthermore, usually a large number of images are returned in several sequential pages, a visualization way that is not view-and transmission-efficient. To overcome these problems an automatic wrapper-based image retrieval and presentation system is proposed that performs significantly better than other search engines. In particular our novel system exploits the format of multimedia sharing web sites to discover the underlying structure in order to finally infer and extract multimedia files and corresponding associated keywords from the web pages. Afterwards the gathered content is properly organized in a multiscale tree structure for efficient visualization. By this way, users can select only paths-of-interest in the tree structure, thus detecting the needed content much faster and spending less bandwidth compared to current solutions. Experimental results are presented that indicate the interesting performance of the proposed architecture.",

Their ultimate goal is to improve the Quality of Life of the elderly and to help them to live more independently. The technology service platform is integration of systems from Hewlett Packard (Italy), Alcatel-Lucent (Italy), Converge ICT Solutions (Greece), Eltronic A/S (Denmark) and Socrate Medical (Italy). The service platform has been tested, validated and evaluated in four different European pilot sites (Frederikshavn in Denmark, Lappeenranta in Finland, Trikala in Greece and Belfast in UK) for a duration of more than one year and based on the outcome from the real-life operations and user feedback, it has been optimised, improved and adapted for diverse regional conditions. This has been a very challenging process because the user and functional requirements are very high w.r.t. intuitive user interface with minimum user interaction, diverse needs of the main user groups, personalisation needs, requirements for stable operation despite of the fact that it is a pilot system, but working in real-life conditions and exposed to interruptions in connectivity, hardware failures, human errors, etc.",

In this paper an automatic multi-agent image retrieval system is proposed. Our novel system exploits the format of multimedia sharing Web sites to discover the underlying structure in order to finally infer and extract multimedia files and corresponding associated keywords from the Web pages.

            "abstract": "We use a Markovian model to capture the habitual user profiles of an information access system. In this model, the general as well as the individual for each user, profile is captured in the form of a Markovian process where the states are the keywords asked to the system by the users and a transition from state to state corresponds to the order theses keywords appeared in the queries. Under this model the probabilistic locality of the Markovian state space translates to semantical locality of the corresponding keywords in a way that a clustering of the Markovian state space corresponds to a semantic clustering of the keyword space. Since the states represent keywords asked by the users, the state space can grow very large, but at the same time it is partitioned into disjoint subsets such that strong interactions among the states of the same subset exists but weak interactions among states of different subsets. We exploit this structure to effectively cluster the large state space and reveal the corresponding semantic keyword clusters. We then define a semantic distance between the various user profiles that can be used to cluster the user space on the basis of keyword usage and keyword semantic relevance. The resulting clustering achieves high independence from the row data. Users for e.g. that never asked a common keyword may end up very close to each other if their keywords were asked together by many other users.",

Our architecture resembles the visual pathway of primates as we demonstrate how the rotated orientation specific receptive fields of the simple neurons can perform local curvature calculation of the planar shape that is projected on the retina of the eye. We then use the same method to encode planar curvature into the intensity of gray scale images and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this encoding by proposing a shape-based triple correlation invariant image classification scheme. We present experimental results illustrating that by encoding planar curvature into the intensity values we improve the recognition capability of multi layered neural network classifiers without imposing additional complexity to the learning process.",

            "abstract": "A fully automated wrapper for information extraction from Web pages is presented. The motivation behind such systems lies in the emerging need for going beyond the concept of \"human browsing\". The World Wide Web is today the main \"all kind of information\" repository and has been so far very successful in disseminating information to humans. By automating the process of information retrieval, further utilization by targeted applications is enabled. The key idea in our novel system is to exploit the format of the Web pages to discover the underlying structure in order to finally infer and extract pieces of information from the Web page. Our system first identifies the section of the Web page that contains the information to be extracted and then extracts it by using clustering techniques and other tools of statistical origin. STAVIES can operate without human intervention and does not require any training. The main innovation and contribution of the proposed system consists of introducing a signal-wise treatment of the tag structural hierarchy and using hierarchical clustering techniques to segment the Web pages. The importance of such a treatment is significant since it permits abstracting away from the raw tag-manipulating approach. Experimental results and comparisons with other state of the art systems are presented and discussed in the paper, indicating the high performance of the proposed algorithm.",

The emerging need for such systems occurs due to the need for going beyond the concept of \"human browsing\" by automating the process of information retrieval enabling further utilization by targeted applications. The key idea in our novel system is to exploit the format of the information contained in the Web pages discovering the underlying structure and finally maps it to semantic relationships. In doing this we identify one section of the Web page as the one containing the useful information and we proceed in extracting semantic tokens contained in this section by using clustering techniques and other tools of statistical origin. Our innovation consists in building a system that can operate without human intervention or training and yet achieving excellent extraction precision and recall.",
