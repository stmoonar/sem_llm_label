            "abstract": "We examine the problem of recommending items to ad-hoc user groups. Group recommendation in collaborative rating datasets has received increased attention recently and has raised novel challenges. Different consensus functions that aggregate the ratings of group members with varying semantics ranging from least misery to pairwise disagreement, have been studied. In this paper, we explore a new dimension when computing group recommendations, that is, affinity between group members and its evolution over time. We extend existing group recommendation semantics to include temporal affinity in recommendations and design GRECA, an efficient algorithm that produces temporal affinity-aware recommendations for ad-hoc groups. We run extensive experiments that show substantial improvements in group recommendation quality when accounting for affinity while maintaining very good performance.",

            "abstract": "Datasets are important for training and testing many information processing applications. In the field of news recommendation, there are still few available datasets, and many feel obliged to use nonnews datasets to test their algorithms for news recommendation. This paper presents some of the most common datasets for recommender systems in general, and explains why these datasets do not fully satisfy the needs in news recommendation. We then discuss the ongoing process of building up an entirely new dataset for Norwegian news in the SmartMedia project. In particular, we go through some of the features of news datasets that separate them from many other datasets and are crucial for their use in news recommendation.",

The prototype is context sensitive taking the user\u2019s location and time into account when giving recommendations. The prototype implements three algorithms to recommend concerts by taking advantage of what users have listened to before: a collaborative filtering algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor), a Matrix Factorization algorithm, and a Hybrid approach combining these two. The usability of the prototype was evaluated using the System Usability Scale and a user centered evaluation was performed to evaluate the quality of recommendations. The results from the usability evaluation shows that users generally were satisfied with the usability of the prototype. The results from the Quality Evaluation shows that the KNearest Neighbor and Hybrid approach produces satisfactory results whereas the Matrix Factorization implementation was experienced to be a bit poorer. The users testing the prototype were generally satisfied with the quality of recommendations.",

            "abstract": "In group recommendation systems, recommendations may be given to arbitrarily composed groups that may not display any particular characteristics across group members. Since individual recommendation systems can assume that the users\u2019 previous behavior is sufficient for coming up with new recommendations, statistical analyses of user logs or user preferences is enough for computing new recommendations with some degree of certainty. Group recommendation systems face a substantially more complex situation, as group members may be so different that no single recommendation seem acceptable and group processes may alter the individual preferences when users discuss their options. This paper discusses some of the intrinsic challenges of group recommendation systems and argue that current approaches to group recommendations only address part of the problem. A framework for analyzing the critical issues in group recommendations is presented and related to common recommendation problems.",

            "abstract": "We propose an approach to context-aware advertising in which context is defined by the products currently used by a consumer. Unlike more traditional approaches, consumers are neither identified nor tracked; instead, products are tagged. An interesting use-case scenario for this model is a product-aware outdoor advertising system that dynamically selects a product to advertise based on the products identified for one person or a group of people nearby. For example, RFID tags integrated into clothing of someone passing by a digital billboard could allow for determining preferences regarding style, fashion and brands. This information would be used by a digital billboard with an RFID reader to recommend and advertise complementary and other products. There would be no inherent connection between product information and the identity of the consumer; and therefore the privacy of the consumer would not be violated. Tagging and tracking of consumer products provides opportunities for more personalized and engaging marketing experiences without introducing a privacy risk.",

These recommendations were not only personalized on the basis of customer's behavior but also by considering user's location. MovieLens, a movie recommendation site, was used for model assessment. The results of the assessment showed that the method presented in this paper has a good accuracy for prediction of users' preferences.",
