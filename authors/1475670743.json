            "title": "GlobalBench: A Benchmark for Global Progress in Natural Language Processing",
            "abstract": "Despite the major advances in NLP, significant disparities in NLP system performance across languages still exist. Arguably, these are due to uneven resource allocation and sub-optimal incentives to work on less resourced languages. To track and further incentivize the global development of equitable language technology, we introduce GlobalBench. Prior multilingual benchmarks are static and have focused on a limited number of tasks and languages. In contrast, GlobalBench is an ever-expanding collection that aims to dynamically track progress on all NLP datasets in all languages. Rather than solely measuring accuracy, GlobalBench also tracks the estimated per-speaker utility and equity of technology across all languages, providing a multi-faceted view of how language technology is serving people of the world. Furthermore, GlobalBench is designed to identify the most under-served languages, and rewards research efforts directed towards those languages. At present, the most under-served languages are the ones with a relatively high population, but nonetheless overlooked by composite multilingual benchmarks (like Punjabi, Portuguese, and Wu Chinese). Currently, GlobalBench covers 966 datasets in 190 languages, and has 1,128 system submissions spanning 62 languages.",

            "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) models trained on people-generated data can be unreliable because, without any constraints, they can learn from spurious correlations that are not relevant to the task. We hypothesize that enriching models with speaker information in a controlled, educated way can guide them to pick up on relevant inductive biases. For the speaker-driven task of predicting code-switching points in English\u2013Spanish bilingual dialogues, we show that adding sociolinguistically-grounded speaker features as prepended prompts significantly improves accuracy. We find that by adding influential phrases to the input, speaker-informed models learn useful and explainable linguistic information. To our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate speaker characteristics in a neural model for code-switching, and more generally, take a step towards developing transparent, personalized models that use speaker information in a controlled way.",

            "title": "Rethinking End-to-End Evaluation of Decomposable Tasks: A Case Study on Spoken Language Understanding",
            "abstract": "Decomposable tasks are complex and comprise of a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Spoken intent prediction, for example, combines automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, typically hold out examples for only the surface-level sub-task. As a result, models with similar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance differences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between competitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct robust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility functions. Given a dataset for a decomposable task, our method optimally creates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of the end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we generate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights datasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing natural language understanding abilities, and one with held-out speakers to test speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10% between end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original test sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable comparisons between different architectures, driving future model development. We release our splits and tools for the community.",

            "title": "Classifying Powder Flowability for Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing Using Machine Learning",
            "abstract": "Metal powders are used as feedstock in a variety of manufacturing methods, wherein the metallic particulates may be deposited upon a substrate, spread upon a build plate, or melted layer-by-layer. Regardless of how the powder is consumed during a given manufacturing process, the ease with which a powder flows maintains a significant impact on the properties and behavior of the resultant component procured. This is especially true for cold spray additive manufacturing, which is a solid-state metallic particulate deposition process that requires suitable flowability to prevent component waviness as well as prevent nozzle clogging.That being said, particle-level geometrical properties, such as size and shape features, greatly impact the capacity of a powder to flow, or its flowability. Existing techniques for measuring a particle\u2019s flowability require manual powder processing which can be both time-consuming and vulnerable to man-made error. Both of these setbacks can be addressed through automatic, data-driven techniques trained to classify flowability from particle property measurements and expertly procured powder Hall Flow rates for training and testing.To our knowledge, we present the first computational model for classifying flowability (when captured in terms of the industrially standardized Hall Flow rates) of a metal powder given its particle-level physical property measurements. After obtaining twenty-one metal powder samples from manufacturers, particle-level physical property measurements of each powder were measured. We used these particle measurements to train a Decision Tree model to classify whether a particle\u2019s Hall Flow rate was fast or slow. With an achieved accuracy 98.04%, our work illustrates that powder flowability, through the lens of Hall Flow rates, can be accurately classified using data-driven techniques. This work lays a promising foundation for further exploration into predictive models for this cutting-edge domain.",

            "abstract": "The World Wide Web provides an excellent platform for investors to discover new partnership opportunities with a variety of companies. Analysts can categorize websites according to their business domains to retain relevant investment opportunities. Classifying websites manually is too expensive and time-consuming; thus, automatic classification tools are necessary. In this paper, we present FinDX (Financial Data EXploration), a tool for automatic website content classification for the financial technology (fintech) domain. At the core of our system is a keyword-based web crawler that extracts text from the landing page and relevant subpages, such as the About or Product pages of company websites. After cleaning the text and filtering it using part-of-speech tagging, we use a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify a company website as fintech or non-fintech. FinDX achieves high binary classification accuracy on two different datasets of business websites, attaining a maximal F-score of 96%. In addition, our flexible tool is easily adaptable to any business domain and is not resource-expensive. This makes FinDX ideal for use in startup environments.",
