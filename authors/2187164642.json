            "abstract": "Recent studies on Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) provide both empirical and theoretical evidence supporting their effectiveness in capturing structural patterns on both homophilic and certain heterophilic graphs. Notably, most real-world homophilic and heterophilic graphs are comprised of a mixture of nodes in both homophilic and heterophilic structural patterns, exhibiting a structural disparity. However, the analysis of GNN performance with respect to nodes exhibiting different structural patterns, e.g., homophilic nodes in heterophilic graphs, remains rather limited. In the present study, we provide evidence that Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) on node classification typically perform admirably on homophilic nodes within homophilic graphs and heterophilic nodes within heterophilic graphs while struggling on the opposite node set, exhibiting a performance disparity. We theoretically and empirically identify effects of GNNs on testing nodes exhibiting distinct structural patterns. We then propose a rigorous, non-i.i.d PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for GNNs, revealing reasons for the performance disparity, namely the aggregated feature distance and homophily ratio difference between training and testing nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical implications of our new findings via (1) elucidating the effectiveness of deeper GNNs; and (2) revealing an over-looked distribution shift factor on graph out-of-distribution problem and proposing a new scenario accordingly.",

            "title": "MRA-GNN: Minutiae Relation-Aware Model over Graph Neural Network for Fingerprint Embedding",
            "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in fingerprint embedding, which plays a critical role in modern Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems. However, previous works including CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches fail to exploit the nonstructural data, such as topology and correlation in fingerprints, which is essential to facilitate the identifiability and robustness of embedding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm for fingerprint embedding, called Minutiae Relation-Aware model over Graph Neural Network (MRA-GNN). Our proposed approach incorporates a GNN-based framework in fingerprint embedding to encode the topology and correlation of fingerprints into descriptive features, achieving fingerprint representation in the form of graph embedding. Specifically, we reinterpret fingerprint data and their relative connections as vertices and edges respectively, and introduce a minutia graph and fingerprint graph to represent the topological relations and correlation structures of fingerprints. We equip MRA-GNN with a Topological relation Reasoning Module (TRM) and Correlation-Aware Module (CAM) to learn the fingerprint embedding from these graphs successfully. To tackle the over-smoothing problem in GNN models, we incorporate Feed-Forward Module and graph residual connections into proposed modules. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various fingerprint datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our approach in exploiting nonstructural information of fingerprints.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to model complex relationships between entities in graph-structured data such as social networks, protein structures, and knowledge graphs. However, due to the size of real-world industrial graphs and the special architecture of GNNs, it is a long-lasting challenge for engineers and researchers to deploy GNNs on large-scale graphs, which significantly limits their applications in real-world applications. In this tutorial, we will cover the fundamental scalability challenges of GNNs, frontiers of large-scale GNNs including classic approaches and some newly emerging techniques, the evaluation and comparison of scalable GNNs, and their large-scale real-world applications. Overall, this tutorial aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the challenges and state-of-the-art techniques for scaling GNNs. The summary and discussion on future directions will inspire engineers and researchers to explore new ideas and developments in this rapidly evolving field.
