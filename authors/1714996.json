            "abstract": "Predicting traffic flow on a road network is crucial in various aspects of the transportation domain, encompassing safety and logistics. This paper introduces an innovative approach to forecast traffic flow, with a specific emphasis on predicting future traffic along paths within a road network. The proposed framework is tailored to accept GPS trajectory data as input, generating time series data illustrating traffic flow along designated pathways. It achieves this by utilizing only a subset of trajectories that strictly follow the paths without detours. This intuitive approach results in training data that better captures the essence of the forecasting problem. In the final step of our methodology, we employ state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods, including ensemble trees and recurrent neural networks. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it using a real-world dataset, demonstrating its capability in predicting traffic flow.",

            "abstract": "Digital twins serve as virtual representations of physical environments that are increasingly valuable across various sectors, including maritime operations. The complexity of monitoring vessel traffic through the Automatic Identification System (AIS), demands more sophisticated, data-driven approaches due to the extreme vessel volume and intricate vessel movement patterns. In this paper, we present a highly scalable system for maritime route and event forecasting that leverages streaming real-time AIS data for vessel route prediction, traffic state estimation, and event detection based on the actor model. The proposed solution integrates data driven models on the actor level for route forecasting that utilize vessel specific features and are adapted according to the system requirements and the limitations of AIS streaming service networks. Leveraging the forecasting functionalities, the platform is able not only to detect but also forecast events of interest for the entire global fleet accurately and consistently without any memory or system issue and continuously generate predictions for 170K vessels during performance experiments, which demonstrates the high scalability and versatility of the proposed architecture for global maritime digital twin applications.",

            "abstract": "The wide spread of Automatic Identification System (AIS) has motivated several maritime analytics operations. Vessel Location Forecasting (VLF) is one of the most critical operations for maritime awareness. However, accurate VLF is a challenging problem due to the complexity and dynamic nature of maritime traffic conditions. Furthermore, as privacy concerns and restrictions have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in dispersed databases of several isolated data silos among different organizations, which in turn decreases the quality of learning models. In this paper, we propose an efficient VLF solution based on LSTM neural networks, in two variants, namely Nautilus and FedNautilus for the centralized and the federated learning approach, respectively. We also demonstrate the superiority of the centralized approach with respect to current state of the art and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the federated against the centralized approach.",

In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Vessel Traffic Flow Forecasting (VTFF) is vital for maritime harbor supervision, safety management and collision avoidance. Previous works approach the VTFF problem from two different perspectives: a) directly - by predicting the future traffic based on sequence analysis of historical traffic flow,and b) indirectly - by estimating the future traffic based on future vessel locations produced by vessel route forecasting algorithms. In this work, we introduce the Unified Approach for VTFF (UA-VTFF) method by taking advantage of both the indirect and direct paradigms. Our method, in order to predict the future vessel traffic flow in a time horizon of up to 30 min for a specific space, utilizes the results of the indirect paradigm by feeding them into a model that approaches the VTFF problem directly. UA-VTFF is validated over real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and compared to baseline methods with quite promising results.",

To address this challenge, we present VesselVision, a system that estimates, tracks, and visualizes vessels' collision risk. In particular, our system offers a unified solution that tracks vessels that are detected to be in encountering process and assess their corresponding collision risk over streaming AIS position data in an online fashion.

The architecture makes use of a data lake for scalable storage of diverse mobility data sets, on top of which separate computing and storage layers are implemented to allow independent scaling with a data operations toolbox providing all data operations. Furthermore, to cater for mobility analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence support, an edge analytics suite is provided that encompasses distributed algorithms for mobility analytics and federated learning, thereby exploiting edge computing technologies. In turn, this is supported by a resource allocator that monitors the energy consumption of data-intensive operations and provides this information to the platform for intelligent task placement in edge devices, aiming at energy-efficient operations. As a result, an end-to-end platform is proposed that combines data services and infrastructure services towards supporting mobility application domains, such as urban and maritime.",

This paper introduces a novel Vessel Location Forecasting (VLF) framework, based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks, aiming to perform effective location forecasting in time horizons up to 60 minutes, even for vessels not recorded in the past. The proposed VLF framework is specially designed for handling vessel data by addressing some major GPS-related obstacles including variable sampling rate, sparse trajectories, and noise contained in such data. Our framework also learns by incorporating a novel trajectory data augmentation method to improve its predictive power. We validate VLF framework using three real-word datasets of vessels moving in different sea areas, comparing with various methods, and examining several aspects. Results prove VLF framework\u2019s generic nature, robustness regarding parameter changes, and superiority against state of the art in terms of prediction accuracy (higher than 30%) and computational effort.",

            "title": "Collision Risk Assessment and Forecasting on Maritime Data",
            "abstract": "The wide spread of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and related tools has motivated several maritime analytics operations. One of the most critical operations for the purpose of maritime safety is the so-called Vessel Collision Risk Assessment and Forecasting (VCRA/F), with the difference between the two lying in the time horizon when the collision risk is calculated: either at current time by assessing the current collision risk (i.e., VCRA) or in the (near) future by forecasting the anticipated locations and corresponding collision risk (i.e., VCRF). Accurate VCRA/F is a difficult task, since maritime traffic can become quite volatile due to various factors, including weather conditions, vessel manoeuvres, etc. Addressing this problem by using complex models introduces a trade-off between accuracy (in terms of quality of assessment / forecasting) and responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework that discovers encountering vessels and assesses/predicts their corresponding collision risk probability, in the latter case via state-of-the-art vessel route forecasting methods. Our experimental study on a real-world AIS dataset demonstrates that the proposed framework balances the aforementioned trade-off while presenting up to 70% improvement in R2 score, with an overall accuracy of around 96% for VCRA and 77% for VCRF.",
