            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) and the Social Linked Data (\\textttSolid ~\\footnotehttps://solidproject.org/ ) framework represent decentralized approaches to machine learning and web development, respectively, with a focus on preserving privacy. Federated learning enables the distributed training of machine learning models across datasets partitioned across multiple clients, whereas applications developed with the Solid approach store data inPersonal Online Data Stores (pods) under the control of individual users. This paper discusses the merits and challenges of executing Federated Learning on Solid pods and the readiness of the Solid server architecture to support this. We aim to detail these challenges, in addition to identifying avenues for further work to fully harness the benefits of Federated Learning in Solid environments, where users retain sovereignty over their data.",

            "abstract": "In the digital age, where health data and digital lives converge, data privacy and control are crucial. The advent of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) brings advanced data analysis and healthcare predictions, but also privacy concerns. The ESPRESSO project 1 asserts that for AI to be trustworthy and effective in healthcare, it must prioritize user control over corporate interests. The shift towards decentralized personal online datastores (pods) and Solid 2 principles represents a new era of private, controllable Web interactions, balancing AI data protection and machine intelligence. This balance is particularly important for applications involving health data. However, decentralization poses challenges, particularly in secure, efficient data search and data retrieval, that need to be addressed first. We argue that a decentralized search system that provides a large-scale search across Solid pods, while considering data owners' control of their data and users' different access rights, is crucial for this new paradigm. In this paper, we describe how our current decentralized search system's prototype (ESPRESSO) helps to query structured and unstructured personal health data in Solid servers. The paper also describes a search scenario that shows how ESPRESSO can search health data combined with fitness personal data stored in different personal datastores",

Solid 1, a decentralized Web ecosystem, restores individual privacy and control by separating data from applications, allowing integration across applications while enabling users to control access. The growth in Solid's decentralized pods, and the escalating amounts of data stored in them, necessitate a decentralized search mechanism to query data within personal datastores, while respecting varying access constraints. This demo paper presents our decentralized search system (ESPRESSO) for querying RDF and non-RDF data in Solid datastores, tackling challenges like query propagation, data indexing, privacy, and results aggregation.",

            "abstract": "As input data distributions evolve, the predictive performance of machine learning models tends to deteriorate. In practice, new input data tend to come without target labels. Then, state-of-the-art techniques model input data distributions or model prediction distributions and try to understand issues regarding the interactions between learned models and shifting distributions. We suggest a novel approach that models how explanation characteristics shift when affected by distribution shifts. We \ufb01nd that the modeling of explanation shifts can be a better indicator for detecting out-of-distribution model behaviour than state-of-the-art techniques. We analyze different types of distribution shifts using synthetic examples and real-world data sets. We provide an algorithmic method that allows us to inspect the interaction between data set features and learned models and compare them to the state-of-the-art. We release our methods in an open-source Python package, as well as the code used to reproduce our experiments.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Rigorous research into the historical past of Web technology-driven innovation becomes timely as technological growth and forecasting are attracting popular interest. Drawing on economic and management literature relating to the typical trends of technological innovation, we examine the long-term development of Web technology in a theoretically informed and empirical manner. An original longitudinal dataset of 20,493 Web-related US patents is used to trace the growth curve of Web technology between the years of 1990 through 2013. We find that the accumulation of corporate Web inventions followed an S-shaped curve which shifted to linear growth after year 2004. This transition is unusual in relation to the traditional S-curve model of technological development that typically approaches a limit. The point of inflection on the S-curve coincided reasonably closely with the timing of the dot-com crash in year 2000. Moreover, we find a complex bi-directional relationship between patenting rates in Web technology and movements in the NASDAQ composite stock index. The implications of these results are discussed in theoretical and practical terms for sustained technological growth. Specific recommendations for different stakeholders in commercial Web development are included.",

In this survey, we focus on data\u2010driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms.

            "abstract": "In today\u2019s Internet, a web user becomes members of multiple social networks due to different types of services provided by each of these networks. This creates an opportunity to make trust decisions that go beyond individual social networks, since these networks provide single perspective of trust. To make trust inference over multiple social networks, these networks need to be consolidated. It is nontrivial as these networks are of heterogeneous nature due to different naming conventions used in these networks. Furthermore, trust metrics extracted from these networks are also varied in nature due to different trust evaluation algorithms used in each of these networks. Heterogeneity of these social networks can be overcome by using semantic technologies as it allows us to represent knowledge using ontologies. Trust data can be consolidated by using such data fusion techniques which not only provide but also preserve trust data integrity from each of the individual social network profiles. The proposed semantic framework is evaluated using two sets of experiments. Through simulations in this work, we analysed various techniques for data fusion. For identifying suitable technique that preserves the integrity of trust consolidated from each of the individual networks, analysis revealed that Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging parameter best aggregated trust data, and, unlike other techniques, it preserved the integrity of trust from each individual network for varying participant overlap and tie overlap (p\u22640.05). Similarly, for experimental analysis, we used findings of the simulation study about the best trust aggregation technique and applied the proposed framework on real-life trust data between participants, which we extracted from pairs of professional social networks. Analysis partially proved our hypothesis about generating better trust values from consolidated multiple heterogeneous networks. We witnessed an improvement in overall results for all the participants who were part of multiple social networks (p\u22640.05), while disproving the claim for those existing in nonoverlapping regions of the social networks.",

            "abstract": "The Web has been the subject of compelling biological metaphors that liken it to an evolving ecosystem. Analogies of this kind could benefit from further theoretical and empirical examination. Evolutionary and cognitive approaches provide not only a powerful theoretical framework to address this theme, but also a heritage of robust analytic tools that can help to quantify complex and subjective social and technological phenomena. The goal of this workshop will be to discuss how evolutionary approaches can inform our understanding of the Web at present, as well as methodological challenges and opportunities to shape its evolution into the future.",
