            "title": "Graph Neural Network based Future Clinical Events Prediction from Invasive Coronary Angiography",
            "abstract": "Early prediction of future clinical events from invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains a daily challenge in clinical routine practice. In this study, we hypothesize that stenosis\u2019s geometry information could benefit the prediction of future events from ICA. To address this, we propose a framework that employs graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit geometry information from ICA and integrates it with clinical information to predict the occurrence of events at the stenosis level. The proposed model can be extended to predict events using two-view imaging data as well. The performance is compared to classical baseline models on a dataset comprising 1551 stenosis, out of which 414 exhibited an event in the following two years. The results illustrate that the proposed approach outperforms other models, with F1-scores of 0.57 and 0.59 for one-view and two-view data, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the importance of the geometry information for future events prediction in a learning context. The code is available at https://github.com/xsunn/eventsPre.",

Although numerous systems have been developed so far, existing system evaluations lack in rigour. In this work, we build a text-to-SQL benchmark that covers different classes of queries, and we evaluate the effectiveness of several systems in the field. To evaluate system efficiency, we measure execution time and resource consumption for the different query classes. Our comprehensive evaluation aims at filling in a big gap in understanding the capabilities and boundaries of existing systems and it reveals several open challenges.",

            "abstract": "A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",
