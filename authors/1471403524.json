            "title": "Can Knowledge Graphs Simplify Text?",
            "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG)-to-Text Generation has seen recent improvements in generating fluent and informative sentences which describe a given KG. As KGs are widespread across multiple domains and contain important entity-relation information, and as text simplification aims to reduce the complexity of a text while preserving the meaning of the original text, we propose KGSimple, a novel approach to unsupervised text simplification which infuses KG-established techniques in order to construct a simplified KG path and generate a concise text which preserves the original input's meaning. Through an iterative and sampling KG-first approach, our model is capable of simplifying text when starting from a KG by learning to keep important information while harnessing KG-to-text generation to output fluent and descriptive sentences. We evaluate various settings of the KGSimple model on currently-available KG-to-text datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to unsupervised text simplification models which start with a given complex text. Our code is available on GitHub.",

            "abstract": "Forest inventory forms the foundation of forest management. Remote sensing (RS) is an efficient means of measuring forest parameters at scale. Remotely sensed species classification can be used to estimate species abundances, distributions, and to better approximate metrics such as aboveground biomass. State-of-the-art methods of RS species classification rely on deep-learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models have two major drawbacks: they require large samples of each species to classify well and they lack explainability. Therefore, rare species are poorly classified causing poor approximations of their associated parameters. We show that the classification of rare species can be improved by as much as eight F1-points using a neuro-symbolic (NS) approach that combines CNNs with an NS framework. The framework allows for the incorporation of domain knowledge into the model through the use of mathematically represented rules, improving model explainability.",

            "abstract": "Check-worthy claim detection aims at providing plausible misinformation to the downstream fact-checking systems or human experts to check. This is a crucial step toward accelerating the fact-checking process. Many efforts have been put into how to identify check-worthy claims from a small scale of pre-collected claims, but how to efficiently detect check-worthy claims directly from a large-scale information source, such as Twitter, remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MythQA, a new multi-answer open-domain question answering(QA) task that involves contradictory stance mining for query-based large-scale check-worthy claim detection. The idea behind this is that contradictory claims are a strong indicator of misinformation that merits scrutiny by the appropriate authorities. To study this task, we construct TweetMythQA, an evaluation dataset containing 522 factoid multi-answer questions based on controversial topics. Each question is annotated with multiple answers. Moreover, we collect relevant tweets for each distinct answer, then classify them into three categories: \"Supporting\", \"Refuting\", and \"Neutral\". In total, we annotated 5.3K tweets. Contradictory evidence is collected for all answers in the dataset. Finally, we present a baseline system for MythQA and evaluate existing NLP models for each system component using the TweetMythQA dataset. We provide initial benchmarks and identify key challenges for future models to improve upon. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/TonyBY/Myth-QA",
