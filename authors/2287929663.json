            "title": "A Hierarchical Dataflow-Driven Heterogeneous Architecture for Wireless Baseband Processing",
            "abstract": "Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\\times$ and $2.3\\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.",

            "abstract": "Open radio access network (O-RAN) is considered as a viable method for reducing the cost and enhancing the energy efficiency of cellular networks, due to its native incorporation of intelligence and open interfaces. However, the processing delay of software-based wireless protocol stacks has hindered its development. This paper presents the implementation of parallel computing acceleration for an LTE baseband system based on single program multiple data (SPMD) methodology, and proposes detailed optimization strategies for the time-consuming synchronization and OFDM modulation modules in the system. Experiment results based on the implicit SPMD program compiler (ISPC) show that continuous memory access has a significant impact on the final acceleration effect. Moreover, the processing speed of software-based physical layer can be increased up to 10\u201330 times through SPMD.",
