            "abstract": "Automated tracking of physical fitness has sparked a health revolution by allowing individuals to track their own physical activity and health in real time. This concept is beginning to be applied to tracking of cognitive load. It is well known that activity in the brain can be measured through changes in the body\u2019s physiology, but current real-time measures tend to be unimodal and invasive. We therefore propose the concept of a wearable educational fitness (EduFit) tracker. We use machine learning with physiological data to understand how to develop a wearable device that tracks cognitive load accurately in real time. In an initial study, we found that body temperature, skin conductance, and heart rate were able to distinguish between (i) a problem solving activity (high cognitive load), (ii) a leisure activity (moderate cognitive load), and (iii) daydreaming (low cognitive load) with high accuracy in the test dataset. In a second study, we found that these physiological features can be used to predict accurately user-reported mental focus in the test dataset, even when relatively small numbers of training data were used. We explain how these findings inform the development and implementation of a wearable device for temporal tracking and logging a user\u2019s learning activities and cognitive load.",

            "title": "kBot: Knowledge-Enabled Personalized Chatbot for Asthma Self-Management",
            "abstract": "There is a well-recognized need for a shift to proactive asthma care given the impact asthma has on overall healthcare costs. The demand for continuous monitoring of patient's adherence to the medication care plan, assessment of environmental triggers, and management of asthma can be challenging in traditional clinical settings and taxing on clinical professionals. Recent years have seen a robust growth of general purpose conversational systems. However, they lack the capabilities to support applications such an individual's health, which requires the ability to contextualize, learn interactively, and provide the proper hyper-personalization needed to hold meaningful conversations. In this paper, we present kBot, a knowledge-enabled personalized chatbot system designed for health applications and adapted to help pediatric asthmatic patients (age 8 to 15) to better control their asthma. Its core functionalities include continuous monitoring of the patient's medication adherence and tracking of relevant health signals and environment data. kBot takes the form of an Android application with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in both text and voice, and a backend cloud-based server application that handles data collection, processing, and dialogue management. It achieves contextualization by piecing together domain knowledge from online sources and inputs from our clinical partners. The personalization aspect is derived from patient answering questionnaires and day-to-day conversations. kBot's preliminary evaluation focused on chatbot quality, technology acceptance, and system usability involved eight asthma clinicians and eight researchers. For both groups, kBot achieved an overall technology acceptance value of greater than 8 on the 11-point Likert scale and a mean System Usability Score (SUS) greater than 80. A demo of our kBot application is available at this URL: https://bit.ly/kBot\\_demo.",

            "abstract": "Objective: Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease with multiple triggers manifesting as symptoms with various intensities. This paper evaluates the suitability of long-term monitoring of pediatric asthma using diverse data to qualify and quantify triggers that contribute to the asthma symptoms and control to enable a personalized management plan. \nMaterials and Methods: Asthma condition, environment, and adherence to the prescribed care plan were continuously tracked for 97 pediatric patients using kHealth-Asthma technology for one or three months. \nResult: At the cohort level, among 21% of the patients deployed in spring, 63% and 19% indicated pollen and Particulate Matter (PM2.5), respectively, as the major asthma contributors. Of the 18% of the patients deployed in fall, 29% and 21% found pollen and PM2.5 respectively, to be the contributors. For the 28% of the patients deployed in winter, PM2.5 was identified as the major contributor for 80% of them. One patient across each season has been chosen to explain the determination of personalized triggers by observing correlations between triggers and asthma symptoms gathered from anecdotal evidence. \nDiscussion and Conclusion: Both public and personal health signals including compliance to prescribed care plan have been captured through continuous monitoring using the kHealth-Asthma technology which generated insights on causes of asthma symptoms across different seasons. Collectively, they can form the underlying basis for personalized management plan and intervention. \nKEYWORDS: Personalized Digital Health, Medical Internet of Things, Pediatric Asthma Management, Patient Generated Health Data, Personalized Triggers, Telehealth,",
