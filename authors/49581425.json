            "abstract": "Data science is a field that has developed to enable efficient integration and analysis of increasingly large data sets in many domains. In particular, big data in genetics, neuroimaging, mobile health, and other subfields of biomedical science, promises new insights, but also poses challenges. To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, including a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with developing a resource for personalized data science training for biomedical researchers. The BD2K TCC web portal is powered by ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index, which collects training resources for data science, including online courses, videos of tutorials and research talks, textbooks, and other web-based materials. While the availability of so many potential learning resources is exciting, they are highly heterogeneous in quality, difficulty, format, and topic, making the field intimidating to enter and difficult to navigate. Moreover, data science is rapidly evolving, so there is a constant influx of new materials and concepts. We leverage data science techniques to build ERuDIte itself, using data extraction, data integration, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing to automatically collect, integrate, describe, and organize existing online resources for learning data science.",

            "abstract": "Evidence plays a crucial role in any biomedical research narrative, providing justification for some claims and refutation for others. We seek to build models of scientific argument using information extraction methods from full-text papers. We present the capability of automatically extracting text fragments from primary research papers that describe the evidence presented in that paper\u2019s figures, which arguably provides the raw material of any scientific argument made within the paper. We apply richly contextualized deep representation learning pre-trained on biomedical domain corpus to the analysis of scientific discourse structures and the extraction of \u201cevidence fragments\u201d (i.e., the text in the results section describing data presented in a specified subfigure) from a set of biomedical experimental research articles. We first demonstrate our state-of-the-art scientific discourse tagger on two scientific discourse tagging datasets and its transferability to new datasets. We then show the benefit of leveraging scientific discourse tags for downstream tasks such as claim-extraction and evidence fragment detection. Our work demonstrates the potential of using evidence fragments derived from figure spans for improving the quality of scientific claims by cataloging, indexing and reusing evidence fragments as independent documents.",

We benchmark various state-of-the-art NLP and computer vision models, including unimodal models which only take either caption texts or images as inputs, and multimodal models. Extensive experiments and analysis show that multimodal models, despite outperforming unimodal ones, still need improvements especially on a less-supervised way of grounding visual concepts with languages, and better transferability to low resource domains. We release our dataset and the benchmarks to facilitate future research in multimodal learning, especially to motivate targeted improvements for applications in scientific domains.",

ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data.

The information in this resource tends to follow a style of discourse that is intended to provide scientific explanations for various pieces of evidence derived from experimental findings. Studying the rhetorical structure of the narrative discourse could enable more powerful information extraction methods to automatically construct models of scientific argument from full-text papers. In this paper, we apply richly contextualized deep representation learning to the analysis of scientific discourse structures as a clause-tagging task. We improve the current state-of-the-art clause-level sequence tagging over text clauses for a set of discourse types (e.g. \"hypothesis\", \"result\", \"implication\", etc.) on scientific paragraphs. Our model uses contextualized embeddings, word-to-clause encoder, and clause-level sequence tagging models and achieves F1 performance of 0.784.",

            "abstract": "The eighth Wake Conference, held between 20th and 22nd of June 2023, marks nearly a decade and a half of successful international conferences focused on advancements in the field of wake dynamics. This bi-annual conference, held for the past decade on the island of Gotland, Sweden seeks to aid in this by providing a venue for scientists and PhD students working in the field of wake dynamics to come together and share their research and expertise. To understand the need for this conference one only needs to look to modern wind farms. These massive energy facilities rival the production of a nuclear power plant and consist of dozens or potentially hundreds of individual wind turbines. The numbers of turbines involved make it unavoidable that they will invariably be impacted by the wakes of upstream turbines. This wake interaction results in a decreased power production, caused by the lower kinetic energy in the wind, and an increase in the turbulence intensity. This decrease in power emphases the importance of understanding the physical nature of vortices and their dynamics in the wake of a turbine when designing the layout of these immense wind farms. The clear importance of farm design, and the related interest in the field of wake and wind farm aerodynamics, can be seen in the growing number of scientific articles on the subject. Further, in order to make a substantial impact on one of the most significant challenges of our time - global climate change - the wind industry\u2019s growth must continue. A part of making this growth possible, and to solve some of the scientific problems of doing so, will require research into the different areas of the physics of wind turbine and wind farm wakes. To this end, the conference covers the following subject areas: Wake and vortex dynamics, instabilities in trailing vortices and wakes, simulation and measurements of wakes, analytical approaches for modeling wakes, wake interaction along with other wind farm investigations. We would like to thank all those that assisted in the review process for the 55 papers which constitute the proceedings of the Wake Conference 2023 that were selected to be published. We are also thankful for the help we have received from the editorial team at IOP Publishing during the process.

The ImageCLEF meeting presented a shared evaluation in 2016 to use machine learning to split these composite figures into components automatically. We adapted an existing high-performance object detection method to analyze the substructure of published biomedical figures by developing a novel multi-branch output convolution neural network to predict irregular panel layouts and provide augmented training data to drive learning. Our system has an accuracy of 86.8% on the 2016 ImageCLEF Medical dataset and 83.1% on a new dataset derived from open access papers from the INTACT database of molecular interactions.",

            "abstract": "The increasing richness and diversity of biomedical data types creates major organizational and analytical impediments to rapid translational impact in the context of training and education. As biomedical data-sets increase in size, variety and complexity, they challenge conventional methods for sharing, managing and analyzing those data. In May 2017, we convened a two-day meeting between the BD2K Training Coordinating Center (TCC), ELIXIR Training/TeSS, GOBLET, H3ABioNet, EMBL-ABR, bioCADDIE and the CSIRO, in Huntington Beach, California, to compare and contrast our respective activities, and how these might be leveraged for wider impact on an international scale. Discussions focused on the role of i) training for biomedical data science; ii) the need to promote core competencies, and the ii) development of career paths. These led to specific conversations about i) the values of standardizing and sharing data science training resources; ii) challenges in encouraging adoption of training material standards; iii) strategies and best practices for the personalization and customization of learning experiences; iv) processes of identifying stakeholders and determining how they should be accommodated; and v) discussions of joint partnerships to lead the world on data science training in ways that benefit all stakeholders. Generally, international cooperation was viewed as essential for accommodating the widest possible participation in the modern bioscience enterprise, providing skills in a truly \u201cFAIR\u201d manner, addressing the importance of data science understanding worldwide. Several recommendations for the exchange of educational frameworks are made, along with potential sources for support, and plans for further cooperative efforts are presented.",
