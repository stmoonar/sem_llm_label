            "abstract": "With advances in the field of Linked (Open) Data (LOD), language data on the LOD cloud has grown in number, size, and variety. With an increased volume and variety of language data, optimizations of methods for distributing, storing, and querying these data become more central. To this end, this position paper investigates use cases at the intersection of LLOD and Big Data, existing approaches to utilizing Big Data techniques within the context of linked data, and discusses the challenges and benefits of this union.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the relation between the meanings of words is an important part of comprehending natural language. Prior work has either focused on analysing lexical semantic relations in word embeddings or probing pretrained language models (PLMs), with some exceptions. Given the rarity of highly multilingual benchmarks, it is unclear to what extent PLMs capture relational knowledge and are able to transfer it across languages. To start addressing this question, we propose MultiLexBATS, a multilingual parallel dataset of lexical semantic relations adapted from BATS in 15 languages including low-resource languages, such as Bambara, Lithuanian, and Albanian. As experiment on cross-lingual transfer of relational knowledge, we test the PLMs\u2019 ability to (1) capture analogies across languages, and (2) predict translation targets. We find considerable differences across relation types and languages with a clear preference for hypernymy and antonymy as well as romance languages.",

            "abstract": "Using language models to detect or predict the presence of language phenomena in the text has become a mainstream research topic. With the rise of generative models, experiments using deep learning and transformer models trigger intense interest. Aspects like precision of predictions, portability to other languages or phenomena, scale have been central to the research community. Discourse markers, as language phenomena, perform important functions, such as signposting, signalling, and rephrasing, by facilitating discourse organization. Our paper is about discourse markers detection, a complex task as it pertains to a language phenomenon manifested by expressions that can occur as content words in some contexts and as discourse markers in others. We have adopted language agnostic model trained in English to predict the discourse marker presence in texts in 8 other unseen by the model languages with the goal to evaluate how well the model performs in different structure and lexical properties languages. We report on the process of evaluation and validation of the model\u2019s performance across European Portuguese, Hebrew, German, Polish, Romanian, Bulgarian, Mace-donian, and Lithuanian and about the results of this validation. This research is a key step towards multilingual language processing.",

            "abstract": "We present version 1.3 of the PARSEME multilingual corpus annotated with verbal multiword expressions. Since the previous version, new languages have joined the undertaking of creating such a resource, some of the already existing corpora have been enriched with new annotated texts, while others have been enhanced in various ways. The PARSEME multilingual corpus represents 26 languages now. All monolingual corpora therein use Universal Dependencies v.2 tagset. They are (re-)split observing the PARSEME v.1.2 standard, which puts impact on unseen VMWEs. With the current iteration, the corpus release process has been detached from shared tasks; instead, a process for continuous improvement and systematic releases has been introduced.",

As a theoretical basis, we discuss the multi-word word expressions as a part of the formulaic language used as discourse markers for organizing discourse. We also identify that parallel research in multiple languages may provide inter-lingual insights. We created a parallel multilingual corpus TED-ELH for our research and applied a parallel corpus alignment algorithm to extract multi-word discourse markers and their translations in Lithuanian and Hebrew. The analysis of the translations of multi-word discourse markers allowed us to identify that they demonstrate certain variability and either remain multi-word expressions or turn into one-word translations due to the linguistic characteristics of the target languages.",

            "abstract": "In this article, by the ability to translate Aramaic to another spoken languages, we investigated machine translation in a cultural heritage domain for two primary purposes: evaluating the quality of ancient translations and preserving Aramaic (an endangered language). First, we detailed the construction of a publicly available Biblical parallel Aramaic-Hebrew corpus based on two ancient (early 2nd to late 4th century) Hebrew-Aramaic translations: Targum Onkelus and Targum Jonathan. Then using the statistical machine translation approach, which in our use case significantly outperforms neural machine translation, we validated the excepted high quality of the translations. The trained model failed to translate Aramaic texts of other dialects. However, when we trained the same statistical machine translation model on another Aramaic-Hebrew corpus of a different dialect (Zohar, 13th century), a very high translation score was achieved. We examined an additional important cultural heritage source of Aramaic texts, the Babylonian Talmud (early 3rd to late 5th century). Since we do not have a parallel Aramaic-Hebrew corpus of the Talmud, we used the model trained on the Bible corpus for translation. We performed an analysis of the results and suggest some potential promising future research.",

We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

            "abstract": "Discourse markers carry information about the discourse structure and organization, and also signal local dependencies or epistemological stance of speaker. They provide instructions on how to interpret the discourse, and their study is paramount to understand the mechanism underlying discourse organization. This paper presents a new language resource, an ISO-based annotated multilingual parallel corpus for discourse markers. The corpus comprises nine languages, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, German, European Portuguese, Hebrew, Romanian, Polish, and Macedonian, with English as a pivot language. In order to represent the meaning of the discourse markers, we propose an annotation scheme of discourse relations from ISO 24617-8 with a plug-in to ISO 24617-2 for communicative functions. We describe an experiment in which we applied the annotation scheme to assess its validity. The results reveal that, although some extensions are required to cover all the multilingual data, it provides a proper representation of discourse markers value. Additionally, we report some relevant contrastive phenomena concerning discourse markers interpretation and role in discourse. This first step will allow us to develop deep learning methods to identify and extract discourse relations and communicative functions, and to represent that information as Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD).",
