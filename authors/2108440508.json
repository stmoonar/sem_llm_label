            "title": "Towards Multi-Subsession Conversational Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) could acquire dynamic user preferences towards desired items through multi-round interactive dialogue. Previous CRS mainly focuses on the single conversation (subsession) that user quits after a successful recommendation, neglecting the common scenario where user has multiple conversations (multi-subsession) over a short period. Therefore, we propose a novel conversational recommendation scenario named Multi-Subsession Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MSMCR), where user would still resort to CRS after several subsessions and might preserve vague interests, and system would proactively ask attributes to activate user interests in the current subsession. To fill the gap in this new CRS scenario, we devise a novel framework called Multi-Subsession Conversational Recommender with Activation Attributes (MSCAA). Specifically, we first develop a context-aware recommendation module, comprehensively modeling user interests from historical interactions, previous subsessions, and feedback in the current subsession. Furthermore, an attribute selection policy module is proposed to learn a flexible strategy for asking appropriate attributes to elicit user interests. Finally, we design a conversation policy module to manage the above two modules to decide actions between asking and recommending. Extensive experiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of our MSCAA framework for the MSMCR setting.",

            "title": "Multi-Interest Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation System with Fuzzy Feedback based User Simulator",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

            "abstract": "Today's digitalization has become a staple of life, and consumers' escalating digital lifestyles and demand for convenient services are directly driving the digital transformation of the automotive industry. The car will no longer be a single-function transport but will become an intelligent mobile terminal providing mobility services. The influx of digital services into the car will result in a dramatic transformation of the relationship between the driver and the car, where the car will act as an intelligent mobile terminal to transfer and communicate information with people or the surrounding environment, which will lead to an explosion of information in the car, and due to the limitations of human information processing capabilities, this may make the currently established design of human-computer interaction in the car no longer applicable. If we continue to view the human-vehicle relationship through the lens of a control-oriented machine interface, this will place strong constraints on the design of intelligent human-vehicle interaction. The core of the future intelligent vehicle HCI field is a richer and more diverse information interaction between vehicle, human, and environment, so changing the concept from HCI to human-vehicle information interaction may well support the development of future intelligent vehicle systems. In this article, the exploitation of a human-vehicle interaction assistance system for the handover of control of a vehicle under conditional automation is used as an example to discuss how human information interaction is applicable to the automotive domain.",

            "abstract": "Recently, news recommendation has attracted great attentions as it helps users quickly find news satisfying their preferences. It is important to note that both the interests of users and the news readers change over time. Although existing news recommendation methods have achieved promising performance, they treat the representation of news as static and ignore the dynamic nature of news, i.e. news attracts different users at different times and thus may have different features. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Attentive Convolution Neural Network (DACNN) to solve the above issues. Specifically, we extract features from the clicked history of news as dynamic representations of news and from the browsed history of users as dynamic representations of users. Moreover, we propose to employ a shared CNN with inner-attention to learn user-item interactions from the dynamic representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets and have proved the superiority of our model.",
