            "title": "A Bi-Objective Approach for Product Recommendations",
            "abstract": "We propose a bi-objective formulation for product recommendations. Our formulation goes beyond traditional recommendations by capturing two conflicting objectives: utility that serves customers\u2019 interests, and profit margin, a business-oriented goal. To satisfy the needs of our business partners, we formulate a new problem, namely generating a result containing all sets of k products such that there does not exist any other set of k products that dominates the returned sets, i.e., whose cumulative values for each objective is higher than a set of k products in the result. We study properties of k-Pareto sets that enable us to reduce the number of candidates, as well as the number of dominance tests between candidate sets. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that leverages those properties to prune the space of solutions. We generalize traditional measures of recommendation accuracy to be applicable to sets of k products. Our experiments on a large set of real customer transactions validate the need for a bi-objective optimization to reconcile customer and business interests, and the scalability of our solution.",
