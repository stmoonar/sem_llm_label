            "abstract": "Layout stitching is a repetitive and tedious task of the radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) design process. While academic research on layout splicing algorithms mainly focuses on analog and digital circuits, there is still a lack of well-developed algorithms for RFICs. An RFIC system usually has a symmetrical layout, such as transmitter and receiver components, low-noise amplifier (LNA), an SPDT switch, etc. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an automated procedure for the layout of RFICs by relying on the basic device/PCell structure based on the interconnection among circuit topologies. This approach makes the in-series generation of layouts and automatic splicing based on circuit logic possible, resulting in superior stitching performance compared with related modules in Advanced Design System. To demonstrate the physical application possibilities, we implemented our algorithm on an LNA and a switch circuit.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) displacement sensor based on the diagonal symmetry complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) structure is proposed. The one-dimensional (1D) displacement sensor is initially developed by etching a ring on the ground plane, and a triangle metal patch is used as the mover. When the mover is attached, a CSRR is formed, thereby inducing a resonant frequency. The displacement of the mover can be retrieved by the variation in the resonant frequency. Then, the structure is extended for designing a 2D displacement sensor. To further reduce the error caused by the lateral displacement, the shape of the sensor is further optimized using the particle swarm algorithm. Finally, the structure of the CSRR displacement sensor is simulated and analyzed, and a physical prototype is made. The measured results are consistent with the theoretical analysis, and its sensitivity is 160 MHz/mm.",

In this work, we introduce an acoustic imaging algorithm by only using the built-in sensors of a smartphone without any external equipment. First, the speaker of the smartphone is used to emit sound waves with a specific frequency band. During the movement of the smartphone, the accelerometer collects acceleration data to reconstruct the trajectories of the movements, while the microphones receive the reflected waves. A microphone plus an accelerometer are able to partially replace the functionality of a microphone array and to become a symmetry-imitation system. After scanning, a series of algorithms are implemented to generate a heat map, which outlines the target object. Our algorithm demonstrates the feasibility of smartphone-based acoustic imaging with minimal equipment complexity and no additional cost, which is beneficial to the promotion and popularization of acoustic imaging technology in daily applications.",

            "abstract": "Objective: Separation and detection of micro-particles or cells from bio-samples by point-of-care (POC) systems are critical for biomedical and healthcare diagnostic applications. Among various microfluidic separation techniques, acoustophoresis-based technique has the advantages of label-free and good biocompatibility. However, most of the existing separation techniques are bulky and require additional equipment for analysis. Methods: We proposed a platform, which integrates an acoustophoresis-based separation device and a lensless imaging sensor into a compact standalone system to tackle this challenge. Standing Surface Acoustic Wave (SSAW) is utilized for label-free particle separation, while lensless imaging is employed for seamless particle detection and counting using self-developed dual-threshold motion detection algorithms. In particular, we specially optimized the design of microfluidic channel and interdigital transducers (IDTs) for higher performance bioparticle separation, designed a heat dissipation system for the suppression of fluid temperature, and proposed a novel frequency-temperature-curve based method to determine the appropriate signal driving frequency for IDTs. Results: At 2 \u03bcL/min flow rate, separation efficiency of 93.52% and purity of 94.29% for 15 \u03bcm microbead were achieved in mixed 5\u03bcm and 15\u03bcm microbead solution at a 25 dBm RF driving power, and similar results for mixed 10 \u03bcm and 15 \u03bcm microbead solution. Conclusions: The results showed that the integrated platform has an excellent capability to seamlessly separate, distinguish, and count microbeads of different sizes. Significance: Such a platform and the design methodologies offer a promising POC solution for label-free cell separation and detection in biomedical diagnostics.",

            "abstract": "With the various applications of microfluidics, numerical simulation is highly recommended to verify its performance and reveal potential defects before fabrication. Among all the simulation parameters and simulation tools, the velocity field and concentration profile are the key parts and are generally simulated using finite element analysis (FEA). In our previous work [Wang et al., Lab Chip, 2016, 21, 4212-4219], automated design of microfluidic mixers by pre-generating a random library with the FEA was proposed. However, the duration of the simulation process is time-consuming, while the matching consistency between limited pre-generated designs and user desire is not stable. To address these issues, we inventively transformed the fluid mechanics problem into an image recognition problem and presented a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based technique to predict the fluid behavior of random microfluidic mixers. The pre-generated 10\u2009513 candidate designs in the random library were used in the training process of the CNN, and then 30\u2009757 brand new microfluidic mixer designs were randomly generated, whose performance was predicted by the CNN. Experimental results showed that the CNN method could complete all the predictions in just 10 seconds, which was around 51\u2009600\u00d7 faster than the previous FEA method. The CNN library was extended to contain 41\u2009270 candidate designs, which has filled up those empty spaces in the fluid velocity versus solute concentration map of the random library, and able to provide more choices and possibilities for user desire. Besides, the quantitative analysis has confirmed the increased compatibility of the CNN library with user desire. In summary, our CNN method not only presents a much faster way of generating a more complete library with candidate mixer designs but also provides a solution for predicting fluid behavior using a machine learning technique.",

            "abstract": "According to the complexity of human physiology and variability among individuals, e.g., genes, environment, lifestyle exposures, etc., personalized medicine aims to synthesize the specific efficacious drug for each individual patient. For synthesizing personalized medicine, customized solutions with specific concentrations are required. Equipped with the advantages in saving costly reagents and rare samples, microfluidic biochips are promising in generating different concentrations for personalized medicine. On the one hand, digital microfluidic biochips require the programming control for driving the movement of the droplets, which suffer from random errors caused by imbalanced droplet splitting. On the other hand, existing flow-based microfluidic biochips can only generate linear concentration gradients, which cause significant waste for synthesizing personalized medicine. To address the above issues, this article proposes the first artificial neural network (ANN)-based design method for flow-based microfluidic biochips, which accurately generates the customized concentration gradients. According to the required concentration, an initial chip is first selected from the prebuilt database and then fine-tuned by ANN to better match the required concentration. The computational simulation results show that the induced deviations in generated concentrations are generally less than 0.014, which validates the accuracy of the proposed neural network model.",

Two different fields\u2014communication engineering, and lab on a chip technology\u2014were analyzed as examples. We first built an article library by downloading all the articles from the target journal using a python-based crawler. Second, the rapid automatic keyword extraction algorithm was implemented on the title and abstract of each article. Finally, we classified all extracted keywords into class by calculating the Levenshtein distance between each of them. The results demonstrated its capability of not only finding out how communication engineering and lab on a chip were evolved in the past decades but also summarizing the analytical outcomes after data mining of the extracted keywords. Our algorithm is more than a useful tool for researchers during the preparation of a review article, it can also be applied to quantitatively analyze the past, present and help authors predict the future trend of a specific research field.",

            "title": "Universal Triboelectric Nanogenerator Simulation Based on Dynamic Finite Element Method Model",
            "abstract": "The lack of a universal simulation method for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) makes the device design and optimization difficult before experiment, which protracts the research and development process and hinders the landing of practical TENG applications. The existing electrostatic induction models for TENGs have limitations in simulating TENGs with complex geometries and their dynamic behaviors under practical movements due to the topology change issues. Here, a dynamic finite element method (FEM) model is proposed. The introduction of air buffer layers and the moving mesh method eliminates the topology change issues during practical movement and allows simulation of dynamic and time-varying behaviors of TENGs with complex 2D/3D geometries. Systematic investigations are carried out to optimize the air buffer thickness and mesh densities, and the optimized results show excellent consistency with the experimental data and results based on other existing methods. It also shows that a 3D disk-type rotating TENG can be simulated using the model, clearly demonstrating the capability and superiority of the dynamic FEM model. Moreover, the dynamic FEM model is used to optimize the shape of the tribo-material, which is used as a preliminary example to demonstrate the possibility of designing a TENG-based sensor.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the method of our submission to the ISBI 2019 Challenge for the task of classification of normal versus malignant cells in B-ALL white blood cancer microscopic images. We aimed to combine convolutional neural networks with several state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we fine-tuned pretrained deep learning networks including ResNet and DenseNet for this task. Overfitting is one of the major problems for this challenge. We solve overfitting by using the gradient norm clipping and the cosine annealing learning rate schedule with restarts, which have a significant impact on the performance of our deep neural network. More importantly, adaptive pooling layer is used in our models. With this modification, models are able to adapt to images of any size. An ensemble of deep models achieved a 0.8570 weighted-f1 score on the preliminary test set reported by the test server.",
