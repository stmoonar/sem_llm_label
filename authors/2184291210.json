            "title": "Towards Safe Autonomy in Hybrid Traffic: Detecting Unpredictable Abnormal Behaviors of Human Drivers via Information Sharing",
            "abstract": "Hybrid traffic which involves both autonomous and human-driven vehicles would be the norm of the autonomous vehicles\u2019 practice for a while. On the one hand, unlike autonomous vehicles, human-driven vehicles could exhibit sudden abnormal behaviors such as unpredictably switching to dangerous driving modes \u2013 putting its neighboring vehicles under risks; such undesired mode switching could arise from numbers of human driver factors, including fatigue, drunkenness, distraction, aggressiveness, etc. On the other hand, modern vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies enable the autonomous vehicles to efficiently and reliably share the scarce run-time information with each other [1]. In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first efficient algorithm that can (1) significantly improve trajectory prediction by effectively fusing the run-time information shared by surrounding autonomous vehicles, and can (2) accurately and quickly detect abnormal human driving mode switches or abnormal driving behavior with formal assurance without hurting human drivers\u2019 privacy. To validate our proposed algorithm, we first evaluate our proposed trajectory predictor on NGSIM and Argoverse datasets and show that our proposed predictor outperforms the baseline methods. Then through extensive experiments on SUMO simulator, we show that our proposed algorithm has great detection performance in both highway and urban traffic. The best performance achieves detection rate of \\(97.3\\% \\) , average detection delay of 1.2s, and 0 false alarm.",

            "abstract": "The recent advancements in wireless technology enable connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to gather data via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, such as processed LIDAR and camera data from other vehicles. In this work, we design an integrated information sharing and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for CAVs, to take advantage of the extra information when making decisions to improve traffic efficiency and safety. We first use weight pruned convolutional neural networks (CNN) to process the raw image and point cloud LIDAR data locally at each autonomous vehicle, and share CNN-output data with neighboring CAVs. We then design a safe actor-critic algorithm that utilizes both a vehicle's local observation and the information received via V2V communication to explore an efficient behavior planning policy with safety guarantees. Using the CARLA simulator for experiments, we show that our approach improves the CAV system's efficiency in terms of average velocity and comfort under different CAV ratios and different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the execution of unsafe actions and always maintains a safe distance from other vehicles. We construct an obstacle-at-corner scenario to show that the shared vision can help CAVs to observe obstacles earlier and take action to avoid traffic jams.",

            "abstract": "Reward design is a key component of deep reinforcement learning, yet some tasks and designer's objectives may be unnatural to define as a scalar cost function. Among the various techniques, formal methods integrated with DRL have garnered considerable attention due to their expressiveness and flexibility to define the reward and requirements for different states and actions of the agent. However, how to leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to guide multi-agent reinforcement learning reward design remains unexplored. Complex interactions, heterogeneous goals and critical safety requirements in multi-agent systems make this problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel STL-guided multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. The STL requirements are designed to include both task specifications according to the objective of each agent and safety specifications, and the robustness values of the STL specifications are leveraged to generate rewards. We validate the advantages of our method through empirical studies. The experimental results demonstrate significant reward performance improvements compared to MARL without STL guidance, along with a remarkable increase in the overall safety rate of the multi-agent systems.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning is the method of choice for trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, its data-hungry nature implicitly requires the availability of sufficiently rich and high-quality centralized datasets, which easily leads to privacy leakage. Besides, uncertainty-awareness becomes increasingly important for safety-crucial cyber physical systems whose prediction module heavily relies on machine learning tools. In this paper, we relax the data collection requirement and enhance uncertainty-awareness by using Federated Learning on Connected Autonomous Vehicles with an uncertainty-aware global objective. We name our algorithm as FLTP. We further introduce ALFLTP which boosts FLTP via using active learning techniques in adaptatively selecting participating clients. We consider two different metrics negative log-likelihood (NLL) and aleatoric uncertainty (AU) for client selection. Experiments on Argoverse dataset show that FLTP significantly outperforms the model trained on local data. In addition, ALFLTP-AU converges faster in training regression loss and performs better in terms of Miss Rate (MR) than FLTP in most rounds, and has more stable round-wise performance than ALFLTP-NLL.",

            "abstract": "Communication technologies enable coordination among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, it remains unclear how to utilize shared information to improve the safety and efficiency of the CAV system in dynamic and complicated driving scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework of constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a parallel Safety Shield for CAVs in challenging driving scenarios that includes unconnected hazard vehicles. The coordination mechanisms of the proposed MARL include information sharing and cooperative policy learning, with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-Transformer as a spatial-temporal encoder that enhances the agent's environment awareness. The Safety Shield module with Control Barrier Functions (CBF)-based safety checking protects the agents from taking unsafe actions. We design a constrained multi-agent advantage actor-critic (CMAA2C) algorithm to train safe and cooperative policies for CAVs. With the experiment deployed in the CARLA simulator, we verify the performance of the safety checking, spatial-temporal encoder, and coordination mechanisms designed in our method by comparative experiments in several challenging scenarios with unconnected hazard vehicles. Results show that our proposed methodology significantly increases system safety and efficiency in challenging scenarios.",
