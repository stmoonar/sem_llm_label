They are nice portable devices used for communicating but with advancement in phone technology things have taken a turn since we first used a Nokia back in 2001. People communicate and share content with each other via phones .now where does this content go ? right, in our phone's memory but what happens when you run out of space ? right, you use an external memory facility but what's next when the card is full and you don't have the luxury of a laptop around you and you just can't delete all the data you have in the name of memories . I am so glad to tell you that we have a solution .you don't need to worry about the space that is taken by your media. We intend to link this data sends to the cloud .",

            "abstract": "High-throughput small RNA (sRNA) sequencing technology enables an entirely new perspective for plant microRNA (miRNA) research and has immense potential to unravel regulatory networks. Novel insights gained through data mining in publically available rich resource of sRNA data will help in designing biotechnology-based approaches for crop improvement to enhance plant yield and nutritional value. Bioinformatics resources enabling meta-analysis of miRNA expression across multiple plant species are still evolving. Here, we report PmiRExAt, a new online database resource that caters plant miRNA expression atlas. The web-based repository comprises of miRNA expression profile and query tool for 1859 wheat, 2330 rice and 283 maize miRNA. The database interface offers open and easy access to miRNA expression profile and helps in identifying tissue preferential, differential and constitutively expressing miRNAs. A feature enabling expression study of conserved miRNA across multiple species is also implemented. Custom expression analysis feature enables expression analysis of novel miRNA in total 117 datasets. New sRNA dataset can also be uploaded for analysing miRNA expression profiles for 73 plant species. PmiRExAt application program interface, a simple object access protocol web service allows other programmers to remotely invoke the methods written for doing programmatic search operations on PmiRExAt database.
