            "title": "USNAP: fast unique dense region detection and its application to lung cancer",
            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Many real-world problems can be modeled as annotated graphs. Scalable graph algorithms that extract actionable information from such data are in demand since these graphs are large, varying in topology, and have diverse node/edge annotations. When these graphs change over time they create dynamic graphs, and open the possibility to find patterns across different time points. In this article, we introduce a scalable algorithm that finds unique dense regions across time points in dynamic graphs. Such algorithms have applications in many different areas, including the biological, financial, and social domains. Results There are three important contributions to this manuscript. First, we designed a scalable algorithm, USNAP, to effectively identify dense subgraphs that are unique to a time stamp given a dynamic graph. Importantly, USNAP provides a lower bound of the density measure in each step of the greedy algorithm. Second, insights and understanding obtained from validating USNAP on real data show its effectiveness. While USNAP is domain independent, we applied it to four non-small cell lung cancer gene expression datasets. Stages in non-small cell lung cancer were modeled as dynamic graphs, and input to USNAP. Pathway enrichment analyses and comprehensive interpretations from literature show that USNAP identified biologically relevant mechanisms for different stages of cancer progression. Third, USNAP is scalable, and has a time complexity of O(m+mc\u2009log\u2009nc+nc\u2009log\u2009nc), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in the dynamic graph; mc is the number of edges, and nc is the number of vertices in the collapsed graph. Availability and implementation The code of USNAP is available at https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/\u223cjuris/data/USNAP22.",

            "abstract": "Abstract MirDIP is a well-established database that aggregates microRNA-gene human interactions from multiple databases to increase coverage, reduce bias, and improve usability by providing an integrated score proportional to the probability of the interaction occurring. In version 5.2, we removed eight outdated resources, added a new resource (miRNATIP), and ran five prediction algorithms for miRBase and mirGeneDB. In total, mirDIP 5.2 includes 46 364 047 predictions for 27 936 genes and 2734 microRNAs, making it the first database to provide interactions using data from mirGeneDB. Moreover, we curated and integrated 32 497 novel microRNAs from 14 publications to accelerate the use of these novel data. In this release, we also extend the content and functionality of mirDIP by associating contexts with microRNAs, genes, and microRNA\u2013gene interactions. We collected and processed microRNA and gene expression data from 20 resources and acquired information on 330 tissue and disease contexts for 2657 microRNAs, 27 576 genes and 123 651 910 gene\u2013microRNA\u2013tissue interactions. Finally, we improved the usability of mirDIP by enabling the user to search the database using precursor IDs, and we integrated miRAnno, a network-based tool for identifying pathways linked to specific microRNAs. We also provide a mirDIP API to facilitate access to its integrated predictions. Updated mirDIP is available at https://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP.",

            "title": "IID 2021: towards context-specific protein interaction analyses by increased coverage, enhanced annotation and enrichment analysis",
            "abstract": "Abstract Improved bioassays have significantly increased the rate of identifying new protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and the number of detected human PPIs has greatly exceeded early estimates of human interactome size. These new PPIs provide a more complete view of disease mechanisms but precise understanding of how PPIs affect phenotype remains a challenge. It requires knowledge of PPI context (e.g. tissues, subcellular localizations), and functional roles, especially within pathways and protein complexes. The previous IID release focused on PPI context, providing networks with comprehensive tissue, disease, cellular localization, and druggability annotations. The current update adds developmental stages to the available contexts, and provides a way of assigning context to PPIs that could not be previously annotated due to insufficient data or incompatibility with available context categories (e.g. interactions between membrane and cytoplasmic proteins). This update also annotates PPIs with conservation across species, directionality in pathways, membership in large complexes, interaction stability (i.e. stable or transient), and mutation effects. Enrichment analysis is now available for all annotations, and includes multiple options; for example, context annotations can be analyzed with respect to PPIs or network proteins. In addition to tabular view or download, IID provides online network visualization. This update is available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/iid.",

Many existing formats support automatic software analysis of biological pathways, for examples BioPAX (Biological Pathway Exchange). Although some algorithms are available as web application or standalone tools, no general graphical application for the parsing of BioPAX pathway data exists. Also, very few tools can perform Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA) using pathway encoded in the BioPAX format. To fill this gap we introduce BiP, an automatic and graphical software tool aimed at performing the parsing and accessing of BioPAX pathway data, along with pathway enrichment analysis by using information coming from pathways encoded in BioPAX.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nBiP is freely available for academic and non-profit organizations at https://gitlab.com/giuseppeagapito/bip under the LGPL 2.1, the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Gene sets over-representation analysis (GSOA) is a common technique of enrichment analysis that measures the overlap between a gene set and selected instances (e.g. pathways). Despite its popularity, there is currently no established standard for visualization of GSOA results. Results Here, we propose a visual exploration of the GSOA results by showing the relationships among the enriched instances, while highlighting important instance attributes, such as significance, closeness (centrality) and clustering. Availability and implementation GSOAP is implemented as an R package and is available at https://github.com/tomastokar/gsoap.",

            "abstract": "Abstract PathDIP was introduced to increase proteome coverage of literature-curated human pathway databases. PathDIP 4 now integrates 24 major databases. To further reduce the number of proteins with no curated pathway annotation, pathDIP integrates pathways with physical protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) to predict significant physical associations between proteins and curated pathways. For human, it provides pathway annotations for 5366 pathway orphans. Integrated pathway annotation now includes six model organisms and ten domesticated animals. A total of 6401 core and ortholog pathways have been curated from the literature or by annotating orthologs of human proteins in the literature-curated pathways. Extended pathways are the result of combining these pathways with protein-pathway associations that are predicted using organism-specific PPIs. Extended pathways expand proteome coverage from 81 088 to 120 621 proteins, making pathDIP 4 the largest publicly available pathway database for these organisms and providing a necessary platform for comprehensive pathway-enrichment analysis. PathDIP 4 users can customize their search and analysis by selecting organism, identifier and subset of pathways. Enrichment results and detailed annotations for input list can be obtained in different formats and views. To support automated bioinformatics workflows, Java, R and Python APIs are available for batch pathway annotation and enrichment analysis. PathDIP 4 is publicly available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/pathDIP.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Knowing the set of physical protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) that occur in a particular context\u2014a tissue, disease, or other condition\u2014can provide valuable insights into key research questions. However, while the number of identified human PPIs is expanding rapidly, context information remains limited, and for most non-human species context-specific networks are completely unavailable. The Integrated Interactions Database (IID) provides one of the most comprehensive sets of context-specific human PPI networks, including networks for 133 tissues, 91 disease conditions, and many other contexts. Importantly, it also provides context-specific networks for 17 non-human species including model organisms and domesticated animals. These species are vitally important for drug discovery and agriculture. IID integrates interactions from multiple databases and datasets. It comprises over 4.8 million PPIs annotated with several types of context: tissues, subcellular localizations, diseases, and druggability information (the latter three are new annotations not available in the previous version). This update increases the number of species from 6 to 18, the number of PPIs from \u223c1.5 million to \u223c4.8 million, and the number of tissues from 30 to 133. IID also now supports topology and enrichment analyses of returned networks. IID is available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/iid.",

            "abstract": "Given a large, dynamic graph, how can we trace the activities of groups of vertices over time? Given a dynamic biological graph modeling a given disease progression, which genes interact closely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions are being disrupted in the latter stage of the disease? Which genes interact sparsely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions increase as the disease progresses? Knowing the answers to these questions is important as they give insights to the underlying molecular mechanism to disease progression, and potential treatments that target these mechanisms can be developed. There are three main contributions to this paper. First, we designed a novel algorithm, SDREGION, that identifies subgraphs that decrease or increase in density monotonically over time, referred to as d-regions or i-regions, respectively. We introduced the objective function, -density, for identifying d-(i-)regions. Second, SDREGION is a generic algorithm, applicable across several real datasets. In this manuscript, we showed its effectiveness, and made observations in the modeling of the progression of lung cancer. In particular, we observed that SDREGION identified d-(i-)regions that capture mechanisms that align with literature. Importantly, findings that were identified but were not retrospectively validated by literature may provide novel mechanisms in tumor progression that will guide future biological experiments. Third, SDREGION is scalable with a time complexity of O(mlogn + nlogn) where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in a given dynamic graph.",
