            "abstract": "Decision-making through artificial neural networks with minimal latency is critical for numerous applications such as navigation, tracking, and real-time machine action systems. This requires machine learning hardware to process multidimensional data at high throughput. Unfortunately, handling convolution operations, the primary computational tool for data classification tasks, obeys challenging runtime complexity scaling laws. However, homomorphically implementing the convolution theorem in a Fourier optics display light processor can achieve a non-iterative O(1) runtime complexity for data inputs beyond 1,000 \u00d7 1,000 large matrices. Following this approach, here we demonstrate data streaming multi-kernel image batching using a Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) accelerator. We show image batch processing of large-scale matrices as 2 million dot product multiplications performed by a digital light processing module in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, we further parallelize this optical FCNN system by exploiting multiple spatially parallel diffraction orders, achieving a 98x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art FCNN accelerators. A comprehensive discussion of the practical challenges associated with working at the edge of system capabilities highlights the problem of crosstalk and resolution scaling laws in the Fourier domain. Accelerating convolution by exploiting massive parallelism in display technology brings non-Van Neumann-based machine learning acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Innovative processor architectures aim to play a critical role in future sustainment of performance improvements under severe limitations imposed by the end of Moore\u2019s Law. The Reconfigurable Optical Computer (ROC) is one such innovative, Post-Moore\u2019s Law processor. ROC is designed to solve partial differential equations in one shot as opposed to existing solutions, which are based on costly iterative computations. This is achieved by leveraging physical properties of a mesh of optical components that behave analogously to lumped electrical components. However, virtualization is required to combat shortfalls of the accelerator hardware. Namely, (1) the infeasibility of building large photonic arrays to accommodate arbitrarily large problems and (2) underutilization brought about by mismatches in problem and accelerator mesh sizes due to future advances in manufacturing technology. In this work, we introduce an architecture and methodology for lightweight virtualization of ROC that exploits advantages borne from optical computing technology. Specifically, we apply temporal and spatial virtualization to ROC and then extend the accelerator scheduling tradespace with the introduction of spectral virtualization. Additionally, we investigate multiple resource scheduling strategies for a system-on-chip (SoC)-based PDE acceleration architecture and show that virtual configuration management offers a speedup of approximately 2\u00d7. Finally, we show that overhead from virtualization is minimal, and our experimental results show two orders of magnitude increased speed as compared to microprocessor execution while keeping errors due to virtualization under 10%.",

With convolution operations being computationally intensive, next\u2010generation hardware accelerators need to offer parallelization and high efficiency.

Here, a parallelized operation high\u2010throughput Fourier optic convolutional accelerator is demonstrated.

            "abstract": "\n Deeplearning algorithms are revolutionising many aspects of modern life. Typically, they are implemented in CMOS-based hardware with severely limited memory access times and inefficient data-routing. All-optical neural networks without any electro-optic conversions could alleviate these shortcomings. However, an all-optical nonlinear activation function, which is a vital building block for optical neural networks, needs to be developed efficiently on-chip. Here, we introduce and demonstrate both optical synapse weighting and all-optical nonlinear thresholding using two different effects in one single chalcogenide material. We show how the structural phase transitions in a wide-bandgap phase-change material enables storing the neural network weights via non-volatile photonic memory, whilst resonant bond destabilisation is used as a nonlinear activation threshold without changing the material. These two different transitions within chalcogenides enable programmable neural networks with near-zero static power consumption once trained, in addition to picosecond delays performing inference tasks not limited by wire charging that limit electrical circuits; for instance, we show that nanosecond-order weight programming and near-instantaneous weight updates enable accurate inference tasks within 20 picoseconds in a 3-layer all-optical neural network. Optical neural networks that bypass electro-optic conversion altogether hold promise for network-edge machine learning applications where decision-making in real-time are critical, such as for autonomous vehicles or navigation systems such as signal pre-processing of LIDAR systems.",

            "abstract": "With an ongoing trend in computing hardware towards increased heterogeneity, domain-specific co-processors are emerging as alternatives to centralized paradigms. The tensor core unit (TPU) has shown to outperform graphic process units by almost 3-orders of magnitude enabled by higher signal throughout and energy efficiency. In this context, photons bear a number of synergistic physical properties while phase-change materials allow for local nonvolatile mnemonic functionality in these emerging distributed non van-Neumann architectures. While several photonic neural network designs have been explored, a photonic TPU to perform matrix vector multiplication and summation is yet outstanding. Here we introduced an integrated photonics-based TPU by strategically utilizing a) photonic parallelism via wavelength division multiplexing, b) high 2 Peta-operations-per second throughputs enabled by 10s of picosecond-short delays from optoelectronics and compact photonic integrated circuitry, and c) zero power-consuming novel photonic multi-state memories based on phase-change materials featuring vanishing losses in the amorphous state. Combining these physical synergies of material, function, and system, we show that the performance of this 8-bit photonic TPU can be 2-3 orders higher compared to an electrical TPU whilst featuring similar chip areas. This work shows that photonic specialized processors have the potential to augment electronic systems and may perform exceptionally well in network-edge devices in the looming 5G networks and beyond.",

            "abstract": "Innovative processor architectures play a critical role in sustaining performance improvements under severe limitations imposed by feature size and energy consumption. The Reconfigurable Optical Computer (ROC) is one such innovative, Post-Moore\u2019s Law processor. ROC is designed to solve partial differential equations in one shot as opposed to existing solutions, which are based on costly iterative computations. This is achieved by leveraging physical properties of a mesh of optical components that behave similarly to electrical resistances. However, building large photonic arrays to accommodate arbitrarily large problems is not yet feasible. It is also possible to have problems that are smaller than the size of the accelerator array. In both cases, virtualization is necessary. In this work, we introduce an architecture and methodology for light-weight virtualization of ROC. We show that overhead from virtualization is minimal, and our experimental results show two orders of magnitude increased speed as compared to microprocessor execution while keeping errors due to virtualization under 10%.",
