            "abstract": "Web authors frequently embed social media to support and enrich their content, creating the potential to derive web-based, cross-platform social media representations that can enable more effective social media retrieval systems and richer scientific analyses. As step toward such capabilities, we introduce a novel language modeling framework that enables automatic annotation of roles that social media entities play in their embedded web context. Using related communication theory, we liken social media embeddings to quotes, formalize the page context as structured natural language signals, and identify a taxonomy of roles for quotes within the page context. We release SocialQuotes, a new data set built from the Common Crawl of over 32 million social quotes, 8.3k of them with crowdsourced quote annotations. Using SocialQuotes and the accompanying annotations, we provide a role classification case study, showing reasonable performance with modern-day LLMs, and exposing explainable aspects of our framework via page content ablations. We also classify a large batch of un-annotated quotes, revealing interesting cross-domain, cross-platform role distributions on the web.",

            "title": "Towards Realistic Synthetic User-Generated Content: A Scaffolding Approach to Generating Online Discussions",
            "abstract": "The emergence of synthetic data represents a pivotal shift in modern machine learning, offering a solution to satisfy the need for large volumes of data in domains where real data is scarce, highly private, or difficult to obtain. We investigate the feasibility of creating realistic, large-scale synthetic datasets of user-generated content, noting that such content is increasingly prevalent and a source of frequently sought information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a starting point for generating synthetic social media discussion threads, due to their ability to produce diverse responses that typify online interactions. However, as we demonstrate, straightforward application of LLMs yields limited success in capturing the complex structure of online discussions, and standard prompting mechanisms lack sufficient control. We therefore propose a multi-step generation process, predicated on the idea of creating compact representations of discussion threads, referred to as scaffolds. Our framework is generic yet adaptable to the unique characteristics of specific social media platforms. We demonstrate its feasibility using data from two distinct online discussion platforms. To address the fundamental challenge of ensuring the representativeness and realism of synthetic data, we propose a portfolio of evaluation measures to compare various instantiations of our framework.",

            "title": "Generating Usage-related Questions for Preference Elicitation in Conversational Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. Users searching for recommendations may not have deep knowledge of the available options in a given domain. As such, they might not be aware of key attributes or desirable values for them. However, in many settings, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing, to create a high-quality labeled training dataset. Another main contribution is the development of four models for the question generation task: two template-based baseline models and two neural text-to-text models. The template-based models use heuristically extracted common patterns found in the training data, while the neural models use the training data to learn to generate questions automatically. Using common metrics from machine translation for automatic evaluation, we show that our approaches are effective in generating elicitation questions, even with limited training data. We further employ human evaluation for comparing the generated questions using both pointwise and pairwise evaluation designs. We find that the human evaluation results are consistent with the automatic ones, allowing us to draw conclusions about the quality of the generated questions with certainty. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of cases where the models show their limitations.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) enable users to use natural language feedback to control their recommendations, overcoming many of the challenges of traditional recommendation systems. However, the practical adoption of CRSs remains limited due to a lack of rich and diverse conversational training data that pairs user utterances with recommendations. To address this problem, we introduce a new method to generate synthetic training data by transforming curated item collections, such as playlists or movie watch lists, into item-seeking conversations. First, we use a biased random walk to generate a sequence of slates, or sets of item recommendations; then, we use a language model to generate corresponding user utterances. We demonstrate our approach by generating a conversational music recommendation dataset with over one million conversations, which were found to be consistent with relevant recommendations by a crowdsourced evaluation. Using the synthetic data to train a CRS, we significantly outperform standard retrieval baselines in offline and online evaluations.",

This has motivated conversational recommender systems (CRSs), with control provided through natural language feedback. However, as with most application domains, building robust CRSs requires training data that reflects system usage$\\unicode{x2014}$here conversations with user utterances paired with items that cover a wide range of preferences. This has proved challenging to collect scalably using conventional methods. We address the question of whether it can be generated synthetically, building on recent advances in natural language. We evaluate in the setting of item set recommendation, noting the increasing attention to this task motivated by use cases like music, news, and recipe recommendation. We present TalkTheWalk, which synthesizes realistic high-quality conversational data by leveraging domain expertise encoded in widely available curated item collections, generating a sequence of hypothetical yet plausible item sets, then using a language model to produce corresponding user utterances. We generate over one million diverse playlist curation conversations in the music domain, and show these contain consistent utterances with relevant item sets nearly matching the quality of an existing but small human-collected dataset for this task. We demonstrate the utility of the generated synthetic dataset on a conversational item retrieval task and show that it improves over both unsupervised baselines and systems trained on a real dataset.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in commercial conversational services that allow naturally spoken and typed interaction, particularly for well-formulated questions and commands, have increased the need for more human-centric interactions in information retrieval. The First International Workshop on Conversational Approaches to Information Retrieval (CAIR`17) brings together academic and industrial researchers to create a forum for research on conversational approaches to search. A specific focus is on techniques that support complex and multi-turn user-machine dialogues for information access and retrieval, and multi-model interfaces for interacting with such systems. We invite submissions addressing all modalities of conversation, including speech-based, text-based, and multimodal interaction. We also welcome studies of human-human interaction (e.g., collaborative search) that can inform the design of conversational search applications, and work on evaluation of conversational approaches.",
