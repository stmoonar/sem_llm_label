            "abstract": "Sports analytics has grown significantly through continuous data streams from wearable tracking devices. This article explores the performance of traditional Machine Learning methods (ML) compared to Streaming Machine Learning approaches (SML) in the context of sports analytics, specifically in identifying passes during a soccer match. The study utilizes leg movement data from wearable sensors on players\u2019 shoes to differentiate between pass and nonpass actions. Balanced, imbalanced and rebalanced datasets are created and analyzed. Several traditional and streaming algorithms are tested, and statistical analyses are performed to assess their performance. The findings indicate that Streaming Machine Learning can achieve comparable or better performance than traditional methods, especially on larger rebalanced datasets. This research highlights the potential of Streaming Machine Learning for online sports analytics and suggests future directions for exploring player tendencies and edge device adaptability.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, data coming from electronic devices surround us. Analyzing them all in real-time, also considering the class imbalance and concept drift challenges is a big challenge and the starting point to understand where to innovate. This paper proposes IEBench, an easy-to-use benchmarking environment for comparing streaming learners. We implemented various state-of-art algorithms, and we conducted a comprehensive experimental campaign with IEBench. We evaluated the algorithms on artificial and real data streams with different imbalance levels and concept drift types. We collected empirical evidence of the role and impact of existing methods for rebalancing data streams in improving performance during different types of concept drift. IEBench eases the practitioners\u2019 task of testing existing algorithms on a new data stream and the scientists\u2019 one of developing new algorithms and systematically comparing them with the state-of-the-art.",

            "title": "Kalman Filtering for Learning with Evolving Data Streams",
            "abstract": "Processing data streams gained much importance in recent years. Standard machine learning algorithms do not cope well with non-stationary streaming data, where decision models evolve and generate so-called concept drift. Online adaptive algorithms emerged to solve these issues. They learn incrementally and generally require explicit forgetting mechanisms to adapt to concept drift. In this paper, we propose the application of Kalman filtering to handle evolving data streams. This novel approach addresses data stream mining and concept drift management challenges from a new perspective, directly modelling a representation suitable for the data streams. First, we study a Kalman filter based learning a pproach and investigate its integration into the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm, namely KalmanNB. Additionally, we propose the Hoeffding Kalman Tree, a combination of the Hoeffding Tree with KalmanNB. Empirical results demonstrate that the Kalman filter based approach inherently manages concept drifts, and it adapts to the emerging concept more rapidly than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, it is an accurate and robust approach and requires less storage while still being faster.",

            "abstract": "In recent years an increasing number of applications, IoT sensors and websites have produced endless streams of data. These data streams are not only unbounded, but their characteristics dynamically change over time, generating a phenomenon called concept drift. The standard machine learning models do not work properly in this context and new techniques have been developed in order to tackle these challenges. In this paper we present a new Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm that exploits Kalman Filter, namely KalmanNB, to manage automatically concept drift. Furthermore, we want to investigate when this new approach, which directly follows the values of data's attributes, is better than the standard strategy, which monitors the performance of the model in order to detect a drift. Extensive experiments on both artificial and real datasets with concept drifts reveal that KalmanNB is a valid alternative to the state-of-the-art algorithms, outperforming the latter especially in case of recurring concept drifts.",
