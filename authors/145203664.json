            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

In this paper, we discuss the advantages of Serverless workflow and how they can be used and monitored to natively trigger complex algorithm pipelines in the continuum, dynamically placing and relocating them taking into account incoming IoT data, QoS constraints, and the current status of the continuum infrastructure. Therefore we presented the Urgent Function Enabler (UFE) platform, a fully distributed architecture able to define, spread, and manage FaaS functions, using local IOT data managed using the Fiware ecosystem and a computing infrastructure composed of mobile and stable nodes.",

However, as the variety of data sources, and the volume and velocity of data grow, processing this data while considering the uncertainty of infrastructure and timeliness constraints of urgent application workflows can be nontrivial and presents a new set of challenges. In this paper, we use an application workflow that monitors and manage the air quality impacts of remote wildfires to illustrate how the R-Pulsar programming system, leveraging the SAGE and WIFIRE platforms, can enable urgent analytics across the computing continuum. R-Pulsar supports urgent data-processing pipelines that tradeoff the content of data, cost of computation, and urgency of the results to support such workflows. We also discuss research challenges associated with programming urgent application workflows and managing resources in an autonomic manner.",

            "abstract": "The landscape for cloud services and cyberinfrastructure offerings has increased drastically over the past few years. Initially, users moved their applications to the cloud to take advantage of a pay-per-usage model and on-demand access. However, as more cloud providers joined the market, users shifted their goals for using cloud computing from cost reduction to resilience, agility, and optimization. These goals can be achieved by dynamically combining services from multiple providers, for example, to avoid data center or cloud zone outages or to take advantage of extensive offerings with different price points. However, to efficiently support application deployment in this dynamic environment, new models and tools that can measure the application performance and the Quality of Service (QoS) of different configurations are required. The goal of this work is to evaluate the application performance and the QoS of a distributed Software-Defined Environment as well as calculate the QoS of alternative configurations from the underlying pool of services. In particular, we present a mathematical model and a tool for evaluating the performance and QoS of batch application workflows in a distributed environment. We experimentally evaluate the proposed model using a bioinformatics workflow running on infrastructure services from multiple cloud providers.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous computing is becoming common in the HPC world. The fast-changing hardware landscape is pushing programmers and developers to rely on performance-portable programming models to rewrite old and legacy applications and develop new ones. While this approach is suitable for individual applications, outstanding challenges still remain when multiple applications are combined into complex workflows. One critical difficulty is the exchange of data between communicating applications where performance constraints imposed by heterogeneous hardware advantage different data layouts. We attempt to solve this problem by exploring asynchronous data layout conversions for applications requiring different memory access patterns for shared data. We implement the proposed solution within the DataSpaces data staging service, extending it to support heterogeneous application workflows across a broad spectrum of programming models. In addition, we integrate heterogeneous DataSpaces with the Kokkos programming model and propose the Kokkos Staging Space as an extension of the Kokkos data abstraction. This new abstraction enables us to express data on a virtual shared space for multiple Kokkos applications, thus guaranteeing the portability of each application when assembling them into an efficient heterogeneous workflow. We present performance results for the Kokkos Staging Space using a synthetic workflow emulator and three different scenarios representing access frequency and use patterns in shared data. The results show that the Kokkos Staging Space is a superior solution in terms of time-to-solution and scalability compared to existing file-based Kokkos data abstractions for inter-application data exchange.",

Specifically, for a few years, the TPDS Reproducibility Initiative2,3 has been exploring postpublication peer review of the code associated with published articles. Authors who have published in TPDS can make their published work more reproducible and earn a reproducibility badge by submitting their associated code for postpublication peer review. To date, this pilot has largely focused on two badges, Code Available and Code Reviewed, and has successfully badged more than a dozen articles. Ensuring reproducibility has also taken on additional complexity due to the increasingly central roles played by computation and data.4 While TPDS\u2019s goal has always been to include badges for reproducing research results using the code and/or data provided, the nature of research in the parallel and distributed systems covered by TPDS makes it challenging to evaluate the code and data for reproducibility. This is because such an evaluation may require access to specific hardware, system architectures and scales, operating system configurations, and so Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MC.2022.3158156 Date of current version: 6 May 2022 Advancing Reproducibility in Parallel and Distributed Systems Research",

            "abstract": "Extreme scale computing and data have become essential to computational and data-enabled science and engineering, promising dramatic new insights into natural and engineered systems. However, data-management challenges continue to limit the potential impact of extreme-scale application workflows. Data-intensive application workflows targeting extreme scale, high-performance, distributed computing environments can involve dynamic coordination, interactions and data coupling between multiple application processes that run at scale on different resources, and with services for monitoring, analysis and visualization and archiving, and present challenges due to increasing data volumes and complex data-coupling patterns, system energy constraints, increasing failure rates, etc. In this talk I will present my translational computer science (TCS) research experiences in addressing these challenges. TCS research bridges foundational/use-inspired research with the delivery and deployment of outcomes to the target community and supports the essential bi-direction interplays. Specifically, I will explore data sharing abstractions, managed data pipelines, data-staging services, and in-situ/in-transit data placement and processing to support extreme scale in-situ workflows.",
