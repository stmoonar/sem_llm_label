            "abstract": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have very recently been introduced into the world of machine learning, quickly capturing the attention of the entire community. However, KANs have mostly been tested for approximating complex functions or processing synthetic data, while a test on real-world tabular datasets is currently lacking. In this paper, we present a benchmarking study comparing KANs and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) on tabular datasets. The study evaluates task performance and training times. From the results obtained on the various datasets, KANs demonstrate superior or comparable accuracy and F1 scores, excelling particularly in datasets with numerous instances, suggesting robust handling of complex data. We also highlight that this performance improvement of KANs comes with a higher computational cost when compared to MLPs of comparable sizes.",

            "abstract": "Natural Language Understanding and Generation models suffer from a limited capability of understanding the nuances of inclusive communication as they are trained on massive data, often including significant portions of non-inclusive content. Even when the models are specifically designed to address non-inclusive language detection or reformulation, they disregard, to a large extent, inclusiveness-related features that are likely correlated with the inclusive language nuances, such as the discourse type, level of inclusiveness, and intended context of use. To assess the importance of additional inclusiveness-related features, we collect a new corpus of Italian administrative documents humanly annotated by linguistic experts. Linguistic experts not only highlight non-inclusive text snippets and propose possible reformulations, but also annotate multi-aspect labels related to different inclusive language nuances. We empirically show that a multi-task learning approach that leverages the multi-aspect annotations can improve the non-inclusive text reformulation performance, thereby confirming the potential of expert-annotated data in inclusive language processing.",

            "abstract": "Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism as their lack of interpretability limits their controllability and reliability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insight into the model's decision-making processes. In the image field, Concept-based models have emerged as explainable-by-design architectures, employing human-interpretable features as intermediate representations. However, these methods have not been yet adapted to textual data, mainly because they require expensive concept annotations, which are impractical for real-world text data. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a self-supervised Interpretable Concept Embedding Models (ICEMs). We leverage the generalization abilities of LLMs to predict the concepts labels in a self-supervised way, while we deliver the final predictions with an interpretable function. The results of our experiments show that ICEMs can be trained in a self-supervised way achieving similar performance to fully supervised concept-based models and end-to-end black-box ones. Additionally, we show that our models are (i) interpretable, offering meaningful logical explanations for their predictions; (ii) interactable, allowing humans to modify intermediate predictions through concept interventions; and (iii) controllable, guiding the LLMs' decoding process to follow a required decision-making path.",

            "abstract": "Segmentation of crop fields is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity, monitoring crop health, and promoting sustainable practices. Deep learning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable predictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the performance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks. Our findings indicate a 2\\% improvement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model in fewer GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels are irrelevant to this task.",

Further, we consider many recording types at the same time, such as sentence reading and sustained vowel emission, by employing a Mixture of Expert ensemble to align the predictions on different data types.

To address this issue, a wide range of papers proposing Concept-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (C-XAI) methods have arisen in recent years. Nevertheless, a unified categorization and precise field definition are still missing. This paper fills the gap by offering a thorough review of C-XAI approaches. We define and identify different concepts and explanation types. We provide a taxonomy identifying nine categories and propose guidelines for selecting a suitable category based on the development context. Additionally, we report common evaluation strategies including metrics, human evaluations and dataset employed, aiming to assist the development of future methods.

As a result, traditional theory-based methods are often being replaced by data-driven approaches, thanks to the greater availability of battery data and advances in artificial intelligence. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular, are promising methods to be exploited, because they can capture temporal dependencies and predict SOC without a battery model.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing charging sessions data together with external data ( weather and population information and energy/fuel prices ) collected from different sources. The proposed methodology, named GEORGE (enerGy dEmand fOrecasting foR charGing infrastructurE), offers a building-blocks based approach for the monthly energy demand forecasting. The approach is both generalisable and data-specific. We discuss the results of a classification learning approach to predict a belonging range of kwh for a charge point. In particular the most promising model has good performances in predicting high utilization and is more advantageous to support the company\u2019s decision-making process. Many possible developments are discussed to improve the prediction.",

            "title": "Exploring waste-collection fleet data: challenges in a real-world use case",
            "abstract": "In the age of connected vehicles, large amounts of data can be collected while driving through a variety of on-board sensors. The information collected can be used for various types of data-driven analytics that can be of great benefit to both vehicle owners, e.g., to reduce costs by means of predictive maintenance, and to society as a whole, e.g., to optimize mobility behavior. Prior to any real-world data analysis, an investigation and characterization of the available data is of utmost importance in order to evaluate the quality and quantity of the data and to set the right expectations. In this paper, we focus on the data exploration and characterization step, which is necessary to avoid inconsistencies in the collected parameters and to enable valid, data-driven modeling. The proposed data exploration considers both the frequency of samples and their values for all monitored parameters. A specific cross-provider data comparison is performed to compare values collected for the same vehicle at the same time from different fleet monitoring data providers. The study is applied to a real-world use case with months of data from dozens of vehicles deployed in the waste collection service managed by SEA, Soluzioni Eco Ambientali, in Italy. The analyzes uncover unexpected behaviors in the measurements and lead to their early identification, bringing great benefits to the company operating the fleet by improving data collection and enabling a safe modeling phase.",
