            "abstract": "The recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in a wide range of Natural Language Processing applications opens the path towards novel Question Answering Systems over Knowledge Graphs leveraging LLMs. However, one of the main obstacles preventing their implementation is the scarcity of training data for the task of translating questions into corresponding SPARQL queries, particularly in the case of domain-specific KGs. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we evaluate several strategies for fine-tuning the OpenLlama LLM for question answering over life science knowledge graphs. In particular, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation approach for extending a set of existing queries over a given knowledge graph towards a larger dataset of semantically enriched question-to-SPARQL query pairs, enabling fine-tuning even for datasets where these pairs are scarce. In this context, we also investigate the role of semantic\"clues\"in the queries, such as meaningful variable names and inline comments. Finally, we evaluate our approach over the real-world Bgee gene expression knowledge graph and we show that semantic clues can improve model performance by up to 33% compared to a baseline with random variable names and no comments included.",

            "abstract": "Background , enhancing interoperability of bioinformatics knowledge bases is a high priority requirement to maximize data reusability, and thus increase their utility such as the return on investment for biomedical research. A knowledge base may provide useful information for life scientists and other knowledge bases, but it only acquires exchange value once the knowledge base is (re)used, and without interoperability the utility lies dormant. Results , in this article, we discuss several approaches to boost interoperability depending on the interoperable parts. The \ufb01ndings are driven by several real-world scenario examples that were mostly implemented by Bgee, a well-established gene expression database. Moreover, we discuss ten general main lessons learnt. These lessons can be applied in the context of any bioinformatics knowledge base to foster data reusability. Conclusions , this work provides pragmatic methods and transferable skills to promote reusability of bioinformatics knowledge bases by focusing on interoperability.",

            "abstract": "The BioResource Research Center (BRC) at the Japanese Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) develops and maintains the RIKEN BioResource MetaDatabase. This database integrates several life science datasets to support researchers in making a comprehensive use of RIKEN\u2019s research results. For instance, RIKEN BRC collects, preserves and distributes various bioresources for further scientific research: experimental mouse strains, cultured cell lines and genetic materials of human and animal origin. In this article, we present a case study that mainly combines the RIKEN BioResource MetaDataBase [1] and the Bgee, a multi-species gene expression database [2]. Our use case involves finding the Alzheimer disease (AD) related human genes that are highly expressed in the healthy prefrontal cortex, and the RIKEN\u2019s genetically modified mice related to these genes. Information on the gene expression is obtained from the Bgee database and the human-mouse orthologs from the Orthologous MAtrix (OMA) database [3]. Orthologs are pairs of genes which have evolved from a single gene in the last common ancestor. The DisGeNET dataset provides relationships between disease and human genes [4]. In summary, we combined the four aforementioned data sources by writing the federated SPARQL query at https://purl.org/data-in-use and illustrated in Fig. 1. This query can be executed in the SPARQL endpoint at https://knowledge.brc.riken.jp/sparql. Examples of retrieved results are shown in Table 1. Among them, the APOE gene is highly relevant for AD research as shown in [5]. Furthermore, we evaluated two query execution scenarios. One scenario considers a SERVICE SPARQL subquery to be executed against the remote Bgee SPARQL endpoint resulting in an average runtime of about 60 seconds and, thus, assuring access to the latest data. The second scenario replaces the SERVICE subquery with a subquery matching triple patterns from the named graph containing Bgee data and stored in the RIKEN BioResource MetaDatabase. As a result, the query runtime is drastically reduced from 60 seconds to around 26 seconds (i.e., 2.3x faster). Therefore, we compared federated versus centralised data access and storage",

            "title": "Bio-SODA: Enabling Natural Language Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs without Training Data",
            "abstract": "The problem of natural language processing over structured data has become a growing research field, both within the relational database and the Semantic Web community, with significant efforts involved in question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA). However, many of these approaches are either specifically targeted at open-domain question answering using DBpedia, or require large training datasets to translate a natural language question to SPARQL in order to query the knowledge graph. Hence, these approaches often cannot be applied directly to complex scientific datasets where no prior training data is available. In this paper, we focus on the challenges of natural language processing over knowledge graphs of scientific datasets. In particular, we introduce Bio-SODA, a natural language processing engine that does not require training data in the form of question-answer pairs for generating SPARQL queries. Bio-SODA uses a generic graph-based approach for translating user questions to a ranked list of SPARQL candidate queries. Furthermore, Bio-SODA uses a novel ranking algorithm that includes node centrality as a measure of relevance for selecting the best SPARQL candidate query. Our experiments with real-world datasets across several scientific domains, including the official bioinformatics Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) challenge, as well as the CORDIS dataset of European projects, show that Bio-SODA outperforms publicly available KGQA systems by an F1-score of least 20% and by an even higher factor on more complex bioinformatics datasets.",

However, analyzing evolutionary data in RDF is not trivial, due to the steep learning curve required to understand both the data models adopted by different RDF data sources, as well as the equivalent SPARQL constructs required to benefit from this data \u2013 in particular, recursive property paths. In this article, we provide a hands-on introduction to querying evolutionary data across several data sources that publish orthology information in RDF, namely: The Orthologous MAtrix (OMA), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) RDF platform, the Database of Orthologous Groups (OrthoDB) and the Microbial Genome Database (MBGD). We present four protocols in increasing order of complexity. In these protocols, we demonstrate through SPARQL queries how to retrieve pairwise orthologs, homologous groups, and hierarchical orthologous groups. Finally, we show how orthology information in different data sources can be compared, through the use of federated SPARQL queries.",

            "title": "Enabling semantic queries across federated bioinformatics databases",
            "abstract": "Motivation Data integration promises to be one of the main catalysts in enabling new insights to be drawn from the wealth of biological data available publicly. However, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, both at the syntactic and the semantic level, still poses significant challenges for achieving interoperability among biological databases. Results We introduce an ontology-based federated approach for data integration. We applied this approach to three heterogeneous data stores that span different areas of biological knowledge: 1) Bgee, a gene expression relational database; 2) OMA, a Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) orthology data store, and 3) UniProtKB, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) store containing protein sequence and functional information. To enable federated queries across these sources, we first defined a new semantic model for gene expression called GenEx. We then show how the relational data in Bgee can be expressed as a virtual RDF graph, instantiating GenEx, through dedicated relational-to-RDF mappings. By applying these mappings, Bgee data are now accessible through a public SPARQL endpoint. Similarly, the materialised RDF data of OMA, expressed in terms of the Orthology ontology, is made available in a public SPARQL endpoint. We identified and formally described intersection points (i.e. virtual links) among the three data sources. These allow performing joint queries across the data stores. Finally, we lay the groundwork to enable nontechnical users to benefit from the integrated data, by providing a natural language template-based search interface.

In this update paper, we review the recent algorithmic improvements in the OMA pipeline, describe increases in species coverage (particularly in plants and early-branching eukaryotes) and introduce several new features in the OMA web browser. Notable improvements include: (i) a scalable, interactive viewer for hierarchical orthologous groups; (ii) protein domain annotations and domain-based links between orthologous groups; (iii) functionality to retrieve phylogenetic marker genes for a subset of species of interest; (iv) a new synteny dot plot viewer; and (v) an overhaul of the programmatic access (REST API and semantic web), which will facilitate incorporation of OMA analyses in computational pipelines and integration with other bioinformatic resources. OMA can be freely accessed at https://omabrowser.org.",
