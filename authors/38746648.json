            "title": "Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Attack Strategy With Swarm Robots in Denied Environments",
            "abstract": "An attack\u2013defense confrontation problem arises from a robot swarm attacking a territory protected by another one. In denied environments, global positioning and communication are hardly available. It becomes difficult for a swarm to realize collaboration and handle confrontation against another. Commonly used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on pretraining, which is time consuming and has strong environmental dependence, especially in denied environments. To study attack strategies in denied environments, this work proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based attack strategy with Swarm Robots for the first time. Each robot obtains its situation information by perceiving its nearby peers and enemies. Such information is utilized to evaluate the benefits or threats of a robot\u2019s next perceptible attack positions. Then, each robot uses EA to optimize its fitness function and searches for its optimal position. A collision-avoidance strategy is integrated into the algorithm. Hence, a robot swarm realizes collaboration and handles confrontation as long as each robot can sense its surroundings. They utilize their own sensors to detect others locally without using global positioning and communication devices. The experimental result analyses show that the EA-based attack strategy has better scalability and more potential in solving large-scale confrontational problems than the DRL-based algorithms. Rationales of the proposed method are presented to show the great capability of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in pre-trained language models have enabled convenient methods for generating human-like text at a large scale. Though these generation capabilities hold great potential for breakthrough applications, it can also be a tool for an adversary to generate misinformation. In particular, social media platforms like Twitter are highly susceptible to AI-generated misinformation. A potential threat scenario is when an adversary hijacks a credible user account and incorporates a natural language generator to generate misinformation. Such threats necessitate automated detectors for AI-generated tweets in a given user's Twitter timeline. However, tweets are inherently short, thus making it difficult for current state-of-the-art pre-trained language model-based detectors to accurately detect at what point the AI starts to generate tweets in a given Twitter timeline. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm using stylometric signals to aid detecting AI-generated tweets. We propose models corresponding to quantifying stylistic changes in human and AI tweets in two related tasks: Task 1 - discriminate between human and AI-generated tweets, and Task 2 - detect if and when an AI starts to generate tweets in a given Twitter timeline. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the stylometric features are effective in augmenting the state-of-the-art AI-generated text detectors.",

            "abstract": "Recently, using a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to guide robots in a source location problem has attracted widespread interest. While being navigated by PSO, robots are easily trapped into U-shape-like concave obstacles such that they move back and forth cyclically and fail to locate a correct source. Existing obstacle avoidance strategies perform well when robots have information about all obstacles. Yet in many real scenes, robots have no prior information. This work proposes a novel PSO based on Tabu Search (PSO-TS) for robots to locate multiple sources. Instead of traditionally setting obstacles as tabu objects, PSO-TS innovatively sets trapping areas as tabu objects such that robots do not need prior knowledge or expensive hardware and much time to obtain obstacle information. The weighted average velocity of a robot is employed to determine if it is stuck inside an obstacle-induced area. If so, a rectangular tabu area is set to push robots out of the area and prevents robots from searching the same area again. The proposed method can be embedded into various source location algorithms to improve their performance. Its obstacle avoidance capability is proved. Finally, experimental results show the algorithmic compatibility, environmental adaptability and obstacle avoidance performance of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Hate speech detection refers to the task of detecting hateful content that aims at denigrating an individual or a group based on their religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. Due to the different policies of the platforms, different groups of people express hate in different ways. Furthermore, due to the lack of labeled data in some platforms it becomes challenging to build hate speech detection models. To this end, we revisit if we can learn a generalizable hate speech detection model for the cross platform setting, where we train the model on the data from one (source) platform and generalize the model across multiple (target) platforms. Existing generalization models rely on linguistic cues or auxiliary information, making them biased towards certain tags or certain kinds of words (e.g., abusive words) on the source platform and thus not applicable to the target platforms. Inspired by social and psychological theories, we endeavor to explore if there exist inherent causal cues that can be leveraged to learn generalizable representations for detecting hate speech across these distribution shifts. To this end, we propose a causality-guided framework, PEACE, that identifies and leverages two intrinsic causal cues omnipresent in hateful content: the overall sentiment and the aggression in the text. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple platforms (representing the distribution shift) showing if causal cues can help cross-platform generalization.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Citrus (Citrus reticulata), which is an important economic crop worldwide, is often managed in a labor-intensive and inefficient manner in developing countries, thereby necessitating more rapid and accurate alternatives to field surveys for improved crop management. In this study, we propose a novel method for individual tree segmentation from unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (RS) using a combination of geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and layer-adaptive Euclidean distance transformation-based watershed segmentation (LAEDT-WS). First, we use a GEOBIA support vector machine classifier that is optimized for features and parameters to identify the boundaries of citrus tree canopies accurately by generating mask images. Thereafter, our LAEDT workflow separates connected canopies and facilitates the accurate segmentation of individual canopies using WS. Our method exhibited an F1-score improvement of 10.75% compared to the traditional WS method based on the canopy height model. Furthermore, it achieved 0.01% and 1.38% higher F1-scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning detection networks YOLOX and YOLACT, respectively, on the test plot. Our method can be extended to detect larger-scale or more complex structured crops or economic plants by introducing more finely detailed and transferable RS images, such as high-resolution or LiDAR-derived images, to improve the mask base map.",

            "abstract": "Since brain network organization is essentially governed by the harmonic waves derived from the Eigen-system of the underlying Laplacian matrix, discovering the harmonic-based alterations provides a new window to understand the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a unified reference space. However, current reference (common harmonic waves) estimation studies over the individual harmonic waves are often sensitive to outliers, which are obtained by averaging the heterogenous individual brain networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel manifold learning approach to identify a set of outlier-immunized common harmonic waves. The backbone of our framework is calculating the geometric median of all individual harmonic waves on the Stiefel manifold, instead of Fr\u00e9chet mean, thus improving the robustness of learned common harmonic waves to the outliers. A manifold optimization scheme with theoretically guaranteed convergence is tailored to solve our method. The experimental results on synthetic data and real data demonstrate that the common harmonic waves learned by our approach are not only more robust to the outliers than the state-of-the-art methods, but also provide a putative imaging biomarker to predict the early stage of AD.",

            "abstract": "The rise of social media platforms has facilitated the formation of echo chambers, which are online spaces where users predominantly encounter viewpoints that reinforce their existing beliefs while excluding dissenting perspectives. This phenomenon significantly hinders information dissemination across communities and fuels societal polarization. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for quantifying echo chambers. In this paper, we present the Echo Chamber Score (ECS), a novel metric that assesses the cohesion and separation of user communities by measuring distances between users in the embedding space. In contrast to existing approaches, ECS is able to function without labels for user ideologies and makes no assumptions about the structure of the interaction graph. To facilitate measuring distances between users, we propose EchoGAE, a self-supervised graph autoencoder-based user embedding model that leverages users' posts and the interaction graph to embed them in a manner that reflects their ideological similarity. To assess the effectiveness of ECS, we use a Twitter dataset consisting of four topics - two polarizing and two non-polarizing. Our results showcase ECS's effectiveness as a tool for quantifying echo chambers and shedding light on the dynamics of online discourse.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture (SM) is affected by many factors, such as soil characteristics, land cover, and meteorological conditions, making accurate remote sensing SM estimation a tough task. To fully explore the complementary information of multisource remote sensing data in SM estimation, it is necessary to explore the multiple feature variable selection method. Traditional filter methods may lead to feature redundancy and low accuracy, and embedding methods usually require complex parameter optimization. To overcome the above issues, we propose an enhanced generalized regression neural network with backward sequential feature selection (EBSFS) method for SM estimation. By using $k$-fold cross-validation to obtain the training set and validation set, and using the Pearson correlation coefficient to design evaluation criteria and an objective function, EBSFS searches for feature variables that minimize the objective function and updates the feature subset during iteration. EBSFS can adaptively obtain the optimal number of feature variables based on the evaluation criteria. Moreover, EBSFS does not require parameter optimization and can be flexibly and conveniently embedded into ensemble learning framework. Experiments conducted over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from April 2015 to March 2016 demonstrate that EBSFS greatly reduces the feature redundancy, produces a more compact feature subset, and achieves higher estimation accuracy. Precisely, EBSFS presents better performance with R = 0.9544 and RMSE = 0.0310 under 13 input feature variables.",

            "title": "Towards LLM-guided Causal Explainability for Black-box Text Classifiers",
            "abstract": "With the advent of larger and more complex deep learning models, such as in Natural Language Processing (NLP), model qualities like explainability and interpretability, albeit highly desirable, are becoming harder challenges to tackle and solve. For example, state-of-the-art models in text classification are black-box by design. Although standard explanation methods provide some degree of explainability, these are mostly correlation-based methods and do not provide much insight into the model. The alternative of causal explainability is more desirable to achieve but extremely challenging in NLP due to a variety of reasons. Inspired by recent endeavors to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as experts, in this work, we aim to leverage the instruction-following and textual understanding capabilities of recent state-of-the-art LLMs to facilitate causal explainability via counterfactual explanation generation for black-box text classifiers. To do this, we propose a three-step pipeline via which, we use an off-the-shelf LLM to: (1) identify the latent or unobserved features in the input text, (2) identify the input features associated with the latent features, and finally (3) use the identified input features to generate a counterfactual explanation. We experiment with our pipeline on multiple NLP text classification datasets, with several recent LLMs, and present interesting and promising findings.",

            "title": "J-Guard: Journalism Guided Adversarially Robust Detection of AI-generated News",
            "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of AI-generated text online is profoundly reshaping the information landscape. Among various types of AI-generated text, AI-generated news presents a significant threat as it can be a prominent source of misinformation online. While several recent efforts have focused on detecting AI-generated text in general, these methods require enhanced reliability, given concerns about their vulnerability to simple adversarial attacks. Furthermore, due to the eccentricities of news writing, applying these detection methods for AI-generated news can produce false positives, potentially damaging the reputation of news organizations. To address these challenges, we leverage the expertise of an interdisciplinary team to develop a framework, J-Guard, capable of steering existing supervised AI text detectors for detecting AI-generated news while boosting adversarial robustness. By incorporating stylistic cues inspired by the unique journalistic attributes, J-Guard effectively distinguishes between real-world journalism and AI-generated news articles. Our experiments on news articles generated by a vast array of AI models, including ChatGPT (GPT3.5), demonstrate the effectiveness of J-Guard in enhancing detection capabilities while maintaining an average performance decrease of as low as 7% when faced with adversarial attacks.",
