            "title": "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2022 Report",
            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are core to fostering innovative thinking. Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",

            "abstract": "The face image database is essential to evaluate the face detection and recognition algorithms. Out-of-focus blur is one of the important factors which may influence the detection and recognition results. To investigate the effect of out-of-focus blur on the performance of face recognition system, a new face database concentrating on the factor of out-of-focus blur was built. Two typical acquisition facilities - PC camera and professional digital camera - were used. The whole focus range was divided into 11 intervals. 628 images were gathered with similar pose and expression, but with strictly controlled different definitions. The features and building process of the database are presented in this paper. Then evaluation of the blur assessment algorithms are raised. A suggestion of the usage of the blur assessment algorithms is proposed.",

            "abstract": "Face Image Retrieval is an important application of Content-Based Image Retrieval. A more practical model of face image retrieval system is analyzed in this paper. Moreover a suitable algorithm based on power law transformation(PLT) is introduced. The feature space is spanned by the training set enlarged from the input query image rather than images in the retrieving dataset. Experiments and comparison with projection based method show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",
