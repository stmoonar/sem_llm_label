            "abstract": "A vaccine passport serves as documentary proof, providing passport holders with greater freedom while roaming around during pandemics. It confirms vaccination against certain infectious diseases like COVID-19, Ebola, and flu. The key challenges faced by the digital vaccine passport system include passport forgery, unauthorized data access, and inaccurate information input by vaccination centers. Privacy concerns also need to be addressed to ensure that the user's personal identification information (PII) is not compromised. Additionally, it is necessary to track vaccine vials or doses to verify their authenticity, prevent misuse and illegal sales, as well as to restrict the illicit distribution of vaccines. To address these challenges, we propose a Blockchain-Enabled Secure Vaccine Passport System, leveraging the power of smart contracts. Our solution integrates off-chain and on-chain cryptographic computations, facilitating secure communication among various entities. We have utilized the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store encrypted vaccine passports of citizens securely. Our prototype is built on the Ethereum platform, with smart contracts deployed on the Sepolia Test network, allowing for performance evaluation and validation of the system's effectiveness. By combining IPFS as a distributed data storage platform and Ethereum as a blockchain platform, our solution paves the way for secure, efficient, and globally interoperable vaccine passport management, supporting comprehensive vaccination initiatives worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Digital identity is evolving from centralized systems to a decentralized approach known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI empowers individuals to control their digital identities, eliminating reliance on third-party data custodians and reducing the risk of data breaches. However, the concept of trust in SSI remains complex and fragmented. This paper systematically analyzes trust in SSI in light of its components and threats posed by various actors in the system. As a result, we derive three distinct trust models that capture the threats and mitigations identified across SSI literature and implementations. Our work provides a foundational framework for future SSI research and development, including a comprehensive catalogue of SSI components and design requirements for trust, shortcomings in existing SSI systems and areas for further exploration.",

            "abstract": "In the realm of wireless communications and task allocations, where agents need to travel to perform tasks, a new challenge has emerged. This challenge involves efficiently distributing tasks among agents while considering their preferences and priorities. Unfortunately, many existing solutions rely on centralized systems, making them susceptible to various vulnerabilities, including privacy concerns and security threats. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel solution named SEPP-TAP-a secure and privacy-preserving decentralized framework for multi-agent task allocation problems, harnessing the power of blockchain technology. SEPP-TAP not only protects agents' privacy and location information but also strengthens network security by mitigating threats like the Sybil attack and network flooding. Our approach employs innovative anonymization techniques to ensure that agents' identities remain concealed throughout successive task requests, breaking any associations between tasks performed by a particular agent.",

            "abstract": "Tabular data sharing serves as a common method for data exchange. However, sharing sensitive information without adequate privacy protection can compromise individual privacy. Thus, ensuring privacy-preserving data sharing is crucial. Differential privacy (DP) is regarded as the gold standard in data privacy. Despite this, current DP methods tend to generate privacy-preserving tabular datasets that often suffer from limited practical utility due to heavy perturbation and disregard for the tables' utility dynamics. Besides, there has not been much research on selective attribute release, particularly in the context of controlled partially perturbed data sharing. This has significant implications for scenarios such as cross-agency data sharing in real-world situations. We introduce OptimShare: a utility-focused, multi-criteria solution designed to perturb input datasets selectively optimized for specific real-world applications. OptimShare combines the principles of differential privacy, fuzzy logic, and probability theory to establish an integrated tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. Empirical assessments confirm that OptimShare successfully strikes a balance between better data utility and robust privacy, effectively serving various real-world problem scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Traceability is one of the most sought-after properties for supply chains because it facilitates a plethora of use cases like food recalls, counterfeit detection, and quality improvement by tracing the history of a product. Recently proposed traceability solutions rely heavily on blockchain technology because it offers data immutability and transparency. However, these solutions suffer from two significant limitations. Firstly, they do not validate traceability data for accuracy and completeness. So, how can we be sure that the data on the blockchain is correct and complete? Secondly, they provide a limited threat model or none at all. So, how can we be sure that the trace for a product has not been altered by an adversary? To summarise, we propose ForTrac, an Ethereum-based forward traceability system for generic physical products. Each product is digitally represented as an ERC-721 token. In a forward traceability system, traces are built correctly by design. ForTrac uses a valid predicate that states the sequence of steps a product has to follow and how much time each step can maximally take. We show that ForTrac is secure. Unlike previous work, our security analysis is not restricted to only the blockchain component. It also includes the communication protocol between the product reader, server, and smart contract. We show that our communication protocol guarantees data agreement between the reader and smart contract using Scyther. Finally, we demonstrate that our prototype is feasible by assessing costs and performance. By using forward traceability and including a detailed security analysis we provide accuracy and completeness. Our valid predicate documents which events have to be collected for a trace to be complete. Data accuracy is provided by showing that the smart contract agrees with the data sent by the reader.",

            "abstract": "Demand response (DR) has been studied widely in the smart grid literature, however, there is still a significant gap in approaches that address security, privacy, and robustness of settlement processes simultaneously. The need for security and robustness emerges as a vital property, as Internet of Things (IoT) devices become part of the smart grid; in the form of smart meters, home energy management systems (HEMSs), intelligent transformers, and so on. In this paper, we use energy blockchain to secure energy transactions among customers and the utility. In addition, we formulate a mixed-strategy stochastic game model to address uncertainties in DR contributions of agents and achieve optimal demand response decisions. This model utilizes the processing hardware of customers for block mining, stores customer DR agreements as distributed ledgers, and offers a smart contract and consensus algorithm for energy transaction validation. We use a real dataset of residential demand profiles and photovoltaic (PV) generation to validate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show the impact of electric vehicle (EV) discharging and customer demand reduction on increasing the probability of successful block mining and improving customer profits. Moreover, the results demonstrate the security and robustness of our consensus algorithm for detecting malicious activities.",

We address the lack of guaranteed fairness, as defined above, in the existing platforms for this setting. We present TEDX, a decentralized solution for guaranteed three party fair exchange of digital goods with scalability and support for incremental deployment over the existing (non-fair) platforms. TEDX combines carefully crafted message exchanges with incentive schemes designed to deter malicious behavior.

            "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) opens up a challenging research area towards improving secure data sharing which currently has several limitations. Primarily, the lack of inbuilt guarantees of honest behavior of participating, such as end-users or cloud behaving maliciously may result in disputes. Given such challenges, we propose a fair, accountable, and secure data sharing scheme, FairShare for IIoT. In this scheme, data collected from IoT devices are processed and stored in cloud servers with intermediate fog nodes facilitating computation. Authorized clients can access this data against some fee to make strategic decisions for improving the operational services of the IIoT system. By enabling blockchain, FairShare prevents fraudulent activities and thereby achieves fairness such that each party gets their rightful outcome in terms of data or penalty/rewards while simultaneously ensuring accountability of the services provided by the parties. Additionally, smart contracts are designed to act as a mediator during any dispute by enforcing payment settlement. Further, security and privacy of data are ensured by suitably applying cryptographic techniques like proxy re-encryption. We prove FairShare to be secure as long as at least one of the parties is honest. We validate FairShare with a theoretical overhead analysis. We also build a prototype in Ethereum to estimate performance and justify comparable results with a state-of-the-art scheme both via simulation and a realistic testbed setup. We observe an additional communication overhead of 256 bytes and a cost of deployment of 1.01 USD in Ethereum which are constant irrespective of file size.",

An attacker can block several channels and stall payments by mounting this attack. A state-of-the-art countermeasure, Hashed Timelock Contract with Griefing-Penalty (<italic>HTLC-GP</italic>) is found to work under the classical assumption of participants being either honest or malicious but fails for rational participants. To address the gap, we introduce a game-theoretic model for analyzing griefing attacks in <italic>HTLC</italic>. We use this model to analyze griefing attacks in <italic>HTLC-GP</italic> and conjecture that it is impossible to design an efficient protocol that will penalize a malicious participant with the current Bitcoin scripting system. We study the impact of the penalty on the cost of mounting the attack and observe that <italic>HTLC-GP</italic> is <italic>weakly effective</italic> in disincentivizing the attacker in certain conditions. To further increase the cost of attack, we introduce the concept of <italic>guaranteed minimum compensation</italic>, denoted as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\zeta $ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and modify <italic>HTLC-GP</italic> into <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {HTLC{-}GP}^{\\zeta }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. By experimenting on several instances of Lightning Network, we observe that the total coins locked in the network drops to 28% for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {HTLC{-}GP}^{\\zeta }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, unlike in <italic>HTLC-GP</italic> where total coins locked does not drop below 40%. These results justify that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {HTLC{-}GP}^{\\zeta }$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is better than <italic>HTLC-GP</italic> to counter griefing attacks.",

            "abstract": "Payments routed in Lightning Network are susceptible to a grie\ufb01ng attack . In this attack, the channels get blocked, and the a\ufb00ected parties cannot process any payment request. Our work is the \ufb01rst to analyze grie\ufb01ng attacks in Hashed Timelock Contract or HTLC , from a game-theoretic point of view. Using the same model, we analyze another payment protocol Hashed Timelock Contract with Grie\ufb01ng-Penalty or HTLC-GP , which was proposed to counter grie\ufb01ng attacks. We \ufb01nd that HTLC-GP is weakly e\ufb00ective in disincentivizing the attacker. To further increase the cost of attack, we introduce the concept of guaranteed minimum compensation and integrate it into HTLC-GP . This modi\ufb01ed payment protocol is termed HTLC-GP \u03b6 and unlike HTLC-GP , the protocol considers the participants to act rationally. By experimenting on several instances of Lightning Network, we show that the capacity locked drops to 40% in the case of HTLC-GP when the rate of grie\ufb01ng-penalty is set to 4 . 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 , and 28% in the case of HTLC-GP \u03b6 when guaranteed minimum compensation is 2 . 5% of the transaction amount. These results justify our claim that HTLC-GP \u03b6 is better than HTLC-GP to counter grie\ufb01ng attacks.",
