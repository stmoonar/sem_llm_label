            "title": "Feather: Lightweight Container Alternatives for Deploying Workloads in the Edge",
            "abstract": ": Recent years have seen the adoption of workload orchestration into the network edge. Cloud orchestrators such as Kubernetes have been extended to edge computing, providing the virtual infrastructure to efficiently manage containerized workloads across the edge-cloud continuum. However, cloud-based orchestrators are resource intensive, sometimes occupying the bulk of resources of an edge device even when idle. While various Kubernetes-based solutions, such as K3s and KubeEdge, have been developed with a specific focus on edge computing, they remain limited to container runtimes. This paper proposes a Kubernetes-compatible solution for edge workload packaging, distribution, and execution, named Feather , which extends edge work-loads beyond containers. Feather is based on Virtual Kubelets, superseding previous work from FLEDGE. It is capable of operating in existing Kubernetes clusters, with minimal, optional additions to the Kubernetes PodSpec to enable multi-runtime images and execution. Both Containerd and OSv unikernel backends are implemented, and evaluations show that unikernel workloads can be executed highly efficiently, with a memory reduction of up to 20% for Java applications at the cost of up to 25% CPU power. Evaluations also show that Feather itself is suitable for most modern edge devices, with the x86 version only requiring 58-62 MiB of memory for the agent itself.",

            "abstract": "The production and consumption of video content has become a staple in the current day and age. With the rise of virtual reality (VR), users are now looking for immersive, interactive experiences which combine the classic video applications, such as conferencing or digital concerts, with newer technologies. By going beyond 2D video into a 360 degree experience the first step was made. However, a 360 degree video offers only rotational movement, making interaction with the environment difficult. Fully immersive 3D content formats, such as light fields and volumetric video, aspire to go further by enabling six degrees-of-freedom (6DoF), allowing both rotational and positional freedom. Nevertheless, the adoption of immersive video capturing and rendering methods has been hindered by their substantial bandwidth and computational requirements, rendering them in most cases impractical for low latency applications. Several efforts have been made to alleviate these problems by introducing specialized compression algorithms and by utilizing existing 2D adaptation methods to adapt the quality based on the user's available bandwidth. However, even though these methods improve the quality of experience (QoE) and bandwidth limitations, they still suffer from high latency which makes real-time interaction unfeasible. To address this issue, we present a novel, open source [32], one-to-many streaming architecture using point cloud-based volumetric video. To reduce the bandwidth requirements, we utilize the Draco codec to compress the point clouds before they are transmitted using WebRTC which ensures low latency, enabling the streaming of real-time 6DoF interactive volumetric video. Content is adapted by employing a multiple description coding (MDC) strategy which combines sampled point cloud descriptions based on the estimated bandwidth returned by the Google congestion control (GCC) algorithm. MDC encoding scales more easily to a larger number of users compared to performing individual encoding. Our proposed solution achieves similar real-time latency for both three and nine clients (163 ms and 166 ms), which is 9% and 19% lower compared to individual encoding. The MDC-based approach, using three workers, achieves similar visual quality compared to a per client encoding solution, using five worker threads, and increased quality when the number of clients is greater than 20.",

            "abstract": "In today's world, the use of video conferencing applications has risen significantly. However, with the introduction of affordable head-mounted displays (HMDs), users are now seeking new immersive and engaging experiences that enhance the 2D video conferencing applications with a third dimension. Immersive video formats such as light fields and volumetric video aim to enhance the experience by allowing for six degrees-of-freedom (6DoF), resulting in users being able to look and walk around in the virtual space. We present a novel, open source, many-to-many streaming architecture using point cloud-based volumetric video. To ensure bitrates that satisfy contemporary networks, the Draco codec encodes the point clouds before they are transmitted using web real-time communication (WebRTC), all while ensuring that the end-to-end latency remains acceptable for real-time communication. A multiple description coding (MDC)-based quality adaptation approach ensures that the pipeline can support a large number of users, each with varying network conditions. In this demo, participants will be seated around a table and will engage in a virtual conference using an HMD, with each participant being captured using a single depth camera. To showcase the quality effectiveness of the MDC-based adaptation algorithm, a dashboard is used to monitor the status of the application and control the bandwidth available to each participant. The available bandwidth and position of the user are taken into account to dynamically assign a quality level to each participant, ensuring a higher quality experience compared to having a uniform quality level for each point cloud object.",

In response to these challenges, this research explores the optimization of adaptive video streaming by integrating 5G terrestrial broadcasting with over-the-top (OTT) streaming methods. A comprehensive integration of forward error correction (FEC), temporal layer injection (TLI), and broadcast techniques enhance the robustness and efficiency of content delivery over broadcast networks and reduce unicast bandwidth to zero in low loss environments. Multiple strategies are compared through an extensive emulation setup for reducing latency in the end-to-end video delivery chain to sub 3-second live latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of a hybrid unicast-broadcast approach in achieving low-latency while maintaining high-quality video streaming performance with significantly reduced bandwidth. For 62.99% of viewers, unicast bandwidth can be reduced to as low as zero when broadcasting the top 3 TV channels.",

            "abstract": "Telecom vendors have adopted containerization to improve their software for heterogeneous edge-to-cloud networks. Container orchestration platforms face however challenges when adapting to the dynamic demands of multi-tenancy, often leading to performance and security conflicts between Cluster Administrators (CAs) and applications administrators. In this paper, we propose that network security and performance constraints should be directly integrated into the scheduler. By dynamically determining preferred network segments for each application, this approach will reduce the network attack surface, enhance resource utilization, and ensure improved performance. The presented prototype and evaluation is just a first step. A comprehensive solution must also support an intent-based interface to the scheduler that simplifies expression of cluster node segmentation constraints and thus frees the CA from node-level management. We outline the vision for such an intent-based interface and emulate it by means of traditional security groups.",

            "abstract": "Microservices have revolutionized application deployment in popular cloud platforms, offering flexible scheduling of loosely-coupled containers and improving operational efficiency. However, this transition made applications more complex, consisting of tens to hundreds of microservices. Efficient orchestration remains an enormous challenge, especially with emerging paradigms such as Fog Computing and novel use cases as autonomous vehicles. Also, multi-cluster scenarios are still not vastly explored today since most literature focuses mainly on a single-cluster setup. The scheduling problem becomes significantly more challenging since the orchestrator needs to find optimal locations for each microservice while deciding whether instances are deployed altogether or placed into different clusters. This paper studies the multi-cluster orchestration challenge by proposing a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach for efficient microservice deployment in Kubernetes (K8s), a widely adopted container orchestration platform. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of RL agents in achieving near-optimal allocation schemes, emphasizing latency reduction and deployment cost minimization. Additionally, the work highlights the versatility of the DeepSets neural network in optimizing microservice placement across diverse multi-cluster setups without retraining. Results show that DeepSets algorithms optimize the placement of microservices in a multi-cluster setup 32 times higher than its trained scenario.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of container technology, companies have been developing microservice-based applications, converting the old monolithic software into a group of loosely coupled containers, with the aim of offering greater flexibility and improving operational efficiency. When users access microservices, their initial point of contact is typically a load balancer. This component is responsible for distributing incoming traffic or requests between multiple instances of microservices. Traditional load balancing approaches mainly rely on round-robin, or weighted roundrobin algorithms which are inadequate to maintain the overall performance and scalability of microservice-based applications. Microservices are often deployed in dynamic environments needing a more adaptive and efficient load balancing strategy to optimize resources and reduce the overall latency for end users. This paper presents a dynamic load balancer for Kubernetes (K8s) clusters based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). It aims to minimize the overall latency while promoting fair distribution of requests. To achieve this goal, the load balancer considers both current network delays and processing loads in the cluster. The evaluation shows that our solution is effective even in environments where both the network traffic and the processing loads in the cluster change dynamically over time. In addition, this study highlights the flexibility of DeepSets neural networks in solving the load balancing challenge in diverse setups without retraining. The results show that the DeepSets algorithms can solve the microservice load balancing problem even in scenarios up to 30 times larger than the trained setup.",

            "abstract": "A Kubernetes cluster typically consists of trusted nodes, running within the confines of a physically secure datacenter. With recent advances in edge orchestration, this is no longer the case. This poses a new challenge: how can we trust a device that an attacker has physical access to? This paper presents an architecture and open-source implementation that securely enrolls edge devices as trusted Kubernetes worker nodes. By providing boot attestation rooted in a hardware Trusted Platform Module, a strong base of trust is provided. A new custom controller directs a modified version of Keylime to cross the cloud-edge gap and securely deliver unique cluster credentials required to enroll an edge worker. The controller dynamically grants and revokes these credentials based on attestation events, preventing a possibly compromised node from accessing sensitive cluster resources. We provide both a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation of the architecture. The qualitative scenarios prove its ability to attest and enroll an edge device with role-based access control (RBAC) permissions that dynamically adjust to attestation events. The quantitative evaluation reflects an average of 10.28 seconds delay incurred on the startup time of the edge node due to attestation for a total average enrollment time of 20.91 seconds. The presented architecture thus provides a strong base of trust, securing a physically exposed edge device and paving the way for a robust and resilient edge computing ecosystem.",

            "title": "Enhancing Virtual Reality Stress Relief with Haptics: The Virtual Rage Room Use Case",
            "abstract": "EXtended Reality (XR) is already demonstrating its potential beyond the entertainment and gaming industry. One sector clearly benefiting from the advantages of XR is the treatment of stress related mental illnesses by means of Virtual Reality (VR). This is a form of therapy using VR which seeks to help decrease the intensity of the stress responses and anxiety levels due to the various modern-day pressures (e.g., situations, thoughts, or memories which provoke anxiety or fear). While showing promising results, the audiovisual essence of Virtual Reality (VR) can limit the effectiveness of this type of virtual therapy, as the patient\u2019s interaction with the environment is constrained to their visual or at most also their audio senses. As such, including in the immersive therapy tactile therapy could enhance the experience and thus the effectiveness of the therapy. However, this has been largely unexplored. The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of haptic feedback in reducing anxiety for stress relief treatment. Therefore, we present a haptic-enabled subjective methodology. As use case, we selected the booming case of the Virtual Rage Room (VRR), where participants can vent their rage by (virtually) destroying objects. The results of our study highlight the significantly positive impact of incorporating haptic feedback in mitigating anxiety within this context. Moreover, the analysis reassures the intrinsic value of this treatment as a potent tool for anxiety alleviation.",

            "title": "Immersive and Interactive Subjective Quality Assessment of Dynamic Volumetric Meshes",
            "abstract": "Dynamic point cloud delivery can provide the required interactivity and realism to six degrees of freedom (6DoF) interactive applications. However, dynamic point cloud rendering imposes stringent requirements (e.g., frames per second (FPS) and quality) that current hardware cannot handle. A possible solution is to convert point cloud into meshes before rendering on the head-mounted display (HMD). However, this conversion can induce degradation in quality perception such as a change in depth, level of detail, or presence of artifacts. This paper, as one of the first, presents an extensive subjective study of the effects of converting point cloud to meshes with different quality representations. In addition, we provide a novel in-session content rating methodology, providing a more accurate assessment as well as avoiding post-study bias. Our study shows that both compression level and observation distance have their influence on subjective perception. However, the degree of influence is heavily entangled with the content and geometry at hand. Furthermore, we also noticed that while end users are clearly aware of quality switches, the influence on their quality perception is limited. As a result, this has the potential to open up possibilities in bringing the adaptive video streaming paradigm to the 6DoF environment.",
