            "abstract": "Data sketching is a critical tool for distinct counting, enabling multisets to be represented by compact summaries that admit fast cardinality estimates. Because sketches may be merged to summarize multiset unions, they are a basic building block in data warehouses. Although many practical sketches for cardinality estimation exist, none provide privacy when merging. We propose the first practical cardinality sketches that are simultaneously mergeable, differentially private (DP), and have low empirical errors. These introduce a novel randomized algorithm for performing logical operations on noisy bits, a tight privacy analysis, and provably optimal estimation. Our sketches dramatically outperform existing theoretical solutions in simulations and on real-world data.",

            "title": "Perfect Spectral Clustering with Discrete Covariates",
            "abstract": "Among community detection methods, spectral clustering enjoys two desirable properties: computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of consistency. Most studies of spectral clustering consider only the edges of a network as input to the algorithm. Here we consider the problem of performing community detection in the presence of discrete node covariates, where network structure is determined by a combination of a latent block model structure and homophily on the observed covariates. We propose a spectral algorithm that we prove achieves perfect clustering with high probability on a class of large, sparse networks with discrete covariates, effectively separating latent network structure from homophily on observed covariates. To our knowledge, our method is the first to offer a guarantee of consistent latent structure recovery using spectral clustering in the setting where edge formation is dependent on both latent and observed factors.",

            "abstract": "The stochastic block model (SBM) and degree-corrected block model (DCBM) are network models often selected as the fundamental setting in which to analyze the theoretical properties of community detection methods. We consider the problem of spectral clustering of SBM and DCBM networks under a local form of edge differential privacy. Using a randomized response privacy mechanism called the edge-flip mechanism, we develop theoretical guarantees for differentially private community detection, demonstrating conditions under which this strong privacy guarantee can be upheld while achieving spectral clustering convergence rates that match the known rates without privacy. We prove the strongest theoretical results are achievable for dense networks (those with node degree linear in the number of nodes), while weak consistency is achievable under mild sparsity (node degree greater than n). We empirically demonstrate our results on a number of network examples.",
