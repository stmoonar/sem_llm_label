            "title": "Fake News Classification Using Tensor Decomposition and Graph Convolutional Network",
            "abstract": "With the widespread of fake news on social media, its impact has become a major concern of the public, so accurate detection methods are urgently needed. As content-based features are the most natural clues for fake news detection, many methods that rely solely on text content have been proposed. However, these methods rarely investigate the sentence interaction patterns of different news articles, and most of them do not consider fine-grained fake news classification. To overcome these issues, this article constructs a graph representation for news articles and employs a graph neural network (GNN) to classify fake news. The proposed method uses the local word co-occurrence information of sentences to obtain the interaction relationship between sentences, which is abstracted by the weight matrix of the graph representation. Accordingly, a third-order co-occurrence tensor is built, and the weight matrix is calculated based on the canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of this tensor. Since our method considers the sentence interaction patterns, the computed representations can capture more accurate contextual information of news articles. The results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods in both binary and multiclass classification tasks. In particular, for multiclass classification on the selected dataset with 70% of the training set for training, the improvements of accuracy and $F1$ -score are 1.82%p\u201316.98%p and 1.85%p\u201316.65%p, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Online social networks (OSNs) provide a platform for individuals to share information, exchange ideas and build social connections beyond in-person interactions. For a specific topic or community, opinion leaders are individuals who have a significant influence on others' opinions. Detecting and modeling opinion leaders is crucial as they play a vital role in shaping public opinion and driving online conversations. Existing research have extensively explored various methods for detecting opinion leaders, but there is a lack of consensus between definitions and methods. It is important to note that the term\"important node\"in graph theory does not necessarily align with the concept of\"opinion leader\"in social psychology. This paper aims to address this issue by introducing the methodologies for identifying influential nodes in OSNs and providing a corresponding definition of opinion leaders in relation to social psychology. The key novelty is to review connections and cross-compare different approaches that have origins in: graph theory, natural language processing, social psychology, control theory, and graph sampling. We discuss how they tell a different technical tale of influence and also propose how some of the approaches can be combined via networked dynamical systems modeling. A case study is performed on Twitter data to compare the performance of different methodologies discussed. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the progression of opinion leader detection on OSNs and inspire further research in understanding the dynamics of opinion evolution within the field.",

Our approach takes into account contact information in the design of the reward function, resulting in improved success rates, generalization for unseen objects, and task efficiency compared to policies that do not consider contact information. Through reinforcement learning using only one object in simulation, we obtain a learned policy for manipulating a single object, which demonstrates good generalization when applied to the task of pushing unseen objects. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Multi-types of user behavior data (e.g., clicking, adding to cart, and purchasing) are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios, which can help to learn users\u2019 multi-faceted preferences. However, it is challenging to explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas features\u201d and gradient conflict in multi-task learning when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d. In this paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d, we propose a Multi-Expert with Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for multi-task learning. Comprehensive experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CIGF.",

            "abstract": "Various types of user behaviors are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios. To fully utilize the multi-behavior information, the exploration of multiplex interaction among them is essential. Many multi-task learning based multi-behavior methods are proposed recently to use multiple types of supervision signals and perform information transfer among them. Despite the great successes, these methods fail to design prediction tasks comprehensively, leading to insufficient utilization of multi-behavior correlative information. Besides, these methods are either based on the weighting of expert information extracted from the coupled input or modeling of information transfer between multiple behavior levels through task-specific extractors, which are usually accompanied by negative transfer phenomenon1. To address the above problems, we propose a multi-behavior recommendation framework, called Hierarchical Projection Enhanced Multi-behavior Recommendation (HPMR). The key module, Projection-based Transfer Network (PTN), uses the projection mechanism to \"explicitly\" model the correlations of upstream and downstream behaviors, refines the upstream behavior representations, and fully uses the refined representations to enhance the learning of downstream tasks. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets and online A/B test further verify the effectiveness of HPMR in modeling the associations from upstream to downstream and alleviating the negative transfer.

However, the \u21121-norm is not rotation invariant, and utilizing original data containing noise as the dictionary leads to poor performance. This paper proposes a method named robust structured sparse subspace clustering with neighborhood preserving projection (RSSSC). Firstly, RSSSC replaces the \u21121 minimization program with a structured re-weighting sparse regularization term, effectively recovering the sparse representation. Secondly, RSSSC uses the extracted features as the dictionary in the self-representation problem to replace the original dataset containing noise and outliers, thus making the model more robust. By fully considering the low-dimensional manifold structure of samples in the original high-dimensional space, RSSSC preserves the neighborhood structure while learning the optimal projection. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on real-world image datasets.",

            "abstract": "Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and functional partial least squares (FPLS) are two mainstream functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which have been commonly used to extract deep information hidden in the original data space. However, the process data always contain random noise, which affects the performance of FDA models. To overcome this issue, two functional probabilistic latent variable models (FPLVMs), including functional probabilistic principal component analysis (FPPCA) and functional probabilistic partial least squares (FPPLS) are proposed in this work. First, the process data are converted into functional data using the FDA. Subsequently, a log-likelihood function considering the noise factor and functional latent variables is designed. Finally, the regression model parameters are estimated using an expectation\u2013maximisation algorithm. In contrast to FPPCA, FPPLS decomposes the process data and the key variable with constrained latent variables, which is similar to the partial least squares (PLS) and the principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the degeneration mechanism from FPLVMs into probabilistic latent variable models and latent variable models is discussed. An adaptive strategy with functional covariance is used to satisfy the online predictive capabilities of the model. Finally, the proposed approach is validated using a numerical case, the Tennessee Eastman process and an industrial o-xylene distillation column for evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, crucial in applications like recommender systems and online advertising, involves ranking items based on the likelihood of user clicks. User behavior sequence modeling has marked progress in CTR prediction, which extracts users' latent interests from their historical behavior sequences to facilitate accurate CTR prediction. Recent research explores using implicit feedback sequences, like unclicked records, to extract diverse user interests. However, these methods encounter key challenges: 1) temporal misalignment due to disparate sequence time ranges and 2) the lack of fine-grained interaction among feedback sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TEM4CTR, which ensures temporal alignment among sequences while leveraging auxiliary feedback information to enhance click behavior at the item level through a representation projection mechanism. Moreover, this projection-based information transfer module can effectively alleviate the negative impact of irrelevant or even potentially detrimental components of the auxiliary feedback information on the learning process of click behavior. Comprehensive experiments on public and industrial datasets confirm the superiority and effectiveness of TEM4CTR, showcasing the significance of temporal alignment in multi-feedback modeling.",

            "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model by exchanging parameters with each other while protecting privacy. Clients may be deployed in geo-distributed sites and communicate through varying significantly wide area networks (WANs). After the topology is constructed, the clients iteratively update the local model and exchange it with neighboring clients until the required accuracy is achieved. A more connected topology usually has fewer iterations but may suffer from a longer time per iteration. How to construct the topology with minimum total time by making a trade-off between the number of iterations and the time per iteration is a crucial issue to be studied. In this paper, we evaluate the number of iterations and the time per iteration of arbitrary topology and then propose a heuristic algorithm to construct the best one by evaluating a series of possible topologies. Our extensive experiments have shown that the other common topologies require 1.88 \u00d7 to 4.53 \u00d7 the total time to achieve the same accuracy compared to the topology obtained by our algorithm.",
