            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "We present a novel framework for uncertain data management. We start with a database whose tuple correctness is uncertain and an oracle that can resolve the uncertainty, i.e., decide if a tuple is correct or not. Such an oracle may correspond, e.g., to a data expert or to a crowdsourcing platform. We wish to use the oracle to clean the database with the goal of ensuring the correct answer for specific mission-critical queries. To avoid the prohibitive cost of cleaning the entire database and to minimize the expected number of calls to the oracle, we must carefully select tuples whose resolution would suffice to resolve the uncertainty in query results. In other words, we need a query-guided process for the resolution of uncertain data. We develop an end-to-end solution to this problem, based on the derivation of query answers and on correctness probabilities for the uncertain data. At a high level, we first track Boolean provenance to identify which input tuples contribute to the derivation of each output tuple, and in what ways. We then design an active learning solution for iteratively choosing tuples to resolve, based on the provenance structure and on an evolving estimation of tuple correctness probabilities. We conduct an extensive experimental study to validate our framework in different use cases.",

            "abstract": "Data scientists frequently examine the raw content of large tables when exploring an unknown dataset. In such cases, small subsets of the full tables (sub-tables) that accurately capture table contents are useful. We present a framework which, given a large data table T, creates a sub-table of small, fixed dimensions by selecting a subset of T\u2019s rows and projecting them over a subset of T\u2019s columns. The question is: Which rows and columns should be selected to yield an informative sub-table?Our first contribution is an informativeness metric for sub-tables with two complementary dimensions: cell coverage, which measures how well the sub-table captures prominent data patterns in T, and diversity. We use association rules as the patterns captured by sub-tables, and show that computing optimal sub-tables directly using this metric is infeasible. We then develop an efficient algorithm that indirectly accounts for association rules using table embedding. The resulting framework produces sub-tables for the full table as well as for the results of queries over the table, enabling the user to quickly understand results and determine subsequent queries. Experimental results show that high-quality sub-tables can be efficiently computed, and verify the soundness of our metrics as well as the usefulness of selected sub-tables through user studies.",

            "abstract": "In recent work, we have introduced a framework for fine-grained consent management in databases, which combines Boolean data provenance with the field of interactive Boolean evaluation. In turn, interactive Boolean evaluation aims at unveiling the underlying truth value of a Boolean expression by frugally probing the truth values of individual values. The required number of probes depends on the Boolean provenance structure and on the (a-priori unknown) probe answers. Prior work has analyzed and aimed to optimize the expected number of probes, where expectancy is with respect to a probability distribution over probe answers. This paper gives a novel worst-case analysis for the problem, inspired by the decision tree depth of Boolean functions. Specifically, we introduce a notion of evasive provenance expressions, namely expressions, where one may need to probe all variables in the worst case. We show that read-once expressions are evasive, and identify an additional class of expressions (acyclic monotone 2-DNF) for which evasiveness may be decided in PTIME. As for the more general question of finding the optimal strategy, we show that it is coNP-hard in general. We are still able to identify a sub-class of provenance expressions that is \"far from evasive\", namely, where an optimal worst-case strategy probes only O(log n) out of the n variables in the expression, and show that we can find this optimal strategy in polynomial time.",

            "title": "ActivePDB: Active Probabilistic Databases",
            "abstract": "We present a novel framework for uncertain data management, called ActivePDB. We are given a relational probabilistic database, where each tuple is correct with some probability; e.g., a database constructed from textual data using information extraction. We are now given a query and we want to determine the correctness of its results. Unlike probabilistic databases, we have an oracle that can resolve the uncertainty, such as a domain expert that can verify data against their sources. Since verification may be costly, our goal is to determine the correct output of the query, while asking the oracle to verify as few tuples as possible. ActivePDB provides an end-to-end solution to this problem. In a nutshell, we first track provenance to identify which input tuples contribute to the derivation of each output tuple, and in what ways. We then design an active learning solution to iteratively choose tuples to be verified based on the provenance structure and on an evolving estimation of the probability of the tuples correctness. We will demonstrate ActivePDB in the context of the NELL database of extracted facts, allowing participants to both pose queries and play the role of oracles.",

            "abstract": "Interactive summarization is a task that facilitates user-guided exploration of information within a document set. While one would like to employ state of the art neural models to improve the quality of interactive summarization, many such technologies cannot ingest the full document set or cannot operate at sufficient speed for interactivity. To that end, we propose two novel deep reinforcement learning models for the task that address, respectively, the subtask of summarizing salient information that adheres to user queries, and the subtask of listing suggested queries to assist users throughout their exploration. In particular, our models allow encoding the interactive session state and history to refrain from redundancy. Together, these models compose a state of the art solution that addresses all of the task requirements. We compare our solution to a recent interactive summarization system, and show through an experimental study involving real users that our models are able to improve informativeness while preserving positive user experience.",

The rows and columns are chosen as representatives of prominent data patterns within and across columns in the input table. SubTab can also be used for query results, enabling the user to quickly understand the results and determine subsequent queries.",

Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",
