            "abstract": "Aerospace manufacturing companies, such as Thales Alenia Space, design, develop, integrate, verify, and validate products characterized by high complexity and low volume. They carefully document all phases for each product but analyses across products are challenging due to the heterogeneity and unstructured nature of the data in documents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and validate data contained in these documents. We consider a case study focused on test data related to electronic boards for satellites. To do so, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. We store the metadata of the reports in a KG, while the actual test results are stored in parquet accessible via a Virtual Knowledge Graph. The validation process is managed using an LLM-based approach. We also conduct a benchmarking study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in executing this task. Finally, we analyze the costs and benefits of automating preexisting processes of manual data extraction and validation for subsequent cross-report analyses.",

            "abstract": "Recent innovations in Information Technology, Cloud Computing, Big Data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling technological solutions that were previously unimaginable, or usually available only for big IT companies, with impacts in both industry and services. The demonstrator named Smart Grid Semantic Platform (SGSP) has been created using these technologies integrating several aspects of the management of an electricity distribution network. The services deployed on the platform concern the visualization of the topographic data and electricity grid assets, as well as the processing and displaying of historical data related to the operation of the networks and/or the result of Big Data analysis. This paper demonstrates how useful the synergy is between the standard semantic model of the electric network (IEC CIM 61968) and the historical data of the time series of medium voltage electricity consumption analyzed using a Big Data platform. Specifically it illustrates the realization of a use case about the calculation of a load index of the electric lines.",

            "abstract": "In the Big Data context, data streaming systems have been introduced to tame velocity and enable reactive decision making. However, approaching such systems is still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., moving from scalable batch processing to continuous analysis and detection. Initially, modern big stream processing systems (e.g., Flink, Spark, Storm) have been lacking the support of declarative languages to express the streaming-based data processing tasks and have been mainly relying on providing low-level APIs for the end-users to implement their tasks. However, recently, this fact has been changing and most of them started to provide SQL-like languages for their end-users. In general, declarative Languages are playing a crucial role in fostering the adoption of Stream Processing. This tutorial focuses on introducing various approaches for declarative querying of the state-of-the-art big data streaming frameworks. In addition, we provide guidelines and practical examples on developing and deploying Stream Processing applications using a variety of SQL-like languages, such as Flink-SQL, KSQL and Spark Streaming SQL.",

            "abstract": "Distributed systems have become the preferred solution for dealing with Big Data analysis tasks. These systems are able to achieve superior performance by managing a large pool of resources as a single entity. However, in many contexts, performance is not the only metric to consider. When comparing two performance equivalent solutions, their cost becomes an important factor. Distributed systems are usually more expensive to deploy than traditional single-threaded applications. In this work, we build on these considerations by presenting an empirical study that compares the cost of two performance equivalent solutions for a real streaming data analysis task for the Telecommunication industry. The first solution is built on popular distributed processing engines (Apache Spark), while the second solution is a single-threaded application built on an home-brew stream processing framework (Natron). We show that, in the case of continuous analysis, the benefits of distributed processing are outvalued by the distributed data ingestion costs. This is also the case for periodic analysis. However, if data ingestion costs are fixed and small, we show that the most cost-effective solution depends on the dataset size.",

In the state-of-the-art, this problem is addressed through ad-hoc solutions that fit only a specific scenario.

They fostered the research in RDF Stream Processing (RSP). However, they do not stress much the reasoning task. Indeed, they are limited to RDFS. At the same time, the existing OWL benchmarks do not consider streaming tasks. There is a need to define, design and evaluate a domain-specific benchmark for stream reasoners that go beyond RDFS, namely Expressive Stream Reasoners (ESR). In this paper, we address this need, and we present LASS 1.0, a first attempt to realize a benchmark for ESR. LASS 1.0 comprises an ontology that models influence in social media, a set of reasoning tasks to stress ESR and an instance generation algorithm that creates streaming and static workloads.",
