            "title": "Reasoning about Smart Contracts via LTL Encoding",
            "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute on blockchains when some conditions are verified. They encode the legally relevant events needed to satisfy the terms of an agreement and are usually defined by using procedural languages, even if some recent proposals investigated the possibility of using logic formalisms. However, existing logic-based initiatives are rather limited since they only enable the formal checking of properties of a single smart contract, totally neglecting its possible interactions with other smart contracts running on the same blockchain. This paper proposes a framework, called SCRea, that works on a set of smart contracts specified as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. SCRea enables to reason about smart contracts considered individually or by considering them as running cooperatively or competitively on the same blockchain.",

            "title": "LiSE: A Personal Booklet for Health Care Annotation",
            "abstract": "Citizens empowerment in managing their own health process leads to increased demand in ICT services. The use of data management and communication techniques to manage information in health systems can provide benefits. Health information systems contain information to ease care access, reduce costs and make health care more efficient. In this context, we focus on the development of a framework to allow citizens in managing and sharing health related data with clinicians and with family doctors. In fact, citizens can play a crucial role in their own health care. Electronic Clinical Records (ECR) contain all information regarding their own clinical related data which can hence be made available for sharing and management. This work presents LiSE (for Libretto Sanitario Elettronico, health personalized booklet), a system implemented for the Smart Health 2.0 Project, as an instrument of citizen/patient empowerment for managing his own care process and for communicating information with family doctors. LiSE is a health information system for clinical data information management, annotated by citizens, overcoming the lack of communication protocols in the other systems currently in use. We report the LiSE structure, we sketch the practical clinical applications and we report user experiences.",
