            "abstract": "Personal data are considered the core of digital services. Data Privacy is the main concern in the currently adopted \u201corganization-centric\u201d approaches for personal data management: this affects the potential benefits arising from a smarter and more valuable use of personal data. We introduce a \u201cuser-centric\u201d model for personal data management, where individuals have control over the entire personal data lifecycle from acquisition to storage, from processing to sharing. In particular, the paper analyses the features of a personal data store and discusses how its adoption enables new application scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The authors' CitySensing system captures at places social media streams and anonymous Call Data Records (CDR) during city-scale events. It semantically annotates the social media streams before fusing it with privacy-preserving aggregates of CDR. The result is analysed and repurposed to feed a public installation where visual story telling assumes a leading role in allowing the audience to perceive emerging patterns and to observe their dynamics. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the visualization on the real-world data of two editions of Milan Design Week. This article is part of a special issue on social multimedia and storytelling.",

The lab is located in Trento which hosts one of the 6 Information and Communication Technologies Lab of the EIT and two reference research groups: University of Trento and the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) center. The aim of the lab is to exploit the potential of big data and open data by creating a platform to share data among academia, industrial and institutional partners. It is our belief that such raw data gives a new image of the territory/community from which the data was collected and by analyzing it new trends, enriched information can be extracted. The results of the analysis can turn into revenue and profit not only for the companies but also for the communities.",

This enables a novel human-driven approach for service creation in a variety of domains (e.g., healthcare, transportation, etc.) Telecom operators own and manage billions of mobile network events (Call Detailed Records - CDRs) per day: interpreting such a big stream of data needs a deep understanding of the events' context through the available background knowledge. We introduce an ontological and stochastic model (HRBModel) to interpret mobile human behavior using merged mobile network data and the geo-referenced background knowledge (e.g., OpenStreetMap, etc.) The model characterizes locations with human activities that can happen (with a given likelihood) there. This allows us to predicatively compile sets of tasks that people are likely to engage in under certain contextual conditions or to characterize exceptional events detected from anomalies in the CDR. An experimental evaluation of the approach is presented.",

            "abstract": "This article introduces a framework for creating rich augmented environments based on a social web of intelligent things and people. We target outdoor environments, aiming to transform a region into a smart environment that can share its cultural heritage with people, promoting itself and its special qualities. Using the applications developed in the framework, people can interact with things, listen to the stories that these things tell them, and make their own contributions. The things are intelligent in the sense that they aggregate information provided by users and behave in a socially active way. They can autonomously establish social relationships on the basis of their properties and their interaction with users. Hence when a user gets in touch with a thing, she is also introduced to its social network consisting of other things and of users; she can navigate this network to discover and explore the world around the thing itself. Thus the system supports serendipitous navigation in a network of things and people that evolves according to the behavior of users. An innovative interaction model was defined that allows users to interact with objects in a natural, playful way using smartphones without the need for a specially created infrastructure.\n The framework was instantiated into a suite of applications called WantEat, in which objects from the domain of tourism and gastronomy (such as cheese wheels or bottles of wine) are taken as testimonials of the cultural roots of a region. WantEat includes an application that allows the definition and registration of things, a mobile application that allows users to interact with things, and an application that supports stakeholders in getting feedback about the things that they have registered in the system. WantEat was developed and tested in a real-world context which involved a region and gastronomy-related items from it (such as products, shops, restaurants, and recipes), through an early evaluation with stakeholders and a final evaluation with hundreds of users.",

Objects are smart in the sense that they share knowledge with users, interact with them in a personalized way and maintain social relationships with users and other objects. When interacting with an object, a user can share information with it and is also introduced to the social network of its friends; the user can explore this network to discover new interesting information, services, objects, people.

In the paper we (i) present the framework and applications we developed, (ii) discuss the peculiar mix of AI technologies we exploited to create social intelligence and embed it into everyday objects, (iii) discuss the innovative interaction approach we developed aiming at natural interaction with no infra-structuring and (iv) report on the field trial we performed using the suite of applications we developed.",
