            "title": "A Deep Neural Network Approach for Customized Prediction of Mobile Devices Discharging Time",
            "abstract": "The role of mobile devices, like smartphones or tablets, is becoming more and more important in everyday life, at the point that their unavailability due to early or unexpected battery discharge is perceived as a serious issue. Therefore, there is an urge for smart and efficient battery management algorithms that can prolong the duration of the battery charge. To this end, a reliable prediction of the battery discharging process would represent a precious tool to enable energy-efficiency optimization mechanisms. In this paper, we address this challenge by considering different machine learning techniques to provide an accurate and user-dependent prediction of the discharging time of a mobile device and, eventually, we propose a Deep Neural Network model that provides the best performance. Unlike previous solutions proposed in the literature, our method exploits space-time data from the device operating system (Android) to learn the specific battery usage pattern of the user, thus offering a customized prediction of the discharge process. We show that such model outperforms the other machine-learning methods considered in this study, and achieves much better performance than the deterministic linear fitting methods widely used in commercial devices.",

            "title": "Dynamic Allocation of Crowd Contributions for Sentiment Analysis during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election",
            "abstract": "Opinions about the 2016 U.S. Presidential Candidates have been expressed in millions of tweets that are challenging to analyze automatically. Crowdsourcing the analysis of political tweets effectively is also difficult, due to large inter-rater disagreements when sarcasm is involved. Each tweet is typically analyzed by a fixed number of workers and majority voting. We here propose a crowdsourcing framework that instead uses a dynamic allocation of the number of workers. We explore two dynamic-allocation methods: (1) The number of workers queried to label a tweet is computed offline based on the predicted difficulty of discerning the sentiment of a particular tweet. (2) The number of crowd workers is determined online, during an iterative crowd sourcing process, based on inter-rater agreements between labels.We applied our approach to 1,000 twitter messages about the four U.S. presidential candidates Clinton, Cruz, Sanders, and Trump, collected during February 2016. We implemented the two proposed methods using decision trees that allocate more crowd efforts to tweets predicted to be sarcastic. We show that our framework outperforms the traditional static allocation scheme. It collects opinion labels from the crowd at a much lower cost while maintaining labeling accuracy.",
