            "title": "PAPS: Progressive Attention-Based Pan-sharpening",
            "abstract": "Pan-sharpening aims to seek high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) images from paired multispectral images of low resolution (LRMS) and panchromatic (PAN) images, the key to which is how to maximally integrate spatial and spectral information from PAN and LRMS images. Following the principle of gradual advance, this paper designs a novel network that contains two main logical functions, i.e., detail enhancement and progressive fusion, to solve the problem. More specifically, the detail enhancement module attempts to produce enhanced MS results with the same spatial sizes as corresponding PAN images, which are of higher quality than directly up-sampling LRMS images. Having a better MS base (enhanced MS) and its PAN, we progressively extract information from the PAN and enhanced MS images, expecting to capture pivotal and complementary information of the two modalities for the purpose of constructing the desired HRMS. Extensive experiments together with ablation studies on widely-used datasets are provided to verify the efficacy of our design, and demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

            "abstract": "The reflection superposition phenomenon is complex and widely distributed in the real world, which derives various simplified linear and nonlinear formulations of the problem. In this paper, based on the investigation of the weaknesses of existing models, we propose a more general form of the superposition model by introducing a learnable residue term, which can effectively capture residual information during decomposition, guiding the separated layers to be complete. In order to fully capitalize on its advantages, we further design the network structure elaborately, including a novel dual-stream interaction mechanism and a powerful decomposition network with a semantic pyramid encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to verify our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

            "title": "Trash or Treasure? An Interactive Dual-Stream Strategy for Single Image Reflection Separation",
            "abstract": "Single image reflection separation (SIRS), as a representative blind source separation task, aims to recover two layers, $\\textit{i.e.}$, transmission and reflection, from one mixed observation, which is challenging due to the highly ill-posed nature. Existing deep learning based solutions typically restore the target layers individually, or with some concerns at the end of the output, barely taking into account the interaction across the two streams/branches. In order to utilize information more efficiently, this work presents a general yet simple interactive strategy, namely $\\textit{your trash is my treasure}$ (YTMT), for constructing dual-stream decomposition networks. To be specific, we explicitly enforce the two streams to communicate with each other block-wisely. Inspired by the additive property between the two components, the interactive path can be easily built via transferring, instead of discarding, deactivated information by the ReLU rectifier from one stream to the other. Both ablation studies and experimental results on widely-used SIRS datasets are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of YTMT, and reveal its superiority over other state-of-the-art alternatives. The implementation is quite simple and our code is publicly available at $\\href{https://github.com/mingcv/YTMT-Strategy}{\\textit{https://github.com/mingcv/YTMT-Strategy}}$.",

            "title": "Modeling and Performance Analysis in Cache-enabled Millimeter Wave HetNets with Access and Backhaul Integration",
            "abstract": "Recently, a mmWave-based access and backhaul integration HetNetsarchitecture (mABHetNets) has been envisioned to provide the high link capacity in both access and backhaul links. In mABHetNets, the access link and the backhaul link will share the same mm-wave spectral resources to serve cellular users as well as to maintain the backhaul capacity of the SBSs. However, a large spectrum bandwidth are occupied by the backhaul link to maintain the backhaul link capacity. Up to 50\\% mmWave spectrum resource will be used in backhaul link to satisfy the high speed data traffic. Such \"\\emph{spectrum occupation}\" of backhaul link has restricted network performance to achieve a better possible improvement. To overcome spectrum occupation problem in the existing mABHetNets, involving caches in the mABHetNets brings a opportunity. When the backhaul traffic is offloaded by caching popular fils in the SBSs and the corresponding mmWave spectrum can be transfered to the access link by the bandwidth partition. Then with more spectrum for access link, both the network throughout and the coverage ability are increased significantly. However, the caching power consumption will be increased and the EE will be decreased. Therefore, we analyze the througput and EE in mABHetNets by stochastic geometry tool. Extensive numerical and simulations results are carried out to validate our work.",
