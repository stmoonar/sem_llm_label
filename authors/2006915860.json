            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "One of the main concerns of agricultural financing institutions is to make sure the loans they grant are used for the stated objective when the loan was requested. Specifically, when Banco Agrario de Colombia grants loans for crop farmers, it schedules verification visits to the cultivation sites to check if the crop stipulated in the loan agreement exists and assess its health. These visits are challenging to make due to the number of visits over vast areas that they need to schedule, lack of trained personnel, and difficulty of access. This article proposes a software tool, based on a machine learning model for processing free satellite imagery, to support the bank\u2019s identification of non-compliant crops with the investment plan before making field visits, minimizing the loss of investment by focusing on those areas to prioritize the visits. Sugarcane along the department of Boyac\u00e1, Colombia was chosen as the case of study. Free access satellite imagery through the Colombian Data Cube (CDCol) was used and machine learning models were applied on them to classify the land and predict the presence of the crop, a Random Forest model achieved an overall F1-score of 91% using Landsat-8 imagery and a K-nearest Neighbors model achieved an overall F1-score of 98% using Sentinel-2 imagery.",

            "abstract": "Since simulation became the third pillar of scientific research, several forms of computers have become available to drive computer aided simulations, and nowadays, clusters are the most popular type of computers supporting these tasks. For instance, cluster settings, such as the so-called supercomputers, cluster of workstations (COW), cluster of desktops (COD), and cluster of virtual machines (COV) have been considered in literature to embrace a variety of scientific applications. However, those scientific applications categorized as high-performance computing (HPC) are conceptually restricted to be addressed only by supercomputers. In this aspect, we introduce the notions of cluster overhead and cluster coupling to assess the capacity of non-HPC systems to handle HPC applications. We also compare the cluster overhead with an existing measure of overhead in computing systems, the total parallel overhead, to explain the correctness of our methodology. The evaluation of capacity considers the seven dwarfs of scientific computing, which are well-known, scientific computing building blocks considered in the development of HPC applications. The evaluation of these building blocks provides insights regarding the strengths and weaknesses of non-HPC systems to deal with future HPC applications developed with one or a combination of these algorithmic building blocks.",

            "abstract": "Cities are growing rapidly in terms of population, land use and transport services. New housing developments and transport infrastructure are key triggers for the process of change. As cities grow from new infrastructure and land-cover changes, the need to coordinate these changes with the government land-use and transport policies also increases. Urban planners use Land-use transportation interaction models to coordinate the cities' development with the land-use and transport policies in order to diagnose the impact of these policies in the development of cities. This paper proposes the Bogot\u00e1 Urban Simulator (BUS), which was developed to assist the policy assessment process in urban planning for the city of Bogot\u00e1. The proposed simulator comprises a web application for the publication and execution of urban models, a distributed processing system and an interactive visual analytic environment for the exploration of policies. The architectural decisions considered in the development of the simulator are described; in addition, a performance evaluation of the resulting service oriented simulator is conducted.",
