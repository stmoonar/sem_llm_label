            "title": "Prioritizing Potential Wetland Areas via Region-to-Region Knowledge Transfer and Adaptive Propagation",
            "abstract": "Wetlands are important to communities, offering benefits ranging from water purification, and flood protection to recreation and tourism. Therefore, identifying and prioritizing potential wetland areas is a critical decision problem. While data-driven solutions are feasible, this is complicated by significant data sparsity due to the low proportion of wetlands (3-6\\%) in many areas of interest in the southwestern US. This makes it hard to develop data-driven models that can help guide the identification of additional wetland areas. To solve this limitation, we propose two strategies: (1) The first of these is knowledge transfer from regions with rich wetlands (such as the Eastern US) to sparser regions (such as the Southwestern area with few wetlands). Recognizing that these regions are likely to be very different from each other in terms of soil characteristics, population distribution, and land use, we propose a domain disentanglement strategy that identifies and transfers only the applicable aspects of the learned model. (2) We complement this with a spatial data enrichment strategy that relies on an adaptive propagation mechanism. This mechanism differentiates between node pairs that have positive and negative impacts on each other for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To summarize, given two spatial cells belonging to different regions, we identify domain-specific and domain-shareable features, and, for each region, we rely on adaptive propagation to enrich features with the features of surrounding cells. We conduct rigorous experiments to substantiate our proposed method's effectiveness, robustness, and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates that each module is essential in prioritizing potential wetlands, which justifies our assumption.",

            "abstract": "In many fields of computer science, tensor decomposition techniques are increasingly being adopted as the core of many applications that rely on multi-dimensional datasets for implementing knowledge discovery tasks. Unfortunately, a major shortcoming of state-of-the-art tensor analyses is that, despite their effectiveness when the data is certain, these operations become difficult to apply, or altogether inapplicable, in the presence of uncertainty in the data, a circumstance common to many real-world scenarios. In this paper we propose a way to address this issue by extending the known Tensor-Train technique for tensor factorization in order to deal with uncertain data, here modeled as intervals. Working with interval-valued data, however, presents numerous challenges, since many algebraic operations that form the building blocks of the factorization process, as well as the properties that make these procedures useful for knowledge discovery, cannot be easily extended from their scalar counterparts, and often require some approximation (including, though it is not only the case, for keeping computational costs manageable). These challenges notwithstanding, our proposed techniques proved to be reasonably effective, and are supported by a thorough experimental validation.",

            "title": "Causal Disentanglement for Implicit Recommendations with Network Information",
            "abstract": "Online user engagement is highly influenced by various machine learning models, such as recommender systems. These systems recommend new items to the user based on the user\u2019s historical interactions. Implicit recommender systems reflect a binary setting showing whether a user interacted (e.g., clicked on) with an item or not. However, the observed clicks may be due to various causes such as user\u2019s interest, item\u2019s popularity, and social influence factors. Traditional recommender systems consider these causes under a unified representation, which may lead to the emergence and amplification of various biases in recommendations. However, recent work indicates that by disentangling the unified representations, one can mitigate bias (e.g., popularity bias) in recommender systems and help improve recommendation performance. Yet, prior work in causal disentanglement in recommendations does not consider a crucial factor, that is, social influence. Social theories such as homophily and social influence provide evidence that a user\u2019s decision can be highly influenced by the user\u2019s social relations. Thus, accounting for the social relations while disentangling leads to less biased recommendations. To this end, we identify three separate causes behind an effect (e.g., clicks): (a) user\u2019s interest, (b) item\u2019s popularity, and (c) user\u2019s social influence. Our approach seeks to causally disentangle the user and item latent features to mitigate popularity bias in implicit feedback\u2013based social recommender systems. To achieve this goal, we draw from causal inference theories and social network theories and propose a causality-aware disentanglement method that leverages both the user\u2013item interaction network and auxiliary social network information. Experiments on real-world datasets against various state-of-the-art baselines validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for mitigating popularity bias and generating de-biased recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Storing tabular data to balance storage and query efficiency is a long-standing research question in the database community. In this work, we argue and show that a novel DeepMapping abstraction, which relies on the impressive memorization capabilities of deep neural networks, can provide better storage cost, better latency, and better run-time memory footprint, all at the same time. Such unique properties may benefit a broad class of use cases in capacity-limited devices. Our proposed DeepMapping abstraction transforms a dataset into multiple key-value mappings and constructs a multi-tasking neural network model that outputs the corresponding values for a given input key. To deal with memorization errors, DeepMapping couples the learned neural network with a lightweight auxiliary data structure capable of correcting mistakes. The auxiliary structure design further enables DeepMapping to efficiently deal with insertions, deletions, and updates even without retraining the mapping. We propose a multi-task search strategy for selecting the hybrid DeepMapping structures (including model architecture and auxiliary structure) with a desirable trade-off among memorization capacity, size, and efficiency. Extensive experiments with a real-world dataset, synthetic and benchmark datasets, including TPC-H and TPC-DS, demonstrated that the DeepMapping approach can better balance the retrieving speed and compression ratio against several cutting-edge competitors.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to recommend new items to users by learning user and item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with the user's interests). Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous to the treatment and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand, since these confounders affect both the exposure and the ratings, it is essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information (i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity, aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network information is also captured in our method with the aid of \\textit{causal disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the exposure of an item to the user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for debiasing recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Causal learning has become an essential attribute in majority of the machine learning models. One of the widely studied fields in causal learning is causal discovery which aims to identify potential cause-effect relationships from observational data. Temporal causal discovery models are specifically curated to enforece the temporal constraints while discovering the causal relationships. However, in physical systems such as hydrological systems, there are additional constraints such as spatial constraints that play a crucial role in deciding whether a node is a causal parent for another node or not. Failing to enforce these additional constraints may mislead the model to classify an irrelevant relationship as a causal relationship. Furthermore, causal discovery models are evaluated against a ground truth causal graph. However, the hydrological systems contain a huge number of features making it challenging to obtain a ground-truth causal graph. To deal with the aforementioned problems, in this study we propose a new Spatio-Temporal Causal Discovery Framework named, STCD. By enforcing temporal and spatial constraints STCD aims at identifying meaningful causal relationships. Furthermore, to evaluate the causal relations inferred by STCD in the absence of the ground-truth causal graph, we utilize only the causal parents of a target variable for prediction across different years. We demonstrate that utilizing only the causal features identified by STCD to predict the flow-rate for a target location attains superior performance.",

            "abstract": "The 15th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2022) was successfully held on 2/21 - 2/25/2022 online. It was originally planned to be held in Tempe, Arizona and changed to a virtual format due to the surge of Omicron. It was a five-day event with the middle 3 days dedicated to keynote speeches, single-session presentations, poster sessions, and sponsor talks. This brief report provides an overview of WSDM 2022 with organization and program details and statistics from Conference Chairs and Program Committee Chairs, as well as a message from the WSDM Steering Committee Chair to call for future WSDM conferences in the US (2024) and Europe (2025). Further details can be found at https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2022/. At the end of this report, we express our deep gratitude to authors, volunteers, special interest groups (SIGs), steering committee, and sponsors.",
