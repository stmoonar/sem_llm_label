            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the multi-resource allocation problem, a unique feature of which is that the multiple resources can compensate each other while achieving the desired system performance. In particular, power and time allocations are jointly optimized with the target of energy efficiency under the resource-limited constraints. Different from previous studies on the power-time tradeoff, we consider a multi-server case where the concurrent serving users are quantitatively restricted. Therefore user selection is investigated accompanying the resource allocation, making the power-time tradeoff occur not only between the users in the same server but also in different servers. The complex multivariate optimization problem can be modeled as a variant of 2-Dimension Bin Packing Problem (V2D-BPP), which is a joint non-linear and integer programming problem. Though we use state decomposition model to transform it into a convex optimization problem, the variables are still coupled. Therefore, we propose an Iterative Dual Optimization (IDO) algorithm to obtain its optimal solution. Simulations show that the joint multi-resource allocation algorithm outperforms two existing non-joint algorithms from the perspective of energy efficiency.",

In this paper, we analyse the outage probability of satellite M2M communication system using amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying schemes. Both the channel feedback delay and multiple interferers at the relay and destination are taken into consideration. The channels of the two hops are modeled as Rayleigh and Rician, respectively. The closed-form outage probability expressions for both AF fixed-gain and DF relaying system are obtained, and the validness of our analytical results are verified by the Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the channel delay affects the outage probability performance more significantly compared with the interferences. It is also worthy to note that the DF relaying system provides better performance than AF fixed-gain relaying system, especially when the feedback delay is short. Moreover, it can be found that the performance gaps of the two relaying schemes become trivial as the feedback delay increases.",

Considering that the inserted pilot tones are decayed by data subcarriers in the presence of multiple CFOs, a novel recursive residual CFO tracking (R-RCFOTr) algorithm is proposed. This method first removes CFO-induced inter-carrier interference from data subcarriers, and then updates the residual CFO (RCFO) estimation of each OFDM block recursively. When used in conjunction with a multiple CFOs estimator, the proposed R-RCFOTr can effectively mitigate the impacts from the multiple RCFOs with affordable complexity. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed R-RCFOTr algorithm, which has performance close to that of perfect CFO estimation at moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio, and significantly outperforms conventional CFO tracking algorithm for large CFOs.",

Although the optimization problem is neither convex nor concave, we show that the global optimal solution can be obtained by the branch-and-bound algorithm. To address the computational complexity concern, we also propose a low-complexity suboptimal solution which is obtained by optimizing a cost function over one real variable only.

Both frequency-domain (FD) BF and time-domain (TD) BF are investigated. The later requires less feedback from the destination to perform BF. The BF vectors are designed by maximizing the minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers at the destination, first under the total power constraint (TPC) and then under the per-relay power constraint (PPC). We show that both TPC and PPC BF designs lead to a quasi-convex optimization problem, which can be solved by bisection search method efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that based on max-min SNR criterion, the performance of TD-BF rapidly approaches that of FD-BF when increasing the filter length. Moreover, it is found that for TD-BF, the minimum filter length required to achieve optimum performance under PPC is longer than that under TPC.",

To combat the inter-symbol interference from multi-path fading and timing errors, the cyclic prefix (CP) is used at both the source node and relay nodes. Unlike [7] using IDFT and DFT modulation for two consecutive OFDM blocks respectively, all data blocks are modulated by IDFT at the source node and demodulated by DFT at the destination node in the proposed scheme. A subcarrier basis symbol-by-symbol ML decoding can be employed by exploiting the Alamouti code structure of two consecutive OFDM blocks at the destination node. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve diversity order 2 over frequency-selective channels in the presence of asynchronism between nodes. Moreover, we prove that the proposed scheme over frequency selective fading channel has the identical BER performance with the case of flat fading. Extension to more relay nodes is straightforward and the proposed scheme can achieve diversity order equal to the number of relay nodes.",

Timing offsets are estimated using correlation-type algorithms. By inserting some null subcarriers in the proposed tile structure, we propose a computationally efficient subspace decomposition-based algorithm for CFO estimation. The issue of optimal tile length is studied both theoretically and through simulations.
