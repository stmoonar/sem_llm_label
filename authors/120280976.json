            "title": "A Counterfactual Collaborative Session-based Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Most session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) focus on extracting information from the observed items in the current session of a user to predict a next item, ignoring the causes outside the session (called outer-session causes, OSCs) that influence the user\u2019s selection of items. However, these causes widely exist in the real world, and few studies have investigated their role in SBRSs. In this work, we analyze the causalities and correlations of the OSCs in SBRSs from the perspective of causal inference. We find that the OSCs are essentially the confounders in SBRSs, which leads to spurious correlations in the data used to train SBRS models. To address this problem, we propose a novel SBRS framework named COCO-SBRS (COunterfactual COllaborative Session-Based Recommender Systems) to learn the causality between OSCs and user-item interactions in SBRSs. COCO-SBRS first adopts a self-supervised approach to pre-train a recommendation model by designing pseudo-labels of causes for each user\u2019s selection of the item in data to guide the training process. Next, COCO-SBRS adopts counterfactual inference to recommend items based on the outputs of the pre-trained recommendation model considering the causalities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. As a result, COCO-SBRS can learn the causalities in data, preventing the model from learning spurious correlations. The experimental results of our extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over ten representative SBRSs.",

            "abstract": "Contextual bandit algorithms are commonly used in digital health to recommend personalized treatments. However, to ensure the effectiveness of the treatments, patients are often requested to take actions that have no immediate benefit to them, which we refer to as pro-treatment actions. In practice, clinicians have a limited budget to encourage patients to take these actions and collect additional information. We introduce a novel optimization and learning algorithm to address this problem. This algorithm effectively combines the strengths of two algorithmic approaches in a seamless manner, including 1) an online primal-dual algorithm for deciding the optimal timing to reach out to patients, and 2) a contextual bandit learning algorithm to deliver personalized treatment to the patient. We prove that this algorithm admits a sub-linear regret bound. We illustrate the usefulness of this algorithm on both synthetic and real-world data.",

            "abstract": "In the actual production process, time-varying and nonlinear problems are numerous important problems to be considered, in view of these problems, a process monitoring approach based on locally weighted probabilistic kernel principal component analysis (LWPKPCA) is proposed. First, the method selects the normal process data with a high similarity to the test samples as training data of the local model, and continuously updates the local model according to the test samples to build an accurate time-varying model. Second, by weighting the data of different importance, the role of data similar to test samples in the modeling process is strengthened. Third, the LWPKPCA model is applied to process monitoring, the monitoring indicators are established in a high-dimensional space and used to detect faults. Finally, on the basis of LWPKPCA, the penicillin fermentation process (PFP) is taken to evaluate the monitoring performance of the proposed methods. According to the comparison of the experiment results, the detection rate and accuracy rate of the LWPKPCA method is considerably better than those of probabilistic principal component analysis and probabilistic kernel principal component analysis methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for processing time-varying data with nonlinear characteristics, and the LWPKPCA process monitoring method is effective for improving the performance of fault detection.",

Specifically, we illustrate how to produce a photo-taking robot with an exceptional level of semantic awareness by leveraging recent advances in general purpose language (LM) and vision-language (VLM) models. Given a high-level description of an event we use an LM to generate a natural-language list of photo descriptions that one would expect a photographer to capture at the event. We then use a VLM to identify the best matches to these descriptions in the robot's video stream. The photo portfolios generated by our method are consistently rated as more appropriate to the event by human evaluators than those generated by existing methods.",

            "abstract": "Autonomous individuals establish a structural complex system through pairwise connections and interactions. Notably, the evolution reflects the dynamic nature of each complex system since it recodes a series of temporal changes from the past, the present into the future. Different systems follow distinct evolutionary trajectories, which can serve as distinguishing traits for system classification. However, modeling a complex system's evolution is challenging for the graph model because the graph is typically a snapshot of the static status of a system, and thereby hard to manifest the long-term evolutionary traits of a system entirely. To address this challenge, we suggest utilizing a heat-driven method to generate temporal graph augmentation. This approach incorporates the physics-based heat kernel and DropNode technique to transform each static graph into a sequence of temporal ones. This approach effectively describes the evolutional behaviours of the system, including the retention or disappearance of elements at each time point based on the distributed heat on each node. Additionally, we propose a dynamic time-wrapping distance GDTW to quantitatively measure the distance between pairwise evolutionary systems through optimal matching. The resulting approach, called the Evolution Kernel method, has been successfully applied to classification problems in real-world structural graph datasets. The results yield significant improvements in supervised classification accuracy over a series of baseline methods.",

Computation operations play an important role in transaction processing systems. However, conventional QoS-based mechanisms become inefficient due to the limited concurrent support upon computation operations, thus causing high time consumption in the critical path of concurrency control. In order to efficiently offer concurrent computations, we propose CATS, a Computation Aware Transaction processing System, to mitigate performance impacts caused by computation operations. CATS further leverages program semantics to defer the execution of transaction operations in the commit phase to alleviate unnecessary conflicts caused by computations. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that CATS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art designs, including 2PL and OCC based transaction processing systems on high-contended and computation-intensive workloads.

            "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised learning model on the whole slide image (WSI) for AI-assisted pathology diagnosis. The recent advance in attention-based MIL allows the model to find its region-of-interest (ROI) for interpretation by learning the attention weights for image patches of WSI slides. However, we empirically find that the interpretability of some related methods is either untrustworthy as the principle of MIL is violated or unsatisfactory as the high-attention regions are not consistent with experts\u2019 annotations. In this paper, we propose Bayes-MIL to address the problem from a probabilistic perspective. The induced patch-level uncertainty is proposed as a new measure of MIL interpretability, which outperforms previous methods in matching doctors annotations. We design a slide-dependent patch regularizer (SDPR) for the attention, imposing constraints derived from the MIL assumption, on the attention distribution. SDPR explicitly constrains the model to generate correct attention values. The spatial information is further encoded by an approximate convolutional conditional random field (CRF), for better interpretability. Experimental results show Bayes-MIL outperforms the related methods in patch-level and slide-level metrics and provides much better interpretable ROI on several large-scale WSI datasets.",

            "title": "Multiobjective Optimization Scheduling of Sequential Charging Software for Networked Electric Vehicles",
            "abstract": "In order to reduce the adverse effects of disordered charging of electric vehicles on the safe and stable operation of the distribution network, a multiobjective optimal scheduling method for the sequential charging software of networked electric vehicles is proposed. Aimed at minimizing charging costs and peak-to-valley differences in distribution network loads, its scheduling strategy will continuously roll and update EV charging schemes over time. The results show that the actual response data collected by the Internet of Vehicles app has corrected the probability distribution of the user\u2019s choice of charging mode and response behavior. On the fifth day, the user\u2019s actual charging response curve is close to the theoretical curve obtained by the optimization algorithm, and the expected charging is basically achieved. Calculations showed that the variance of the total load curve after charging decreased by 24.8 from 169.35 to 127.39. The proposed orderly charging strategy can effectively reduce the charging cost of electric vehicle users and the peak-to-valley difference of the distribution network load, play a good role in peak-valley filling, improve the convergence accuracy of the algorithm, and obtain the optimal solution of the problem.",

            "abstract": "Graph embedding provides a feasible methodology to conduct pattern classification for graph-structured data by mapping each data into the vectorial space. Various pioneering works are essentially coding method that concentrates on a vectorial representation about the inner properties of a graph in terms of the topological constitution, node attributions, link relations, etc. However, the classification for each targeted data is a qualitative issue based on understanding the overall discrepancies within the dataset scale. From the statistical point of view, these discrepancies manifest a metric distribution over the dataset scale if the distance metric is adopted to measure the pairwise similarity or dissimilarity. Therefore, we present a novel embedding strategy named <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {MetricDistribution2vec}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"bold\">MetricDistribution</mml:mi><mml:mn mathvariant=\"bold\">2</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant=\"bold\">vec</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wei-ieq1-3366589.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to extract such distribution characteristics into the vectorial representation for each data. We demonstrate the application and effectiveness of our representation method in the supervised prediction tasks on extensive real-world structural graph datasets. The results have gained some unexpected increases compared with a surge of baselines on all the datasets, even if we take the lightweight models as classifiers. Moreover, the proposed method also conducts investigations in Few-Shot classification scenarios, and the results still show attractive discrimination in rare training samples based inference.",
