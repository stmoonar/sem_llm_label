            "abstract": "htmlabstract Igor, your personal IoT butler \nIgor is named after the Discworld characters of the same name. You should think of it as a butler (or valet, or majordomo, whatever the difference is) that knows everything that goes on in your household, and makes sure everything runs smoothly. It performs its tasks without passing judgements and maintains complete discretion, even within the household. It can work together with other Igors (lending a hand) and with lesser servants such as Iotsa-based devices. \nIgor includes a Certificate Authority implementation that allows you to use secure communication over https on the local network (for Igor and for other applications like web browsers). Igor also includes a privacy and security mechanism based on capabilities to allow fine-grained control over data access.",
