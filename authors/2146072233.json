            "title": "Efficient Non-Learning Similar Subtrajectory Search",
            "abstract": "\n Similar subtrajectory search is a finer-grained operator that can better capture the similarities between one query trajectory and a portion of a data trajectory than the traditional similar trajectory search, which requires that the two checking trajectories are similar in their entirety. Many real applications (e.g., trajectory clustering and trajectory join) utilize similar subtrajectory search as a basic operator. It is considered that the time complexity is\n O\n (\n mn\n 2\n ) for exact algorithms to solve the similar subtrajectory search problem under most trajectory distance functions in the existing studies, where\n m\n is the length of the query trajectory and\n n\n is the length of the data trajectory. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an exact algorithm to solve the similar subtrajectory search problem in\n O\n (\n mn\n ) time for most of widely used trajectory distance functions (e.g., WED, DTW, ERP, EDR and Frechet distance). Through extensive experiments on three real datasets, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.\n",

            "title": "Online Ridesharing with Meeting Points",
            "abstract": "\n Nowadays, ridesharing becomes a popular commuting mode. Dynamically arriving riders post their origins and destinations, then the platform assigns drivers to serve them. In ridesharing, different groups of riders can be served by one driver if their trips can share common routes. Recently, many ridesharing companies (e.g., Didi and Uber) further propose a new mode, namely \"ridesharing with meeting points\". Specifically, with a short walking distance but less payment, riders can be picked up and dropped off\n around\n their origins and destinations, respectively. In addition,\n meeting points\n enables more flexible routing for drivers, which can potentially improve the global profit of the system. In this paper, we first formally define the Meeting-Point-based Online Ridesharing Problem (MORP). We prove that MORP is NP-hard and there is no polynomial-time deterministic algorithm with a constant competitive ratio for it. We notice that a structure of vertex set,\n k\n -skip cover, fits well to the MORP.\n k\n -skip cover tends to find the vertices (meeting points) that are convenient for riders and drivers to come and go. With meeting points, MORP tends to serve more riders with these convenient vertices. Based on the idea, we introduce a convenience-based meeting point candidates selection algorithm. We further propose a hierarchical meeting-point oriented graph (HMPO graph), which ranks vertices for assignment effectiveness and constructs\n k\n -skip cover to accelerate the whole assignment process. Finally, we utilize the merits of\n k\n -skip cover points for ridesharing and propose a novel algorithm, namely SMDB, to solve MORP. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.\n",

            "title": "Efficient $k-\\text{clique}$ Listing with Set Intersection Speedup",
            "abstract": "Listing all k-cliques is a fundamental problem in graph mining, with applications in finance, biology, and social network analysis. However, owing to the exponential growth of the search space as $k$ increases, listing all k-cliques is algorithmically challenging. DDegree and DDegCol are the state-of-the-art algorithms that exploit ordering heuristics based on degree ordering and color ordering, respectively. Both DDegree and DDegCol induce high time and space overhead for set intersections cause they construct and maintain all induced subgraphs. Meanwhile, it is non-trivial to implement the data level parallelism to further accelerate on DDegree and DDegCol. In this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms SDegree and BitCol for k-clique listing. We mainly focus on accelerating the set intersections for k-clique listing. Both SDegree and BitCol exploit the data level parallelism for further acceleration with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) or vector instruction sets. Furthermore, we propose two preprocessing techniques Pre-Core and Pre-List, which run in linear time. The preprocessing techniques significantly reduce the size of the original graph and prevent exploring a large number of invalid nodes. In the theoretical analysis, our algorithms have a comparable time complexity and a slightly lower space complexity than the state-of-the-art algorithms. The comprehensive experiments reveal that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by 3.75x for degree ordering and 5.67x for color ordering on average.",

            "abstract": "The Future of Work (FoW) is witnessing an evolution where AI systems (broadly machines or businesses) are used to the benefit of humans. Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Online crowdsourcing platforms have proliferated over the last few years and cover a number of important domains, these platforms include from worker-task platforms such Amazon Mechanical Turk, worker-for-hire platforms such as TaskRabbit to specialized platforms with speci\ufb01c tasks such as ridesharing like Uber, Lyft, Ola etc. An increasing proportion of human workforce will be employed by these platforms in the near future. The crowdsourcing community has done yeoman\u2019s work in designing effective algorithms for various key components, such as incentive design, task assignment and quality control. Given the increasing importance of these crowdsourcing platforms, it is now time to design mechanisms so that it is easier to evaluate the effectiveness of these platforms. Speci\ufb01cally, we advocate developing benchmarks for crowdsourcing research. Benchmarks often identify important issues for the community to focus and improve upon. This has played a key role in the development of research domains as diverse as databases and deep learning. We believe that developing appropriate benchmarks for crowdsourcing will ignite further innovations. However, crowdsourcing \u2013 and future of work, in general \u2013 is a very diverse \ufb01eld that makes developing benchmarks much more challenging. Substantial effort is needed that spans across developing benchmarks for datasets, metrics, algorithms, platforms and so on. In this article, we initiate some discussion into this important problem and issue a call-to-arms for the community to work on this important initiative.",
