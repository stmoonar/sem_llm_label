            "abstract": "Human travel and social contacts are deemed as the key force in driving the transmission of infectious diseases. Consequently, epidemic models should represent individuals\u2019 spatiotemporal contacts in detail to investigate the complex process of epidemic diffusion. Mathematical epidemic models usually assume a homogeneous human population and describe unstructured contacts. Most network-based epidemic models do not synthetically consider the temporal and spatial features of human structured contact behaviors. We here combined a social network with a bipartite network to build a multilayer agent network to model heterogeneous individuals\u2019 temporal and spatial structured contacts. We used the largest collective outbreak of H1N1 influenza at a Chinese university in 2009 as a case study. Experimental results indicate that our models can reproduce individuals\u2019 daily travel and social contact patterns, as well as the H1N1 influenza outbreak. We found that only quarantining dormitories to stop interbuilding transmission could not achieve a great effect in mitigating epidemic outbreaks at a university. The prohibition of students\u2019 visiting across dormitory rooms was indispensable to prevent intrabuilding transmission of infectious diseases. Furthermore, it would be better to quarantine admitted case patients\u2019 close contacts to control potentially latent individuals.",

            "abstract": "During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), people use social media to acquire and exchange various types of information at a historic and unprecedented scale. Only the situational information are valuable for the public and authorities to response to the epidemic. Therefore, it is important to identify such situational information and to understand how it is being propagated on social media, so that appropriate information publishing strategies can be informed for the COVID-19 epidemic. This article sought to fill this gap by harnessing Weibo data and natural language processing techniques to classify the COVID-19-related information into seven types of situational information. We found specific features in predicting the reposted amount of each type of information. The results provide data-driven insights into the information need and public attention.",

            "abstract": "A hybrid particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) aided Kalman filter (PSO-GA-KF) method for dynamic harmonic state estimation in the power system is investigated. The initial choice of states and KF's parameters, such as process and measurement error covariance matrices significantly affects the estimation precision. Aiming at this problem, a combination of PSO and GA (PSO-GA) is proposed to optimise KF's parameters. In this hybrid algorithm, by replacing the gene mutation operator of GA, the PS algorithm mutation operator is constructed, which can adjust the evolution direction and range based on historical records and swarm records, leading to avoiding the blindness of GA mutation and reducing the probability of devious mutation and enhancing the velocity of evolution. Thus, the global search ability of the hybrid PSO-GA can ensure KF has more accurate estimation of harmonics. To test the effectiveness of the algorithm, several time-varying signals are simulated with harmonics and decaying DC components in the presence of amplitude drift and white noise. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm has more accurate estimation, faster convergence and better robustness against noise in comparison with the conventional Kalman filter (KF), KF based on the maximum likelihood and PSO aided KF (PSO-KF).",

            "abstract": "Capacity drop is one of the most famous and confusing phenomena in the dynamic of motorway traffic and is closely related to the occurrence of congestion and the magnitude of travel delay. Traffic flow theory and traffic flow model play an important role in testing and developing efficient motorway traffic control strategies, while macroscopic models of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) type fail to reproduce the capacity drop. This paper proposes a modified Cell Transmission Model(CTM) based on the special contribution of on-ramp flow on the capacity drop to reflect the capacity drop at merge in the first-order traffic flow model. We calibrate and validate the presented model with real traffic data, the validation results show that this model is robust and capable to capture capacity drop phenomenon.",

Firstly, we make some improvements on the Markov decision model for DWTA, so that it can be applied to the real air defense combat. And then, the improved Markov decision model is applied to each distribution stage in the DWTA process. Furthermore, considering the dynamic stochastic antagonism characteristic of DWTA process, we introduce the concept of time window to describe the time constraints and deal with the stochastic events based on the theory of Random Service System (RSS). As a result, the multi-stage DWTA model is proposed. Finally, we compare our algorithm with other two algorithms, and the experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve greater benefits than other algorithms under the same conditions, which shows the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Cloud computing is attracting an increased number of researches in delivering modeling and simulation abilities as a service. Among which, simulation execution as a service (EaaS) is a hot spot. It aims at releasing users from complex running configurations and meanwhile guaranteeing the QoS requirements. Under the motivation, focusing on EaaS for parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) application, the paper proposes a QoS-aware job scheduling framework in two-tier virtualization-based private cloud data center. In PADS EaaS, an adaptive job size adjustment component is designed to realize intelligent and adaptive job size setting for PADS instead of assigning by users. Furthermore, an adaptive deadline-aware job size adjustment algorithm, named ADaSA, is designed in the adjustment component to realize efficient job scheduling with high job responsiveness. ADaSA algorithm firstly computes a minimum processor requested that leads to maximum runtime stretch. It makes sure that more jobs can be scheduled at the same time while satisfying current job's deadline requirements. On other hand, ADaSA tries to pick up all possible idle CPU time in background virtual machines and reserved ones for other jobs. Through that way, more chances are generated to response more jobs in waiting queue. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with trace-driven simulation. The results show that ADaSA outperforms both cloud-based job scheduling algorithm KCEASY and traditional EASY in terms of response time (up to 90%) and bounded slow down (up to 95%), and at the same time guarantees approximately equivalent deadline-missed rate. ADaSA also outperforms two representative moldable scheduling algorithms in terms of deadline-missed rate (up to 60%).",

The conventional atmospheric simulation can seldom give the precise prediction results due to inaccurate input parameters.

The coefficients of dispersion in this model are selected as the system state variables and updated by assimilating observed data into the model in real time. To obtain high-quality observed data, a UAV-based air contaminant sensory system is developed. Two experiments are designed and implemented to verify the performance of the method.

            "abstract": "The method of artificial society has provided a powerful way to study and explain how individual behaviors at micro level give rise to the emergence of global social phenomenon. It also creates the need for an appropriate representation of social structure which usually has a significant influence on human behaviors. It has been widely acknowledged that social networks are the main paradigm to describe social structure and reflect social relationships within a population. To generate social networks for a population of interest, considering physical distance and social distance among people, we propose a generation model of social networks for a large-scale artificial society based on human choice behavior theory under the principle of random utility maximization. As a premise, we first build an artificial society through constructing a synthetic population with a series of attributes in line with the statistical (census) data for Beijing. Then the generation model is applied to assign social relationships to each individual in the synthetic population. Compared with previous empirical findings, the results show that our model can reproduce the general characteristics of social networks, such as high clustering coefficient, significant community structure and small-world property. Our model can also be extended to a larger social micro-simulation as an input initial. It will facilitate to research and predict some social phenomenon or issues, for example, epidemic transition and rumor spreading.",

            "abstract": "The impact that the heterogeneities of links\u2019 weights have on epidemic diffusion in weighted networks has received much attention. Investigating how heterogeneous edge weights affect epidemic spread is helpful for disease control. In this paper, we study a Reed\u2013Frost epidemic model in weighted evolving networks. Our results indicate that a higher heterogeneity of edge weights leads to higher epidemic prevalence and epidemic incidence at earlier stage of epidemic diffusion in weighted evolving networks. In addition, weighted evolving scale-free networks come with a higher epidemic prevalence and epidemic incidence than unweighted scale-free networks.",
