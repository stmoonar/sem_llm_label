            "abstract": "The decentralization of modern power systems challenges the hierarchical structure of the electric grid and necessitates automated schemes to manage adverse conditions. This work proposes an adaptive isolation methodology that can divide a grid into autonomous islands, ensuring stable and economical operation amid deliberate (e.g., cyberattacks) or unintentional abnormal events. The adaptive isolation logic is event-triggered to prevent false positives, enhance detection accuracy, and reduce computational overhead. A measurement-based stable kernel representation (SKR) triggering mechanism initially inspects distributed generation controllers for abnormal behavior. The SKR then alerts a machine learning (ML) ensemble classifier to assess whether the system behavior remains within acceptable operational limits. The event-triggered adaptive isolation framework is evaluated using the IEEE RTS-24 and 118-bus systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework detects anomalous behavior with 100% accuracy in real-time, i.e., within 22 msec. Supply-adequate partitions are identified outperforming traditional islanding detection and formation techniques while minimizing operating costs.",

            "abstract": "Smart grid advancements and the increased integration of digital devices have transformed the existing power grid into a cyber-physical energy system. This reshaping of the current power system can make it vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which could cause irreversible damage to the energy infrastructure resulting in the loss of power, equipment damage, etc. Constant threats emphasize the importance of cybersecurity investigations. At the same time, developing cyber-physical system (CPS) simulation testbeds is crucial for vulnerability assessment and the implementation and validation of security solutions. In this paper, two separate real-time CPS testbeds are developed based on the availability of local research facilities for impact analysis of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on microgrids. The two configurations are implemented using two different digital real-time simulator systems, one using the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup and the other one using OPAL-RT with ExataCPS to emulate the cyber-layer infrastructure. Both testbeds demonstrate the impact of DoS attacks on microgrid control and protection operation.",

            "abstract": "The distributed generation capabilities of microgrids (MGs) arise as essential assets in enhancing grid resilience. The integration of distributed energy sources, controllable loads, and prosumers necessitates the deployment of potent control and communication synergies. While those synergies transform MGs into cyber-physical systems through information technologies able to sense, control, and actuate local resources and loads, they inadvertently expose MGs to cyber-attack threats. Increasing the security of critical communication and control systems against \u201cblack swan\u201d events, i.e., high-impact low-probability cyber-physical incidents, is a major priority for MG operations. Such incidents, if left unabated, can intensify and elicit system dynamics instability, eventually causing outages and system failures. In this article, we develop an integrated approach for multiagent MG systems able to perform the detection of malicious cyber-physical attacks based on subspace methods. We employ the small-signal model of an autonomous/islanded MG and consider different attack models targeting the MG\u2019s secondary frequency control. The attack detector is constructed via identifying the stable kernel representation of the autonomous cyber-physical MG in the attack-free case. We illustrate the impact of the attack models as well as the feasibility of the developed detection method in simulation models of the Canadian urban benchmark distribution system.",

            "abstract": "Embedded controllers, sensors, actuators, advanced metering infrastructure, etc. are cornerstone components of cyber-physical energy systems such as microgrids (MGs). Harnessing their monitoring and control functionalities, sophisticated schemes enhancing MG stability can be deployed. However, the deployment of \u2018smart\u2019 assets increases the threat surface. Power systems possess mechanisms capable of detecting abnormal operations. Furthermore, the lack of sophistication in attack strategies can render them detectable since they blindly violate power system semantics. On the other hand, the recent increase of process-aware rootkits that can attain persistence and compromise operations in undetectable ways requires special attention. In this work, we investigate the steps followed by stealthy rootkits at the process level of control systems pre- and post-compromise. We investigate the rootkits' precompromise stage involving the deployment to multiple system locations and aggregation of system-specific information to build a neural network-based virtual data-driven model (VDDM) of the system. Then, during the weaponization phase, we demonstrate how the VDDM measurement predictions are paramount, first to orchestrate crippling attacks from multiple system standpoints, maximizing the impact, and second, impede detection blinding system operator situational awareness.",

            "abstract": "Smart grid (SG) systems enhance grid resilience and efficient operation, leveraging the bidirectional flow of energy and information between generation facilities and prosumers. For energy demand management (EDM), the SG network requires computing a large amount of data generated by massive Internet-of-things sensors and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with minimal latency. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme in a 6G-enabled SG edge network to offload resource-consuming EDM computation to edge servers. Automatic resource provisioning is achieved by harnessing the computational capabilities of smart meters in the dynamic edge network. To enforce DRL-assisted policies in dense 6G networks, the state information from multiple edge servers is required. However, adversaries can \u201cpoison\u201d such information through false state injection (FSI) attacks, exhausting SG edge computing resources. Toward addressing this issue, we investigate the impact of such FSI attacks with respect to abusive utilization of edge resources, and develop a lightweight FSI detection mechanism based on supervised classifiers. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of DRL in dynamic resource allocation, the impact of the FSI attacks, and the effectiveness of the detection technique.",

            "abstract": "The digitization and decentralization of the electric power grid are key thrusts for an economically and environmentally sustainable future. Toward this goal, distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, electric vehicles, etc., are becoming ubiquitous in power systems. Power utilities benefit from DERs as they minimize operational costs; at the same time, DERs grant users and aggregators control over the power they produce and consume. DERs are interconnected, interoperable, and support remotely controllable features; thus, their cybersecurity is of cardinal importance. DER communication dependencies and the diversity of DER architectures widen the threat surface and aggravate the cybersecurity posture of power systems. In this work, we focus on security oversights that reside in the cyber and physical layers of DERs and can jeopardize grid operations. The existing works have underlined the impact of cyberattacks targeting DER assets; however, they either focus on specific system components (e.g., communication protocols), do not consider the mission-critical objectives of DERs, or neglect the adversarial perspective (e.g., adversary/attack models) altogether. To address these omissions, we comprehensively analyze adversarial capabilities and objectives when manipulating DER assets, and then present how protocol and device-level vulnerabilities can materialize into cyberattacks impacting power system operations. Finally, we provide mitigation strategies to thwart adversaries and directions for future DER cybersecurity research.",

Rootkit detection is a strenuous process and requires advanced security methods due to their sophisticated operation. A careful analysis of possible rootkit target locations and their exploitation techniques is necessary to design effective threat detection and mitigation mechanisms. This paper discusses the cyber kill chain of a rootkit which can simultaneously deploy itself at multiple locations in a microgrid in a coordinated and stealthy way in order to maximize the impact on power system operations. The rootkit leverages system measurements to hide its presence and its attack impact from the detection mechanisms.",
