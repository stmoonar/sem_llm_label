            "title": "Collaborative Service Placement, Task Scheduling, and Resource Allocation for Task Offloading With Edge-Cloud Cooperation",
            "abstract": "In an edge-cloud cooperative computing network, the task offloading performance can be further improved by the edge-cloud and edge-edge cooperation, in which the tasks can be offloaded from an edge server to the cloud server or another edge server. Such edge-cloud cooperative task offloading can jointly utilize the resources of all the edge servers and the cloud server. This paper proposes a collaborative service placement, task scheduling, computing resource allocation, and transmission rate allocation scheme for a multi-task and multi-service scenario with edge-cloud cooperation. The objective of our optimization problem is to minimize the total task processing delay while guaranteeing long-term task queuing stability. Considering the high complexity of the original optimization problem, we transform the problem into a deterministic problem for each time slot based on the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we design an iterative algorithm to obtain the whole solution to the problem efficiently based on a hybrid method using multiple numerical techniques. Further, considering the inherent difference in the optimization periods of the service placement, resource allocation, and task scheduling sub-problems, we design a multi-timescale algorithm to solve the sub-problems with different optimization periods. The complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, and extensive simulations are conducted by varying multiple crucial parameters. The superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparison with 4 other schemes.",

            "title": "Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Vehicular Edge Computing Based on V2I and V2V Modes",
            "abstract": "In an internet of vehicle (IoV) scenario, vehicular edge computing (VEC) exploits the computing capabilities of the vehicles and roadside unit (RSU) to enhance the task processing capabilities of the vehicles. Resource management is essential to the performance improvement of the VEC system. In this paper, we propose a joint task offloading and resource allocation scheme to minimize the total task processing delay of all the vehicles through task scheduling, channel allocation, and computing resource allocation for the vehicles and RSU. Different from the existing works, our scheme: 1) considers task diversity by profiling the tasks of the vehicles by multiple attributes including data size, computation amount, delay tolerance, and task type; 2) considers vehicle classification by dividing the vehicles into 4 sets according to whether they have task offloading requirements or provide task processing services; 3) considers task processing flexibility by deciding for each vehicle to process its tasks locally, to offload the tasks to the RSU via V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) connections, or to the other vehicles via V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) connections. An algorithm based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) and Reformulation Linearization (RL) methods is designed to optimally solve the optimization problem. A heuristic algorithm is also designed to provide the sub-optimal solution with low computational complexity. We analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithms and conduct extensive simulations in 6 scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme in comparison with 4 other schemes.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) plays a key role in Intelligent Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Processing of the computation-intensive ML tasks can be largely enhanced by applying edge computing (EC) to traditional cloud-based schemes. System optimizations in the existing works always ignore the inference accuracy of ML models with different complexities, and their impacts on error task inference. In this article, we propose a joint task offloading and resource allocation scheme for accuracy-aware machine-learning-based IIoT applications in an edge\u2013cloud-based network architecture. We aim at minimizing the long-term average system cost affected by the task offloading, computing resource allocation, and inference accuracy of the ML models deployed on the sensors, edge server, and cloud server. The Lyapunov optimization technique is applied to convert the long-term stochastic optimization problem into a short-term deterministic problem. An optimal algorithm based on the general Benders decomposition (GBD) technology and a heuristic algorithm based on proportional computing resource allocation and task offloading strategy comparison are proposed to efficiently solve the problem, respectively. The performance of our scheme is proved by theoretical analysis and evaluated by extensive simulations conducted in multiple scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our two algorithms in comparison with several other schemes proposed by the existing works.",
