            "title": "Research on a New Control System Based on L1 Adaptive Control Scheme for the Voice Coil Motor",
            "abstract": "With the continuous development of voice coil motors, it has also been widely used in today\u2019s sports competitions. For example, the Hawk-Eye system in tennis matches uses voice coil motors to focus on the camera to capture the trajectory of the tennis ball. Therefore, in order to better solve the problem of dynamic parameter uncertainty, external load disturbance, and tracking control of the voice coil motor servo system in motion, this paper proposes for the first time the strategy of using L1 adaptive control algorithm to control the voice coil motor servo system. First, it briefly analyzes the working principle and control method of the voice coil motor, and then constructs the uncertain parameter model according to the mathematical model of the voice coil motor. The closed-loop system of voice coil motor is simulated and analyzed by L1 adaptive controller. The results show that the L1 adaptive control method effectively suppresses the high-frequency interference caused by the voice coil motor in operation, can control the tracking error to gradually converge and so the tracking effect is better, and has strong robustness to the perturbation of system parameters. It can be applied to voice coil motor servo control.",

            "abstract": "In order to timely gain working status parameters of operating parts in combine harvester and improve its operating efficiency, fault diagnosis and load feedback control system is designed. In the system, rotation speed sensors were used to gather these signals of forward speed and rotation speeds of intermediate shaft, conveying trough, tangential and longitudinal flow threshing rotors, grain conveying auger. Using C8051 single chip microcomputer (SCM) as processor for main control unit, faults diagnosis and forward speed control were carried through by rotation speed ratio analysis of each channel rotation speed and intermediate shaft rotation speed by use of multi-sensor fused fuzzy control algorithm, and these processing results would be sent to touch screen and display work status of combine harvester. Field trials manifest that fault monitoring and load feedback control system has good man-machine interaction and the fault diagnosis method based on rotation speed ratios has low false alarm rate, and the system can realize automation control of forward speed for combine harvester.",
