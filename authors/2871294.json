            "abstract": "Data trees, typically encoded in JSON, are ubiquitous in data-driven applications. This ubiquity makes urgent the development of novel techniques for querying heterogeneous JSON data in a flexible manner. We propose a rule language for JSON, called constrained tree-rules, whose purpose is to provide a high-level unified view of heterogeneous JSON data and infer implicit information. As reasoning with constrained tree-rules is undecidable, we identify a relevant subset featuring tractable query answering, for which we design an automata-based query rewriting algorithm. Our approach consists of leveraging NoSQL document stores by means of a novel instance-aware query-rewriting technique. We present an extensive experimental analysis on large collections of several million JSON records. Our results show the importance of instance-aware rewriting as well as the efficiency and scalability of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Existential rules are a positive fragment of first-order logic that generalizes function-free Horn rules by allowing existentially quantified variables in rule heads. This family of languages has recently attracted significant interest in the context of ontology-mediated query answering. Forward chaining, also known as the chase, is a fundamental tool for computing universal models of knowledge bases, which consist of existential rules and facts. Several chase variants have been defined, which differ on the way they handle redundancies. A set of existential rules is bounded if it ensures the existence of a bound on the depth of the chase, independently from any set of facts. Deciding if a set of rules is bounded is an undecidable problem for all chase variants. Nevertheless, when computing universal models, knowing that a set of rules is bounded for some chase variant does not help much in practice if the bound remains unknown or even very large. Hence, we investigate the decidability of the k-boundedness problem, which asks whether the depth of the chase for a given set of rules is bounded by an integer k. We identify a general property which, when satisfied by a chase variant, leads to the decidability of k-boundedness. We then show that the main chase variants satisfy this property, namely the oblivious, semi-oblivious (aka Skolem), and restricted chase, as well as their breadth-first versions.",

            "abstract": "Logic circuits operating in living cells are generally built by mimicking electronic layouts, and scale-up is accomplished using additional layers of elementary logic gates like NOT and NOR gates. Recombinase-based logic, in which logic is implemented using DNA inversion or excision, allows for highly efficient, compact and single-layer design architectures. However, recombinase logic architectures depart from electronic design principles, and gate design performed empirically is challenging for an increasing number of inputs. Here we used a combinatorial approach to explore the design space of recombinase logic devices. We generated combinations and permutations of recombination sites, genes, and regulatory elements, for a total of ~19 million designs supporting the implementation of all 2- and 3-input logic functions and up to 92% of 4-input logic functions. We estimated the influence of different design constraints on the number of executable functions, and found that the use of DNA inversion and transcriptional terminators were key factors to implement the vast majority of logic functions. We provide a user-friendly interface, called RECOMBINATOR (http://recombinator.lirmm.fr/index.php), that enable users to navigate the design space of recombinase-based logic, find architectures implementing a specific logic function and sort them according to various biological criteria. Finally, we define a set of 16 architectures from which all 256 3-input logic functions can be derived. This work provides a theoretical foundation for the systematic exploration and design of single-layer recombinase logic devices.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Computational simulation is critical in the modern engineering design process. Currently, the use of simulation is limited by the time-consuming process of converting CAD assemblies into FEA models which are efficient to run and yet sufficiently accurate. In addition to the geometric representation of components, analysts require additional knowledge to describe the complete 3D simulation model. To speed up the generation of CAE models from CAD assemblies, we propose to capture high-level modelling and idealisation decisions, characterising the simulation intent, into a knowledge-based CAE model. In this framework, a simulation intent ontology formalises and structures the analysis parameters, the modelling and idealisation decisions. The ontological concepts and relations required to incorporate two of the key capabilities, cellular modelling and equivalencing, are described. Cellular modelling introduces the concept of cells, which subdivide the 3D space, and to which simulation attributes can be attached. Equivalencing maintains the link between different representations of the cells required for different analyses throughout the analysis lifecycle. Illustrative examples show how the knowledge-based CAE model is used to manage the idealisation decisions and to apply inference rules replicating current modelling practices.",

            "abstract": "Existential rules, long known as tuple-generating dependencies in database theory , have been intensively studied in the last decade as a powerful formalism to represent ontological knowledge in the context of ontology-based query answering. A knowledge base is then composed of an instance that contains incomplete data and a set of existential rules, and answers to queries are logically entailed from the knowledge base. This brought again to light the fundamental chase tool, and its different variants that have been proposed in the literature. It is well-known that the problem of determining, given a chase variant and a set of existential rules, whether the chase will halt on any instance, is undecidable. Hence, a crucial issue is whether it becomes decidable for known subclasses of existential rules. In this work, we consider linear existential rules, a simple yet important subclass of ex-istential rules that generalizes inclusion dependencies. We show the decidability of the all instance chase termination problem on linear rules for three main chase variants, namely semi-oblivious, restricted and core chase. To obtain these results, we introduce a novel approach based on so-called derivation trees and a single notion of forbidden pattern. Besides the theoretical interest of a unified approach and new proofs, we provide the first positive decidability results concerning the termination of the restricted chase, proving that chase termination on linear existential rules is decidable for both versions of the problem: Does every fair chase sequence terminate? Does some fair chase sequence terminate?",

Our theoretical framework uses a reduced library of computational devices distributed into different cellular subpopulations, which are then composed in various manners to implement all desired logic functions at the multicellular level. Our design platform called CALIN (Composable Asynchronous Logic using Integrase Networks) is broadly accessible via a web server, taking truth tables as inputs and providing corresponding DNA designs and sequences as outputs (available at http://synbio.cbs.cnrs.fr/calin).

            "abstract": "We propose to demonstrate a system for accessing Key-Value stores in the presence of semantic constraints, as considered in the setting of ontology-mediated query answering. The constraints we study are expressed in a native rule language for JSON records and their purpose is to establish a high level view over a collection of legacy and possibly heterogenous Key-Value stores. To ensure correct and complete data access, constraints are taken into account via query rewriting techniques tailored for MongoDB queries. The nature of queries and constraints also enable the deployment of parallelization techniques for optimizing query rewriting and therefore the whole data access task. During the demonstration, attendees will first be able to query JSON datasets in the presence of rules thereby illustrating how semantic constraints bring novel and pertinent answers to queries. Then, it will be possible to make a detailed analysis of query rewriting and compare the parallel version of the reformulation algorithm with the baseline centralized one.",

            "abstract": "A major goal of synthetic biology is to reprogram living organisms to solve pressing challenges in manufacturing, environmental remediation, or healthcare. While many types of genetic logic gates have been engineered, their scalability remains limited. Previous work demonstrated that Distributed Multicellular Computation (DMC) enables the implementation of complex logic within cellular consortia. However, current DMC systems require spatial separation of cellular subpopulation to be scalable to N-inputs, and need cell-cell communication channels to operate. Here we present scalable composition frameworks for the systematic design of multicellular consortia performing recombinase-based Boolean or history-dependent logic, and integrating an arbitrary number of inputs. The theoretical designs for both Boolean and history-dependent logic are based on reduced sets of computational modules implemented into specific cellular subpopulations which can then be combined in various manners to implement all logic functions. Our systems mark a departure from previous DMC architectures as they do not require either cell-cell communication nor spatial separation, greatly facilitating their implementation and making them fully autonomous. Due to their scalability and composability, we anticipate that the design strategies presented here will help researchers and engineers to reprogram cellular behavior for various applications in a streamlined manner. We provide an online tool for automated design of DNA architectures allowing the implementation of multicellular N-inputs logic functions at: http://synbio.cbs.cnrs.fr/calin.",

In this paper, we study the problem of answering ontology-mediated queries on top of key-value stores. We formalize the data model and core queries of these systems, and introduce a rule language to express lightweight ontologies on top of data.

However, setting up detailed anatomical models has been a difficult task, especially for simulation. We demonstrate MyCorporisFabrica [MyCF], the first assistant tool for modeling and simulating anatomical structures such as bones, muscles, viscera and fat tissues. Using a novel ontology-centered knowledge base, it helps selecting anatomical entities based on their type or their contribution to physiological functions. The resulting 3D model can be automatically transfered to an arbitrary humanoid character in a similar pose, only defined by its skin. This allows to quickly generate anatomical models for a large range of target characters, while maintaining anatomical consistency. Finally, the knowledge base also contains mechanical data used to set up a choice of mechanical models of the selected entities, which we export to a simulator. This dramatically eases biomechanical modeling and makes it possible for non-expert users to enter that field. We demonstrate this technology and detail a practical example.",

Functions stand for symbolic information bringing a high level description of product subsets and apply also to human body anatomical entities. Ontology-based approaches bring new means to improve the efficiency of these digital models. Here, the purpose is to identify similarities and differences between existing ontology based descriptions of products and virtual humans. From this analysis, it is shown how compatible descriptions can be obtained and how a common framework can be derived where products and virtual humans can be both incorporated for various applications involving 3D models. The proposed framework contains an ontology-based description of products and virtual humans enabling the access to 3D models while accessing high-level semantic information through the use of inference mechanisms. Biomechanical simulations of virtual humans and structural behavior simulations of products is the context used to setup this common framework such that products and virtual humans can take part to these simulations where products and virtual humans are involved.",

            "abstract": "The web has evolved from a technological platform to a real social milieu thereby be- coming a continuous source of Big Social Data (BSD). BSD is characterized by a combination of factual content such as the coordinates of a restaurant, the content of a webpage or the title of a movie, behavior data such as exchanges between social relationships, as well as subjective data such as users' opinions, reviews, and tags. The goal of a social application is to analyze BSD and process it in order to understand it and transform it into valuable content to users. Building social applications requires an essential data preparation step during which raw BSD is sanitized, normalized, enriched, pruned, and transformed making it readily available for fur- ther processing. We argue for the need to formalize data preparation and develop appropriate tools to enable easy prototyping of social applications. We describe SOCLE, our framework for BSD preparation. We provide an architecture inspired from typical social applications, the state of the art of existing languages and algebras for manipulating BSD, and the scientific challenges and opportunities underlying the development of SOCLE.

            "abstract": "In this demo we will showcase a research prototype for processing queries and updates on large XML documents. The prototype is based on the idea of statically and dynamically partitioning the input document, so to distribute the computing load among the machines of a Map/Reduce cluster. Attendees will be able to run predefined queries and updates on documents conforming to the XMark schema, as well as to submit their own queries and updates.",

            "title": "Types for Detecting XML Query-Update Independence",
            "abstract": "In the last decade XML became one of the main standards for data storage and exchange on the Web. Detecting XML query-update independence is crucial to efficiently perform data management tasks, like those concerning view-maintenance, concurrency control, and security. This thesis presents a novel static analysis technique to detect XML query- update independence, in the presence of a schema. Rather than types, the presented system infers chains of types. Each chain represents a path that can be traversed on a valid document during query/update evaluation. The resulting independence analysis is precise, although it raises a challenging issue: recursive schemas may lead to infer infinitely many chains. This thesis presents a sound and complete approximation tech- nique ensuring a finite analysis in any case, together with an efficient implementation performing the chain-based analysis in polynomial space and time.",
