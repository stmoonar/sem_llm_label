            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is a promising wireless technology for supporting various intelligent vehicle applications. In mmWave vehicular network systems, acquiring accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is challenging due to the high mobility of vehicles, making user scheduling and beamforming more difficult. This work aims to enhance both communication throughput and reliability for mmWave vehicular networks without the help of explicit CSI. A closed-form optimal scheduling policy is proposed for the single road side unit (RSU) case based on the Lyapunov optimization framework. For the multiple-RSU case, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is proposed to jointly optimize user scheduling, beamforming, power allocation, and handover decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL framework significantly enhances communication throughput under reliability constraints compared to baseline algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The vision of decoupled software and hardware for wireless communications has prompted the application of Open-Radio-Access-Networks (O-RANs) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Such a structure is beneficial to operators for flexible and low-cost network deployment, and to terminals for continuously evolving wireless technologies. Conventionally, they rely on General-Purpose-Processors (GPPs) such as Intel\u2019s x86 processors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for digital baseband signal processing. However, concerns regarding energy efficiency, open software environment and programmability still hinder the development. This paper proposes a domain specific manycore architecture based on RISC-V instruction extension and a multi-level dataflow programming model for open-source baseband signal processing in 6G networks. The proposed architecture shows promising performance which is comparable to state-of-the-art FPGA implementations, and meanwhile flexibility in terms of software programmability.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a novel time-triggered reservation scheme is proposed to improve the performance of IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocol. The proposed Reservation-based Distributed Channel Access (RDCA) protocol leverages the overhearing feature of the shared wireless channel and allows reservation-based data transmission with collision resolution. The reservation is realized in a time-triggered manner by setting extra timers on mobile stations. Through time-triggered reservation, a collision-free transmission scheduling can be achieved in a collaborative way without the assistance from the access point (AP). RDCA substantially reduces the delay and can function as the MAC layer for the wireless extension of time-sensitive networking (TSN). Meanwhile, the throughput of the network is increased due to the reduction of collisions. Moreover, RDCA also maintains backward compatibility with the legacy IEEE 802.11 terminals. The analysis of saturated throughput is provided and the performance gain in terms of delay and throughput is evaluated by extensive simulations. Compared to legacy IEEE 802.11, the throughput in RDCA increases up to 50% and the delay reduces up to 70%.",

            "abstract": "The cooperation among intelligent agents is the key to build smarter real-world intelligent systems. Recent researches have shown that wireless communication plays a vital role in multi-agent cooperation. However, limited wireless resources become the bottleneck of large-scale multi-agent cooperation. Therefore, we focus on how to improve the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning under the constraint of communication resources. To share more valuable information among agents under resource constraint, we formulate the message importance and design a decentralized scheduling policy with query mechanism, so that agents can effectively exchange messages according to their message importance. We further design a message prediction mechanism to compensate for those messages that are not scheduled for transmission in the current round. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes in a traffic junction environment, where only a fraction of agents can broadcast their messages in each round due to limited wireless resources. Results show that the importance-aware message exchange can extract valuable information to guarantee the system performance even when less than half of agents can share their states. By exploiting message prediction, the system can further save 40% of communication resources while guaranteeing the system performance.",

            "abstract": "In federated learning (FL) over the 5G system (5GS), a group of user equipments (UEs) that are FL participants with diverse local datasets can accelerate the model training and enhance the model generalization. It is impractical to blindly select a large number of FL participants in order to derive a well-trained model. Instead, it would be more beneficial to select a small number of FL participants (i.e. UEs) with specific characteristics given the considerations of the mobile communication resource constraints. However, how to effectively select suitable UEs as FL participants is a challenging problem for application server on mobile targets, since it requires prior information about user characteristics, such as user location information and mobility-related information. This paper proposes a FL member selection method based on the assistance of a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5GS to address the above problem. In particular, the trajectory prediction is considered as a typical scenario where 5GS has the ability to identify the list of best candidate UEs to participate in the FL according to the criteria as specified by the FL server. This paper illustrates the effective 5GS support for the application AI services from the Network for AI perspective.",

An expectation propagation framework (EPA) based on the extended factor graph is developed for MIMO-SCMA with multiantenna users. A new initialization method is proposed to accelerate convergence. Moreover, the SC-EPA with lower complexity is proposed by introducing QR decomposition and RE cluster-based decentralized factor node (FN) processing. Furthermore, new approaches for message passing between variable nodes (VNs) and FNs are proposed to improve the parallelism and reduce the complexity of the algorithm.

            "abstract": "Minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detection is increasingly relevant for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. MMSE suffers from high computational complexity and low parallelism because of the increasing number of users and antennas in massive MIMO systems. This paper proposes a recursive conjugate gradient (RCG) method to iteratively estimate signals. First, a recursive conjugate gradient detection algorithm is proposed that achieves high parallelism and low complexity through iteration. Second, a quadrant-certain-based initial method that improves detection accuracy without added complexity is proposed. Third, an approximated log likelihood ratio (LLR) computation method is proposed to achieve simplified calculation. The analyses show that compared with related methods, the proposed RCG algorithm reduces computational complexity and exploits the potential parallelism. RCG is mathematically demonstrated to achieve low approximated error. Based on the RCG method, an architecture is proposed in a 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 64-QAM massive MIMO system. First, a parallel processing element array with single-sided input is adopted; this array eliminates the throughput limitation. Second, a deeply pipelined user-level method based on the recursive conjugate gradient method is proposed. Third, an approximated architecture is proposed to compute the soft output. The architecture is verified on an FPGA and fabricated on 1.87\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.87\u00a0mm$^2$ silicon with TSMC 65\u00a0nm CMOS technology. The chip achieves 2.69\u00a0Mbps/mW and 1.09\u00a0Mbps/kG energy efficiency (throughput/power) and area efficiency (throughput/area), respectively, which are 2.39 to 10.60\u00d7 and 1.15 to 8.81\u00d7\u00a0those of the normalized state-of-the-art designs.",

            "abstract": "Communication systems\u2019 development requires service customization in aspects, such as standards, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scales, and algorithms. The existing hardware designs for massive MIMO detection have difficulty in achieving both high flexibility and scalability with high hardware efficiency. This article proposes a baseband processor based on a dynamic coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) for massive MIMO detection. To efficiently support various algorithm features and requirements, three optimization techniques are proposed to achieve high flexibility and scalability. First, an on-demand matrix\u2013vector systolic array is proposed to enable flexible and scalable matrix and vector operations, reducing memory accesses by 82%. Second, distributed multi-interaction data storage is designed for flexible data access and reusability. Finally, a continuable adaptive context information format is proposed to support different bit widths, operations, and extensions of MIMO systems, reducing context information by 67%.

            "title": "Algorithm and Architecture of a Low-Complexity and High-Parallelism Preprocessing-Based K -Best Detector for Large-Scale MIMO Systems",
            "abstract": "As a branch of sphere decoding, the K-best method has played an important role in detection in large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, as the numbers of users and antennas grow, the preprocessing complexity increases significantly, which is one of the major issues with the K-best method. To address this problem, this paper proposes a preprocessing algorithm combining Cholesky sorted QR decomposition and partial iterative lattice reduction (CHOSLAR) for K-best detection in a 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) 16 $\\times$  16 MIMO system. First, Cholesky decomposition is conducted to perform sorted QR decomposition. Compared with conventional sorted QR decomposition, this method reduces the number of multiplications by 25.1% and increases parallelism. Then, a constant-throughput partial iterative lattice reduction method is adopted to achieve near-optimal detection accuracy. This method further increases parallelism, reduces the number of matrix swaps by 45.5%, and reduces the number of multiplications by 67.3%. Finally, a sorting-reduced K -best strategy is used for vector estimation, thereby, reducing the number of comparators by 84.7%. This method suffers an accuracy loss of only approximately 1.44\u00a0dB compared with maximum likelihood detection. Based on CHOSLAR, this paper proposes a fully pipelined very-large-scale-integration architecture. A series of different systolic arrays and parallel processing units achieves an optimal tradeoff among throughput, area consumption, and power consumption. This architectural layout is obtained via TSMC 65-nm 1P9M CMOS technology, and throughput metrics of 1.40\u00a0Gbps/W (throughput/power) and 0.62\u00a0Mbps/kG (throughput/area) are achieved, demonstrating that the proposed system is much more efficient than state-of-the-art designs.",
