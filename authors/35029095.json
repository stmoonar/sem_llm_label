            "title": "RI2AP: Robust and Interpretable 2D Anomaly Prediction in Assembly Pipelines",
            "abstract": "Predicting anomalies in manufacturing assembly lines is crucial for reducing time and labor costs and improving processes. For instance, in rocket assembly, premature part failures can lead to significant financial losses and labor inefficiencies. With the abundance of sensor data in the Industry 4.0 era, machine learning (ML) offers potential for early anomaly detection. However, current ML methods for anomaly prediction have limitations, with F1 measure scores of only 50% and 66% for prediction and detection, respectively. This is due to challenges like the rarity of anomalous events, scarcity of high-fidelity simulation data (actual data are expensive), and the complex relationships between anomalies not easily captured using traditional ML approaches. Specifically, these challenges relate to two dimensions of anomaly prediction: predicting when anomalies will occur and understanding the dependencies between them. This paper introduces a new method called Robust and Interpretable 2D Anomaly Prediction (RI2AP) designed to address both dimensions effectively. RI2AP is demonstrated on a rocket assembly simulation, showing up to a 30-point improvement in F1 measure compared to current ML methods. This highlights its potential to enhance automated anomaly prediction in manufacturing. Additionally, RI2AP includes a novel interpretation mechanism inspired by a causal-influence framework, providing domain experts with valuable insights into sensor readings and their impact on predictions. Finally, the RI2AP model was deployed in a real manufacturing setting for assembling rocket parts. Results and insights from this deployment demonstrate the promise of RI2AP for anomaly prediction in manufacturing assembly pipelines.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in manufacturing pipelines remains a critical challenge, intensified by the complexity and variability of industrial environments. This paper introduces AssemAI, an interpretable image-based anomaly detection system tailored for smart manufacturing pipelines. Our primary contributions include the creation of a tailored image dataset and the development of a custom object detection model, YOLO-FF, designed explicitly for anomaly detection in manufacturing assembly environments. Utilizing the preprocessed image dataset derived from an industry-focused rocket assembly pipeline, we address the challenge of imbalanced image data and demonstrate the importance of image-based methods in anomaly detection. The proposed approach leverages domain knowledge in data preparation, model development and reasoning. We compare our method against several baselines, including simple CNN and custom Visual Transformer (ViT) models, showcasing the effectiveness of our custom data preparation and pretrained CNN integration. Additionally, we incorporate explainability techniques at both user and model levels, utilizing ontology for user-friendly explanations and SCORE-CAM for in-depth feature and model analysis. Finally, the model was also deployed in a real-time setting. Our results include ablation studies on the baselines, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed system. This work highlights the broader impact of advanced image-based anomaly detection in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of smart manufacturing processes.",

            "title": "Cook-Gen: Robust Generative Modeling of Cooking Actions from Recipes",
            "abstract": "As people become more aware of their food choices, food computation models have become increasingly popular in assisting people in maintaining healthy eating habits. For example, food recommendation systems analyze recipe instructions to assess nutritional contents and provide recipe recommendations. The recent and remarkable successes of generative AI methods, such as auto-regressive Large Language Models, can enable robust methods for a more comprehensive understanding of recipes for healthy food recommendations beyond surface-level nutrition content assessments. In this study, we investigate the use of generative AI methods to extend current food computation models, primarily involving the analysis of nutrition and ingredients, to also incorporate cooking actions (e.g., add salt, fry the meat, boil the vegetables, etc.), Cooking actions are notoriously hard to model using statistical learning methods due to irregular data patterns - significantly varying natural language descriptions for the same action (e.g., marinate the meat vs. marinate the meat and leave overnight) and infrequently occurring patterns (e.g., add salt occurs far more frequently than marinating the meat). The prototypical approach to handling irregular data patterns is to increase the volume of data that the model ingests by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, in the cooking domain, these problems are further compounded with larger data volumes presenting a unique challenge that is not easily handled by simply scaling up. In this work, we propose novel aggregation-based generative AI methods, Cook-Gen, that reliably generate cooking actions from recipes, despite difficulties with irregular data patterns, while also outperforming Large Language Models and other strong baselines.",
