            "abstract": "Motivation Combination therapies have emerged as a treatment strategy for cancers to reduce the probability of drug resistance and to improve outcome. Large databases curating the results of many drug screening studies on preclinical cancer cell lines have been developed, capturing the synergistic and antagonistic effects of combination of drugs in different cell lines. However, due to the high cost of drug screening experiments and the sheer size of possible drug combinations, these databases are quite sparse. This necessitates the development of transductive computational models to accurately impute these missing values. Results Here, we developed MARSY, a deep learning multi-task model that incorporates information on gene expression profile of cancer cell lines, as well as the differential expression signature induced by each drug to predict drug-pair synergy scores. By utilizing two encoders to capture the interplay between the drug-pairs, as well as the drug-pairs and cell lines, and by adding auxiliary tasks in the predictor, MARSY learns latent embeddings that improve the prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art and traditional machine learning models. Using MARSY, we then predicted the synergy scores of 133,722 new drug-pair cell line combinations, which we have made available to the community as part of this study. Moreover, we validated various insights obtained from these novel predictions using independent studies, confirming the ability of MARSY in making accurate novel predictions.

            "abstract": "Motivation Computational methods for the prediction of protein-protein interactions, while important tools for researchers, are plagued by challenges in generalising to unseen proteins. Datasets used for modelling protein-protein predictions are particularly predisposed to information leakage and sampling biases. Results In this study, we introduce RAPPPID, a method for the Regularised Automatic Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions using Deep Learning. RAPPPID is a twin AWD-LSTM network which employs multiple regularisation methods during training time to learn generalised weights. Testing on stringent interaction datasets composed of proteins not seen during training, RAPPPID outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Further experiments show that RAPPPID\u2019s performance holds regardless of the particular proteins in the testing set and its performance is higher for biologically supported edges. This study serves to demonstrate that appropriate regularisation is an important component of overcoming the challenges of creating models for protein-protein interaction prediction that generalise to unseen proteins. Additionally, as part of this study, we provide datasets corresponding to several data splits of various strictness, in order to facilitate assessment of PPI reconstruction methods by others in the future.

            "abstract": "Motivation The increasing number of publicly available databases containing drugs\u2019 chemical structures, their response in cell lines, and molecular profiles of the cell lines has garnered attention to the problem of drug response prediction. However, many existing methods do not fully leverage the information that is shared among cell lines and drugs with similar structure. As such, drug similarities in terms of cell line responses and chemical structures could prove to be useful in forming drug representations to improve drug response prediction accuracy. Results We present two deep learning approaches, BiG-DRP and BiG-DRP+, for drug response prediction. Our models take advantage of the drugs\u2019 chemical structure and the underlying relationships of drugs and cell lines through a bipartite graph and a heterogenous graph convolutional network that incorporate sensitive and resistant cell line information in forming drug representations. Evaluation of our methods and other state-of-the-art models in different scenarios shows that incorporating this bipartite graph significantly improves the prediction performance. Additionally, genes that contribute significantly to the performance of our models also point to important biological processes and signaling pathways. Analysis of predicted drug response of patients\u2019 tumors using our model revealed important associations between mutations and drug sensitivity, illustrating the utility of our model in pharmacogenomics studies.

            "abstract": "Abnormal coagulation and an increased risk of thrombosis are features of severe COVID-19, with parallels proposed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threating condition associated with hyperinflammation. The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.",

            "title": "REP: Predicting the Time-Course of Drug Sensitivity",
            "abstract": "The biological processes involved in a drug's mechanisms of action are oftentimes dynamic, complex and difficult to discern. Time-course gene expression data is a rich source of information that can be used to unravel these complex processes, identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and predict the response to a drug. However, the majority of previous work has not fully utilized this temporal dimension. In these studies, the gene expression data is either considered at one time-point (before the administration of the drug) or two timepoints (before and after the administration of the drug). This is clearly inadequate in modeling dynamic gene-drug interactions, especially for applications such as long-term drug therapy. \nIn this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework for drug response prediction by taking advantage of time-course gene expression data. Our goal is to predict drug response values at every stage of a long-term treatment, given the expression levels of genes collected in the previous time-points. To this end, REP employs a built-in recursive structure that exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past values of drug responses for subsequent predictions. It also incorporates tensor completion that can not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing data, but also predict unseen gene expression levels (GELs). These advantages enable REP to estimate drug response at any stage of a given treatment from some GELs measured in the beginning of the treatment. Extensive experiments on a dataset corresponding to 53 multiple sclerosis patients treated with interferon are included to showcase the effectiveness of REP.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of clinical drug response (CDR) of cancer patients, based on their clinical and molecular profiles obtained prior to administration of the drug, can play a significant role in individualized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to address this issue, but training them requires data from a large number of patients treated with each drug, limiting their feasibility. While large databases of drug response and molecular profiles of preclinical in-vitro cancer cell lines (CCLs) exist for many drugs, it is unclear whether preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of real patients. We designed a systematic approach to evaluate how well different algorithms, trained on gene expression and drug response of CCLs, can predict CDR of patients. Using data from two large databases, we evaluated various linear and non-linear algorithms, some of which utilized information on gene interactions. Then, we developed a new algorithm called TG-LASSO that explicitly integrates information on samples\u2019 tissue of origin with gene expression profiles to improve prediction performance. Our results showed that regularized regression methods provide significantly accurate prediction. However, including the network information or common methods of including information on the tissue of origin did not improve the results. On the other hand, TG-LASSO improved the predictions and distinguished resistant and sensitive patients for 7 out of 13 drugs. Additionally, TG-LASSO identified genes associated with the drug response, including known targets and pathways involved in the drugs\u2019 mechanism of action. Moreover, genes identified by TG-LASSO for multiple drugs in a tissue were associated with patient survival. In summary, our analysis suggests that preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of patients and identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and survival. AUTHOR SUMMARY Cancer is among the leading causes of death globally and perdition of the drug response of patients to different treatments based on their clinical and molecular profiles can enable individualized cancer medicine. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to play a significant role in this task; but, these algorithms are designed based the premise that a large number of labeled training samples are available, and these samples are accurate representation of the profiles of real tumors. However, due to ethical and technical reasons, it is not possible to screen humans for many drugs, significantly limiting the size of training data. To overcome this data scarcity problem, machine learning models can be trained using large databases of preclinical samples (e.g. cancer cell line cultures). However, due to the major differences between preclinical samples and real tumors, it is unclear how accurately such preclinical-to-clinical computational models can predict the clinical drug response of cancer patients. Here, first we systematically evaluate a variety of different linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms for this particular task using two large databases of preclinical (GDSC) and tumor samples (TCGA). Then, we present a novel method called TG-LASSO that utilizes a new approach for explicitly incorporating the tissue of origin of samples in the prediction task. Our results show that TG-LASSO outperforms all other algorithms and can accurately distinguish resistant and sensitive patients for the majority of the tested drugs. Follow-up analysis reveal that this method can also identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity in each cancer type.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the response of cancer cells to drugs is an important problem in pharmacogenomics. Recent efforts in generation of large scale datasets profiling gene expression and drug sensitivity in cell lines have provided a unique opportunity to study this problem. However, one major challenge is the small number of samples (cell lines) compared to the number of features (genes) even in these large datasets. We propose a collaborative filtering like algorithm for modeling gene-drug relationship to identify patients most likely to benefit from a treatment. Due to the correlation of gene expressions in different cell lines, the gene expression matrix is approximately low-rank, which suggests that drug responses could be estimated from a reduced dimension latent space of the gene expression. Towards this end, we propose a joint low-rank matrix factorization and latent linear regression approach. Experiments with data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database are included to show that the proposed method can predict drug-gene associations better than the state-of-the-art methods.",

An improved understanding of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on gene community behavior is of great importance for the study of cancer.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTo expand our capability to analyze combinatorial patterns of cancer alterations, we developed a rigorous methodology for cancer mutation pattern discovery based on a new, constrained form of correlation clustering. Our new algorithm, named C3 (Cancer Correlation Clustering), leverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage and driver network concentration principles. To test C3, we performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene modules and identifying biologically relevant driver genes. The proposed agnostic clustering method represents a unique tool for efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver pathways in large-scale cancer genomics studies, and it may also be used for other clustering problems on biological graphs.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe source code for the C3 method can be found at https://github.com/jackhou2/C3 CONTACTS: jianma@cs.cmu.edu or milenkov@illinois.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
