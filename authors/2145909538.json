            "abstract": "We present MEGAnno, a novel exploratory annotation framework designed for NLP researchers and practitioners. Unlike existing labeling tools that focus on data labeling only, our framework aims to support a broader, iterative ML workflow including data exploration and model development. With MEGAnno\u2019s API, users can programmatically explore the data through sophisticated search and automated suggestion functions and incrementally update task schema as their project evolve. Combined with our widget, the users can interactively sort, filter, and assign labels to multiple items simultaneously in the same notebook where the rest of the NLP project resides. We demonstrate MEGAnno\u2019s flexible, exploratory, efficient, and seamless labeling experience through a sentiment analysis use case.",

            "abstract": "It is a challenging task to automatically excavate new words from huge amounts of domain-specific corpus. This paper proposed a new phrase mining method based on a fast-text model. With existing terminology and iterative computing framework, this method can extract high-quality domain terms from a given domain-specific corpus. Experiments on geographic corpus show that mining results of this method are more accurate compared with that of the traditional unsupervised mining method, with an accuracy of 68.6% in the top 500 candidates. Meanwhile, the scoring system is more reasonable and effective. In general, this new word mining method can effectively utilize external knowledge and save costs of manual labeling. It is more practical and important to the construction and expansion of the glossary.",

            "abstract": "Nominal modification works to describe and restrict noun phrases, making the information delivery more vivid and precise. In English, the communicative functions of different modification patterns of head-nouns have been studied in a lot of corpus-based investigations of the written and the spoken registers, but few corpus-based register studies have been ever conducted in Chinese. This research takes the initiative attempt to conduct a corpus-based study on Chinese modification patterns across registers. A one-million-word corpus including both written and spoken Chinese is first built and all the modification patterns of noun phrases are extracted in Chunker, a self-developed colligation query and analysis tool. Through classification of modification patterns and statistical processing, the study displays the distributions of simple and complex modification patterns and the relationship between the frequency of modification patterns and the information density across registers and discusses the functional implication of such distributions and relationship under the guidance of Biber\u2019s register theory.",

            "abstract": "As the rapid development of social media, now massive data are produced every day. We need to know about users' view and comment on a hot event so that the government and relevant departments can control and guide public opinion, and people can have a correct understanding of the event. So it is necessary to analyze these data. While it is difficult to dig out sufficient information from these data because of their shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose a sentiment orientation analysis method based on background and domain sentiment lexicon expansion, which reflects user's sentiment orientation of evaluation objects more comprehensively. Then we can obtain a more informative and significant sentiment orientation of short text. In the experiment, Chinese Weibo data sets of French security and Turkish Airlines are used to show that our sentiment orientation analysis method has better performance than the domain sentiment lexicon based method.",

            "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is a hot topic in natural language processing. People usually concern the sentiments in a specific domain. By focusing on specific domain such as micro-blogs of a specific product, we can discover the sentiment distribution of customs about this product. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis which divides the sentiments into positive/negative and neutral categories, we divided the product related information into three types: positive/negative about the product and product advertisements. The reason for this kind division is that ordinary positive category in sentiment analysis may contains product advertisements which do not reflect custom's opinions. This phenomenon is very common in micro-blog where there are lots of product promotions and propagandas. In this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed CNN model combines Chinese word-level embedding and Chinese character-level embedding as input features of the sentiment analysis. In the experiment, Chinese micro-blog datasets of weight loss products and mobile phones are used to show that our sentiment analysis method has better performance than the lexicon based method.",
