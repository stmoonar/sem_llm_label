            "abstract": "Community Question-Answering (CQA) forums have revolutionized how people seek information, especially those related to their healthcare needs, placing their trust in the collective wisdom of the public. However, there can be several answers in response to a single query, which makes it hard to grasp the key information related to the specific health concern. Typically, CQA forums feature a single top-voted answer as a representative summary for each query. However, a single answer overlooks the alternative solutions and other information frequently offered in other responses. Our research focuses on aspect-based summarization of health answers to address this limitation. Summarization of responses under different aspects such as suggestions, information, personal experiences, and questions can enhance the usability of the platforms. We formalize a multi-stage annotation guideline and contribute a unique dataset comprising aspect-based human-written health answer summaries. We build an automated multi-faceted answer summarization pipeline with this dataset based on task-specific fine-tuning of several state-of-the-art models. The pipeline leverages question similarity to retrieve relevant answer sentences, subsequently classifying them into the appropriate aspect type. Following this, we employ several recent abstractive summarization models to generate aspect-based summaries. Finally, we present a comprehensive human analysis and find that our summaries rank high in capturing relevant content and a wide range of solutions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) therapies are ineffective in at least 40% patients, and transcriptomic datasets have been widely used to reveal the pathogenesis and to identify the novel drug targets for these patients. Although public IBD transcriptomic datasets are available from many web-based tools/databases, due to the unstructured metadata and data description of these public datasets, most of these tools/databases do not allow querying datasets based on multiple keywords (e.g. colon and infliximab). Furthermore, few tools/databases can compare and integrate the datasets from the query results. To fill these gaps, we have developed IBDTransDB (https://abbviegrc.shinyapps.io/ibdtransdb/), a manually curated transcriptomic database for IBD. IBDTransDB includes a manually curated database with 34 transcriptomic datasets (2932 samples, 122 differential comparisons) and a query system supporting 35 keywords from 5 attributes (e.g. tissue and treatment). IBDTransDB also provides three modules for data analyses and integration. IBDExplore allows interactive visualization of differential gene list, pathway enrichment, gene signature and cell deconvolution analyses from a single dataset. IBDCompare supports comparisons of selected genes or pathways from multiple datasets across different conditions. IBDIntegrate performs meta-analysis to prioritize a list of genes/pathways based on user-selected datasets and conditions. Using two case studies related to infliximab treatment, we demonstrated that IBDTransDB provides a unique platform for biologists and clinicians to reveal IBD pathogenesis and identify the novel targets by integrating with other omics data.

            "title": "No perspective, no perception!! Perspective-aware Healthcare Answer Summarization",
            "abstract": "Healthcare Community Question Answering (CQA) forums offer an accessible platform for individuals seeking information on various healthcare-related topics. People find such platforms suitable for self-disclosure, seeking medical opinions, finding simplified explanations for their medical conditions, and answering others' questions. However, answers on these forums are typically diverse and prone to off-topic discussions. It can be challenging for readers to sift through numerous answers and extract meaningful insights, making answer summarization a crucial task for CQA forums. While several efforts have been made to summarize the community answers, most of them are limited to the open domain and overlook the different perspectives offered by these answers. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel task of perspective-specific answer summarization. We identify various perspectives, within healthcare-related responses and frame a perspective-driven abstractive summary covering all responses. To achieve this, we annotate 3167 CQA threads with 6193 perspective-aware summaries in our PUMA dataset. Further, we propose PLASMA, a prompt-driven controllable summarization model. To encapsulate the perspective-specific conditions, we design an energy-controlled loss function for the optimization. We also leverage the prefix tuner to learn the intricacies of the health-care perspective summarization. Our evaluation against five baselines suggests the superior performance of PLASMA by a margin of 1.5-21% improvement. We supplement our experiments with ablation and qualitative analysis.",

            "abstract": "The Large Language Model (LLM) is renowned for its ability to encode a vast amount of general domain knowledge, enabling it to excel in question-answering, dialogue systems, and summarization tasks. However, the medical domain presents a unique challenge to LLM due to the distribution of medical knowledge, which follows a long-tail pattern. Existing approaches address this challenge by injecting medical knowledge into LLM through single sources such as medical textbooks or medical knowledge bases. However, medical knowledge is distributed across multiple heterogeneous information sources. A medical question-answering system can enhance answer coverage and confidence by considering these diverse knowledge sources together. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach called Heterogeneous Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented LLM for medical domain question answering. Our experiments, conducted on the MedQA-USMLE dataset, demonstrate promising performance improvements. These results underscore the importance of harnessing heterogeneous knowledge sources in the medical domain.",

Our polarization and question answering results indicated that left-leaning media tended to represent refugees as child victims, welcome in the US, and right-leaning media cast refugees as Islamic terrorists. We noted similar results with our sentiment and offensive speech scores over time, which detail possibly unfavorable representations of refugees in right-leaning media. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Based on our results, we provide several recommendations.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how vaping is framed differently (2008-2021) between US news and social media. We analyze 15,711 news articles and 1,231,379 Facebook posts about vaping to study the differences in framing between media varieties. We use word embeddings to provide two-dimensional visualizations of the semantic changes around vaping for news and for social media. We detail that news media framing of vaping shifted over time in line with emergent regulatory trends, such as; flavored vaping bans, with little discussion around vaping as a smoking cessation tool. We found that social media discussions were far more varied, with transitions toward vaping both as a public health harm and as a smoking cessation tool. Our cloze test, dynamic topic model, and question answering showed similar patterns, where social media, but not news media, characterizes vaping as combustible cigarette substitute. We use n-grams to detail that social media data first centered on vaping as a smoking cessation tool, and in 2019 moved toward narratives around vaping regulation, similar to news media frames. Overall, social media tracks the evolution of vaping as a social practice, while news media reflects more risk based concerns. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to intervene around the framing of vaping, and may design communications campaigns that improve the way society sees vaping, thus possibly aiding smoking cessation; and reducing youth vaping.",

            "abstract": "The current advancement in abstractive document summarization depends to a large extent on a considerable amount of human-annotated datasets. However, the creation of large-scale datasets is often not feasible in closed domains, such as medical and healthcare domains, where human annotation requires domain expertise. This paper presents a novel data selection strategy to generate diverse and semantic questions in a low-resource setting with the aim to summarize healthcare questions. Our method exploits the concept of guided semantic-overlap and diversity-based objective functions to optimally select the informative and diverse set of synthetic samples for data augmentation. Our extensive experiments on benchmark healthcare question summarization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed data selection strategy by achieving new state-of-the-art results. Our human evaluation shows that our method generates diverse, fluent, and informative summarized questions.",

            "abstract": "The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers' health-related questions. Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Summ that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question-answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset.",

            "abstract": "Finding the polarity of feelings in texts is a far-reaching task. Whilst the field of natural language processing has established sentiment analysis as an alluring problem, many feelings are left uncharted. In this study, we analyze the optimism and pessimism concepts from Twitter posts to effectively understand the broader dimension of psychological phenomenon. Towards this, we carried a systematic study by first exploring the linguistic peculiarities of optimism and pessimism in user-generated content. Later, we devised a multi-task knowledge distillation framework to simultaneously learn the target task of optimism detection with the help of the auxiliary task of sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. We evaluated the performance of our proposed approach on the benchmark Optimism/Pessimism Twitter dataset. Our extensive experiments show the superior- ity of our approach in correctly differentiating between optimistic and pessimistic users. Our human and automatic evaluation shows that sentiment analysis and hate speech detection are beneficial for optimism/pessimism detection.",
