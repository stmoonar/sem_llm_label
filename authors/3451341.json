            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Shortest path (SP) computation is the fundamental operation in various networks such as urban networks, logistic networks, communication networks, social networks, etc. With the development of technology and societal expansions, those networks tend to be massive. This, in turn, causes deteriorated performance of SP computation, and graph partitioning is commonly leveraged to scale up the SP algorithms. However, the partitioned shortest path (PSP) index has never been systematically investigated and theoretically analyzed, and there is a lack of experimental comparison among different PSP indexes. Moreover, few studies have explored PSP index maintenance in dynamic networks. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically analyze the dynamic PSP index by proposing a universal scheme for it. Specifically, we first propose two novel partitioned shortest path strategies (No-boundary and Post-boundary strategies) to improve the performance of PSP indexes and design the corresponding index maintenance approaches to deal with dynamic scenarios. Then we categorize the partition methods from the perspective of partition structure to facilitate the selection of partition methods in the PSP index. Furthermore, we propose a universal scheme for designing the PSP index by coupling its three dimensions (i.e. PSP strategy, partition structure, and SP algorithm). Based on this scheme, we propose five new PSP indexes with prominent performance in either query or update efficiency. Lastly, extensive experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSP scheme, with valuable guidance provided on the PSP index design.",

            "abstract": "Route planning plays an increasingly important role in our society, and the routing results, which are the paths that vehicles actually travel in a road network, which influence the traffic condition naturally. However, the existing routing algorithms cannot consider the routing results and their influence simultaneously, so traffic congestion could be created when many vehicles are directed to follow similar routes. In this paper, we propose the Global Routing Optimization problem that aims to minimize traffic congestion by continuously evaluating traffic conditions for a set of routing tasks. It is non-trivial to achieve this global optimization goal, as routing and traffic condition evaluation is both time-consuming and interdependent. To break this dependency, we propose a global routing optimization paradigm that can evaluate the routing results\u2019 influence on the traffic condition, and then plan the routes accordingly. To implement it, we first propose a serial model to optimize the next route, followed by a batch model to improve processing efficiency. After that, an iterative model is proposed to further optimize route qualities. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks with synthetic and real workloads validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.",

            "title": "Parallel Hub Labeling Maintenance With High Efficiency in Dynamic Small-World Networks",
            "abstract": "Shortest path computation is a fundamental operation in many application domains and is especially challenging in frequently evolving small-world networks (i.e., graphs in which many nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops). Index-based methods, especially ones based on 2-hop labeling are often used for high query efficiency. However, the evolvements of small-world networks in many realistic scenarios pose the challenge of efficient maintenance of the shortest path index. In this work, we adopt the state-of-the-art Parallel Shortest-distance Labeling (PSL) as the underlying 2-hop labeling construction method, and design algorithms to support its efficient update given edge weight changes (increase and decrease). Specifically, we focus on weighted PSL (WPSL) and propose a propagation-based update mechanism for both synchronous and asynchronous propagation. We also identify the curse of pruning power in the edge weight increase case, and solve it with a balance between index size and effectiveness. Followed by, we extend the asynchronous propagation method to Pruned Landmark Labeling (PLL) for faster index maintenance and query processing with a smaller index size. Finally, we further optimize the index performance by reducing the index size through graph contraction and accelerating the index update through parallelized mix index update. Our experimental results on real-life and synthetic networks demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the relevant baselines on index maintenance.",

            "title": "Stream Processing of Shortest Path Query in Dynamic Road Networks",
            "abstract": "Shortest path query in road network is pervasive in various location-based services nowadays. As the business expands, the scalability issue becomes severer and more servers are deployed to cope with it. Moreover, as the traffic condition keeps changing over time, the existing index-based approaches can hardly adapt to the real-life dynamic environment. Therefore, batch shortest path algorithms have been proposed recently to answer a set of queries together using shareable computation. Besides, they can also work in a highly dynamic environment as no index is needed. However, the existing batch algorithms either assume the batch queries are finely decomposed or just process them without differentiation, resulting in poor query efficiency. In this work, we assume the traffic condition is stable over a short period and treat the issued queries within that period as a stream of query sets. Specifically, we first propose three query set decomposition methods to cluster one query set into multiple query subsets: Zigzag that considers the 1-N shared computation; Co-Clustering that considers the source and target's spatial locality; and Search-Space-Aware that further incorporates search space estimation. After that, we propose two batch algorithms that take advantage of the previously decomposed query sets for efficient query answering: R2R that finds a set of approximate shortest paths from one region to another with bounded error; and Local Cache that improves the existing Global Cache with higher cache hit ratio. Finally, we design three efficient stream processing methods for intra-batch shared computation. The experiments on a large real-world query sets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our decomposition methods compared with the state-of-the-art batch algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Route planning is ubiquitous and has a profound impact on our daily life. However, the existing path algorithms tend to produce similar paths between similar OD (Origin-Destination) pairs because they optimize query results without considering their influence on the whole network, which further introduces congestions. Therefore, we investigate the problem of diversifying the top-k paths between an OD pair such that their similarities are under a threshold while their total length is minimal. However, the current solutions all depend on the expensive graph traversal which is too slow to apply in practice. Therefore, we first propose an edge deviation and concatenation-based method to avoid the expensive graph search in path enumeration. After that, we dive into the path relations and propose a path similarity computation method with constant complexity, and propose a pruning technique to improve efficiency. Finally, we provide the completeness and efficiency-oriented solutions to further accelerate the query answering. Evaluations on the real-life road networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "\n Multi-Constraint Shortest Path (\n MCSP\n ) generalizes the classic shortest path from single to multiple criteria such that more personalized needs can be satisfied. However,\n MCSP\n query is essentially a high-dimensional skyline problem and thus time-consuming to answer. Although the current\n Forest Hop Labeling (FHL)\n index can answer\n MCSP\n efficiently, it takes a long time to construct and lacks the flexibility to handle arbitrary criteria combinations. In this paper, we propose a skyline-cube-based\n FHL\n index that can handle the flexible\n MCSP\n efficiently. Firstly, we analyze the relation between low and high-dimensional skyline paths theoretically and use a cube to organize them hierarchically. After that, we propose methods to derive the high-dimensional path from the lower ones, which can adapt to the flexible scenario naturally and reduce the expensive high dimensional path concatenation. Then we introduce efficient methods for both single and multi-hop cube concatenations and propose pruning methods to further alleviate the computation. Finally, we improve the\n FHL\n structure with lower height for faster construction and query.

However, small-world networks keep evolving in real life, making it indispensable to study the maintenance of shortest path index. In this work, we adopt the state-of-the-art Parallel Shortest-distance Labeling (PSL) as the underlying 2-hop labeling construction method, and design algorithms to support efficient update of the index given edge weight change (increase and decrease) in the network. Specifically, we focus on weighted PSL (WPSL) and propose the update propagation mechanism for both synchronous propagation and asynchronous propagation. We then identify the curse of pruning power generated for the propagation under edge weight increase, and solve this problem with a balance between index size and effectiveness. Finally, we extend the proposed asynchronous propagation method to Pruned Landmark Labeling (PLL) for faster index maintenance and query processing with smaller index size. Our experimental results on real-life and synthetic networks demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms on index maintenance.",
