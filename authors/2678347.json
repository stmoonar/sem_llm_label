            "abstract": "The half-day workshop on Cryptoasset Analytics allows researchers from different disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets. This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program features a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Workshop topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

            "abstract": "Monero is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that allows users to obscure their transaction graph by including chaff coins, called\"mixins,\"along with the actual coins they spend. In this report, we empirically evaluate two weak- nesses in Monero's mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62% of transaction inputs with one or more mixins are vulnerable to\"chain-reaction\"analysis -- that is, the real input can be deduced by elimination, e.g. because the mixins they include are spent by 0-mixin transactions. Sec- ond, Monero mixins are sampled in such a way that the mixins can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually the\"newest\"input. We estimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80% accuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Our analysis uses only public blockchain data, in contrast to earlier attacks requiring active participation in the network. While the first weakness primarily affects Monero transactions made by older software versions (i.e., prior to RingCT), the second weakness is applicable to the newest versions as well. We propose and evaluate a countermeasure de- rived from blockchain data that can improve the privacy of future transactions.",

Our study reveals that this market is funded with multiple thousand bitcoins and generated a turnover of almost 29.5 million USD over the course of 13 months. Assessing the resilience of the market against a well-funded attacker, we discover that in a typical scenario, a selective attack with a 90% success rate requires an investment of 14 000\u2013 54 000 USD (which is recoverable after the attack). We present economic arguments to explain the existence of this novel market for anonymity and underpin the hypothesis of heterogeneous time preference with empirical data.",

            "abstract": "In the cryptographic currency Bitcoin, all transactions are recorded in the blockchain - a public, global, and immutable ledger. Because transactions are public, Bitcoin and its users employ obfuscation to maintain a degree of financial privacy. Critically, and in contrast to typical uses of obfuscation, in Bitcoin obfuscation is not aimed against the system designer but is instead enabled by design. We map sixteen proposed privacy-preserving techniques for Bitcoin on an obfuscation-vs.-cryptography axis, and find that those that are used in practice tend toward obfuscation. We argue that this has led to a balance between privacy and regulatory acceptance.",

It surveys and compares four known techniques, proposes tailored metrics to identify the use of each technique (but not necessarily its users), and presents longitudinal measurements indicating adoption trends and teething troubles. There is a tradeoff between the choice of users' preferred protection mechanisms and the risk that pertaining transactions can be singled out, which hurts privacy due to smaller anonymity sets unless a critical mass adopts the mechanism.",

            "abstract": "We provide a first systematic account of opportunities and limitations of anti-money laundering (AML) in Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency proliferating on the Internet. Our starting point is the observation that Bitcoin attracts criminal activity as many say it is an anonymous transaction system. While this claim does not stand up to scrutiny, several services offering increased transaction anonymization have emerged in the Bitcoin ecosystem - such as Bitcoin Fog, BitLaundry, and the Send Shared functionality of Blockchain.info. Some of these services routinely handle the equivalent of 6-digit dollar amounts. In a series of experiments, we use reverse-engineering methods to understand the mode of operation and try to trace anonymized transactions back to our probe accounts. While Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info successfully anonymize our test transactions, we can link the input and output transactions of BitLaundry. Against the backdrop of these findings, it appears unlikely that a Know-Your-Customer principle can be enforced in the Bitcoin system. Hence, we sketch alternative AML strategies accounting for imperfect knowledge of true identities but exploiting public information in the transaction graph, and discuss the implications for Bitcoin as a decentralized currency.",
