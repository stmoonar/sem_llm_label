            "abstract": "Federated knowledge discovery and data mining are challenged to assess the trustworthiness of data originating from autonomous sources while protecting confidentiality and privacy. Truth-finding algorithms help corroborate data from disagreeing sources. For each query it receives, a truth-finding algorithm predicts a truth value of the answer, possibly updating the trustworthiness factor of each source. Few works, however, address the issues of confidentiality and privacy. We devise and present a secure secret-sharing-based multi-party computation protocol for pseudo-equality tests that are used in truth-finding algorithms to compute additions depending on a condition. The protocol guarantees confidentiality of the data and privacy of the sources. We also present variants of truth-finding algorithms that would make the computation faster when executed using secure multi-party computation. We empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol on two state-of-the-art truth-finding algorithms, Cosine, and 3-Estimates, and compare them with that of the baseline plain algorithms. The results confirm that the secret-sharing-based secure multi-party algorithms are as accurate as the corresponding baselines but for proposed numerical approximations that significantly reduce the efficiency loss incurred.",

            "abstract": "Scholarly articles in mathematical fields feature mathematical statements such as theorems, propositions, etc., as well as their proofs. Extracting them from the PDF representation of the articles requires understanding of scientific text along with visual and font-based indicators. We pose this problem as a multimodal classification problem using text, font features, and bitmap image rendering of the PDF as different modalities. In this paper we propose a multimodal machine learning approach for extraction of theorem-like environments and proofs, based on late fusion of features extracted by individual unimodal classifiers, taking into account the sequential succession of blocks in the document. For the text modality, we pretrain a new language model on a 11 GB scientific corpus; experiments shows similar performance for our task than a model (RoBERTa) pretrained on 160 GB, with faster convergence while requiring much less fine-tuning data. Font-based information relies on training a 128-cell LSTM on the sequence of font names and sizes within each block. Bitmap renderings are dealt with using an EfficientNetv2 deep network tuned to classify each image block. Finally, a simple CRF-based approach uses the features of the multimodal model along with information on block sequences. Experimental results show the benefits of using a multimodal approach vs any single modality, as well as major performance improvements using the CRF modeling of block sequences.",

Applications include improving the performance of information extraction techniques that rely on the style used in each document class, or determining the publisher of a given scientific article. We introduce two approaches: a simple classifier based on hand-coded document style features, as well as a CNN-based classifier taking as input the bitmap representation of the first page of the PDF article. We experiment on a dataset of around 100k articles from arXiv, where labels come from the source LATEX document associated to each article. Results show the CNN approach significantly outperforms that based on simple document style features, reaching over 90% average F1-score on a task to distinguish among several dozens of the most common document classes.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the efficient computation of the provenance of rich queries over graph databases. We show that semiring-based provenance annotations enrich the expressive-ness of routing queries over graphs. Several algorithms have previously been proposed for provenance computation over graphs, each yielding a trade-off between time complexity and generality. Here, we address the limitations of these algorithms and propose a new one, partially bridging a complexity and expres-siveness gap and adding to the algorithmic toolkit for solving this problem. Importantly, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of semirings and corresponding algorithms, establishing which practical approaches are needed in different cases. We implement and comprehensively evaluate several practical applications of the problem (e.g., shortest distances, top- \ud835\udc58 shortest distances, Boolean or integer path features), each corresponding to a specific semiring and algorithm, that depends on the properties of the semiring. On several real-world and synthetic graph datasets, we show that the algorithms we propose exhibit large practical benefits for processing rich graph queries.",

This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Treewidth is a parameter that measures how tree-like a relational instance is, and whether it can reasonably be decomposed into a tree. Many computation tasks are known to be tractable on databases of small treewidth, but computing the treewidth of a given instance is intractable. This article is the first large-scale experimental study of treewidth and tree decompositions of real-world database instances (25 datasets from 8 different domains, with sizes ranging from a few thousand to a few million vertices). The goal is to determine which data, if any, can benefit of the wealth of algorithms for databases of small treewidth. For each dataset, we obtain upper and lower bound estimations of their treewidth, and study the properties of their tree decompositions. We show in particular that, even when treewidth is high, using partial tree decompositions can result in data structures that can assist algorithms.",
