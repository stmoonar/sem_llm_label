            "abstract": "Many real-world data can be modeled as heterogeneous graphs that contain multiple types of nodes and edges. Meanwhile, due to excellent performance, heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have received more and more attention. However, the existing work mainly focuses on the design of novel GNN models, while ignoring another important issue that also has a large impact on the model performance, namely the missing attributes of some node types. The handcrafted attribute completion requires huge expert experience and domain knowledge. Also, considering the differences in semantic characteristics between nodes, the attribute completion should be fine-grained, i.e., the attribute completion operation should be node-specific. Moreover, to improve the performance of the downstream graph learning task, attribute completion and the training of the heterogeneous GNN should be jointly optimized rather than viewed as two separate processes. To address the above challenges, we propose a differentiable attribute completion framework called AutoAC for automated completion operation search in heterogeneous GNNs. We first propose an expressive completion operation search space, including topology-dependent and topology-independent completion operations. Then, we propose a continuous relaxation schema and further propose a differentiable completion algorithm where the completion operation search is formulated as a bi-level joint optimization problem. To improve the search efficiency, we leverage two optimization techniques: discrete constraints and auxiliary unsupervised graph node clustering. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets reveal that AutoAC outperforms the SOTA handcrafted heterogeneous GNNs and the existing attribute completion method.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in handling heterogeneous graphs. In existing heterogeneous GNNs, meta-path plays an essential role. However, recent work pointed out that simple homogeneous graph model without meta-path can also achieve comparable results, which calls into question the necessity of meta-path. In this paper, we first present the intrinsic difference about meta-path-based and meta-path-free models, i.e., how to select neighbors for node aggregation. Then, we propose a novel framework to utilize the rich type semantic information in heterogeneous graphs comprehensively, namely HAGNN (Hybrid Aggregation for Heterogeneous GNNs). The core of HAGNN is to leverage the meta-path neighbors and the directly connected neighbors simultaneously for node aggregations. HAGNN divides the overall aggregation process into two phases: meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation. During the intra-type aggregation phase, we propose a new data structure called fused meta-path graph and perform structural semantic aware aggregation on it. Finally, we combine the embeddings generated by each phase. Compared with existing heterogeneous GNN models, HAGNN can take full advantage of the heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experimental results on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction tasks show that HAGNN outperforms the existing modes, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAGNN.",

            "abstract": "Graph collaborative filtering has achieved great success in capturing users' preferences over items. Despite effectiveness, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods suffer from data sparsity in real scenarios. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been used to address the problem of data sparsity. However, most CL-based methods only leverage the original user-item interaction graph to construct the CL task, lacking the explicit exploitation of the higher-order information (i.e., user-user and item-item relationships). Even for the CL-based method that uses the higher-order information, the reception field of the higher-order information is fixed and regardless of the difference between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive multi-view fusion contrastive learning framework, named AdaMCL, for graph collaborative filtering. To exploit the higher-order information more accurately, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy to fuse the embeddings learned from the user-item and user-user graphs. Moreover, we propose a multi-view fusion contrastive learning paradigm to construct effective CL tasks. Besides, to alleviate the noisy information caused by aggregating higher-order neighbors, we propose a layer-level CL task. Extensive experimental results reveal that AdaMCL is effective and outperforms existing collaborative filtering models significantly.",

            "abstract": "As one of the typical tasks of spatial temporal forecasting, traffic prediction has attracted extensive research attention in recent studies. Recent works usually combine time series modeling methods and graph neural networks to capture the temporal dynamic trends and spatial static dependencies together. However, we find that the temporal static characteristic and spatial dynamic correlations do also exist in the traffic flow, which are neglected or partially considered in previous methods. To capture such characteristics, we propose a novel method for traffic prediction, which models the Spatial Temporal Staticity and Dynamicity (STSD) together. Specifically, besides the traditional spatial and temporal encoder, we propose a pre-training module based on self-supervised contrastive learning to learn the location representation and thus capture the temporal static characteristic. Then, we propose a flow-aware dynamic graph learning module to capture the spatial dynamic correlations. Besides, to correct the original graph built from node distance, a feature reconstruction-based static graph learning module is introduced. The original, static, and dynamic graph are combined together in STSD to model the spatial staticity and dynamicity. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets reveal that STSD can outperform existing traffic forecasting methods.",

            "abstract": "As the study of graph neural networks becomes more intensive and comprehensive, their robustness and security have received great research interest. The existing global attack methods treat all nodes in the graph as their attack targets. Although existing methods have achieved excellent results, there is still considerable space for improvement. The key problem is that the current approaches rigidly follow the definition of global attacks. They ignore an important issue, i.e., different nodes have different robustness and are not equally resilient to attacks. From a global attacker's view, we should arrange the attack budget wisely, rather than wasting them on highly robust nodes. To this end, we propose a totally new method named partial graph attack (PGA), which selects the vulnerable nodes as attack targets. First, to select the vulnerable items, we propose a hierarchical target selection policy, which allows attackers to only focus on easy-to-attack nodes. Then, we propose a cost-effective anchor-picking policy to pick the most promising anchors for adding or removing edges, and a more aggressive iterative greedy-based attack method to perform more efficient attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PGA can achieve significant improvements in both attack effect and attack efficiency compared to existing graph global attack methods.",

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in various applications. Inspired by the success of GNNs, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to introduce GNNs into session-based recommendation and have achieved significant results. Nevertheless, due to the highly diverse types of potential information in sessions, existing GNNs-based methods perform differently on different session datasets, leading to the need for efficient design of neural networks adapted to various session recommendation scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Automated neural architecture search for Graph-based Session Recommendation, namely AutoGSR, a framework that provides a practical and general solution to automatically find the optimal GNNs-based session recommendation model. In AutoGSR, we propose two novel GNN operations to build an expressive and compact search space. Building upon the search space, we employ a differentiable search algorithm to search for the optimal graph neural architecture. Furthermore, to consider all types of session information together, we propose to learn the item meta knowledge, which acts as a priori knowledge for guiding the optimization of final session representations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoGSR is able to find effective neural architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the neural architecture search for the session-based recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to achieve malicious purposes, such as promote or demote a set of target items. Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.",

Unfortunately, given a domain-specific dataset, searching effective feature interaction operations and combinations from a huge candidate space requires significant expert experience and computational costs. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has achieved great success in discovering high-quality network architectures automatically. However, due to the diversity of feature interaction operations and combinations, the existing NAS-based work that treats the architecture search as a black-box optimization problem over a discrete search space suffers from low efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to explore a more efficient architecture search method. To achieve this goal, we propose NAS-CTR, a differentiable neural architecture search approach for CTR prediction. First, we design a novel and expressive architecture search space and a continuous relaxation scheme to make the search space differentiable. Second, we formulate the architecture search for CTR prediction as a joint optimization problem with discrete constraints on architectures and leverage proximal iteration to solve the constrained optimization problem. Additionally, a straightforward yet effective method is proposed to eliminate the aggregation of skip connections. Extensive experimental results reveal that NAS-CTR can outperform the SOTA human-crafted architectures and other NAS-based methods in both test accuracy and search efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Based on the significant improvement of model robustness by AT (Adversarial Training), various variants have been proposed to further boost the performance. Well-recognized methods have focused on different components of AT (e.g., designing loss functions and leveraging additional unlabeled data). It is generally accepted that stronger perturbations yield more robust models. However, how to generate stronger perturbations efficiently is still missed. In this paper, we propose an efficient automated attacker called A2 to boost AT by generating the optimal perturbations on-the-fly during training. A2 is a parameterized automated attacker to search in the attacker space for the best attacker against the defense model and examples. Extensive experiments across different datasets demonstrate that A2 generates stronger perturbations with low extra cost and reliably improves the robustness of various AT methods against different attacks.",

            "title": "PSP: Progressive Space Pruning for Efficient Graph Neural Architecture Search",
            "abstract": "Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has achieved great success in many graph learning tasks such as node classifi-cation and graph classification. However, there is no single GNN architecture that can fit different graph datasets. Designing an effective GNN for a specific graph dataset requires considerable expert experience and huge computational costs. Inspired by the success of neural architecture search (NAS), searching the GNN architectures automatically has attracted more and more attention. Motivated by the fact that the search space plays a critical role in the NAS, we propose a novel and effective graph neural architecture search method called PSP from the perspective of search space design in this paper. We first propose an expressive search space composed of multiple cells. Instead of searching the entire architecture, we focus on searching the architecture of the cell. Then, we propose a progressive space pruning-based algorithm to search the architectures efficiently. Moreover, the data-specific search spaces and architectures ob-tained by PSP can be transferred to new graph datasets based on meta-learning. Extensive experimental results on different types of graph datasets reveal that PSP outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted architectures and the existing NAS methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",
