            "abstract": "Current safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) studies are focused on perception limitations, decision uncertainties, and human-machine interaction, while it tends to overlook the impact of the control system on SOTIF. This letter seeks to address this gap by establishing a lifetime management framework for vehicle dynamics control (VDC) systems. At first, we provide an introduction to the fundamental composition and control architecture of a VDC system. Furthermore, we identify representative hazard scenarios, trigger conditions and performance deficiencies in VDC. Building upon data-driven fault-tolerant control theory, a comprehensive framework consisting of adaptive filter, iterative learning, fault diagnosis and identification, and fault-tolerant control modules is presented. The proposed framework is specifically designed to address trigger conditions such as driving environment variations, integration of multiple control systems, performance degradation due to components aging and maintenance. The framework features online driving state supervision, driving risk measurement, and intervention for mitigation of the SOTIF issues. As a summary of a part of Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL), the letter reports the development of an intelligent vehicle lifetime management framework with a strong focus on SOTIF issues.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, open-pit mining has seen significant advancement, the cooperative operation of various specialized machinery substantially enhancing the efficiency of mineral extraction. However, the harsh environment and complex conditions in open-pit mines present substantial challenges for the implementation of autonomous transportation systems. This research introduces a novel paradigm that integrates Scenario Engineering (SE) with autonomous transportation systems to significantly improve the trustworthiness, robustness, and efficiency in open-pit mines by incorporating the four key components of SE, including Scenario Feature Extractor, Intelligence and Index, Calibration and Certification, and Verification and Validation. This paradigm has been validated in two famous open-pit mines, the experiment results demonstrate marked improvements in robustness, trustworthiness, and efficiency. By enhancing the capacity, scalability, and diversity of autonomous transportation, this paradigm fosters the integration of SE and parallel driving and finally propels the achievement of the \u20186S\u2019 objectives.",

            "abstract": "This letter is the third report from a series of IEEE TIV's decentralized and hybrid workshops (DHWs) on intelligent vehicles for education (IV4E). Autonomous racing serves as a vital platform for nurturing engineering talents among university students, contributing to the development of skills essential for the intelligent vehicle industry. This letter investigates how recent emerging techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and the Metaverse, can contribute to organizing IV4E-oriented autonomous racing events. Among these DHWs, scholars from diverse fields have collectively explored the integration of LLMs and the Metaverse into autonomous racing for educational purposes. The discussions emphasize the role of Metaverse in creating dynamic and immersive training virtual reality platforms and the role of LLMs in enhancing race commentary and the spectator experience. Within this context, the Metaverse introduces complex scenarios to the racetrack, maintaining suspense about the winning team until a race's final moment. This dynamic feature excites the race and motivates the participating teams to intensify their competition efforts. LLMs facilitate personalized commentary, inspiring spectators to become future participants in these races. Our DHWs highlighted a future in which technology, autonomy, and education intersect, fostering inclusive, educational, and engaging autonomous racing events.",

This letter presents a framework for integrating sustainable development goals into ITS lighting systems. We first explore the necessity of headlights in future traffic systems, particularly in the context of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Moreover, we discuss active safety technologies, such as night perception enhancement and collaborative lighting in connected vehicles, which contribute to enhancing safety during nighttime driving. Next, the letter analyzes the impact of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication on intelligent street light systems. We propose a novel street light perception enhancement framework based on V2I, along with an enhanced lighting scheme for faulty vehicles. Lastly, the letter addresses the importance of energy conservation in future networked street lighting system. Several energy-saving schemes, including demand-based lighting and time-of-day optimization, are discussed, emphasizing the need for efficient energy management and sustainable practices in lighting infrastructure.

            "abstract": "End-to-end motion planners have shown great potential for enabling fully autonomous driving. However, when facing out-of-distribution (OOD) events, these planners might not guarantee the optimal prediction of control commands. To better enhance safety, an end-to-end method that benefits robust and general policy learning from potential OOD events is urgently desirable. In this perspective, Sore4PMP, a hierarchical parallel motion planner, is presented as a suitable solution. Based on raw perception data and descriptive prompts, Sore4PMP can first leverage the advanced generative capabilities of Sora to generate virtual OOD events, and then integrate these events into the decision-making process, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in emergency scenarios. With a comprehensive outlook, this perspective aims to provide a potential direction for the development of foundation models coupled with autonomous driving and finally promote the safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of AVs.",

It is found that research on intelligent vehicles is dominated by researchers and institutions from China. Researchers from the US are the second largest contributor to the transaction, whilst those from Germany rank the third. It is also found that, Fei-Yue Wang, Mohan Manubhai Trivedi, and J. Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.",

            "abstract": "Intelligent vehicles (IVs) have gained worldwide attention due to their increased convenience, safety advantages, and potential commercial value. Despite predictions of commercial deployment by 2025, implementation remains limited to small-scale validation, with precise tracking controllers and motion planners being essential prerequisites for IVs. This article reviews state-of-the-art motion planning methods for IVs, including pipeline planning and end-to-end planning methods. The study examines the selection, expansion, and optimization operations in a pipeline method, while it investigates training approaches and validation scenarios for driving tasks in end-to-end methods. Experimental platforms are reviewed to assist readers in choosing suitable training and validation strategies. A side-by-side comparison of the methods is provided to highlight their strengths and limitations, aiding system-level design choices. Current challenges and future perspectives are also discussed in this survey.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a widespread interest in autonomous driving, with researchers primarily focusing on issues such as edge computing, constrained scenarios, and model generalization. ChatGPT is a large-scale natural language model based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer algorithm. It has gained popularity worldwide and is commonly referred to as a \"large model\" or \"foundation model\" due to its high parameter count (over 100M). These models possess human-like understanding capabilities, enabling them to address complex challenges through self-learning and unifying multiple subtasks. While these models are primarily designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness has also been proven in the visual and multi-modal domains. Therefore, foundation models hold promise for contributing to the development of autonomous driving technology. Autonomous driving in mining areas is considered an edge scenario, and the reliable capabilities of foundation models make them highly beneficial in such complex and harsh working environments. This article aims to explore the characteristics of mining areas, the features of foundation models, as well as the framework and key technologies related to large models in mining. It provides technical guidance for the implementation of next-generation (mining 5.0) foundation models in unmanned mines.",

Although a number of surveys have reviewed research achievements in this field, they are still limited in specific tasks, lack of systematic summary and research directions in the future. Here we propose a Survey of Surveys (SoS) for total technologies of AD and IVs that reviews the history, summarizes the milestones, and provides the perspectives, ethics, and future research directions. To our knowledge, this article is the first SoS with milestones in AD and IVs, which constitutes our complete research work together with two other technical surveys. We anticipate that this article will bring novel and diverse insights to researchers and abecedarians, and serve as a bridge between past and future.",
