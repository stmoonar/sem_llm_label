            "abstract": "In order to diagnose sleep problems, it is critical to correctly identify sleep stages which is a labor-intensive task. Due to rising data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computational power and storage, artificial intelligence has been more popular in recent years. Automated sleep staging through cardiac rhythm is one of the active research areas that has gained attention over the last decade. In this study, we review four recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods for automated sleep staging, datasets developed in recent years, and discuss their performance evaluations.",

            "abstract": "There is a concerning rise of offensive language on the content generated by the crowd over various social platforms. Such language might bully or hurt the feelings of an individual or a community. Recently, the research community has investigated and developed different supervised approaches and training datasets to detect or prevent offensive monologues or dialogues automatically. In this study, we propose a model for text classification consisting of modular cleaning phase and tokenizer, three embedding methods, and eight classifiers. Our experiments shows a promising result for detection of offensive language on our dataset obtained from Twitter. Considering hyperparameter optimization, three methods of AdaBoost, SVM and MLP had highest average of F1-score on popular embedding method of TF-IDF.",

Large amounts of text data are being generated on many heterogeneous sources and platforms on the internet.

In this research, we evaluate the runtime of the RDD and the Spark-SQL APIs of the Apache Spark framework to extract text features from the corpus of english Wikipedia. As a result, we demonstrate the significant runtime performance of the SparkSQL compared to RDD API.",

            "abstract": "In the global pandemic, social media platforms are the primary source of information exchange. Social bots are one of the main sources of misinformation in the COVID-19 pandemic but do social bots spread the fake and real news with the same ratio as human accounts on social media platforms? Can bot detection improve fake news detection on social media platforms? Who presents more fake news in the COVID-19 pandemic, Human or social bots? This work provides preliminary research results based on limited data to answer these questions, but it opens a new perspective on fake news detection and bot detection on online platforms. We use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) to create a new model for fake news detection. We use the transfer learning model to detect bot accounts in the COVID-19 data set. Then apply new features to improve the new fake news detection model in the COVID-19 data set.",
