            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to predict the subsequent items which may interest users via comprehensively modeling users' complex preference embedded in the sequence of user-item interactions. However, most of existing SRSs often model users' single low-level preference based on item ID information while ignoring the high-level preference revealed by item attribute information, such as item category. Furthermore, they often utilize limited sequence context information to predict the next item while overlooking richer inter-item semantic relations. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical preference modeling framework to substantially model the complex low- and high-level preference dynamics for accurate sequential recommendation. Specifically, in the framework, a novel dual-transformer module and a novel dual contrastive learning scheme have been designed to discriminatively learn users' low- and high-level preference and to effectively enhance both low- and high-level preference learning respectively. In addition, a novel semantics-enhanced context embedding module has been devised to generate more informative context embedding for further improving the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have demonstrated both the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones and the rationality of our design.",

We introduce the reparametrization method to convert the discrete action space into a continuous space, making the agent robust and random. For the reward part, we design a multi-factor function to reward the agent keeping a balance between frame usage and accuracy.

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item which interests users via modeling their interest in items over time. Most of the existing works on sequential recommendation model users\u2019 dynamic interest in specific items while overlooking users\u2019 static interest revealed by some static attribute information of items, e.g., category, brand. Moreover, existing works often only consider the positive excitation of a user\u2019s historical interactions on his/her next choice on candidate items while ignoring the commonly existing negative excitation, resulting in insufficiently modeling dynamic interest. The overlook of static interest and negative excitation will lead to incomplete interest modeling and thus impedes the recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose modeling both static interest and negative excitation for dynamic interest to further improve the recommendation performance. Accordingly, we design a novel Static-Dynamic Interest Learning (SDIL) framework featured with a novel Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation Modeling (TPNE) module for accurate sequential recommendation. TPNE is specially designed for comprehensively modeling dynamic interest based on temporal positive and negative excitation learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SDIL can effectively capture both static and dynamic interest and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "The session-based recommendation aims to predict users' immediate next actions based on their short-term behaviors reflected by past and ongoing sessions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) recently dominated the related studies, yet their performance heavily relies on graph structures, which are often predefined, task-specific, and designed heuristically. Furthermore, existing graph-based methods either neglect implicit correlations among items or consider explicit and implicit relationships altogether in the same graphs. We propose to decouple explicit and implicit relationships among items. As such, we can capture the prior knowledge encapsulated in explicit dependencies and learned implicit correlations among items simultaneously in a flexible and more interpretable manner for effective recommendations. We design a dual graph neural network that leverages the feature representations extracted by two GNNs: a graph neural network with a single gate (SG-GNN) and an adaptive graph neural network (A-GNN). The former models explicit dependencies among items. The latter employs a self-learning strategy to capture implicit correlations among items. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, achieving 18.46% and 70.72% improvement in HR@20, and 49.10% and 115.29% improvement in MRR@20 on Diginetica and LastFM datasets.",

            "abstract": "Tree-based models and deep neural networks are two schools of effective classification methods in machine learning. While tree-based models are robust irrespective of data domain, deep neural networks have advantages in handling high-dimensional data. Adding a differentiable neural decision forest to the neural network can generally help exploit the benefits of both models. Therefore, traditional decision trees diverge into a bagging version (i.e., random forest) and a boosting version (i.e., gradient boost decision tree). In this work, we aim to harness the advantages of both bagging and boosting by applying gradient boost to a neural decision forest. We propose a gradient boost that can learn the residual using neural decision forest, considering the residual as a part for the final prediction. Besides, we design a structure for learning the parameters of neural decision forest and gradient boost module in contiguous steps, which is extendable to incorporate multiple gradient-boosting modules in an end-to-end manner. Our extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate the competitive performance and efficiency of our model against a series of baseline methods in solving various machine learning tasks.",

The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.",

Through a standardized publishing, discovery, and composition process, SOC enables the orchestration of multiple (including third-party) services to constitute new applications. Hereby the quality of a composite service is fundamentally determined by its constituent services. To satisfy users\u2019 non-functional requirements, it is important to identify the optimal set of constituent services to participate in the composition. Practical applications usually require the optimal set to be identified with high efficiency and accuracy. This poses challenges to existing service composition methods as they either provide no accuracy guarantee or are inapplicable to large-scale problems. The challenges become more evident when considering service graphs, which contain multiple execution paths that could multiply the computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical skyline-based approach for highly efficient service composition, which maintains and reuses varying levels of service skylines to accelerate service composition. We discuss how the skylines can be selectively computed, lazily updated, and efficiently retrieved for reuse. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Given reports of various accuracy degrees from workers, it is important to make wise use of these reports to derive accurate task results. Intuitively, a task result derived from a sufficient number of reports bears lower uncertainty, and higher uncertainty otherwise. Existing report aggregation research, however, has largely neglected the above uncertainty issue. In this regard, we propose a novel report aggregation framework that defines and incorporates a new confidence measure to quantify the uncertainty associated with tasks and workers, thereby enhancing result accuracy. In particular, we employ a link analysis approach to propagate confidence information, subgraph extraction techniques to prioritize workers, and a progressive approach to gradually explore and consolidate workers\u2019 reports associated with less confident workers and tasks. The framework is generic enough to be combined with existing report aggregation methods.

            "title": "Locality-Sensitive State-Guided Experience Replay Optimization for Sparse Rewards in Online Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Online recommendation requires handling rapidly changing user preferences. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an effective means of capturing users' dynamic interest during interactions with recommender systems. Generally, it is challenging to train a DRL agent in online recommender systems because of the sparse rewards caused by the large action space (e.g., candidate item space) and comparatively fewer user interactions. Leveraging experience replay (ER) has been extensively studied to conquer the issue of sparse rewards. However, they adapt poorly to the complex environment of online recommender systems and are inefficient in learning an optimal strategy from past experience. As a step to filling this gap, we propose a novel state-aware experience replay model, in which the agent selectively discovers the most relevant and salient experiences and is guided to find the optimal policy for online recommendations. In particular, a locality-sensitive hashing method is proposed to selectively retain the most meaningful experience at scale and a prioritized reward-driven strategy is designed to replay more valuable experiences with higher chance. We formally show that the proposed method guarantees the upper and lower bound on experience replay and optimizes the space complexity, as well as empirically demonstrate our model's superiority to several existing experience replay methods over three benchmark simulation platforms.",
