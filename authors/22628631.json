            "abstract": "\n Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to draw conclusions about populations from sample data, typically represented in tables. With the prevalence of graph representations in real-life applications, hypothesis testing on graphs is gaining importance. In this work, we formalize node, edge, and path hypotheses on attributed graphs. We develop a sampling-based hypothesis testing framework, which can accommodate existing hypothesis-agnostic graph sampling methods. To achieve accurate and time-efficient sampling, we then propose a Path-Hypothesis-Aware SamplEr, PHASE, an\n m\n -dimensional random walk that accounts for the paths specified in the hypothesis. We further optimize its time efficiency and propose PHASE\n opt\n . Experiments on three real datasets demonstrate the ability of our framework to leverage common graph sampling methods for hypothesis testing, and the superiority of hypothesis-aware sampling methods in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.\n",

Among them, Smart Transportation [7,8], the integrated application of modern technologies and management strategies in transportation systems, refers to the adoption of new IoT solutions to improve urban mobility. These technologies aim to provide innovative solutions related to different modes of transport and traffic management and enable users to be better informed and make safer and 'smarter' use of transport networks. This talk presents SmartCityBus, a data-driven intelligent transportation system (ITS) whose main objective is to use online and offline data in order to provide accurate statistics and predictions and improve public transportation services in the short and medium/long term.",

            "abstract": "Transportation companies and organizations routinely collect huge volumes of passenger transportation data. By aggregating these data (e.g., counting the number of passengers going from a place to another in every 30 minute interval), it becomes possible to analyze the movement behavior of passengers in a metropolitan area. In this paper, we study the problem of finding important trends in passenger movements at varying granularities, which is useful in a wide range of applications such as target marketing, scheduling, and travel intent prediction. Specifically, we study the extraction of movement patterns between regions that have significant flow. The huge number of possible patterns render their detection computationally hard. We propose algorithms that greatly reduce the search space and the computational cost of pattern detection. We study variants of patterns that could be useful to different problem instances, such as constrained patterns and top-k ranked patterns.",

We study the problem of con-tinuously tracking the origins of quantities at network vertices, as interactions take place over time. We target applications, such as financial exchange networks, where the selected transferred units at each interaction are not specified. We investigate several quantity selection policies that apply to different application scenarios. For each policy, we propose space- and time-efficient meta-data propagation mechanisms for continuously tracking provenance at vertices. For the hard case of proportional selection policy, we reduce the cost of tracking in practice, by either (i) limiting provenance tracking to a subset of vertices or groups of vertices, or (ii) tracking provenance only for quantities that were generated in the near past or limiting the provenance data in each vertex by a budget constraint. Our experimental evaluation on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our techniques compared to baseline approaches that extend flow computation algorithms to track provenance.",

            "abstract": "Temporal interaction networks capture the history of activities between entities along a timeline. At each interaction, some quantity of data (money, information, traffic) flows from one vertex of the network to another. Flow-based analysis can reveal important information, such as unusually large money transfers in a part of a financial transaction network. In this paper, we introduce the flow computation problem between two vertrices in an interaction network. We propose and study two models of flow computation, one based on a greedy flow transfer assumption and one that finds the maximum possible flow. We show that the greedy flow computation problem can be easily solved by a single scan of the interactions in time order. For the harder maximum flow problem, we propose precomputation and simplification approaches that can greatly reduce its complexity in practice. We also approach the problem of flow pattern enumeration in interaction networks and propose an effective path indexing technique. We evaluate our algorithms using real datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world phenomena are best represented as interaction networks with dynamic structures (e.g., transaction networks, social networks, traffic networks). Interaction networks capture flow of data which is transferred between their vertices along a timeline. Analyzing such networks is crucial toward comprehend- ing processes in them. A typical analysis task is the finding of motifs, which are small subgraph patterns that repeat themselves in the network. In this paper, we introduce network flow motifs, a novel type of motifs that model significant flow transfer among a set of vertices within a constrained time window. We design an algorithm for identifying flow motif instances in a large graph. Our algorithm can be easily adapted to find the top-k instances of maximal flow. In addition, we design a dynamic programming module that finds the instance with the maximum flow. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on three real datasets and identify flow motifs which are significant for these graphs. Our results show that our algorithm is scalable and that the real networks indeed include interesting motifs, which appear much more frequently than in randomly generated networks having similar characteristics.",
