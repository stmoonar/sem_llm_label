            "abstract": "Rank aggregation with pairwise comparisons is widely encountered in sociology, politics, economics, psychology, sports, etc. Given the enormous social impact and the consequent incentives, the potential adversary has a strong motivation to manipulate the ranking list. However, the ideal attack opportunity and the excessive adversarial capability cause the existing methods to be impractical. To fully explore the potential risks, we leverage an online attack on the vulnerable data collection process. Since it is independent of rank aggregation and lacks effective protection mechanisms, we disrupt the data collection process by fabricating pairwise comparisons without knowledge of the future data or the true distribution. From the game-theoretic perspective, the confrontation scenario between the online manipulator and the ranker who takes control of the original data source is formulated as a distributionally robust game that deals with the uncertainty of knowledge. Then we demonstrate that the equilibrium in the above game is potentially favorable to the adversary by analyzing the vulnerability of the sampling algorithms such as Bernoulli and reservoir methods. According to the above theoretical analysis, different sequential manipulation policies are proposed under a Bayesian decision framework and a large class of parametric pairwise comparison models. For attackers with complete knowledge, we establish the asymptotic optimality of the proposed policies. To increase the success rate of the sequential manipulation with incomplete knowledge, a distributionally robust estimator, which replaces the maximum likelihood estimation in a saddle point problem, provides a conservative data generation solution. Finally, the corroborating empirical evidence shows that the proposed method manipulates the results of rank aggregation methods in a sequential manner.",

            "title": "Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) has recently emerged as a popular method in recommendation systems (RS), closing the gap between metric learning and collaborative filtering. Following the convention of RS, existing practices exploit unique user representation in their model design. This paper focuses on a challenging scenario where a user has multiple categories of interests. Under this setting, the unique user representation might induce preference bias, especially when the item category distribution is imbalanced. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning (DPCML), with the hope of considering the commonly ignored minority interest of the user. The key idea behind DPCML is to introduce a set of multiple representations for each user in the system where users' preference toward an item is aggregated by taking the minimum item-user distance among their embedding set. Specifically, we instantiate two effective assignment strategies to explore a proper quantity of vectors for each user. Meanwhile, a Diversity Control Regularization Scheme (DCRS) is developed to accommodate the multi-vector representation strategy better. Theoretically, we show that DPCML could induce a smaller generalization error than traditional CML. Furthermore, we notice that CML-based approaches usually require negative sampling to reduce the heavy computational burden caused by the pairwise objective therein. In this paper, we reveal the fundamental limitation of the widely adopted hard-aware sampling from the One-Way Partial AUC (OPAUC) perspective and then develop an effective sampling alternative for the CML-based paradigm. Finally, comprehensive experiments over a range of benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of DPCML.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores test-agnostic long-tail recognition, a challenging long-tail task where the test label distributions are unknown and arbitrarily imbalanced. We argue that the variation in these distributions can be broken down hierarchically into global and local levels. The global ones reflect a broad range of diversity, while the local ones typically arise from milder changes, often focused on a particular neighbor. Traditional methods predominantly use a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) approach, targeting a few fixed test label distributions that exhibit substantial global variations. However, the local variations are left unconsidered. To address this issue, we propose a new MoE strategy, $\\mathsf{DirMixE}$, which assigns experts to different Dirichlet meta-distributions of the label distribution, each targeting a specific aspect of local variations. Additionally, the diversity among these Dirichlet meta-distributions inherently captures global variations. This dual-level approach also leads to a more stable objective function, allowing us to sample different test distributions better to quantify the mean and variance of performance outcomes. Theoretically, we show that our proposed objective benefits from enhanced generalization by virtue of the variance-based regularization. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of $\\mathsf{DirMixE}$. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/scongl/DirMixE}.",

            "title": "Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features",
            "abstract": "Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

            "abstract": "This paper explores the size-invariance of evaluation metrics in Salient Object Detection (SOD), especially when multiple targets of diverse sizes co-exist in the same image. We observe that current metrics are size-sensitive, where larger objects are focused, and smaller ones tend to be ignored. We argue that the evaluation should be size-invariant because bias based on size is unjustified without additional semantic information. In pursuit of this, we propose a generic approach that evaluates each salient object separately and then combines the results, effectively alleviating the imbalance. We further develop an optimization framework tailored to this goal, achieving considerable improvements in detecting objects of different sizes. Theoretically, we provide evidence supporting the validity of our new metrics and present the generalization analysis of SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

            "abstract": "The Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) is a crucial metric for machine learning, which is often a reasonable choice for applications like disease prediction and fraud detection where the datasets often exhibit a long-tail nature. However, most of the existing AUC-oriented learning methods assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. How to deal with domain shift remains widely open. This paper presents an early trial to attack AUC-oriented Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) (denoted as AUCUDA hence after). Specifically, we first construct a generalization bound that exploits a new distributional discrepancy for AUC. The critical challenge is that the AUC risk could not be expressed as a sum of independent loss terms, making the standard theoretical technique unavailable. We propose a new result that not only addresses the interdependency issue but also brings a much sharper bound with weaker assumptions about the loss function. Turning theory into practice, the original discrepancy requires complete annotations on the target domain, which is incompatible with UDA. To fix this issue, we propose a pseudo-labeling strategy and present an end-to-end training framework. Finally, empirical studies over five real-world datasets speak to the efficacy of our framework.",

            "abstract": "Due to the simplicity, intuition and explanation, most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed by following the pipeline of message passing. Although they achieve superior performances in many tasks, propagation-based GNNs possess three essential drawbacks. Firstly, the propagation tends to produce smooth effect, which meets the inductive bias of homophily, and causes two serious issues: over-smoothing issue and performance drop on networks with heterophily. Secondly, the propagations to each node are irrelevant, which prevents GNNs from modeling high-order relation, and cause the GNNs fragile to the attributes noises. Thirdly, propagation-based GNNs may be fragile to topology noise, since they heavily relay on propagation over the topology. Therefore, the propagation, as the key component of most GNNs, may be the essence of some serious issues in GNNs. To get to the root of these issue, this paper attempts to replace the propagation with a novel local operation. Quantitative experimental analysis reveals: 1) the existence of low-rank characteristic in the node attributes from ego-networks and 2) the performance improvement by reducing its rank. Motivated by this finding, this paper propose the Low-Rank GNNs, whose key component is the low-rank attribute matrix approximation in ego-network. The graph topology is employed to construct the ego-networks instead of message propagation, which is sensitive to topology noises. The proposed Low-Rank GNNs posses some attractive characteristics, including robust to topology and attribute noises, parameter-free and parallelizable. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance, robustness to noises and universality of the proposed Low-Rank GNNs.",

            "title": "Hi-SIGIR: Hierachical Semantic-Guided Image-to-image Retrieval via Scene Graph",
            "abstract": "Image-to-image retrieval, a fundamental task, aims at matching similar images based on a query image. Existing methods with convolutional neural networks are usually sensitive to low-level visual features, and ignore high-level semantic relationship information. This makes retrieving complicated images with multiple objects and various relationships a significant challenge. Although some works introduce the scene graph to capture the global semantic features of the objects and their relations, they ignore the local visual representations. In addition, due to the fragility of individual modal representations, poisoning attacks in adversarial scenarios are easily achieved, hurting the robustness of the visual-guided foundation image retrieval model. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel hierarchical semantic-guided image-to-image retrieval method via scene graph, called Hi-SIGIR. Specifically, to begin with, our proposed method generates the scene graph of an image. Then, our model extracts and learns both the visual and semantic features of the nodes and relations within the scene graphs. Next, these features are fused to obtain local information and sent to the graph neural network to obtain global information. Using these information, the similarity between the scene graphs of several images is calculated at both the local and global levels to perform image retrieval. Finally, we introduce a surrogate that calculates relevance in a cross-modal manner to understand image content better. Experimental evaluations on several wildly-used benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

            "title": "Focusing on Flexible Masks: A Novel Framework for Panoptic Scene Graph Generation with Relation Constraints",
            "abstract": "Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) presents pixel-wise instance detection and localization, leading to comprehensive and precise scene graphs. Current methods employ conventional Scene Graph Generation (SGG) frameworks to solve the PSG problem, neglecting the fundamental differences between bounding boxes and masks, i.e., bounding boxes are allowed overlap but masks are not. Since segmentation from the panoptic head has deviations, non-overlapping masks may not afford complete instance information. Subsequently, in the training phase, incomplete segmented instances may not be well-aligned to annotated ones, causing mismatched relations and insufficient training. During the inference phase, incomplete segmentation leads to incomplete scene graph prediction. To alleviate these problems, we construct a novel two-stage framework for the PSG problem. In the training phase, we design a proposal matching strategy, which replaces deterministic segmentation results with proposals extracted from the off-the-shelf panoptic head for label alignment, thereby ensuring the all-matching of training samples. In the inference phase, we present an innovative concept of employing relation predictions to constrain segmentation and design a relation-constrained segmentation algorithm. By reconstructing the process of generating segmentation results from proposals using predicted relation results, the algorithm recovers more valid instances and predicts more complete scene graphs. The experimental results show overall superiority, effectiveness, and robustness against adversarial attacks.",

            "title": "Rethinking Label Flipping Attack: From Sample Masking to Sample Thresholding",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have become fundamental building blocks for a wide range of AI applications. The popularity of these methods also makes them widely exposed to malicious attacks, which may cause severe security concerns. To understand the security properties of the ML/DL methods, researchers have recently started to turn their focus to adversarial attack algorithms that could successfully corrupt the model or clean data owned by the victim with imperceptible perturbations. In this paper, we study the Label Flipping Attack (LFA) problem, where the attacker expects to corrupt an ML/DL model's performance by flipping a small fraction of the labels in the training data. Prior art along this direction adopts combinatorial optimization problems, leading to limited scalability toward deep learning models. To this end, we propose a novel minimax problem which provides an efficient reformulation of the sample selection process in LFA. In the new optimization problem, the sample selection operation could be implemented with a single thresholding parameter. This leads to a novel training algorithm called Sample Thresholding. Since the objective function is differentiable and the model complexity does not depend on the sample size, we can apply Sample Thresholding to attack deep learning models. Moreover, since the victim's behavior is not predictable in a poisonous attack setting, we have to employ surrogate models to simulate the true model employed by the victim model. Seeing the problem, we provide a theoretical analysis of such a surrogate paradigm. Specifically, we show that the performance gap between the true model employed by the victim and the surrogate model is small under mild conditions. On top of this paradigm, we extend Sample Thresholding to the crowdsourced ranking task, where labels collected from the annotators are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Finally, experimental analyses on three real-world datasets speak to the efficacy of our method.",
