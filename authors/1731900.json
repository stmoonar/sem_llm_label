            "title": "WellFactor: Patient Profiling using Integrative Embedding of Healthcare Data",
            "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving healthcare industry, platforms now have access to not only traditional medical records, but also diverse data sets encompassing various patient interactions, such as those from healthcare web portals. To address this rich diversity of data, we introduce WellFactor: a method that derives patient profiles by integrating information from these sources. Central to our approach is the utilization of constrained low-rank approximation. WellFactor is optimized to handle the sparsity that is often inherent in healthcare data. Moreover, by incorporating task-specific label information, our method refines the embedding results, offering a more informed perspective on patients. One important feature of WellFactor is its ability to compute embeddings for new, previously unobserved patient data instantaneously, eliminating the need to revisit the entire data set or recomputing the embedding. Comprehensive evaluations on real-world healthcare data demonstrate WellFactor\u2019s effectiveness. It produces better results compared to other existing methods in classification performance, yields meaningful clustering of patients, and delivers consistent results in patient similarity searches and predictions.",

The system, designed to visualize different object types collectively and clearly display their semantic proximity, utilizes a co-embedding technique for knowledge fusion of multi-type data and projects the various types of objects onto a common lower-dimensional space. This produces a more informed representation and visualization that shows both in-type and across-type semantic proximity between objects. The system enables users\u2019 exploration of multi-type document data by providing embedding-based scatter plots to visualize semantic relations within and across object types. In addition, based on user relevance feedback of displayed objects, the system offers recommendations of relevant objects. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system and the underlying embedding method through comparison experiments with the proposed fusion-based approach.",

            "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop topic modeling allows users to explore and steer the process to produce better quality topics that align with their needs. When integrated into visual analytic systems, many existing automated topic modeling algorithms are given interactive parameters to allow users to tune or adjust them. However, this has limitations when the algorithms cannot be easily adapted to changes, and it is difficult to realize interactivity closely supported by underlying algorithms. Instead, we emphasize the concept of tight integration, which advocates for the need to co-develop interactive algorithms and interactive visual analytic systems in parallel to allow flexibility and scalability. In this article, we describe design goals for efficiently and effectively executing the concept of tight integration among computation, visualization, and interaction for hierarchical topic modeling of text data. We propose computational base operations for interactive tasks to achieve the design goals. To instantiate our concept, we present ArchiText, a prototype system for interactive hierarchical topic modeling, which offers fast, flexible, and algorithmically valid analysis via tight integration. Utilizing interactive hierarchical topic modeling, our technique lets users generate, explore, and flexibly steer hierarchical topics to discover more informed topics and their document memberships.",

            "abstract": "Complex relationships among entities can be modeled very effectively using hypergraphs. Hypergraphs model real-world data by allowing a hyperedge to include two or more entities. Clustering of hypergraphs enables us to group the similar entities together. While most existing algorithms solely consider the connection structure of a hypergraph to solve the clustering problem, we can boost the clustering performance by considering various features associated with the entities as well as auxiliary relationships among the entities. Also, we can further improve the clustering performance if some of the labels are known and we incorporate them into a clustering model. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework for hypergraphs that is able to easily incorporate not only multiple relationships among the entities but also multiple attributes and content of the entities from diverse sources. Furthermore, by showing the close relationship between the hypergraph normalized cut and the weighted kernel K-Means, we also develop an efficient multilevel hypergraph clustering method which provides a good initialization with our semi-supervised multi-view clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting the ground-truth clusters and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Topic modeling is commonly used to analyze and understand large document collections. However, in practice, users want to focus on specific aspects or \u201ctargets\u201d rather than the entire corpus. For example, given a large collection of documents, users may want only a smaller subset which more closely aligns with their interests, tasks, and domains. In particular, our paper focuses on large-scale document retrieval with high recall where any missed relevant documents can be critical. A simple keyword matching search is generally not effective nor efficient as 1) it is difficult to find a list of keyword queries that can cover the documents of interest before exploring the dataset, 2) some documents may not contain the exact keywords of interest but may still be highly relevant, and 3) some words have multiple meanings, which would result in irrelevant documents included in the retrieved subset. In this paper, we present TopicSifter, a visual analytics system for interactive search space reduction. Our system utilizes targeted topic modeling based on nonnegative matrix factorization and allows users to give relevance feedback in order to refine their target and guide the topic modeling to the most relevant results.",

            "abstract": "Understanding newly emerging events or topics associated with a particular region of a given day can provide deep insight on the critical events occurring in highly evolving metropolitan cities. We propose herein a novel topic modeling approach on text documents with spatio-temporal information (e.g., when and where a document was published) such as location-based social media data to discover prevalent topics or newly emerging events with respect to an area and a time point. We consider a map view composed of regular grids or tiles with each showing topic keywords from documents of the corresponding region. To this end, we present a tilebased spatio-temporally exclusive topic modeling approach called STExNMF, based on a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique. STExNMF mainly works based on the two following stages: (1) first running a standard NMF of each tile to obtain general topics of the tile and (2) running a spatiotemporally exclusive NMF on a weighted residual matrix. These topics likely reveal information on newly emerging events or topics of interest within a region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach using the geo-tagged Twitter data of New York City. We also provide quantitative comparisons in terms of the topic quality, spatio-temporal exclusiveness, topic variation, and qualitative evaluations of our method using several usage scenarios. In addition, we present a fast topic modeling technique of our model by leveraging parallel computing.",

            "abstract": "The importance of unsupervised clustering and topic modeling is well recognized with ever-increasing volumes of text data. In this paper, we propose a fast method for hierarchical clustering and topic modeling called HierNMF2. Our method is based on fast Rank-2 nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) that performs binary clustering and an efficient node splitting rule. Further utilizing the final leaf nodes generated in HierNMF2 and the idea of nonnegative least squares fitting, we propose a new clustering/topic modeling method called FlatNMF2 that recovers a flat clustering/topic modeling result in a very simple yet significantly more effective way than any other existing methods. We implement highly optimized open source software in C++ for both HierNMF2 and FlatNMF2 for hierarchical and partitional clustering/topic modeling of document data sets. \nSubstantial experimental tests are presented that illustrate significant improvements both in computational time as well as quality of solutions. We compare our methods to other clustering methods including K-means, standard NMF, and CLUTO, and also topic modeling methods including latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and recently proposed algorithms for NMF with separability constraints. Overall, we present efficient tools for analyzing large-scale data sets, and techniques that can be generalized to many other data analytics problem domains.",

Starting with a query, VisIRR visualizes the retrieved documents in a scatter plot along with their topic summary. Next, based on interactive personalized preference feedback on the documents, VisIRR collects and visualizes potentially relevant documents out of the entire corpus so that an integrated analysis of both retrieved and recommended documents can be performed seamlessly.",
