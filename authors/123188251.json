            "title": "Pre-training Multi-task Contrastive Learning Models for Scientific Literature Understanding",
            "abstract": "Scientific literature understanding tasks have gained significant attention due to their potential to accelerate scientific discovery. Pre-trained language models (LMs) have shown effectiveness in these tasks, especially when tuned via contrastive learning. However, jointly utilizing pre-training data across multiple heterogeneous tasks (e.g., extreme multi-label paper classification, citation prediction, and literature search) remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-task contrastive learning framework, SciMult, with a focus on facilitating common knowledge sharing across different scientific literature understanding tasks while preventing task-specific skills from interfering with each other. To be specific, we explore two techniques -- task-aware specialization and instruction tuning. The former adopts a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture with task-aware sub-layers; the latter prepends task-specific instructions to the input text so as to produce task-aware outputs. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive collection of benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our task-aware specialization strategy, where we outperform state-of-the-art scientific pre-trained LMs. Code, datasets, and pre-trained models can be found at https://scimult.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things embeds electronics in everyday devices to enable new products and services. Board games such as Chinese chess (Xi\u00e0ngq\u00ed) are a useful test case, as they pose a limited problem with well defined goals. In this paper, we report on two approaches to live logging of Xi\u00e0ngq\u00ed games. One approach uses a camera phone, image processing and a convolutional neural network, while the other embeds magnets in the pieces and Hall effect sensors into the board. Both approaches permit the live transmission of a game using a web server. Game clocks were also constructed and integrated into the systems.",
