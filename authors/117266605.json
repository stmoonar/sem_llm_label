            "abstract": "Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols have recently been extensively used by distributed and decentralized data management systems with non-trustworthy infrastructures to establish consensus on the order of transactions. BFT protocols cover a broad spectrum of design dimensions from infrastructure settings, such as the communication topology, to more technical features, such as commitment strategy and even fundamental social choice properties like order-fairness. The proliferation of different protocols has made it difficult to navigate the BFT landscape, let alone determine the protocol that best meets application needs. In this tutorial, we discuss BFT protocols that are used in modern large-scale data management systems, present a design space consisting of a set of design dimensions and explore several design choices that capture the trade-offs between different design space dimensions. The presented design space and its design choices will help developers analyze BFT protocols, understand how different protocols are related to each other, and find the protocol that best fits their needs.",

Waffle achieves this without prior knowledge of the input data access distribution, making it the first of its kind to adaptively handle input sequences under a passive persistent adversary. Waffle maintains a constant bandwidth and client-side storage overhead, which can be adjusted to suit the application owner's preferences. This flexibility allows the owner to fine-tune system parameters and strike a balance between security and performance. Our evaluation, utilizing the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) benchmark and Redis as the backend storage, demonstrates promising results. The insecure baseline outperforms Waffle by a mere 5-6x, whereas Waffle outperforms Pancake-a state-of-the-art oblivious datastore under passive persistent adversaries-by 45-57%, and a concurrent ORAM system, TaoStore, by 102x.",

We incorporate vector transformations and apply DFT (Discrete Fourier Transformation) and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transformation, Haar) dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the search space/time of sequence similarity range queries. Our empirical results on a number of Prokaryote and Eukaryote DNA contig databases demonstrate up to 50-fold filtration ratio reduction of the search space and up to 13 times faster filtration. The proposed transformation techniques may easily be integrated as a pre-processing phase on top of current similarity search heuristics/techniques such as BLAST, PatternHunter, FastA and QUASAR to efficiently prune non-relevant sequences. We study the precision of applying dimensionality reduction techniques for faster and more efficient range query searches and discuss the imposed trade-offs.",

            "abstract": "Query size estimation is crucial for many database system components. In particular, query optimizers need efficient and accurate query size estimation when deciding among alternative query plans. In this paper we propose a novel sampling technique based on the golden rule of sampling, introduced by von Neumann in 1947, for estimating range queries. The proposed technique randomly samples the frequency domain using the cumulative frequency distribution and yields good estimates without any a priori knowledge of the actual underlying distribution of spatial objects. We show experimentally that the proposed sampling technique gives smaller approximation error than the Min-Skew histogram based and wavelet based approaches for both synthetic and real datasets. Moreover, the proposed technique can be easily extended for higher dimensional datasets.",

The lack of commensurate improvements in storage systems have resulted in I/O becoming a major bottleneck in modern systems. The use of parallel I/O from multiple devices is a well known technique for improving I/O performance. A key factor in exploiting parallel I/O is knowledge of the access pattern-- the sets of data items that are likely to be accessed concurrently should be declustered across the disks. Range and nearest-neighbor (similarity) queries are the most important class of queries for multimedia databases. Declustering schemes tailored for improving the performance of range only or similarity only queries have been proposed in the literature. The problem of declustering for combined range and similarity queries has not been addressed in the literature.",

            "abstract": "In the presence of semantic information, serializability is too strong a correctness criterion and unnecessarily restricts concurrency. We use the semantic information of a transaction to provide different atomicity views of the transaction to other transactions. The proposed approach improves concurrency and allows interleavings among transactions which are non-serializable, but which nonetheless preserve the consistency of the database and are acceptable to other users. We develop a graph-based tool whose acyclicity is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the correctness of an execution. Our theory encompasses earlier proposals that incorporate semantic information of transactions. Furthermore it is the first approach that provides an efficient graph based tool for recognizing correct schedules without imposing any restrictions on the application domain. Our approach is widely applicable to many advanced database applications such as systems with long-lived transactions and collaborative environments.",

We study the general case of identifying all corrupted pager among any number of secondary sites. We assume that secondary sites can communicate only with the primary site. We present a protocol that identifies the corrupted pages and prove that this protocol is optimal in the sense of requiring the minimum amount of communication. This protocol relies on the structure of Reed-Solomon codes.<<ETX>>",

            "abstract": "We propose a paradigm for developing, describing and proving the correctness of concurrency control protocols for replicated databases in the presence of failures or communication restrictions. Our approach is to hierarchically divide the problem of achieving one-copy serializability by introducing the notion of a \u201cgroup\u201d that is a higher level of abstraction than transactions. Instead of dealing with the overall problem of serializing all transactions, our paradigm divides the problem into two simpler ones. (1) A local policy for each group that ensures a total order of all transactions in that group. (2) A global policy that ensures a correct serialization of all groups. We use the paradigm to demonstrate the similarities between several concurrency control protocols by comparing the way they achieve correctness.",
