            "title": "Towards Robust Rumor Detection with Graph Contrastive and Curriculum Learning",
            "abstract": "Establishing a robust rumor detection model is vital in safeguarding the veracity of information on social media platforms. However, existing approaches to stopping rumor from spreading rely on abundant and clean training data, which is rarely available in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a trustworthy rumor detection model that can handle inadequate and noisy labeled data. Our work addresses robust rumor detection, including classic and early detection, as well as five types of robustness issues: noisy and incomplete propagation, label scarcity and noise, and user disappearance. We propose a novel method, Robustness-Enhanced Rumor Detection (RERD), which mainly leverages the information propagation graphs of source tweets, along with user profiles and retweeting knowledge, for model learning. The novelty of RERD is four-fold. First, we jointly exploit the propagation structures of non-text and text retweets to learn the representation of a source tweet. Second, we simultaneously utilize the top-down and bottom-up information flows with relational propagations for graph representation learning. Third, to have effective early and robust detection, we implement contrastive learning on graphs with early and complete views of information propagation so that small snapshots can foresee their future shapes. Last, we use curriculum pseudo-labeling to mitigate the impact of label scarcity and noisy labels, and to correct representations learned from corrupted data. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RERD consistently outperforms competitors in classic, early, and robust rumor detection scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously cope with early and five robust detections of rumors.",

            "title": "Burstiness-aware Bipartite Graph Neural Networks for Fraudulent User Detection on Rating Platforms",
            "abstract": "As the digital commerce landscape continues to expand with rating platforms, the consumer base has similarly grown, marking a pivotal reliance on user ratings and reviews. However, the rise of fraudulent users leveraging deceitful conduct, such as manipulation of product rankings, challenges the credibility of these platforms and compels the necessity for an effective detection model. Amid the challenges of evolving fraudulent patterns and label scarcity, this paper presents a novel model, Burstiness-aware Bipartite Graph Neural Networks (BurstBGN), which combats fraud by exploiting user-product bipartite graphs and timestamped rating activities. BurstBGN encapsulates two key ideas: the modeling of user-product interaction via historical rating data through an Edge-time GNN module and the exhaustive mapping of bursty fraudulent user activities. The performance of BurstBGN is demonstrated through rigorous benchmarking against established methods across three datasets. Our results show that BurstBGN consistently outperforms these methods under both transductive and inductive settings, confirming its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent users from limited annotated data, and thereby providing a safeguard for maintaining user trust in e-commerce platforms.",

            "abstract": "Rumor detection is to identify and mitigate potentially damaging falsehoods, thereby shielding the public from misleading information. However, existing methods fall short of tackling class imbalance, meaning rumor is less common than true messages, as they lack specific adaptation for the context of rumor dissemination. In this work, we propose Dual Graph Networks with Synthetic Oversampling (SynDGN), a novel method that can determine whether a claim made on social media is rumor or not in the presence of class imbalance. SynDGN properly utilizes dual graphs to integrate social media contexts and user characteristics to make accurate predictions. Experiments conducted on two well-known datasets verify that SynDGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, regardless of whether the data is balanced or not.",

The survey highlights a critical gap in deep neural TDL methods: the underrepresentation of latent correlations among data instances and feature values. GNNs, with their innate capability to model intricate relationships and interactions between diverse elements of tabular data, have garnered significant interest and application across various TDL domains. Our survey provides a systematic review of the methods involved in designing and implementing GNNs for TDL (GNN4TDL). It encompasses a detailed investigation into the foundational aspects and an overview of GNN-based TDL methods, offering insights into their evolving landscape. We present a comprehensive taxonomy focused on constructing graph structures and representation learning within GNN-based TDL methods. In addition, the survey examines various training plans, emphasizing the integration of auxiliary tasks to enhance the effectiveness of instance representations. A critical part of our discussion is dedicated to the practical application of GNNs across a spectrum of GNN4TDL scenarios, demonstrating their versatility and impact. Lastly, we discuss the limitations and propose future research directions, aiming to spur advancements in GNN4TDL. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a thorough understanding of GNNs' role in revolutionizing TDL and pointing towards future innovations in this promising area.",

            "abstract": "The prevalence of disinformation, which includes malformation (e.g., cyberbullying) and misinformation (e.g., fake news) in online platforms has raised significant concerns, prompting the need for robust detection methods to mitigate its detrimental impact. While the field of text classification has witnessed notable advancements in recent years, existing approaches often overlook the evolving nature of disinformation, wherein perpetrators employ perturbations to toxic content to evade detection or censorship. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework, Adversarial Network Towards Improved robustness for Disinformation detection (ANTI-Disinformation), which leverages reinforcement learning techniques as adversarial attacks. Additionally, we propose a defense model to enhance model\u2019s robustness against such attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on well-known disinformation datasets collected from multiple social media platforms. The results demonstrate our approach can effectively produce degradation in existing models\u2019 performance the most, showcasing the effectiveness of our framework and the vulnerability of existing detection systems. The results also exhibit that the proposed defense methods can consistently outperform existing typical methods in constructing robust detection models.",
