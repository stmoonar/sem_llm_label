            "abstract": "Digital ticketing systems typically offer ticket purchase, refund, validation, and, optionally, anonymity of users. However, it would be interesting for users to transfer their tickets, as is currently done with physical tickets. We propose Applause, a ticketing system allowing the purchase, refund, validation, and transfer of tickets based on trusted authority, while guaranteeing the anonymity of users, as long as the used payment method provides anonymity. To study its security, we formalise the security of the transferable E-Ticket scheme in the game-based paradigm. We prove the security of Applause computationally in the standard model and symbolically using the protocol verifier ProVerif. Applause relies on standard cryptographic primitives, rendering our construction efficient and scalable, as shown by a proof-of-concept. In order to obtain Spotlight, an auditable version, proved to be secure, users will remain anonymous except for a trusted third party, which will be able to disclose their identity in the event of a disaster.",

            "abstract": "Swish is a competitive pattern recognition card-based game, in which players are trying to find a valid cards superposition from a set of cards, called a \u201cswish\u201d. By the nature of the game, one may expect to easily recover the logic of the Swish \u2019s designers. However, no justification appears to explain the number of cards, of duplicates, but also under which circumstances no player can find a swish. In this work, we formally investigate Swish . In the commercial version of the game, we observe that there exist large sets of cards with no swish, and find a construction to generate large sets of cards without swish. More importantly, in the general case with larger cards, we prove that Swish is NP-complete. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Problems, reductions and completeness; Theory of computation \u2192 Backtracking",

            "abstract": "The verification of computations performed by an untrusted server is a cornerstone for delegated computations, especially in multi-clients setting where inputs are provided by different parties. Assuming a common secret between clients, a garbled circuit offers the attractive property to ensure the correctness of a result computed by the untrusted server while keeping the input and the function private. Yet, this verification can be guaranteed only once. Based on the notion of multi-key homomorphic encryption (MKHE), we propose RMC-PVC a multi-client verifiable computation protocol, able to verify the correctness of computations performed by an untrusted server for inputs (encoded for a garbled circuit) provided by multiple clients. Thanks to MKHE, the garbled circuit is reusable an arbitrary number of times. In addition, each client can verify the computation by its own. Compared to a single-key FHE scheme, the MKHE usage in RMC-PVC allows to reduce the workload of the server and thus the response delay for the client. It also enforce the privacy of inputs, which are provided by different clients.",

            "abstract": ". In 1986, A.Yao introduced the notion of garbled circuits , designed to verify the correctness of computations performed on an un-trusted server. However, correctness is guaranteed for only one input, meaning that a new garbled circuit must be created for each new input. To address this drawback, in 2010 Gennaro et al. performed the evaluation of the garbled circuit homomorphically using Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme, allowing to reuse the same garbled circuit for new inputs. Their solution requires to encrypt the garbled circuit at every new input. In this paper, we propose a veri\ufb01able-computation scheme allowing to verify the correctness of computations performed by an untrusted server for multiple inputs, where the garbled circuit is homomorphically encrypted only once. Hence, we have a faster scheme comparing to Gen-naro\u2019s solution, since for each new input, we reduce the computations by the size of the circuit representing the function to be computed, for the same security level. The key point to obtain this speed-up is to rely on Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption ( MKHE ) and then to encrypt only once the garbled circuit.",

We focus on cumulative reward maximization in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), a classical reinforcement learning model for decision making under uncertainty.

The demonstration platform is a Web interface that simulates the distributed components of Samba, and which helps the data scientist to configure the end-to-end workflow of deploying a federated MAB algorithm. The user-friendly interface of Samba, allows the users to examine the interaction between three key dimensions of federated MAB: cumulative reward, computation time, and security guarantees.

            "abstract": "The multi-armed bandit is a reinforcement learning model where a learning agent repeatedly chooses an action (pull a bandit arm) and the environment responds with a stochastic outcome (reward) coming from an unknown distribution associated with the chosen arm. Bandits have a wide-range of application such as Web recommendation systems. We address the cumulative reward maximization problem in a secure federated learning setting, where multiple data owners keep their data stored locally and collaborate under the coordination of a central orchestration server. We rely on cryptographic schemes and propose Samba, a generic framework for Secure federAted Multi-armed BAndits. Each data owner has data associated to a bandit arm and the bandit algorithm has to sequentially select which data owner is solicited at each time step. We instantiate Samba for five bandit algorithms. We show that Samba returns the same cumulative reward as the nonsecure versions of bandit algorithms, while satisfying formally proven security properties. We also show that the overhead due to cryptographic primitives is linear in the size of the input, which is confirmed by our proof-of-concept implementation.",
