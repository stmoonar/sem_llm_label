As a theoretical basis, we discuss the multi-word word expressions as a part of the formulaic language used as discourse markers for organizing discourse. We also identify that parallel research in multiple languages may provide inter-lingual insights. We created a parallel multilingual corpus TED-ELH for our research and applied a parallel corpus alignment algorithm to extract multi-word discourse markers and their translations in Lithuanian and Hebrew. The analysis of the translations of multi-word discourse markers allowed us to identify that they demonstrate certain variability and either remain multi-word expressions or turn into one-word translations due to the linguistic characteristics of the target languages.",

Such a situation can be related to existing challenges in the creation, reusing, and exposing of LLD resources. In this paper, we present the results of a survey which examined users\u2019 perspective and experience in the use and application of LLD principles, to evaluate the impact, prospects, requirements, or challenges encountered in LLD adoption. The survey was organized in several sections to collect information about participants\u2019 background, LLD knowledge, use, development, publishing, and metadata use. The results show that some bounds have to be over-stepped to ensure the penetration of LLD principles in a wider community and fully exploit their potential.",

We rst introduce the goals of cross-lingual linking and associated technologies, and in particular, the role that the Linked Data paradigm (Bizer et al., 2011) applied to language data can play in this context. We de ne under-resourced languages with a speci c focus on languages actively used on the internet, i.e., languages with a digitally versatile speaker community, but limited support in terms of language technology. We argue that languages for which considerable amounts of textual data and (at least) a bilingual word list are available, techniques for cross-lingual linking can be readily applied, and that these enable the implementation of downstream applications for under-resourced languages via the localisation and adaptation of existing technologies and resources.",

            "abstract": "Discourse markers carry information about the discourse structure and organization, and also signal local dependencies or epistemological stance of speaker. They provide instructions on how to interpret the discourse, and their study is paramount to understand the mechanism underlying discourse organization. This paper presents a new language resource, an ISO-based annotated multilingual parallel corpus for discourse markers. The corpus comprises nine languages, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, German, European Portuguese, Hebrew, Romanian, Polish, and Macedonian, with English as a pivot language. In order to represent the meaning of the discourse markers, we propose an annotation scheme of discourse relations from ISO 24617-8 with a plug-in to ISO 24617-2 for communicative functions. We describe an experiment in which we applied the annotation scheme to assess its validity. The results reveal that, although some extensions are required to cover all the multilingual data, it provides a proper representation of discourse markers value. Additionally, we report some relevant contrastive phenomena concerning discourse markers interpretation and role in discourse. This first step will allow us to develop deep learning methods to identify and extract discourse relations and communicative functions, and to represent that information as Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD).",

The paper\u2019s aim is to provide the starting point for the construction of a workflow and set of multilingual diachronic ontologies within the humanities use case of the COST Action Nexus Linguarum, European network for Web-centred linguistic data science, CA18209. The survey focuses on the essential aspects needed to understand the current trends and to build applications in this area of study.",

            "title": "Morphological Complexity of Children Narratives in Eight Languages",
            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the morphological complexity in a corpus representing the language production of younger and older children across different languages. The language samples were taken from the Frog Story subcorpus of the CHILDES corpora, which comprises oral narratives collected by various researchers between 1990 and 2005. We extracted narratives by typically developing, monolingual, middle-class children. Additionally, samples of Lithuanian language, collected according to the same principles, were added. The corpus comprises 249 narratives evenly distributed across eight languages: Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Russian and Spanish. Two subcorpora were formed for each language: a younger children corpus and an older children corpus. Four measures of morphological complexity were calculated for each subcorpus: Bane, Kolmogorov, Word entropy and Relative entropy of word structure. The results showed that younger children corpora had lower morphological complexity than older children corpora for all four measures for Spanish and Russian. Reversed results were obtained for English and French, and the results for the remaining four languages showed variation. Relative entropy of word structure proved to be indicative of age differences. Word entropy and relative entropy of word structure show potential to demonstrate typological differences.",

            "abstract": "The paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach including methods from disciplines such as history of concepts, linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) and Semantic Web, to create a comparative framework for detecting semantic change in multilingual historical corpora and generating diachronic ontologies as linguistic linked open data (LLOD). Initiated as a use case (UC4.2.1) within the COST Action Nexus Linguarum, European network for Web-centred linguistic data science , the study will explore emerging trends in knowledge extraction, analysis and representation from linguistic data science, and apply the devised methodology to datasets in the humanities to trace the evolution of concepts from the domain of socio-cultural transformation. The paper will describe the main elements of the methodological framework and preliminary planning of the intended workflow. 2012 ACM Subject",
