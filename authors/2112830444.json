            "abstract": "It is crucial for emergency management organizations to have rapid access to relevant experts who can advise and assist following a disaster. To improve expert-mining and recommendation capabilities, creating a knowledge graph that links experts to their corresponding topics of expertise and other sources of relevant information is a natural choice to capture an integrated network of people and a rich taxonomy of expertise. In this paper, we present an ontology for modeling experts, their expertise topics and relations between them, and their spatiotemporal scoping. We go on to discuss the primary conceptual components and how they can be instantiated, then present overarching examples related to emergency management operations. The ontology synthesizes three different ways to characterize an expert, based on a) identifiable academic expertise; b) voluntary engagements, work-related responsibilities or experience; and c) organization specializations or affiliations.",

            "title": "Here Is Not There: Measuring Entailment-Based Trajectory Similarity for Location-Privacy Protection and Beyond",
            "abstract": "While the paths humans take play out in social as well as physical space, measures to describe and compare their trajectories are carried out in abstract, typically Euclidean, space. When these measures are applied to trajectories of actual individuals in an application area, alterations that are inconsequential in abstract space may suddenly become problematic once overlaid with geographic reality. In this work, we present a different view on trajectory similarity by introducing a measure that utilizes logical entailment. This is an inferential perspective that considers facts as triple statements deduced from the social and environmental context in which the travel takes place, and their practical implications. We suggest a formalization of entailment-based trajectory similarity, measured as the overlapping proportion of facts, which are spatial relation statements in our case study. With the proposed measure, we evaluate LSTM-TrajGAN, a privacy-preserving trajectory-generation model. The entailment-based model evaluation reveals potential consequences of disregarding the rich structure of geographic space (e.g., miscalculated insurance risk due to regional shifts in our toy example). Our work highlights the advantage of applying logical entailment to trajectory-similarity reasoning for location-privacy protection and beyond.",

Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Qualitative spatio-temporal reasoning (QSTR) plays a key role in spatial cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) research. In the past, research and applications of QSTR have often taken place in the context of declarative forms of knowledge representation. For instance, conceptual neighborhoods (CN) and composition tables (CT) of relations are introduced explicitly and utilized for spatial/temporal reasoning. Orthogonal to this line of study, we focus on bottom-up machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate QSTR. More specifically, we are interested in questions of whether similarities between qualitative relations can be learned from data purely based on ML models, and, if so, how these models differ from the ones studied by traditional approaches. To achieve this, we propose a graph-based approach to examine the similarity of relations by analyzing trained ML models. Using various experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the relationships discovered by ML models are well-aligned with CN structures introduced in the (theoretical) literature, for both spatial and temporal reasoning. Noticeably, even with significantly limited qualitative information for training, ML models are still able to automatically construct neighborhood structures. Moreover, patterns of asymmetric similarities between relations are disclosed using such a data-driven approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to automatically discover CNs without any domain knowledge. Our results can be applied to discovering CNs of any set of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) relations.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Qualitative spatial reasoning has been a core research topic in GIScience and AI for decades. It has been adopted in a wide range of applications such as wayfinding, question answering, and robotics. Most developed spatial inference engines use symbolic representation and reasoning, which focuses on small and densely connected data sets, and struggles to deal with noise and vagueness. However, with more sensors becoming available, reasoning over spatial relations on large-scale and noisy geospatial data sets requires more robust alternatives. This paper, therefore, proposes a subsymbolic approach using neural networks to facilitate qualitative spatial reasoning. More specifically, we focus on higher-order spatial relations as those have been largely ignored due to the binary nature of the underlying representations, e.g. knowledge graphs. We specifically explore the use of neural networks to reason over ternary projective relations such as between. We consider multiple types of spatial constraint, including higher-order relatedness and the conceptual neighborhood of ternary projective relations to make the proposed model spatially explicit. We introduce evaluating results demonstrating that the proposed spatially explicit method substantially outperforms the existing baseline by about 20%.",

            "abstract": "Disasters are often unpredictable and complex events, requiring humanitarian organizations to understand and respond to many different issues simultaneously and immediately. Often the biggest challenge to improving the effectiveness of the response is quickly finding the right expert, with the right expertise concerning a specific disaster type/disaster and geographic region. To assist in achieving such a goal, this paper demonstrates a knowledge graph-based search engine developed on top of an expert knowledge graph. It accommodates three modes of information retrieval, including a follow-your-nose search, an expert similarity search, and a SPARQL query interface. We will demonstrate utilizing the system to rapidly navigate from a hazard event to a specific expert who may be helpful, for example. More importantly, as the data is fully integrated including links between hazards and their abstract topics, we can find experts who have relevant expertise while navigating the graph.",

            "abstract": ". The notion of Linked Open Science rests on the assump-tion that Linked Data principles contribute to science and scienti\ufb01c data management in several distinct ways (e.g., by adding rich semantics to improve retrieval and reuse of data). This begs the question of the right level of granularity for such semantic enrichment. On the one extreme of the spectrum, one may provide semantic annotations on the level of entire datasets to improve retrieval while leaving the actual data un-touched. On the other end, one may semantically describe every single datum, such as a particular observation leading to data that supports reasoning, automated con\ufb02ation, and so on, while, at the same time, dra-matically increasing the size of data, including redundancy. This paper reports on our experience in modeling heterogeneous environmental data using a semantically-enabled observation framework, namely the SOSA ontology and its extensions to handle observation collections. We discuss di\ufb00erent means of using these observation collections and compare their pros and cons in terms of data size and ease of querying.",

While there has been substantial progress in open-domain question answering, QA systems are still struggling to answer questions which involve geographic entities or concepts and that require spatial operations. In this paper, we discuss the problem of geographic question answering (GeoQA). We first investigate the reasons why geographic questions are difficult to answer by analyzing challenges of geographic questions. We discuss the uniqueness of geographic questions compared to general QA. Then we review existing work on GeoQA and classify them by the types of questions they can address. Based on this survey, we provide a generic classification framework for geographic questions. Finally, we conclude our work by pointing out unique future research directions for GeoQA.\n",

            "abstract": "The integration of data along a common spatial component remains an obstacle in many problem spaces. One promising method for integrating data in such a way is through the use of a common, underlying spatial reference system, such as a Discrete Global Grid (e.g., the S2 Grid System), and pre-computing spatial relations between features and the constituent components at a spatial resolution appropriate for the data and use case. That is, by emphasizing the notion of the cell, we can examine what is in a cell, predict contents of its parent and child cells, and quickly get an overview of spatially co-located features and regions of interest without having to directly compute spatial interactions. This paper provides an ontology design pattern, to be used as a structural template, for modeling how features or regions map onto a hierarchical grid system and addresses how the attributes of these features may be inherited upwards or downwards through the hierarchy. We furthermore provide a motivating example and implementation.",
