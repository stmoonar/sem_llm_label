            "title": "PDVN: A Patch-based Dual-view Network for Face Liveness Detection using Light Field Focal Stack",
            "abstract": "Light Field Focal Stack (LFFS) can be efficiently rendered from a light field (LF) image captured by plenoptic cameras. Differences in the 3D surface and texture of biometric samples are internally reflected in the defocus blur and local patterns between the rendered slices of LFFS. This unique property makes LFFS quite appropriate to differentiate presentation attack instruments (PAIs) from bona fide samples. A patch-based dual-view network (PDVN) is proposed in this paper to leverage the merits of LFFS for face presentation attack detection (PAD). First, original LFFS data are divided into various local patches along spatial dimensions, which distracts the model from learning the useless facial semantics and greatly relieve the problem of insufficient samples. The strategy of dual-view branches is innovatively proposed, wherein the original view and microscopic view can simultaneously contribute to liveness detection. Separable 3D convolution on the focal dimension is verified to be more effective than vanilla 3D convolution for extracting discriminative features from LFFS data. The voting mechanism on predictions of patch LFFS samples further strengthens the robustness of the proposed framework. PDVN is compared with other face PAD methods on IST LLFFSD dataset and achieves perfect performance, i.e., ACER drops to 0.",

            "title": "Image Reconstruction Using Variable Exponential Function Regularization for Wide-Field Polarization Modulation Imaging",
            "abstract": "Polarization modulation imaging technology plays an important role in microscopic super-resolution imaging. However, the specimen medium contains retardancy, while charge-coupled devices may provide discrete under-sampling, and the coupled wavefronts consisting of the polarization state of the light and the anisotropic distribution of the specimen can lead to vectorial phase fitting degradation. Considering that the point spread function (PSF) of the main degradation parts can be regarded as an asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution with uncertain parameters, an adaptive image reconstruction method is proposed based on variable exponential function regularization. The proposed method concentrates on the diversity of the PSF and uses a variable exponent regularization to improve flexibility of the kernel. Moreover, it can balance image edge preservation and provide staircase artifact suppression, which reduces the over- and under-reconstruction of the microscopic images effectively. By optimizing the Split\u2013Bregman algorithm, we create an efficient method that minimizes the iterative loss function under the premise of achieving high estimation accuracy. Compared with other methods, the experimental results reveal better effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, with improvements of 18% in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, 21% in the structural similarity index measurement, and 337% in the mean structural similarity index measurement.",
