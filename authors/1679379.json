            "abstract": "This half-day workshop on Cryptoasset Analytics allows researchers from different disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets. This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program will feature a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

            "title": "Autoencoder based Anomaly Detection and Explained Fault Localization in Industrial Cooling Systems",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in large industrial cooling systems is very challenging due to the high data dimensionality, inconsistent sensor recordings, and lack of labels. The state of the art for automated anomaly detection in these systems typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work, we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems, including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error. Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months\u2019 time period using 4-fold cross validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) \u2013 indicating that theanomaly is recognized in a very stable manner. The automatically created labels, however, detected anomaly earlier. The main anomaly was found by the autoencoder and automatically created labels, and was also recorded in the log files. Further, the explained fault localization highlighted the most affected component for the main anomaly in a very consistent manner.",

            "title": "Machine Learning Methods for Health-Index Prediction in Coating Chambers",
            "abstract": "Coating chambers create thin layers that improve the mechanical and optical surface properties in jewelry production using physical vapor deposition. In such a process, evaporated material condensates on the walls of such chambers and, over time, causes mechanical defects and unstable processes. As a result, manufacturers perform extensive maintenance procedures to reduce production loss. Current rule-based maintenance strategies neglect the impact of specific recipes and the actual condition of the vacuum chamber. Our overall goal is to predict the future condition of the coating chamber to allow cost and quality optimized maintenance of the equipment. This paper describes the derivation of a novel health indicator that serves as a step toward condition-based maintenance for coating chambers. We indirectly use gas emissions of the chamber\u2019s contamination to evaluate the machine\u2019s condition. Our approach relies on process data and does not require additional hardware installation. Further, we evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms for a condition-based forecast of the health indicator that also reflects production planning. Our results show that models based on decision trees are the most effective and outperform all three benchmarks, improving at least 0.22 in the mean average error. Our work paves the way for cost and quality optimized maintenance of coating applications.",

This workshop is relevant for the Web research community for two reasons. First, on a technical level, fundamental concepts of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated with Web technologies. Second, we witness the formation of socio-technical cryptoasset ecosystems, which are tightly connected to the Web. The program features a mix of invited talks and a selection of peer-reviewed submissions. Workshop topics range from empirical studies, over analytics methods and tools, to case studies, datasets, and cross-cutting issues like legal or ethical aspects.",

            "abstract": "One of the defining features of Bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have been derived from it is a globally visible transaction ledger. While Bitcoin uses pseudonyms as a way to hide the identity of its participants, a long line of research has demonstrated that Bitcoin is not anonymous. This has been perhaps best exemplified by the development of clustering heuristics, which have in turn given rise to the ability to track the flow of bitcoins as they are sent from one entity to another. In this paper, we design a new heuristic that is designed to track a certain type of flow, called a peel chain, that represents many transactions performed by the same entity; in doing this, we implicitly cluster these transactions and their associated pseudonyms together. We then use this heuristic to both validate and expand the results of existing clustering heuristics. We also develop a machine learning-based validation method and, using a ground-truth dataset, evaluate all our approaches and compare them with the state of the art. Ultimately, our goal is to not only enable more powerful tracking techniques but also call attention to the limits of anonymity in these systems.",

However, gathering labeled training data for supervised tasks such as anomaly detection is costly and often difficult to implement in operational environments. Therefore, this work aims to design and implement a solution that reduces the required amount of data for training anomaly classification models on time series sensor data and thereby brings down the overall deployment effort of IoT anomaly detection sensors. We set up several in-lab experiments using three peristaltic pumps and investigated approaches for transferring trained anomaly detection models across assets of the same type. Our experiments achieved promising effectiveness and provide initial evidence that transfer learning could be a suitable strategy for using pre-trained anomaly classification models across industrial assets of the same type with minimal prior labeling and training effort. This work could serve as a starting point for more general, pre-trained sensor data embeddings, applicable to a wide range of assets.",

By providing a growing set of open-source components, GraphSense could ultimately become an instrument for scientific investigations in academia and a possible response to emerging compliance and regulation challenges for businesses and organizations dealing with cryptoassets.",

            "abstract": "We present a first measurement study on the adoption and actual privacy of two popular decentralized CoinJoin implementations, Wasabi and Samourai, in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. By applying highly accurate (\u00bf 99%) algorithms we can effectively detect 30,251 Wasabi and 223,597 Samourai transactions within the block range 530,500 to 725,348 (2018-07-05 to 2022-02-28). We also found a steady adoption of these services with a total value of mixed coins of ca. 4.74 B USD and average monthly mixing amounts of ca. 172.93 M USD) for Wasabi and ca. 41.72 M USD for Samourai. Furthermore, we could trace ca. 322 M USD directly received by cryptoasset exchanges and ca. 1.16 B USD indirectly received via two hops. Our analysis further shows that the traceability of addresses during the pre-mixing and post-mixing narrows down the anonymity set provided by these coin mixing services. It also shows that the selection of addresses for the CoinJoin transaction can harm anonymity. Overall, this is the first paper to provide a comprehensive picture of the adoption and privacy of distributed CoinJoin transactions. Understanding this picture is particularly interesting in the light of ongoing regulatory efforts that will, on the one hand, affect compliance measures implemented in cryptocurrency exchanges and, on the other hand, the privacy of end-users.",
