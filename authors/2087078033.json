            "abstract": "Recommender systems (RecSys) play important roles in helping users navigate, discover, and consume large and highly dynamic information. Today, many RecSys solutions deployed in the real world rely on categorical user-profiles and/or pre-calculated recommendation actions that stay static during a user session. However, recent trends suggest that RecSys need to model user intent in real time and constantly adapt to meet user needs at the moment or change user behavior in situ. There are three primary drivers for this emerging need of online adaptation. First, in order to meet the increasing demand for a better personalized experience, the personalization dimensions and space will grow larger and larger. It would not be feasible to pre-compute recommended actions for all personalization scenarios beyond a certain scale. Second, in many settings the system does not have user prior history to leverage. Estimating user intent in real time is the only feasible way to personalize. As various consumer privacy laws tighten, it is foreseeable that many businesses will reduce their reliance on static user profiles. Therefore, it makes the modeling of user intent in real time an important research topic. Third, a user's intent often changes within a session and between sessions, and user behavior could shift significantly during dramatic events. A RecSys should adapt in real time to meet user needs and be robust against distribution shifts. The online and adaptive recommender systems (OARS) workshop offers a focused discussion of the study and application of OARS, and will bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia. KDD, as the premier data science conference, is an ideal venue to gather leaders in the field to further research into OARS and promote its adoption. This workshop is complementary to several sessions of the main conference (e.g., recommendation, reinforcement learning, etc.) and brings them together using a practical and focused application.",

            "abstract": "Boosting is a commonly used technique to enhance the performance of a set of base models by combining them into a strong ensemble model. Though widely adopted, boosting is typically used in supervised learning where the data is labeled accurately. However, in weakly supervised learning, where most of the data is labeled through weak and noisy sources, it remains nontrivial to design effective boosting approaches. In this work, we show that the standard implementation of the convex combination of base learners can hardly work due to the presence of noisy labels. Instead, we propose LocalBoost, a novel framework for weakly-supervised boosting. LocalBoost iteratively boosts the ensemble model from two dimensions, i.e., intra-source and inter-source. The intra-source boosting introduces locality to the base learners and enables each base learner to focus on a particular feature regime by training new base learners on granularity-varying error regions. For the inter-source boosting, we leverage a conditional function to indicate the weak source where the sample is more likely to appear. To account for the weak labels, we further design an estimate-then-modify approach to compute the model weights. Experiments on seven datasets show that our method significantly outperforms vanilla boosting methods and other weakly-supervised methods.",

            "abstract": "1 FOREWORD Most of the recent progress in information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems has been fueled by deep learning: the success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns for prediction. However, algorithmic advances on accurate predictions and improved user modeling are just a small part of designing considerations of a much larger system. IR and recommender systems difer from other machine learning domains because they are inherently part of an ecosystem \u2013 in the simplest case, a world of items and users. In these ecosystems, system designers face a broad range of decisions \u2013 e.g., how to balance popularity, which incentives should be given to which users, or what safeguards to put in place to ensure the platform thrives in the long-run. Some of the decision making problems are statistical and algorithmic in nature, such as coping with the uncertainty of data and models, while others can involve building systems for the satisfactory of multiple parties. In general, there are many complex decision-making challenges faced by real-world IR and recommender systems, but existing approaches often make oversimplifed assumptions about the environment, data, and human behavior. Ignoring those challenges or treating them simply as pattern recognition problems can cost the engagement, accessibility, fairness, inclusiveness, and ultimately the vitality of IR and recommendation systems.",

            "abstract": "An emerging dilemma that faces practitioners in large scale online experimentation for e-commerce is whether to use Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms for testing or traditional A/B testing (A/B). This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between the two, from the perspectives of confidence intervals, hypothesis test powers, and their relationships with traffic split and sample size both theoretically and numerically. We first make comparisons between MAB with A/B tests in terms of conditions under which disjoint confidence intervals occur, and analyze their connection with the traffic split. Then we explore the relationship between the two in terms of sample sizes needed to achieve the required hypothesis test power, and analyze under what conditions MAB could have a higher test power than A/B given the same sample size. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose two new MAB algorithms that combine the strengths of traditional MAB and A/B together, with higher (or equal) test power and higher (or equal) expected rewards than A/B testing under certain common conditions in e-commerce. Last, we evaluate and compare the performance among the classical MAB algorithms, our newly proposed MAB algorithms, and A/B testing in terms of their accuracy of identifying ground truth winner with practical significance, power rewards trade-off, sample sizes etc. in both simulated datasets and industrial historical datasets. We hope the work can not only facilitate a better understanding of pros and cons of MAB and A/B testing, but also help build the connections between the two and provide possible approaches that can leverage the best from both worlds.",

            "abstract": "On e-commerce platforms, predicting if two products are compatible with each other is an important functionality to achieve trustworthy product recommendation and search experience for consumers. However, accurately predicting product compatibility is difficult due to the heterogeneous product data and the lack of manually curated training data. We study the problem of discovering effective labeling rules that can enable weakly-supervised product compatibility prediction. We develop AMRule, a multi-view rule discovery framework that can (1) adaptively and iteratively discover novel rulers that can complement the current weakly-supervised model to improve compatibility prediction; (2) discover interpretable rules from both structured attribute tables and unstructured product descriptions. AMRule adaptively discovers labeling rules from large-error instances via a boosting-style strategy, the high-quality rules can remedy the current model's weak spots and refine the model iteratively. For rule discovery from structured product attributes, we generate composable high-order rules from decision trees; and for rule discovery from unstructured product descriptions, we generate prompt-based rules from a pre-trained language model. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that AMRule outperforms the baselines by $5.98%$ on average and improves rule quality and rule proposal efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have shown superior performance over conventional methods. However, they show limited scalability on large-scale industrial datasets since most models learn one embedding per item. This leads to a large memory requirement (of storing one vector per item) and poor performance on sparse sessions with cold-start or unpopular items. Using one public and one large industrial dataset, we experimentally show that state-of-the-art SBRSs have low performance on sparse sessions with sparse items. We propose M2TRec, a Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer model for session-based recommendations. Our proposed method learns a transformation function from item metadata to embeddings, and is thus, item-ID free (i.e., does not need to learn one embedding per item). It integrates item metadata to learn shared representations of diverse item attributes. During inference, new or unpopular items will be assigned identical representations for the attributes they share with items previously observed during training, and thus will have similar representations with those items, enabling recommendations of even cold-start and sparse items. Additionally, M2TRec is trained in a multi-task setting to predict the next item in the session along with its primary category and subcategories. Our multi-task strategy makes the model converge faster and significantly improves the overall performance. Experimental results show significant performance gains using our proposed approach on sparse items on the two datasets.",

            "abstract": "E-commerce sites strive to provide users the most timely relevant information in order to reduce shopping frictions and increase customer satisfaction. Multi armed bandit models (MAB) as a type of adaptive optimization algorithms provide possible approaches for such purposes. In this paper, we analyze using three classic MAB algorithms, epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling (TS), and upper confidence bound 1 (UCB1) for dynamic content recommendations, and walk through the process of developing these algorithms internally to solve a real world e-commerce use case. First, we analyze the three MAB algorithms using simulated purchasing datasets with non-stationary reward distributions to simulate the possible time-varying customer preferences, where the traffic allocation dynamics and the accumulative rewards of different algorithms are studied. Second, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with more than 1,000 trials using actual historical A/B test datasets. We find that the larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations the more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we find that TS shows the highest average accumulative rewards under different testing scenarios. Third, we develop a batch-updated MAB algorithm to overcome the delayed reward issue in e-commerce and enable an online content optimization on our App homepage. For a state-of-the-art comparison, a real A/B test among our batch-updated MAB algorithm, a third-party MAB solution, and the default business logic are conducted. The result shows that our batch-updated MAB algorithm outperforms the counterparts and achieves 6.13% relative click-through rate (CTR) increase and 16.1% relative conversion rate (CVR) increase compared to the default experience, and 2.9% relative CTR increase and 1.4% relative CVR increase compared to the external MAB service.",

            "title": "Online Product Feature Recommendations with Interpretable Machine Learning",
            "abstract": "Product feature recommendations are critical for online customers to purchase the right products based on the right features. For a customer, selecting the product that has the best trade-off between price and functionality is a time-consuming step in an online shopping experience, and customers can be overwhelmed by the available choices. However, determining the set of product features that most differentiate a particular product is still an open question in online recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on using interpretable machine learning methods to tackle this problem. First, we identify this unique product feature recommendation problem from a business perspective on a major US e-commerce site. Second, we formulate the problem into a price-driven supervised learning problem to discover the product features that could best explain the price of a product in a given product category. We build machine learning models with a model-agnostic method Shapley Values to understand the importance of each feature, rank and recommend the most essential features. Third, we leverage human experts to evaluate its relevancy. The results show that our method is superior to a strong baseline method based on customer behavior and significantly boosts the coverage by 45%. Finally, our proposed method shows comparable conversion rate against the baseline in online A/B tests.",
