            "title": "A Fast Forward Modelling Method for Simulating Satellite Observations Using Observing Path Tracking",
            "abstract": "The higher the atmosphere is, the larger the deviations in atmospheric temperature and humidity are between the vertical column atmosphere above the cross-section of a satellite instrument and a ray\u2019s trajectory from the cross-section to the satellite. In general, satellite instruments that observe using cross-orbit scanning result in the difference between the observed radiance and the simulations using this method becoming incrementally larger and larger as the cross-section moves to the edge of the satellite\u2019s orbit. The deviations depend on the distance from the column to the ray trajectory and on the horizontal gradient of variables in the distance. In fact, the horizontal gradient of water vapour is larger than the gradient of temperature in clear scenarios, which could introduce an impact of temperature and water vapour on the simulated radiance of a satellite. In this study, a new method to simulate upgoing and downgoing radiation synchronously was developed, using the observing path tracking method. The conventional vertical initial atmospheric profile (Exp.1) and the profiles along the upgoing and downgoing rays of the satellite\u2019s observation (Exp.2) were established, in order to simulate the observed radiance of MWHS-II of FY-3D using global numerical forecasts with resolutions of 15 km and 25 km. The results showed that, for channels in the oxygen and water vapour absorption line on the microwave spectrum, deviations of the two atmospheric profiles were larger at the scan edge (0.01 K) than those at the nadir (0.001 K), and were larger in the upper atmosphere than in the lower atmosphere. The deviation was usually negative in low-latitude regions and was positive in southern high-latitude regions. Such results were obtained in experiments using both the numerical forecast method with 15 km grids and the forecast method with 25 km grids. Deviations were analysed for representative channels at 118 GHz and 183 GHz. Then, the results indicated that bigger deviations between the two experiments were observed in the water vapour absorption line than in the oxygen absorption line in the microwave spectrum. In conclusion, this indicates that, because of the greater horizontal gradient of water vapour, the stronger localisation of water vapour makes the atmospheric profile along the satellite\u2019s observing ray have more increments in the simulated radiance at the scan edge, compared to the atmospheric column profile.",

            "title": "A Novel Intercalibration Method for Fengyun(FY)-3 VIRR Using MERSI Onboard the Same Satellite Based on Pseudo-Invariant Pixels",
            "abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to the radiometric intercalibration between two sensors onboard the same satellite based on pseudo-invariant pixels (PIPs) using iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) method. The IR-MAD algorithm can statistically select PIPs from the multispectral image pair to assess the radiometric differences between them. Analysis of multiple image pairs from different acquisition times can provide long-term intercalibration results for the two sensors. The procedure is applied to Fengyun(FY)-3A&3B visible infrared radiometer (VIRR), with the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) onboard the same platform as the reference. Consistency of the spatial distribution of the PIPs selected by IR-MAD with pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICSs) given by other scientists demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. The long-term time series trending of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) VIRR reflectance over LIBYA1 and LIBYA4 after intercalibration correction shows that the intercalibrated VIRR has good agreement with MERSI, with a mean bias of less than 1% and an uncertainty of less than 2% for most channels. The approach requires no prior knowledge of the intercalibration targets and extends PICS to the pixel-level targets, which results in more diverse samples, broader dynamic ranges, and lower uncertainty, yielding consistent and reliable long-term intercalibration results.",

            "abstract": "The short-wave infrared Polarization and Multiangle Imager (PMAI) onboard Fengyun-3 precipitation satellite is a new spaceborne imaging polarimeter for clouds and aerosols, with polarization channels of 1030, 1370, and 1640 nm. This study presents a detailed description and assessment of the calibration model of PMAI. For radiometric intensity calibration, multiple parameters in the radiometric model are fit into a single coefficient to simplify calibration. The results show that the radiometric calibration uncertainty of the full image plane is better than 0.02, and the calibration coefficient increases as a field of view increases. The maximal unsaturated incident radiance of all channels is equivalent to 100% albedo, and the signal-to-noise ratio at the referenced radiance is greater than 115 and 182 for the polarized and unpolarized channels, respectively. The response of all channels shows high linearity and good uniformity of the full image plane. Based on the results of intensity calibration, a polarization calibration model using a fully linear polarized light source is introduced with a polarization measurement matrix established by a simplified method and a calculation method. Assessment of polarization measurement indicates that the uncertainties of the obtained degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and angle of linear polarization (AoLP) based on the two methods are highly consistent. When fully linearly polarized light is incident, the measurement error of DoLP using the simplified polarization measurement matrix is within 0.02 and that of AoLP is less than 1\u00b0. Therefore, the simplified radiometric intensity and polarization calibration model meets the measurement accuracy requirements and improves the calibration efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The first C- and Ku-band dual-frequency scatterometer (WindRAD) onboard the Chinese FengYun-3E (FY-3E) satellite was successfully launched in July 2021. The WindRAD scatterometer uses an advanced fan-beam conical scanning mechanism to acquire wind vector data of global ocean surfaces and other geophysical parameters through backscattering measurements of the Earth. This article provides an introduction to the WindRAD instrument, an overview of the data preprocessing, and assessment of WindRAD measurements. The numerical weather prediction-based ocean calibration (NOC) approach, natural targets, and cross-calibration against the Ku-band scatterometer onboard the HY-2B satellite based on collocated backscatter measurements, were used to validate WindRAD backscatter results. The evaluation results revealed that the performance of the WindRAD data is generally in good agreement with other scatterometer data currently in use, while WindRAD backscatter data may contain nonlinear calibration issues that require further investigation. WindRAD has the ability to provide high-quality global backscattering measurements, which can be used for the inversion of various geophysical parameters and assimilation applications.",

            "abstract": "The FengYun-3E Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) occultation sounder II (FY-3E GNOS II) was launched on 5 July 2021. For the first time, based on the new GNOS II sensor, this mission realizes radio occultation (RO) and reflectometry observations using the navigation signals from the third-generation BeiDou System (BDS-3), and it is hence important to assess and analyze the BDS-3 remote sensing performances relative to other systems. Here, we assessed FY-3E GNOS II RO atmospheric retrievals by inter-comparing with corresponding data from the NCEP FNL global atmospheric analysis and FY-3D GNOS mission. The GNOS RO data quality and consistency of the different FY-3 meteorological satellites, i.e., FY-3D and FY-3E, as well as different GNSS systems (GPS, BDS-2, BDS-3) were analyzed. We find that the FY-3E GNOS II RO data exhibit better quality than FY-3D GNOS, particularly in the number, penetration height toward surface, and global coverage by BDS RO profiles, due to the integration of BDS-2 and BDS-3. Additionally, comparing with co-located NCEP FNL analysis profiles, the mean difference (and standard deviation) of the FY-3E GNOS II RO atmospheric refractivity profile retrievals is found to be smaller than 0.2% (and 1%), in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, from 5 to 30 km, and remains consistent at this accuracy and precision level with the FY-3D GNOS RO data. These features provide clear evidence for a high utility of the new GNOS II RO data for weather and climate research and applications.",

            "abstract": "Satellite-based PM2.5 estimation is an effective means to achieve large-scale and long-term PM2.5 monitoring and investigation. Currently, most of methods retrieve PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) or top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR) during daytime. A few algorithms are also developed to retrieve nighttime PM2.5 from the satellite day\u2013night band and the accuracy is greatly limited by moonlight and artificial light sources. In this study, we utilize the properties of absorption pollutants in infrared spectrum to estimate PM2.5 concentrations from satellite infrared data, thus achieve the PM2.5 estimation in both day and night. Himawari-8 infrared bands data are used for PM2.5 estimation by a specifically designed neural network and loss function. Quantitative results show the satellite derived PM2.5 concentrations correlates with ground-based data well with R2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 15.43 \u03bcg \u00b7 m\u22123 for hourly PM2.5 estimation. Spatiotemporal distributions of model-estimated PM2.5 over China are also analyzed, and exhibit a highly consistent with ground-based measurements. Dust storms, heavy air pollution and fire smoke events are examined to further demonstrate the efficacy of our model. Our method not only circumvents the intermediate retrievals of AOD, but also enables consistent estimation of PM2.5 concentrations during daytime and nighttime in real-time monitoring.",
