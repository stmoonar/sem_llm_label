            "abstract": "The Chinese Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is difficult to classify words accurately because of the lack of natural separators. Character embedding can effectively avoid the cumulative errors caused by word division, but carries relatively insufficient inter-character sequence information. In order to solve the problem of insufficient feature representation in Chinese NER model, this paper proposes a new CNER model (DBM-CNER), which has a dual-branch encoder structure. One branch is a new Transformer structure, in which the multi-head self-attention has dual-position encodings, and the other is a feedforward multi-scale dilated convolution fusion mechanism. This structure can better extract the global and local dependencies between characters in text from multiple perspectives, and enhance the ability to extract multi-level context features. Compared with other CNER models, the experimental results on the benchmark datasets in three different fields show that the proposed model is superior to state-of-the-art works.",

            "abstract": "The density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is able to cluster arbitrarily structured datasets. However, the clustering result of this algorithm is exceptionally sensitive to the neighborhood radius (Eps) and noise points, and it is hard to obtain the best result quickly and accurately with it. To solve the above problems, we propose an adaptive DBSCAN method based on the chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA-DBSCAN). First, we take the clustering evaluation index of the DBSCNA algorithm as the objective function and use the chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA) to iteratively optimize the evaluation index value of the DBSCAN algorithm to obtain the best Eps value and clustering result. Then, we introduce the theory of deviation in the data point spatial distance of the nearest neighbor search mechanism to assign the identified noise points, which solves the problem of over-identification of the algorithm noise points. Finally, we construct color image superpixel information to improve the CSA-DBSCAN algorithm\u2019s performance regarding image segmentation. The simulation results of synthetic datasets, real-world datasets, and color images show that the CSA-DBSCAN algorithm can quickly find accurate clustering results and segment color images effectively. The CSA-DBSCAN algorithm has certain clustering effectiveness and practicality.",

DPKT-AP combined the ideology of integrated clustering with the AP algorithm, by introducing the density peak theory and k-means algorithm to carry on the three-stage clustering process. In the first stage, the clustering center point was selected by density peak clustering. Because the clustering center was surrounded by the nearest neighbor point with lower local density and had a relatively large distance from other points with higher density, it could help the k-means algorithm in the second stage avoiding the local optimal situation. In the second stage, the k-means algorithm was used to cluster the data samples to form several relatively small spherical subgroups, and each of subgroups had a local density maximum point, which is called the center point of the subgroup. In the third stage, DPKT-AP used the AP algorithm to merge and cluster the spherical subgroups. Experiments on UCI data sets and synthetic data sets showed that DPKT-AP improved the clustering performance and accuracy for the algorithm.",

To address the afore-mentioned issues, this paper proposes two novel methods namely the constraint rules-based affinity propagation (CRAP) and matching micro-clusters hierarchical clustering algorithm (MMHC). The CRAP algorithm can obtain better results by searching the optimal preference value by means of the constraint rules-based search algorithm (CRS). The MMHC algorithm initially takes results of AP as micro-clusters, then they are matched in order to achieve the right partitions of complex structure data. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved clustering algorithm performs better than AP.",

The solutions were following: 1) density peak algorithm (DP) was introduced to create the local density attribute for AP algorithm; 2) weighted similarity was applied to heighten the similarity extent of data points; 3) growth curve function model was employed with setting a self-adaptive strategy for damping factor ( $\\lambda$ ) to enhance the convergence performance of AP at different stages. To verify the performance of DPWSAP we tested six UCI data sets with different density, different dimensions, and data volume. Experimental results indicated that DPWSAP had better clustering accuracy and convergence performance than original AP algorithm and several other clustering algorithms. In addition, the self-adaptive strategy improved the overall performance for the algorithm, and reduced the possibility of human factors affecting the algorithm effect. The analysis results demonstrated that the DPWSAP had a good research value. Thus, the proposed algorithm had a better research prospect in theory and application fields.",

The halo nodes at the edge of the density peaks clustering algorithm has a lower local density. The outliers are distributed in halo nodes. The novel halo identification method based on density peaks clustering algorithm utilize the advantage of DBSCAN algorithm to quickly identify outliers, which improved the sensitivity to halo nodes. However, the identified halo nodes cannot be effectively assigned to adjacent clusters. Therefore, this paper will use K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to classify the identified halo nodes. K-nearest neighbor is the simplest and most efficient classification method. The KNN algorithm has the advantages of high accuracy, insensitivity to outliers and no input hypothesis data. Hence, we proposed a novel density peaks clustering halo node assignment algorithm based on K-nearest neighbor theory (KNN-HDPC). KNN-HDPC can grasp the internal relations between outliers and cluster nodes more deeply, so as to dig out the deeper relations between nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively cluster and reclassify a large number of complex data. We can quickly dig out the potential relationship between noise points and cluster points. The improved algorithm has higher clustering accuracy than the original DPC algorithm, and essentially has more robust clustering results.",

            "title": "FREDPC: A Feasible Residual Error-Based Density Peak Clustering Algorithm With the Fragment Merging Strategy",
            "abstract": "The most common issues for many clustering algorithms include the slow convergence, requirement for pre-specification of a number of parameters, and the lack of robustness when dealing with anomalies. Recently, the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm was proposed to discover the centers of clusters by finding the density peaks in a dataset based on their local densities. The DPC needs neither an iterative process nor a large number of parameters, and it supports a heuristic approach, known as the decision graph, to manually select cluster centroids. However, the selection of the key parameters of the DPC was not systematically investigated. In this paper, we propose the feasible residual error-based density peak clustering algorithm with the fragment merging strategy, where the local density within the neighborhood region is measured through the residual error computation and the resulting residual errors are then used to generate residual fragments for cluster formation. The model parameters are then able to be calculated from the equations with statistical theoretical justification. We also develop a semi-automatic cluster identification method to eliminate the iterative process of manual centroid selection. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the DPC and other clustering algorithms are demonstrated through experiments on standard benchmark datasets. The proposed method named feasible residual error-based density peak clustering (FREDPC) algorithm with the fragment merging strategy only needs to perform in one single step without any iteration and thus it is fast and has a great potential to be applied on a wide range of applications.",
