            "abstract": "Web authors frequently embed social media to support and enrich their content, creating the potential to derive web-based, cross-platform social media representations that can enable more effective social media retrieval systems and richer scientific analyses. As step toward such capabilities, we introduce a novel language modeling framework that enables automatic annotation of roles that social media entities play in their embedded web context. Using related communication theory, we liken social media embeddings to quotes, formalize the page context as structured natural language signals, and identify a taxonomy of roles for quotes within the page context. We release SocialQuotes, a new data set built from the Common Crawl of over 32 million social quotes, 8.3k of them with crowdsourced quote annotations. Using SocialQuotes and the accompanying annotations, we provide a role classification case study, showing reasonable performance with modern-day LLMs, and exposing explainable aspects of our framework via page content ablations. We also classify a large batch of un-annotated quotes, revealing interesting cross-domain, cross-platform role distributions on the web.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of synthetic data represents a pivotal shift in modern machine learning, offering a solution to satisfy the need for large volumes of data in domains where real data is scarce, highly private, or difficult to obtain. We investigate the feasibility of creating realistic, large-scale synthetic datasets of user-generated content, noting that such content is increasingly prevalent and a source of frequently sought information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a starting point for generating synthetic social media discussion threads, due to their ability to produce diverse responses that typify online interactions. However, as we demonstrate, straightforward application of LLMs yields limited success in capturing the complex structure of online discussions, and standard prompting mechanisms lack sufficient control. We therefore propose a multi-step generation process, predicated on the idea of creating compact representations of discussion threads, referred to as scaffolds. Our framework is generic yet adaptable to the unique characteristics of specific social media platforms. We demonstrate its feasibility using data from two distinct online discussion platforms. To address the fundamental challenge of ensuring the representativeness and realism of synthetic data, we propose a portfolio of evaluation measures to compare various instantiations of our framework.",

            "abstract": "Large language models have shown impressive results for multi-hop mathematical reasoning when the input question is only textual. Many mathematical reasoning problems, however, contain both text and image. With the ever-increasing adoption of vision language models (VLMs), understanding their reasoning abilities for such problems is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs along various axes through the lens of geometry problems. We procedurally create a synthetic dataset of geometry questions with controllable difficulty levels along multiple axes, thus enabling a systematic evaluation. The empirical results obtained using our benchmark for state-of-the-art VLMs indicate that these models are not as capable in subjects like geometry (and, by generalization, other topics requiring similar reasoning) as suggested by previous benchmarks. This is made especially clear by the construction of our benchmark at various depth levels, since solving higher-depth problems requires long chains of reasoning rather than additional memorized knowledge. We release the dataset for further research in this area.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few years, we have observed different media outlets\u2019 attempts to shift public opinion by framing information to support a narrative that facilitate their goals. Malicious users referred to as \u201cpathogenic social media\u201d (PSM) accounts are more likely to amplify this phenomena by spreading misinformation to viral proportions. Understanding the spread of misinformation from account-level perspective is thus a pressing problem. In this work, we aim to present a feature-driven approach to detect PSM accounts in social media. Inspired by the literature, we set out to assess PSMs from three broad perspectives: (1) user-related information (e.g., user activity, profile characteristics), (2) source-related information (i.e., information linked via URLs shared by users) and (3) content-related information (e.g., tweets characteristics). For the user-related information, we investigate malicious signals using causality analysis (i.e., if user is frequently a cause of viral cascades) and profile characteristics (e.g., number of followers, etc.). For the source-related information, we explore various malicious properties linked to URLs (e.g., URL address, content of the associated website, etc.). Finally, for the content-related information, we examine attributes (e.g., number of hashtags, suspicious hashtags, etc.) from tweets posted by users. Experiments on real-world Twitter data from different countries demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying PSM users.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of manipulation of public opinion and political events by malicious social media actors. These users are referred to as \u201cPathogenic Social Media (PSM)\u201d accounts. PSMs are key users in spreading misinformation in social media to viral proportions. These accounts can be either controlled by real users or automated bots. Identification of PSMs is thus of utmost importance for social media authorities. The burden usually falls to automatic approaches that can identify these accounts and protect social media reputation. However, lack of sufficient labeled examples for devising and training sophisticated approaches to combat these accounts is still one of the foremost challenges facing social media firms. In contrast, unlabeled data is abundant and cheap to obtain thanks to massive user-generated data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised causal inference PSM detection framework, SemiPsm, to compensate for the lack of labeled data. In particular, the proposed method leverages unlabeled data in the form of manifold regularization and only relies on cascade information. This is in contrast to the existing approaches that use exhaustive feature engineering (e.g., profile information, network structure, etc.). Evidence from empirical experiments on a real-world ISIS-related dataset from Twitter suggests promising results of utilizing unlabeled instances for detecting PSMs.",

            "abstract": "A growing set of applications consider the process of network formation by using subgraphs as a tool for generating the network topology. One of the pressing research challenges is thus to be able to use these subgraphs to understand the network topology of information cascades which ultimately paves the way to theorize about how information spreads over time. In this paper, we make the first attempt at using network motifs to understand whether or not they can be used as generative elements for the diffusion network organization during different phases of the cascade lifecycle. In doing so, we propose a motif percolation-based algorithm that uses network motifs to measure the extent to which they can represent the temporal cascade network organization. We compare two phases of the cascade lifecycle from the perspective of diffusion-- the phase of steep growth and the phase of inhibition prior to its saturation. Our experiments on a set of cascades from the Weibo platform and with 5-node motifs demonstrate that there are only a few specific motif patterns with triads that are able to characterize the spreading process and hence the network organization during the inhibition region better than during the phase of high growth. In contrast, we do not find compelling results for the phase of steep growth.",

Social media are primarily based on the reports they receive from their own users to mitigate the problem. Despite efforts of social media in suspending many accounts, this solution is not guaranteed to be effective, because not all extremists are caught this way, or they can simply return with another account or migrate to other social networks. In this paper, we design an automatic detection scheme that using as little as three groups of information related to usernames, profile, and textual content of users, determines whether or not a given username belongs to an extremist user. We first demonstrate that extremists are inclined to adopt usernames that are similar to the ones that their like-minded have adopted in the past. We then propose a detection framework that deploys features which are highly indicative of potential online extremism.

These accounts hereafter referred to as \"Pathogenic Social Media (PSM)\" accounts, are often controlled by terrorist supporters, water armies or fake news writers and hence can pose threats to social media and general public. Understanding and analyzing PSMs could help social media firms devise sophisticated and automated techniques that could be deployed to stop them from reaching their audience and consequently reduce their threat. In this paper, we leverage the well-known statistical technique \"Hawkes Process\" to quantify the influence of PSM accounts on the dissemination of malicious information on social media platforms. Our findings on a real world ISIS-related dataset from Twitter indicate that PSMs are significantly different from regular users in making a message viral. Specifically, we observed that PSMs do not usually post URLs from mainstream news sources. Instead, their tweets usually receive large impact on audience, if contained URLs from Facebook and alternative news outlets. In contrary, tweets posted by regular users receive nearly equal impression regardless of the posted URLs and their sources. Our findings can further shed light on understanding and detecting PSM accounts.",

            "title": "Leveraging Motifs to Model the Temporal Dynamics of Diffusion Networks",
            "abstract": "Information diffusion mechanisms based on social influence models are mainly studied using likelihood of adoption when active neighbors expose a user to a message. The problem arises primarily from the fact that for the most part, this explicit information of who-exposed-whom among a group of active neighbors in a social network, before a susceptible node is infected is not available. In this paper, we attempt to understand the diffusion process through information cascades by studying the temporal network structure of the cascades. In doing so, we accommodate the effect of exposures from active neighbors of a node through a network pruning technique that leverages network motifs to identify potential infectors responsible for exposures from among those active neighbors. We attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the components used in modeling cascade dynamics and especially whether the additional effect of the exposure information is useful. Following this model, we develop an inference algorithm namely InferCut, that uses parameters learned from the model and the exposure information to predict the actual parent node of each potentially susceptible user in a given cascade. Empirical evaluation on a real world dataset from Weibo social network demonstrate the significance of incorporating exposure information in recovering the exact parents of the exposed users at the early stages of the diffusion process.",
