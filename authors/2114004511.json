            "abstract": "\n Given\n m\n users (voters), where each user casts her preference for a single item (candidate) over\n n\n items (candidates) as a ballot, the preference aggregation problem returns\n k\n items (candidates) that have the\n k\n highest number of preferences (votes). Our work studies this problem considering\n complex fairness constraints\n that have to be satisfied via proportionate representations of different values of the group protected attribute(s) in the top-\n k\n results. Precisely, we study\n the margin finding problem under single ballot substitutions\n , where a single substitution amounts to removing a vote from candidate\n i\n and assigning it to candidate\n j\n and the goal is to\n minimize the number of single ballot substitutions needed to guarantee that the top-k results satisfy the fairness constraints.\n We study several variants of this problem considering how top-\n k\n fairness constraints are defined, (i) MFBinaryS and MFMultiS are defined when the fairness (proportionate representation) is defined over a single, binary or multivalued, protected attribute, respectively; (ii) MF-Multi2 is studied when top-\n k\n fairness is defined over two different protected attributes; (iii) MFMulti3+ investigates the margin finding problem, considering 3 or more protected attributes. We study these problems theoretically, and present a suite of algorithms with provable guarantees. We conduct rigorous large scale experiments involving multiple real world datasets by appropriately adapting multiple state-of-the-art solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed methods.\n",

            "abstract": "Given multiple individual rank orders over a set of candidates or items, where the candidates belong to multiple (non-binary) protected groups, we study the classical rank aggregation problem subject to proportionate fairness or p-fairness (RAPF in short), considering Kemeny distance. We first study the problem of producing the closest p-fair ranking to an individual ranked order IPF in short) considering Kendall-Tau distance, and present multiple solutions for IPF. We then present two computational frameworks(a randomized randpickperm and a deterministic algpickperm) to solve RAPF that leverages the solutions of IPF as a subroutine. We make several non-trivial algorithmic contributions: (i) we prove that when the group protected attribute is binary, IPF can be solved exactly using a greedy technique; (ii) we present two different solutions for IPF when the group protected attribute is multi-valued, algexact is optimal and algapprox admits a 2 approximation factor; (iii) we design a framework for RAPF solution with an approximation factor that is 2+ the approximation factor of the IPF solution. The resulting randpickperm and algpickperm solutions exhibit 3 and 4 approximation factors when designed using algexact and algapprox, respectively. We run extensive experiments using multiple real world and large scale synthetic datasets and compare our proposed solutions against multiple state-of-the-art related works to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our studied problem and proposed solution.",

            "abstract": "Peer groups leverage the presence of knowledgeable individuals in order to increase the knowledge level of other participants. The \u2018smart\u2019 formation of peer groups can thus play a crucial role in educational settings, including online social networks and learning platforms. Indeed, the targeted groups formation problem, where the objective is to maximize a measure of aggregate knowledge, has received considerable attention in recent literature. In this paper we initiate a dynamic variant of the problem that, unlike previous works, allows the change of group composition over time while still targeting to maximize the aggregated knowledge level. The problem is studied in a principled way, using a realistic learning gain function and for two different interaction modes among the group members. On the algorithmic side, we present DyGroups, a generic algorithmic framework that is greedy in nature and highly scalable. We present non-trivial proofs to demonstrate theoretical guarantees for DyGroups in a special case. We also present real peer learning experiments with humans, and perform synthetic data experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions by comparing against multiple appropriately selected baseline algorithms.",

We initiate the study of recommending deployment strategies for collaborative tasks to requesters that are consistent with deployment parameters they desire: a lower-bound on the quality of the crowd contribution, an upper-bound on the latency of task completion, and an upper-bound on the cost incurred by paying workers. A deployment strategy is a choice of value for three dimensions: Structure (whether to solicit the workforce sequentially or simultaneously), Organization (to organize it collaboratively or independently), and Style (to rely solely on the crowd or to combine it with machine algorithms). We propose StratRec, an optimization-driven middle layer that recommends deployment strategies and alternative deployment parameters to requesters by accounting for worker availability. Our solutions are grounded in discrete optimization and computational geometry techniques that produce results with theoretical guarantees. We present extensive experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and conduct synthetic experiments to validate the qualitative and scalability aspects of StratRec.",

            "abstract": "We investigate online group formation where members seek to increase their learning potential via collaboration. We capture two common learning models: LpA where each member learns from all higher skilled ones, and LpD where the least skilled member learns from the most skilled one. We formulate the problem of forming groups with the purpose of optimizing peer learning under different affinity structures: AffD where group affinity is the smallest between all members, and AffC where group affinity is the smallest between a designated member (e.g., the least skilled or the most skilled) and all others. This gives rise to multiple variants of a multiobjective optimization problem. We propose principled modeling of these problems and investigate theoretical and algorithmic challenges. We first present hardness results, and then develop computationally efficient algorithms with constant approximation factors. Our real-data experiments demonstrate with statistical significance that forming groups considering affinity improves learning.

            "abstract": "Network connections have been shown to be correlated with structural or external attributes of the network vertices in a variety of cases. Given the prevalence of this phenomenon network scientists have developed metrics to quantify its extent. In particular, the assortativity coefficient is used to capture the level of correlation between a single-dimensional attribute (categorical or scalar) of the network nodes and the observed connections, i.e., the edges. Nevertheless, in many cases a multi-dimensional, i.e., vector feature of the nodes is of interest. Similar attributes can describe complex behavioral patterns (e.g., mobility) of the network entities. To date little attention has been given to this setting and there has not been a general and formal treatment of this problem. In this study we develop a metric, the vector assortativity index (VA-index for short), based on network randomization and (empirical) statistical hypothesis testing that is able to quantify the assortativity patterns of a network with respect to a vector attribute. Our extensive experimental results on synthetic network data show that the VA-index outperforms a baseline extension of the assortativity coefficient, which has been used in the literature to cope with similar cases. Furthermore, the VA-index can be calibrated (in terms of parameters) fairly easy, while its benefits increase with the (co-)variance of the vector elements, where the baseline systematically over(under)estimate the true mixing patterns of the network.",
