            "title": "Contextual Matrix Orderings for Graph Collections",
            "abstract": "Visualizing a graph directly via its adjacency matrix is a common and effective technique. Such matrix visualizations rely crucially on a good ordering of the vertices to highlight intrinsic patterns in the graph. When analyzing collections of graphs, such as time varying sequences or connectivity information ranging over multiple specimens, the user currently needs to make the choice: either order each graph individually to optimize its ordering quality, or use a single, simultaneous ordering for all graphs in the collection, which necessarily reduces the ordering quality for the individual graphs.In this paper we explore the space of contextual orderings that lie between these two extremes. Intuitively, contextual orderings maintain a higher level of consistency than individual orderings and deliver a higher ordering quality than simultaneous orderings. To formally reason about contextual orderings we define a distance measure between orderings which is based on individual block moves (IBM). The IBM distance allows us to relate consistency within the context of the collection with ordering quality. Specifically, we define the consistency of an ordering as the IBM distance to the simultaneous ordering for the collection. Our experiments show that already at a small IBM distance to the simultaneous ordering we can find contextual orderings with significantly improved ordering quality. Furthermore, we can create orderings that are nearly as good as individual orderings, but exhibit considerably improved consistency. We hence believe that contextual orderings can enable a more fine-grained analysis of graph collections, by allowing the user to focus on individual graphs while maintaining a sense of the context they appear in.",

            "abstract": "Detecting location-correlated groups in point sets is an important task in a wide variety of applications areas. In addition to merely detecting such groups, the group's shape carries meaning as well. In this paper, we represent a group's shape using a simple geometric object, a line segment. Specifically, given a radius $r$, we say a line segment is representative of a point set $P$ if it is within distance $r$ of each point $p \\in P$. We aim to find the shortest such line segment. This problem is equivalent to stabbing a set of circles of radius $r$ using the shortest line segment. We describe an algorithm to find the shortest representative segment in $O(n \\log h + h \\log^3 h)$ time. Additionally, we show how to maintain a stable approximation of the shortest representative segment when the points in $P$ move.",

We study the problem of creating a minimum-cardinality partition into monochromatic islands. Our input is a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane where each point has one of $k \\geq 2$ colors. A set of points is monochromatic if it contains points of only one color. An island $I$ is a subset of $S$ such that $\\mathcal{CH}(I) \\cap S = I$, where $\\mathcal{CH}(I)$ denotes the convex hull of $I$. We identify an island with its convex hull; therefore, a partition into islands has the additional requirement that the convex hulls of the islands are pairwise-disjoint. We present three greedy algorithms for constructing island partitions and analyze their approximation ratios.",

            "abstract": "Points of interest on a map such as restaurants, hotels, or subway stations, give rise to categorical point data: data that have a fixed location and one or more categorical attributes. Consequently, recent years have seen various set visualization approaches that visually connect points of the same category to support users in understanding the spatial distribution of categories. Existing methods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the same category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we introduce SimpleSets, which uses simple shapes to enclose categorical point patterns, thereby providing a clean overview of the data distribution. SimpleSets is designed to visualize sets of points with a single categorical attribute; as a result, the point patterns enclosed by SimpleSets form a partition of the data. We give formal definitions of point patterns that correspond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions categorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a rendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of shapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm pays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a consistent manner. We compare SimpleSets to the state-of-the-art set visualizations using standard datasets from the literature.",

            "title": "Data-Spatial Layouts for Grid Maps",
            "abstract": "Grid maps are a well-known technique to visualize data associated with spatial regions. A grid map assigns each region to a tile in a grid (often orthogonal or hexagonal) and then represents the associated data values within this tile. Good grid maps represent the underlying geographic space well: regions that are geographically close are close in the grid map and vice versa. Though Tobler\u2019s law suggests that spatial proximity relates to data similarity, local variations may obscure clusters and patterns in the data. For example, there are often clear differences between urban centers and adjacent rural areas with respect to socio-economic indicators. To get a better view of the data distribution, we propose grid-map layouts that take data values into account and place regions with similar data into close proximity. In the limit, such a data layout is essentially a chart and loses all spatial meaning. We present an algorithm to create hybrid layouts, allowing for trade-offs between data values and geographic space when assigning regions to tiles. Our algorithm also handles hierarchical grid maps and allows us to focus either on data or on geographic space on different levels of the hierarchy. Leveraging our algorithm we explore the design space of (hierarchical) grid maps with a hybrid layout and their semantics.",

            "title": "Optimizing Symbol Visibility through Displacement",
            "abstract": "In information visualization, the position of symbols often encodes associated data values. When visualizing data elements with both a numerical and a categorical dimension, positioning in the categorical axis admits some flexibility. This flexibility can be exploited to reduce symbol overlap, and thereby increase legibility. In this paper we initialize the algorithmic study of optimizing symbol legibility via a limited displacement of the symbols. Specifically, we consider unit square symbols that need to be placed at specified $y$-coordinates. We optimize the drawing order of the symbols as well as their $x$-displacement, constrained within a rectangular container, to maximize the minimum visible perimeter over all squares. If the container has width and height at most $2$, there is a point that stabs all squares. In this case, we prove that a staircase layout is arbitrarily close to optimality and can be computed in $O(n\\log n)$ time. If the width is at most $2$, there is a vertical line that stabs all squares, and in this case, we give a 2-approximation algorithm that runs in $O(n\\log n)$ time. As a minimum visible perimeter of $2$ is always trivially achievable, we measure this approximation with respect to the visible perimeter exceeding $2$. We show that, despite its simplicity, the algorithm gives asymptotically optimal results for certain instances.",
