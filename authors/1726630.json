            "title": "Characteristics of Deep and Skim Reading on Smartphones vs. Desktop: A Comparative Study",
            "abstract": "Deep reading fosters text comprehension, memory, and critical thinking. The growing prevalance of digital reading on mobile interfaces raises concerns that deep reading is being replaced by skimming and sifting through information, but this is currently unmeasured. Traditionally, reading quality is assessed using comprehension tests, which require readers to explicitly answer a set of carefully composed questions. To quantify and understand reading behaviour in natural settings and at scale, however, implicit measures are needed of deep versus skim reading across desktop and mobile devices, the most prominent digital reading platforms. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically induce deep and skim reading and subsequently train classifiers to discriminate these two reading styles based on eye movement patterns and interaction data. Based on a user study with 29 participants, we created models that detect deep reading on both devices with up to 0.82 AUC. We present the characteristics of deep reading and discuss how our models can be used to measure the effect of reading UI design and monitor long-term changes in reading behaviours.",

            "abstract": "Temporal target selection requires users to wait and trigger the selection input within a bounded time window, with a selection cursor that is expected to be delayed. This task conceptualizes, for example, a variety of game scenarios such as determining the timing of shooting a projectile towards a moving object. In this work, we explore models that predict \u201cwhen\u201d users typically perform a selection (i.e., user selection distribution) and their selection error rates in such tasks. We hypothesize that users react to temporal factors including \u201cdistance\u201d, \u201cwidth\u201d, and \u201cdelay\u201d as how they treat the corresponding variables in spatial target selection. The derived models are evaluated in a controlled experiment and an MTurk-based online study. Our research contributes new knowledge on user behavior in temporal target selection tasks and its potential connection with its spatial correspondence. Our models and conclusions can benefit both users and designers of relevant interactive applications.",

In critical settings, such as medical diagnosis, criminal judgment, or information consumption, these cognitive biases hinder optimal decision outcomes, thereby resulting in dangerous decisions and negative societal impact. The use of AI systems can amplify and exacerbate cognitive biases in their users. In this workshop, we seek to foster discussions on ongoing research around cognitive biases in human-AI collaboration and identify future research directions to understand, quantify, and mitigate the effects of cognitive biases. We will explore cognitive biases appearing in various contexts of human-AI collaboration: what can cause them?; how can we measure, model, mitigate, and manage cognitive biases?; and how can we utilise cognitive biases for the greater good? We will reflect on workshop discussions to form a research community around cognitive biases and bias-aware systems.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive biases have been shown to play a critical role in creating echo chambers and spreading misinformation. They undermine our ability to evaluate information and can influence our behaviour without our awareness. To allow the study of occurrences and effects of biases on information consumption behaviour, we explore indicators for cognitive biases in physiological and interaction data. Therefore, we conducted two experiments investigating how people experience statements that are congruent or divergent from their own ideological stance. We collected interaction data, eye tracking data, hemodynamic responses, and electrodermal activity while participants were exposed to ideologically tainted statements. Our results indicate that people spend more time processing statements that are incongruent with their own opinion. We detected differences in blood oxygenation levels between congruent and divergent opinions, a first step towards building systems to detect and quantify cognitive biases.",

            "abstract": "Algorithms increasingly curate the information we see online, prioritizing attention and engagement. By catering to personal preferences, they confirm existing opinions and reinforce cognitive biases. When it comes to polarizing topics such as climate change or abortion rights, the combination of algorithmic information curation and cognitive biases can easily skew our perception and, thus, undermine our critical thinking abilities while creating a thriving ground for misinformation. To curb the spread of misinformation, a research agenda is needed around the interplay between cognitive biases, computing systems, and online platform design. In this article, we synthesize insights from a workshop series, propose a research agenda, and sketch out a blueprint for technologies to support critical thinking through the lens of human\u2013computer interaction and design. We discuss the affordances of online media and how they could prioritize teaching users how to spot misinformation better and conduct themselves in online environments.",

We analysed and critically assessed the different approaches used in the three stages (perception, learning, inference) of a typical mobile emotion sensing framework, following a structured paper selection process. The contribution of this survey is three-fold; first, we document all the latest relevant literature on mobile emotion sensing research; second, we describe how mobile and wearable devices use their sensing and computing capabilities to monitor human emotions; third, we discuss challenges and opportunities of mobile emotion sensing to demonstrate the potential of this thriving field of research.",

However, due to the low compliance and quality of hand hygiene reported in previous studies, constant monitoring of healthcare workers' hand hygiene compliance and quality is crucial. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using a thermal camera together with an RGB camera to detect hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation, thereby monitoring handrub quality.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 32 participants for this study. Participants were required to perform four types of handrubs to produce different hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation. After each task, participants' hands were photographed under a thermal camera and an RGB camera, while an ultraviolet (UV) test was used to provide the ground truth of hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation. Then, a U-Net was used to segment areas covered with alcohol-based formulations from thermal images, and the system performance was evaluated by comparing coverage differences between thermal images and UV images regarding accuracy and Dice coefficient.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe system yields promising results in terms of accuracy (93.5%) and Dice coefficient (87.1%) when observations take place 10 seconds after performing handrub. In addition, we also examine the system performance change over a 60-second observation period, and the accuracy and Dice coefficient still remain at about 92.4% and 85.7% when observation happens at the 60-second time point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGiven these encouraging results, thermal imaging shows its potential feasibility in providing accurate, constant, and systematic hand hygiene quality monitoring.",

The information is invisible to the human eye and can be read using thermal imaging after temperature transfer through interaction with the objects. Prior methods either modify the surface appearance, require customized devices or not commonly used materials, or embed components that are not fully 3D printable. Such limitations restrict the design space for 3D prints, or cannot be readily applied to the already deployed 3D printing setups. In this paper, we present an information embedding technique using low-cost off-the-shelf dual extruder FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printers, common materials (e.g., generic PLA), and a mobile thermal device (e.g., a thermal smartphone), by leveraging the thermal properties of common 3D print materials. In addition, we show our method can also be generalized to conventional near-infrared imaging scenarios. We evaluate our technique against multiple design and fabrication parameters and propose a design guideline for different use cases. Finally, we demonstrate various everyday applications enabled by our method, such as interactive thermal displays, user-activated augmented reality, automating thermal triggered events, and hidden tokens for social activities.",

            "abstract": "Implicit tendencies and cognitive biases play an important role in how information is perceived and processed, a fact that can be both utilised and exploited by computing systems. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) has been widely used to assess people\u2019s associations of target concepts with qualitative attributes, such as the likelihood of being hired or convicted depending on race, gender, or age. The condensed version\u2013the Brief IAT\u2013aims to implicit biases by measuring the reaction time to concept classifications. To use this measure in HCI research, however, we need a way to construct and validate target concepts, which tend to quickly evolve and depend on geographical and cultural interpretations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new method to appropriate the BIAT using crowdsourcing to measure people\u2019s leanings on polarising topics. We present a web-based tool to test participants\u2019 bias on custom themes, where self-assessments often fail. We validated our approach with 14 domain experts and assessed the fit of crowdsourced test construction. Our method allows researchers of different domains to create and validate bias tests that can be geographically tailored and updated over time. We discuss how our method can be applied to surface implicit user biases and run studies where cognitive biases may impede reliable results.",

            "abstract": "Given the prevalence of online misinformation and our scarce cognitive capacity, Internet users have been shown to frequently fall victim to such information. As some studies have investigated psychological factors that make people susceptible to believe or share misinformation, some ongoing research further put these findings into practice by objectively identifying when and which users are vulnerable to misinformation. In this position paper, we highlight two ongoing avenues of research to identify vulnerable users: detecting cognitive biases and exploring misinformation spreaders. We also discuss the potential implications of these objective approaches: discovering more cohorts of vulnerable users and prompting interventions to more effectively address the right group of users. Lastly, we point out two of the understudied contexts for misinformation vulnerability research as opportunities for future research.",
