            "abstract": "According to whether a connection to the receiver is established before data transmission, random access schemes can be divided into two categories: connection-based and connection-free. For cellular networks, its connection-based access mechanism has been heavily criticized for being ill-suited to Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. With the existing studies overwhelmingly focusing on the physical-layer transmission and detection design of various connection-free access schemes, less attention has been paid to the fundamental understanding of when connection establishment could be beneficial. The challenge originates from the lack of proper modeling of connection-based random access. In this paper, a scalable model that incorporates each node\u2019s queueing behavior is proposed for connection-based slotted Aloha, based on which both the data throughput and the mean queueing delay of data packets are characterized, optimized, and compared with those for connection-free slotted Aloha. Conditions for beneficial connection establishment in terms of the optimal throughput and queueing delay performance are discussed and applied to cellular networks with the newly introduced Random Access-based Small Data Transmission (RA-SDT) schemes. The analysis offers important insights for the optimal access design of M2M communications.",

            "abstract": "Delay and information transmission rate are two fundamental quantities in communication systems. The information-theoretic capacity provides the ultimate limit of the transmission rate for reliable communications, yet with the effect of delay either completely ignored or partially considered. How to incorporate delay constraints into capacity characterization is one of the long-standing fundamental problems in wireless communications, which has gained a renewed sense of urgency with the increasingly demanding requirements for high data rate and low latency. The challenge lies in establishing an analytical framework that can integrate the accurate characterization of delay with the information-theoretic capacity. In this paper, by modeling the information flow as a queue of codewords, we demonstrate that the service process is the key that associates both the information output rate and the access/queueing delay performance. For a given mean-access-delay constraint, the maximum information output rate is characterized in various conditions in fading channels. The analysis shows that the mean-access-delay constraint has a crucial impact on the maximum information output rate when it is below a certain threshold. To achieve the maximum information output rate, the information encoding rate needs to be carefully tuned according to the delay constraint, which diminishes as the constraint becomes more strict. Discussions on how to incorporate feedback overhead and other delay constraints including the mean queueing delay and access delay deadline into the rate analysis are also presented.",

            "abstract": "As one of the most representative random-access schemes, slotted Aloha has been adopted in various wireless communication networks. A multi-cell Aloha network may easily become unstable as the inter-cell interference grows if the traffic input rates and transmission probabilities of nodes are not properly regulated. Yet how to stabilize a multi-cell Aloha network has remained largely unknown. To address the above open issue, an analytical framework is proposed in this paper for multi-cell Aloha networks to characterize the stability region of traffic input rates and operating region of transmission probabilities of nodes for achieving network stability. Specifically, the inter-cell interference level is captured by the overlapping ratio of each cell, and shown to be a key factor that determines the stability performance. For a two-cell Aloha network, the stability region of input rates and complete operating regions of transmission probabilities are obtained as functions of the overlapping ratios of cells. For the general $M$ -cell case, a transmission control algorithm is further proposed to stabilize the network only based on the local information exchange between neighboring cells, with effectiveness demonstrated through simulations.",

In addition, with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays employed at BSs, the beamspace channel is sparse for each user, and thus there is no need to serve all the users in a cell by all the beams therein jointly. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop a flexible clustered cell-free networking scheme that can decompose the whole network into a number of weakly interfered small subnetworks operating independently and in parallel. Given a per-user rate constraint for service quality guarantee, this paper aims to maximize the number of decomposed subnetworks so as to reduce the signaling overhead and system complexity as much as possible. By formulating it as a bipartite graph partitioning problem, a rate-constrained network decomposition (RC-NetDecomp) algorithm is proposed, which can smoothly tune the network structure from the current cellular network with simple beam allocation to a fully cooperative network by increasing the required per-user rate.

Specifically, we investigate the PLDPC code, generalized space shift keying (GSSK) modulation, and MPPM constellation. First, we propose a type of novel GSMPPM constellations that intelligently integrates the GSSK into MPPM, referred to as asymmetric dual-mode (ADM) constellations, so as to improve the performance of the PLDPC-coded GSMPPM system. Furthermore, exploiting a protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm, we construct a type of improved PLDPC code, referred to as I-PLDPC code, which outperforms the existing PLDPC codes over weak turbulence channels. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed ADM constellations and the proposed I-PLDPC code can obtain noticeable performance gains over their counterparts. Therefore, the proposed PLDPC-coded GSMPPM system with ADM constellations is competent to satisfy the high-reliability requirement for FSO applications.",

            "abstract": "As one of the two fundamental types of multiple access, random access has been widely adopted in various communication networks, and expected to play an increasingly central role owing to the rising popularity of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Despite decades of successful applications, the theory of random access has long been underdeveloped, with key fundamental issues unresolved. Among them, stability of random-access networks is the most long-standing one that has received continuous attention for almost half a century. The challenge lies in establishing an analytical framework where the coupled service processes of nodes\u2019 queues can be characterized. In this paper, by extending our previously proposed analytical framework from the symmetric scenario to the general one, we tackle three open questions: 1) How to characterize the coupled service rates of nodes? 2) How to determine the stability region of input rates, only within which the network can be stabilized? 3) For given input rates within the stability region, how to tune the transmission probabilities of nodes to stabilize the network? We demonstrate that the key to characterizing the coupled service rates lies in properly establishing and solving the fixed-point equations of steady-state probabilities of successful transmission of Head-of-Line (HOL) packets of nodes. For the stability region of input rates, which closely depends on the definition of stability, two types of stability, i.e., queue-stability and throughput-stability, are considered, and both stability regions are shown to be determined by the sufficient and necessary condition of the existence of positive real roots of the fixed-point equations. To characterize the operating regions of transmission probabilities, constraints need to be further developed to ensure that the network operates at the specific steady-state point. The analysis shows that to stabilize the network, the transmission probabilities of nodes can be tuned only based on their long-term traffic input rates. Although the main results are illustrated based on Aloha with Constant Backoff, discussions on how to incorporate a general backoff function and other features of random access are also presented.",

            "abstract": "With the emerging unlicensed spectrum sharing and Machine-to-Machine communications, the coexistence performance of multiple devices with different access schemes operating at the same unlicensed bands has received significant research interests. As the two most representative random-access schemes, Aloha and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) both found wide applications in unlicensed bands. Yet most of the studies have focused on the coexistence of CSMA-based networks, leaving the coexistence of Aloha-based and CSMA-based networks largely unexplored. The challenge originates from the lack of a coexistence model of slotted Aloha and CSMA. In this paper, the throughput performance of coexisting Aloha and CSMA networks is characterized and optimized by extending a unified analytical framework proposed for random-access networks. The analysis shows that different from the single-network case where the maximum throughput of CSMA is much higher thanks to carrier sensing, when Aloha and CSMA coexist, Aloha would significantly outperform CSMA if each network optimizes its own throughput performance without cooperation, leading to poor throughput performance for CSMA and severe unfairness. To achieve fair coexistence, inter-network cooperation is crucial. The optimal transmission probabilities of Aloha and CSMA for maximizing the total network throughput under a given throughput ratio are further derived, and applied to coexisting LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks to optimize their coexistence performance.",

Specifically, by deriving the outage probability for given maximum allowable access delay as a function of system parameters, the outage probability is minimized by optimally tuning the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor. For given outage probability bound, the admission control and resource allocation for the random access channel are further discussed, where the maximum number of Machine-Type Devices (MTDs) that can be admitted with given number of preambles and the minimum number of preambles that should be allocated with given network size are obtained. Compared to the standard setting where the ACB factor is fixed, significant gains in outage probability are demonstrated by optimally tuning the ACB factor according to the number of MTDs and the traffic input rate of each MTD. It is also shown that for given required outage probability bound, the optimal tuning of ACB factor enables much more MTDs to be admitted for given preamble resource, and requires much fewer preambles for given network size.",

            "abstract": "Slotted Aloha provides a simple way for accommodating the massive access of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Yet, the delay performance of slotted Aloha has long been observed to significantly deteriorate as the network size grows. It is therefore important to study how to optimize the delay performance of slotted Aloha in a large-scale network. This paper focuses on the optimization of access delay of a buffered slotted Aloha network, where $n$ nodes transmit to a common receiver in fading channels. Specifically, by deriving the closed-form expressions of the network steady-state points in both unsaturated and saturated conditions, the first and second moments of access delay of each packet are obtained as explicit functions of system parameters, and minimized by optimizing the transmission probability of each node. The analysis shows that to achieve the minimum mean access delay, the transmission probability of each node should be reduced as the network size increases, leading to a diminishing node data rate unless the information encoding rate is jointly optimized. The minimum mean access delay for a given data rate requirement is further characterized, and effects of key parameters such as the minimum required data rate for each node, the mean received signal-to-noise ratio of each packet and the number of nodes on the rate-constrained minimum mean access delay are discussed. The practical insights of the analysis are also demonstrated by taking the example of an LTE-M system with smart grid applications.",
