            "abstract": "Many data-intensive applications, including smart logistics, smart cities, intelligent factories, etc. have been made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to the large amounts of data produced, it is no longer viable to upload all data to the cloud, as it results in network congestion, low throughput, high latency, and privacy issues. Edge processing provides a solution to these problems and aims to process data as close to the source. However, a generic approach to edge processing that can decide which components to offload is still missing. Cascading Reasoning (CR) is a vision that aims to realize highly expressive reasoning over high-frequency data by introducing a layered approach. The lowest layers employ low-complexity techniques and select relevant parts of the data. Going up in the layers, the complexity increases while the data volume decreases as each layer selects relevant parts for further processing. CR aligns with Edge processing, as lower layers can be processed closer to the source, i.e. the Edge, and the expressive reasoning allows to handle the data variety and domain knowledge imposed by the IoT. However, until now, CR approaches required to manually define the various layers. In this paper, we propose a generic CR Edge processing platform that can decide which parts of the queries to offload to the Edge and how to optimize the queries and reasoning rules for efficient Edge processing.",

            "abstract": "A healthy and safe indoor environment is an important part of containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",

            "abstract": "Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data from heterogeneous sources with domain knowledge and context information in real-time is a challenging task in IoT healthcare data management applications that can be solved with semantics. Existing IoT platforms often have issues with preserving the privacy of patient data. Moreover, configuring and managing context-aware stream processing queries in semantic IoT platforms requires much manual, labor-intensive effort. Generic queries can deal with context changes but often lead to performance issues caused by the need for expressive real-time semantic reasoning. In addition, query window parameters are part of the manual configuration and cannot be made context-dependent. To tackle these problems, this paper presents DIVIDE, a component for a semantic IoT platform that adaptively derives and manages the queries of the platform\u2019s stream processing components in a context-aware and scalable manner, and that enables privacy by design. By performing semantic reasoning to derive the queries when context changes are observed, their real-time evaluation does require any reasoning. The results of an evaluation on a homecare monitoring use case demonstrate how activity detection queries derived with DIVIDE can be evaluated in on average less than 3.7 seconds and can therefore successfully run on low-end IoT devices.",

As a consequence, the Web infrastructure is evolving to enable continuous and reactive data access. Since data streams available on the Web originate from a variety of sources, they are highly heterogeneous. Indeed, addressing data variety and velocity simultaneously is inevitable. Stream Reasoning is the research field that studies how to combine data integration techniques with stream processing technologies. In particular, solutions for RDF Stream Processing (RSP) combine stream processing notions with data integration standards. This tutorial paper presents RSP4J, a innovative API that aims at fostering the adoption of RSP by simplifying the usage, benchmarking, and fast prototyping of Web Stream Processing applications.",

A few attempts were already made in the past to improve negative sampling by exploiting schematic domain and range constraints. However, such approaches did not exploit the full range of schematic axioms. To remedy this situation, we introduce a new type of conditional constraints based on OWL restrictions. Additionally, we investigate two alternative views on how constraints might be used to generate false triples\u2014an open world view and a closed world view\u2014and perform empirical evaluations for both of them. Our results indicate that in the closed world view, even a limited number of OWL constraints can improve link prediction performance. Also, for regular constraints, both open world and closed world views offer signi\ufb01cant improvements with respect to baseline negative sampling techniques.",

Stream Reasoning (SR) is the research \ufb01eld that aims to solve the heterogeneity, noisiness, and incompleteness problems that come with the processing of continuously produced data. The use of Semantic Web technologies allows to mitigate many of these problems. RDF Stream Processing (RSP), a sub\ufb01eld of SR, speci\ufb01cally deals with the processing of RDF data streams. Many RSP engines and solutions exist, however, none provide the \ufb02exibility to rapidly create a prototype for new RSP applications or aid in the design of new components. In this demonstration paper, we showcase Streaming MASSIF Prototypes, a RSP prototyping platform that provides the necessary tooling to e\ufb00ortlessly create new RSP applications. Furthermore, the available tooling and the inherent \ufb02exibility of the platform allow researchers and developers to fully focus on the design of new RSP components, hiding super\ufb02uous complexities and con\ufb01gurations.",

            "abstract": "In healthcare, the aging of the population is resulting in a gradual shift from residential care to home care, requiring reliable follow-up of elderly people by a whole network of care providers. The environment of these patients is increasingly being equipped with different monitoring devices, which allow to obtain insight into the current condition of patient & environment. However, current monitoring platforms that support care providers are centralized and not personalized, reducing performance, scalability, autonomy and privacy. Because the available data is only exposed through custom APIs, profile knowledge cannot be efficiently exchanged, which is required to provide optimal care. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed data-driven platform, built on Semantic Web technologies, that enables the integration of all profile knowledge in order to deliver personalized continuous home care. It provides a distributed smart monitoring service, which allows to locally monitor only the relevant sensors according to the patient\u2019s profile, and infer personalized decisions when analyzing events. Moreover, it provides a medical treatment planning service, which composes treatment plans tailored to each patient, including personalized quality of service parameters allowing a doctor to select the optimal plan. To illustrate how the platform delivers these services, the paper also presents a demonstrator using a realistic home care scenario.",
