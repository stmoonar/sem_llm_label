            "title": "Face hallucination using multisource references and cross\u2010scale dual residual fusion mechanism",
            "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in enhancing the quality of low\u2010resolution (LR) facial images for various social life applications. Existing methods often use domain\u2010specific prior knowledge, which is effective in improving the face super\u2010resolution model's performance. However, it is challenging to obtain rich and accurate prior information from LR inputs in real\u2010world scenarios, which can limit the robustness and generalization ability of the developed face super\u2010resolution model. In this paper, a multisource reference\u2010based face super\u2010resolution Network, namely MSRNet, is proposed. Without considering the prior knowledge of faces, the network can reconstruct a LR face image with a magnitude factor of 8 under the guidance of multiple reference face images of different identities. By constructing an \u201cappearance\u2010alike\u201d reference data set Face_Ref, the designed MSRNet aims to fully exploit the local and spatially similar high frequency information between the distinct references and the current face. More specifically, to effectively combine the information from multiple references, a cross\u2010scale and cross\u2010space feature fusion mechanism is introduced for external and internal references, and then the enhanced local semantics are finally incorporated into the high\u2010resolution face reconstruction. The robustness of face image super\u2010resolution is increased compared to current correlation approaches, since it not only eliminates the need for face prior knowledge but also avoids performing alignment operations on reference faces with multiple expressions and different poses. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to produce results for face super\u2010resolution that are satisfying and dependable and outperforms the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods in terms of visual perceptual quality and quantity evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Chinese herbal medicine is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). With developing of traditional Chinese medicine, the usage of Chinese herbal medicine is growing rapidly. It is essential to identify Chinese herbal medicine correctly since Chinese herbal medicine is used to treat disease. However, identifying Chinese herbal medicine is a hard task because lots of Chinese herbal medicine with different properties displays similar appearance, such as Radix StephaniaeTetrandrae and Radix Paeoniae Alba. Traditional methods of classifying Chinese herbal medicine are low-efficiency and rely on professional medical knowledge. Machine learning methods can reduce the need for professional knowledge in some fields due to its self-learning ability. In this study, a framework, called CNN & BLS, combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) with broad learning system (BLS) for identifying the Chinese herbal medicine, is proposed. Experimental results show the CNN & BLS displays the promising performance for identifying Chinese herbal medicine.",

            "abstract": "Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is the core of medical information system in hospital. EMRs arises from the medical institution, and large amount of clinical data generated every day. Due to the EMRs contains many medical entities and clinical information of the patient, by analyzing and mining the texts data, medical knowledge which closely related to patients or certain diseases can be obtained. In this paper, we ues the EMRs of patients with Esophageal Carcinoma(EC), which include the clinical symptoms of the patients, tests they have undergone, results of the examinations, and the diagnosis and treatment plan. In this paper, word vector training is carried out for large-scale electronic medical record corpus by means of the skip model of word2vec deep learning tool. Then applying the features data to the k-means clustering algorithm to identifying medical entities about EC by word clustering. As the first step of medical knowledge mining, medical entity recognition is the premise of extracting the semantic relationship implied in medical text and structuring EMRs.",
