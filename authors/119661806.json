            "abstract": "New advancements for the detection of synthetic images are critical for fighting disinformation, as the capabilities of generative AI models continuously evolve and can lead to hyper-realistic synthetic imagery at unprecedented scale and speed. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of generalizing across different concept classes, e.g., when training a detector on human faces and testing on synthetic animal images \u2013 highlighting the ineffectiveness of existing approaches that randomly sample generated images to train their models. By contrast, we propose an approach based on the premise that the robustness of the detector can be enhanced by training it on realistic synthetic images that are selected based on their quality scores according to a probabilistic quality estimation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting experiments with generated images from two seminal architectures, StyleGAN2 and Latent Diffusion, and using three different concepts for each, so as to measure the cross-concept generalization ability. Our results show that our quality-based sampling method leads to higher detection performance for nearly all concepts, improving the overall effectiveness of the synthetic image detectors.",

            "abstract": "We introduce S2VS, a video similarity learning approach with self-supervision. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is typically used to train deep models on a proxy task so as to have strong transferability on target tasks after fine-tuning. Here, in contrast to prior work, SSL is used to perform video similarity learning and address multiple retrieval and detection tasks at once with no use of labeled data. This is achieved by learning via instance-discrimination with task-tailored augmentations and the widely used InfoNCE loss together with an additional loss operating jointly on self-similarity and hard-negative similarity. We benchmark our method on tasks where video relevance is defined with varying granularity, ranging from video copies to videos depicting the same incident or event. We learn a single universal model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks, surpassing previously proposed methods that use labeled data.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of image splicing localization with a multi-stream network architecture that processes the raw RGB image in parallel with other handcrafted forensic signals. Unlike previous methods that either use only the RGB images or stack several signals in a channel-wise manner, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture that consists of multiple encoder streams. Each stream is fed with either the tampered image or handcrafted signals and processes them separately to capture relevant information from each one independently. Finally, the extracted features from the multiple streams are fused in the bottleneck of the architecture and propagated to the decoder network that generates the output localization map. We experiment with two handcrafted algorithms, i.e., DCT and Splicebuster. Our proposed approach is benchmarked on three public forensics datasets, demonstrating competitive performance against several competing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results, e.g., 0.898 AUC on CASIA.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we introduce InDistill, a model compression approach that combines knowledge distillation and channel pruning in a unified framework for the transfer of the critical information flow paths from a heavyweight teacher to a lightweight student. Such information is typically collapsed in previous methods due to an encoding stage prior to distillation. By contrast, InDistill leverages a pruning operation applied to the teacher's intermediate layers reducing their width to the corresponding student layers' width. In that way, we force architectural alignment enabling the intermediate layers to be directly distilled without the need of an encoding stage. Additionally, a curriculum learning-based training scheme is adopted considering the distillation difficulty of each layer and the critical learning periods in which the information flow paths are created. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art performance on three standard benchmarks, i.e. CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and FashionMNIST by 3.08%, 14.27%, and 1% mAP, respectively, as well as on more challenging evaluation settings, i.e. ImageNet and CIFAR-100 by 1.97% and 5.65% mAP, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Unobtrusive mental state monitoring based on neurosphysiological signals has seen thriving developments over the past decade, with a wide area of applications, from rehabilitation to neuroergonomics and neuromarketing. Particularly, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) have been popular techniques to obtain cognitive-relevant biosignals. However, current wearable systems may still pose practical inconvenience, motivating further interest to integrate EOG+EEG recording into streamlined frontal-only sensor montages with sufficient signal fidelity. We propose, here, a spatial filtering approach to reliably extract EOG signals from a reduced set of frontal EEG electrodes, placed on non-hair-bearing (NHB) areas. Within a common signal analytic framework, two distinct schemes are examined. The one is based on standard linear least squares (LLS) and the other on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Both schemes are data-driven techniques, require a small amount of training data, and lead to reliable estimators of EOG activity from EEG signals. The LASSO-based technique, in addition, provides guidelines that generalize well across subjects. Using experimental data, we provide some empirical evidence that our estimators can replace the actual EOG signals in algorithmic pipelines that automatically detect oculographic events, like blinks and saccades.",

A total of 30 tools for content creation, promotion and monetization are reviewed. The target groups, i.e. creator groups, are divided in 10 types according to their role in 3D media production. Based on this division 10 candidate TO-BE scenarios have been identified and out of these 10 scenarios, we have selected 6 scenarios for validation by media creators. The validation was performed through a survey of 24 statements on a 5 Likert scale by 47 individuals from the domains of Media, Fine arts, Architecture, and Informatics. Useful evaluation results and comments have been collected that can be useful for future systems design.",

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to improve the accuracy of simple classifiers in centralized settings by leveraging naturally occurring network links, but graph convolutional layers are challenging to implement in decentralized settings when node neighbors are not constantly available. We address this problem by employing decoupled GNNs, where base classifier predictions and errors are diffused through graphs after training. For these, we deploy pre-trained and gossip-trained base classifiers and implement peer-to-peer graph diffusion under communication uncertainty. In particular, we develop an asynchronous decentralized formulation of diffusion that converges to centralized predictions in distribution and linearly with respect to communication rates. We experiment on three real-world graphs with node features and labels and simulate peer-to-peer networks with uniformly random communication frequencies; given a portion of known labels, our decentralized graph diffusion achieves comparable accuracy to centralized GNNs with minimal communication overhead (less than 3% of what gossip training already adds).",

The goal of this work is to introduce the methodology and software tools for contributing toward transforming the existing intuition-based paradigm of policy-making into an evidence-driven approach enabled by heterogeneous sources of data already available in the city. More specifically, methods for data collection, efficient data storage, and data analysis are implemented to measure the economic activity, assess the environmental impact and evaluate the social consequences of certain policy decisions. Subsequently, the extracted pieces of evidence are used to inform, advise, monitor, evaluate, and revise the decisions made by policy planners. Our contribution in this work is on outlining and deploying an easily extendable system architecture to harmonize and analyze heterogeneous data sources in ways that are found to be useful for policy-makers. For evaluating this architecture, we examine the case of a controlled parking system in the city of Thessaloniki and try to optimize its operation by balancing effectively between economic growth, environmental protection, and citizen satisfaction.",

            "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u2010based systems are widely employed nowadays to make decisions that have far\u2010reaching impact on individuals and society. Their decisions might affect everyone, everywhere, and anytime, entailing concerns about potential human rights issues. Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond traditional AI algorithms optimized for predictive performance and embed ethical and legal principles in their design, training, and deployment to ensure social good while still benefiting from the huge potential of the AI technology. The goal of this survey is to provide a broad multidisciplinary overview of the area of bias in AI systems, focusing on technical challenges and solutions as well as to suggest new research directions towards approaches well\u2010grounded in a legal frame. In this survey, we focus on data\u2010driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms. If otherwise not specified, we use the general term bias to describe problems related to the gathering or processing of data that might result in prejudiced decisions on the bases of demographic features such as race, sex, and so forth.",

            "title": "Error-aware BCIs",
            "abstract": "The ability of recognizing and correcting the erroneous actions is an integral part of human nature. Plenty of neuroscientific studies have been investigating the ability of human brain to recognize errors. The distinct neuronal responses that are produced by the human brain during the perception of an erroneous action are referred to as error-related potentials (ErrPs). Although research in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has managed to achieve significant improvement in terms of detecting the users'intentions over the last years, in a real-world setting, the interpretation of brain commands still remains an error-prone procedure leading to inaccurate interactions. Even for multimodal interaction schemes, the attained performance is far from optimal. As a means to overcome these debilities, and apart from developing more sophisticated machine-learning techniques or adding further modalities, scientists have also exploited the users' ability to perceive errors. During the rapid growth of the BCI/Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) technology over the last years, ErrPs have been used widely in order to enhance several existing BCI applications serving as a passive correction mechanism towards a more user-friendly environment. The principal idea is that a BCI system may incorporate, as feedback, the user's judgement about its function and use this feedback to correct its current output. In this chapter, we discuss the potentials and applications of ErrPs into developing hybrid BCI systems that emphasize in reliability and user experience by introducing the so-called error awareness.",
