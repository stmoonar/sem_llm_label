            "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented question-answering systems combine retrieval techniques with large language models to provide answers that are more accurate and informative. Many existing toolkits allow users to quickly build such systems using off-the-shelf models, but they fall short in supporting researchers and developers to customize the model training, testing, and deployment process. We propose LocalRQA, an open-source toolkit that features a wide selection of model training algorithms, evaluation methods, and deployment tools curated from the latest research. As a showcase, we build QA systems using online documentation obtained from Databricks and Faire's websites. We find 7B-models trained and deployed using LocalRQA reach a similar performance compared to using OpenAI's text-ada-002 and GPT-4-turbo.",

            "title": "Mixture of Soft Prompts for Controllable Data Generation",
            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) effectively generate fluent text when the target output follows natural language patterns. However, structured prediction tasks confine the output format to a limited ontology, causing even very large models to struggle since they were never trained with such restrictions in mind. The difficulty of using LLMs for direct prediction is exacerbated in few-shot learning scenarios, which commonly arise due to domain shift and resource limitations. We flip the problem on its head by leveraging the LLM as a tool for data augmentation rather than direct prediction. Our proposed Mixture of Soft Prompts (MSP) serves as a parameter-efficient procedure for generating data in a controlled manner. Denoising mechanisms are further applied to improve the quality of synthesized data. Automatic metrics show our method is capable of producing diverse and natural text, while preserving label semantics. Moreover, MSP achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks when compared against strong baselines. Our method offers an alternate data-centric approach for applying LLMs to complex prediction tasks.",

            "abstract": "The continuous, online processing of streaming data generated by smart city settings offers opportunities for richer, data-driven understanding of modern urban life. In this paper, we focus on the application of machine learning for highly localized classification of a broad set of urban activities from streaming twitter social media data. We build a platform for continuous ingestion of twitter data, spatio-temporal clustering of the tweets, and online topic and sub-topic extraction through hierarchical classification. We demonstrate results within Manhattan, and show that we can identify urban activities at the spatio-temporal resolution of 3 hours within a single city block. We also demonstrate how our streaming platform can be extended to support multi-modal sensing across dense urban environments, and scale to cover vast geographical areas.",

It uses and compares the different mathematical algorithms \u2013 classical mathematic model, na\u00efve Bayesian classifier, advanced time series K-means clustering model, self-organizing map (SOM) neural network algorithm and support vector machine (SVM), which are used in constructing the advanced Artificial Intelligence model. Then, it gives out the process of constructing the complete Artificial Intelligence model. Through theoretical analysis and experiment, the coverage rate and time efficiency with different sample size for the above various algorithms are verified. The results show that the advanced time series K-means clustering model can effectively improve both criteria. Besides, it also analyzes the advantages, applicable conditions and limitations of different models.",
