            "abstract": "With the emergence of various information access systems exhibiting increasing complexity, there is a critical need for sound and scalable means of automatic evaluation. To address this challenge, user simulation emerges as a promising solution. This half-day tutorial focuses on providing a thorough understanding of user simulation techniques designed specifically for evaluation purposes. We systematically review major research progress, covering both general frameworks for designing user simulators, and specific models and algorithms for simulating user interactions with search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. We also highlight some important future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Vector-based retrieval systems have become a common staple for academic and industrial search applications because they provide a simple and scalable way of extending the search to leverage contextual representations for documents and queries. As these vector-based systems rely on contextual language models, their usage commonly requires GPUs, which can be expensive and difficult to manage. Given recent advances in introducing sparsity into language models for improved inference efficiency, in this paper, we study how sparse language models can be used for dense retrieval to improve inference efficiency. Using the popular retrieval library Tevatron and the MSMARCO, NQ, and TriviaQA datasets, we find that sparse language models can be used as direct replacements with little to no drop in accuracy and up to 4.3x improved inference speeds",

            "abstract": "The success of contextual word representations and advances in neural information retrieval have made dense vector-based retrieval a standard approach for passage and document ranking. While effective and efficient, dual-encoders are brittle to variations in query distributions and noisy queries. Data augmentation can make models more robust but introduces overhead to training set generation and requires retraining and index regeneration. We present Contrastive Alignment POst Training (CAPOT), a highly efficient finetuning method that improves model robustness without requiring index regeneration, the training set optimization, or alteration. CAPOT enables robust retrieval by freezing the document encoder while the query encoder learns to align noisy queries with their unaltered root. We evaluate CAPOT noisy variants of MSMARCO, Natural Questions, and Trivia QA passage retrieval, finding CAPOT has a similar impact as data augmentation with none of its overhead.",

            "abstract": "Online discussions are a ubiquitous aspect of everyday life. An Internet user who interacts with an online discussion may benefit from seeing hyperlinks to webpages relevant to the discussion because the relevant webpages can provide added context, act as citations for background sources, or condense information so that conversations can proceed seamlessly at a high level. In this paper, we propose and study a new task of retrieving relevant webpages given an online discussion. We frame the task as a novel retrieval problem where we treat a sequence of comments in an online discussion as a query and use such a query to retrieve relevant webpages. We construct a new data set using Reddit, an online discussion forum, to study this new problem. We explore and evaluate multiple representative retrieval methods to examine their effectiveness for solving this new problem. We also propose to leverage the comments that contain hyperlinks as training data to enable supervised learning and further improve retrieval performance. We find that results using modern retrieval methods are promising and that leveraging comments with hyperlinks as training data can further improve performance. We release our data set and code to enable additional research in this direction.",

            "abstract": "Predicting how a user responds to news events enables important applications such as allowing intelligent agents or content producers to estimate the effect on different communities and revise unreleased messages to prevent unexpected bad outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. We present a new task, Response Forecasting on Personas for News Media, to estimate the response a persona (characterizing an individual or a group) might have upon seeing a news message. Compared to the previous efforts which only predict generic comments to news, the proposed task not only introduces personalization in the modeling but also predicts the sentiment polarity and intensity of each response. This enables more accurate and comprehensive inference on the mental state of the persona. Meanwhile, the generated sentiment dimensions make the evaluation and application more reliable. We create the first benchmark dataset, which consists of 13,357 responses to 3,847 news headlines from Twitter. We further evaluate the SOTA neural language models with our dataset. The empirical results suggest that the included persona attributes are helpful for the performance of all response dimensions. Our analysis shows that the best-performing models are capable of predicting responses that are consistent with the personas, and as a byproduct, the task formulation also enables many interesting applications in the analysis of social network groups and their opinions, such as the discovery of extreme opinion groups.",

            "abstract": "China\u2019s rapid technological growth and aggressive globalization policies have led to an increasing interest in Chinese patents abroad. This study uses strategic emerging industries (SEIs) that are important for the future development of the world as examples and constructs a novel dataset of Chinese SEI patents abroad (1993\u20132017) to explore the spatiotemporal evolution and determinants of the geography of these patents. Our results show that the number of Chinese SEI patents abroad is growing rapidly, and the new-generation information technology industry is increasingly dominating, accounting for approximately 50% of all SEI patents abroad. Chinese SEI patents abroad are highly concentrated in the United States, Western Europe, and East Asia, and their influence is gradually spreading from African countries to developed countries. The host country\u2019s intellectual property rights (IPR) protection level, technology market size and imitation risk have significant positive effects on Chinese SEI patents abroad, while the host country\u2019s high-tech product market size and competition risk have negative effects on Chinese patents abroad. The conclusions provide new information for understanding Chinese patents abroad activities and the motivation of China\u2019s technology globalization and provide evidence from an emerging country for research of the international diffusion of technology innovation.",

            "title": "I3A: An Intelligent Interactive Information Agent Model for Information Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Information Retrieval (IR) can be broadly interpreted as an interactive process for connecting users with the right information at the right time to finish a task, where interaction can be multimodal (e.g., using text, speech, and gestures) and connection can be made in multiple ways (e.g., querying, browsing, and recommendation). Although many formal IR models have been developed, the existing models are generally restricted to modeling the problem of ranking information items in response to a user's query without much consideration of user interaction. As a result, how to develop a general formal model that can cover all the variations of interactive IR (IIR) remains an open challenge. In this talk, I will discuss how we can address this challenge and present a general formal model for IR, called Intelligent Interactive Information Agent (I3A) model, which provides a unified theoretical foundation for both optimizing and evaluating sophisticated IIR algorithms and application systems. In I3A, an IIR system is modeled generally as an intelligent interactive information agent which plays an interactive cooperative \"game\" with its user(s), where both parties would take turns to \"make moves\" and interact with each other with a common objective of helping a user finish a task with minimum overall user effort. The optimization of IIR can be formally modelled as the agent optimizing a sequence of interaction decisions in response to each user action in a Bayesian decision framework. I will discuss how to refine the various components of the decision framework to make I3A operational and how multiple existing models, such as the Interface Card Model, the Probability Ranking Principle for IIR, formal models of users, and online learning to rank, can all be covered in the general I3A model. The I3A model also naturally suggests a new general methodology of evaluating IIR systems using search simulation.",

More specifically, digitized historical newspapers give us a magnifying glass into the past. In this paper, we propose a scalable and customizable big data analysis system that enables researchers to study complex questions about our society as depicted in news media for the past few centuries by applying cutting-edge text analysis tools to large historical newspaper collections. We discuss our experience with building a preliminary version of such a system, including how we have addressed the following challenges: processing millions of digitized newspaper pages from various publications worldwide, which amount to hundreds of terabytes of data; applying article segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to historical newspapers, which vary between and within publications over time; retrieving relevant information to answer research questions from such data collections by applying human-in-the-loop machine learning; and enabling users to analyze topic evolution and semantic dynamics with multiple compatible analysis operators. We also present some preliminary results of using the proposed system to study the social construction of juvenile delinquency in the United States and discuss important remaining challenges to be tackled in the future.",

            "abstract": "As learning becomes more dependent on online learning platforms, new challenges emerge. One major challenge is efficient access to educational content as most content is unstructured and scattered on the Web. Indeed, there is a great need for organizing educational content and presenting it in a semantically structured and browsable format that does not require the users' prior knowledge of relevant content. In this paper, we address this need by introducing a novel semantic structure, called Browsable Concept Index (BCI), to bring semantic structures to educational content. A BCI consists of a set of representative concepts that form a graph with each (weighted) edge indicating strength of association between two concepts and each concept node being linked to the text segments in the collection of documents that cover the concept. The BCI effectively integrates scattered textual content and enables efficient access to the content by users in multiple ways including: semantic browsing, exploratory and targeted information seeking, and collaborative information seeking. We further propose an optimization-based algorithm to automatically create a BCI based on a collection of educational textual content. Experiments on Coursera course content demonstrate that the our algorithm is effective, allowing the automatic construction of a useful BCI that can facilitate online learning.",

Entity set expansion in software-related domains such as StackOverflow can benefit many downstream tasks (e.g., software knowledge graph construction) and facilitate better IT operations and service management. Meanwhile, existing approaches are less concerned with two problems: (1) How to deal with multiple types of seed entities simultaneously? (2) How to leverage the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs)? Being aware of these two problems, in this paper, we study the entity set co-expansion task in StackOverflow, which extracts Library, OS, Application, and Language entities from StackOverflow question-answer threads. During the co-expansion process, we use PLMs to derive embeddings of candidate entities for calculating similarities between entities. Experimental results show that our proposed SECoExpan framework outperforms previous approaches significantly.",
