            "abstract": "Detecting location-correlated groups in point sets is an important task in a wide variety of applications areas. In addition to merely detecting such groups, the group's shape carries meaning as well. In this paper, we represent a group's shape using a simple geometric object, a line segment. Specifically, given a radius $r$, we say a line segment is representative of a point set $P$ if it is within distance $r$ of each point $p \\in P$. We aim to find the shortest such line segment. This problem is equivalent to stabbing a set of circles of radius $r$ using the shortest line segment. We describe an algorithm to find the shortest representative segment in $O(n \\log h + h \\log^3 h)$ time. Additionally, we show how to maintain a stable approximation of the shortest representative segment when the points in $P$ move.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "A geometric $t$-spanner for a set $S$ of $n$ point sites is an edge-weighted graph for which the (weighted) distance between any two sites $p,q \\in S$ is at most $t$ times the original distance between $p$ and~$q$. We study geometric $t$-spanners for point sets in a constrained two-dimensional environment $P$. In such cases, the edges of the spanner may have non-constant complexity. Hence, we introduce a novel spanner property: the spanner complexity, that is, the total complexity of all edges in the spanner. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ point sites in a simple polygon $P$ with $m$ vertices. We present an algorithm to construct, for any fixed integer $k \\geq 1$, a $2\\sqrt{2}k$-spanner with complexity $O(mn^{1/k} + n\\log^2 n)$ in $O(n\\log^2n + m\\log n + K)$ time, where $K$ denotes the output complexity. When we relax the restriction that the edges in the spanner are shortest paths, such that an edge in the spanner can be any path between two sites, we obtain for any constant $\\varepsilon \\in (0,2k)$ a relaxed geodesic $(2k + \\varepsilon)$-spanner of the same complexity, where the constant is dependent on $\\varepsilon$. When we consider sites in a polygonal domain $P$ with holes, we can construct a relaxed geodesic $6k$-spanner of complexity $O(mn^{1/k} + n\\log^2 n)$ in $O((n+m)\\log^2n\\log m+ K)$ time. Additionally, for any constant $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ and integer constant $t \\geq 2$, we show a lower bound for the complexity of any $(t-\\varepsilon)$-spanner of $\\Omega(mn^{1/(t-1)} + n)$.",

Assuming the nodes (modules) are connected squares on a grid, we investigate the complexity of deciding whether collisions may occur, or can be avoided, if a set of expansion and contraction operations is executed. We study both discrete- and continuous-time models, and allow operations to be coupled into a single parallel group. Our algorithms to decide if a collision may occur run in $O(n^2\\log^2 n)$ time, $O(n^2)$ time, or $O(n\\log^2 n)$ time, depending on the presence and type of coupled operations, in a continuous-time model for a modular robot with $n$ nodes. To decide if collisions can be avoided, we show that a very restricted version is already NP-complete in the discrete-time model, while the same problem is polynomial in the continuous-time model. A less restricted version is NP-hard in the continuous-time model.",

In general, different (labelled) graphs may have the same set of connected triples, making unique reconstruction of the original graph from the triples impossible. We identify some families of graphs (including triangle-free graphs) for which all graphs have a different set of connected triples. We also give algorithms that reconstruct a graph from a set of triples, and for testing if this reconstruction is unique. Finally, we study a possible extension of the model in which the subsets of size $k$ that induce a connected graph are given for larger (fixed) values of $k$.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces two new abstract morphs for two $2$-dimensional shapes. The intermediate shapes gradually reduce the Hausdorff distance to the goal shape and increase the Hausdorff distance to the initial shape. The morphs are conceptually simple and apply to shapes with multiple components and/or holes. We prove some basic properties relating to continuity, containment, and area. Then we give an experimental analysis that includes the two new morphs and a recently introduced abstract morph that is also based on the Hausdorff distance (Van Kreveld et al. Between shapes, using the Hausdorff distance. Computational Geometry 100:101817, 2022). We show results on the area and perimeter development throughout the morph, and also the number of components and holes. A visual comparison shows that one of the new morphs appears most attractive.",

            "abstract": "The Fr\\'echet distance is a commonly used similarity measure between curves. It is known how to compute the continuous Fr\\'echet distance between two polylines with $m$ and $n$ vertices in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ in $O(mn (\\log \\log n)^2)$ time; doing so in strongly subquadratic time is a longstanding open problem. Recent conditional lower bounds suggest that it is unlikely that a strongly subquadratic algorithm exists. Moreover, it is unlikely that we can approximate the Fr\\'echet distance to within a factor $3$ in strongly subquadratic time, even if $d=1$. The best current results establish a tradeoff between approximation quality and running time. Specifically, Colombe and Fox (SoCG, 2021) give an $O(\\alpha)$-approximate algorithm that runs in $O((n^3 / \\alpha^2) \\log n)$ time for any $\\alpha \\in [\\sqrt{n}, n]$, assuming $m = n$. In this paper, we improve this result with an $O(\\alpha)$-approximate algorithm that runs in $O((n + mn / \\alpha) \\log^3 n)$ time for any $\\alpha \\in [1, n]$, assuming $m \\leq n$ and constant dimension $d$.",

We give approximation algorithms for the Earth Mover's Distance between various sets of geometric objects. We give a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation when $P$ is a set of weighted points and $S$ is a set of line segments, triangles or $d$-dimensional simplices. When $P$ and $S$ are both sets of line segments, sets of triangles or sets of simplices, we give a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation with a small additive term. All algorithms run in time polynomial in the size of $P$ and $S$, and actually calculate the transport plan (that is, a specification of how to move the mass), rather than just the cost. To our knowledge, these are the first combinatorial algorithms with a provable approximation ratio for the Earth Mover's Distance when the objects are continuous rather than discrete points.",

For various analysis tasks it is necessary to define and compute a volume of earth (soil) based on such an outline, capturing, for example, the possible volume of a landslide in a high-risk region. In this paper we discuss several options to define meaningful 2D surfaces induced by a 1D outline, which allow us to compute such volumes. We experimentally compare the proposed surface options for two applications: similarity of paths on terrains and landslide susceptibility analysis. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Information systems \u2192 Geographic information systems; Theory of computation \u2192 Computational geometry",
