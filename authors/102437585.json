            "abstract": "This paper introduces M3fed, a novel solution for federated learning of movement anomaly detection models. This innovation has the potential to improve data privacy and reduce communication costs in machine learning for movement anomaly detection. We present the novel federated learning (FL) strategies employed to train M3fed, perform an example experiment with maritime AIS data, and evaluate the results with respect to communication costs and FL model quality by comparing classic centralized M3 and the new federated M3fed.",

            "abstract": "The digital transformation provides industries with unparalleled opportunities for value creation. AI and Machine learning (AI/ML)-driven approaches for data analysis applied to the massive amounts of data steaming from industrial processes can lead to enhanced operation, costs reduction, and powerful decision-making strategies. In this paper we address the problem of Quality Assurance (QA) in industrial manufacturing. We propose Smart Active Sampling (SAS), a new QA sampling strategy for quality inspection outside the production line. Based on the principles of active learning, an AI/ML model trained for quality prediction decides which produced pieces or samples are sent to quality inspection, to further improve its own prediction accuracy. SAS reduces the production of scrap parts due to earlier detection of quality violations. By inspecting a much lower number of samples as compared to traditional random sampling approaches, SAS improves QA efficiency and cuts down quality inspection costs, resulting in an overall smoother operation. We elaborate on some of the challenges faced in smart sampling strategies for quality inspection, describe the main concepts behind SAS, and showcase its application in a real-world manufacturing QA use case, training an AI/ML model for product defect prediction. Compared to a standard random sampling strategy, widely applied today in industrial QA applications, SAS improves model prediction accuracy requiring a significantly lower number of inspected samples, up to five time less samples in the analyzed dataset.",

            "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly explored in various domains and industries. Many companies experiment with AI, but too often those experiments are one-off analyses based on outdated data and the resulting models never make it into production. This paper proposes a framework for building and operating AI models at the industrial edge. The center of this framework is the model artifact, a model-generating entity. We analyze three AI model use-cases and user roles involved in industrial AI applications to illustrate the challenges in deploying and operating AI applications in industrial edge scenarios. We propose to structure the AI models into predefined artifacts that enable deployments with only a few clicks. The edge device links sensor data with the model input and returns the model output as feedback back into the industrial process. Model training, deployment, and management can be carried out in a scalable manner even by a non-expert. Several models can be managed in parallel, and data can be linked to the respective sensor or machine.",

Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to develop a machine learning model without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of their data. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different FL aggregation methods and compare them to central and local training approaches. Our study is based on four datasets with varying data distributions. The results indicate that the performance of FL is highly dependent on the data and its distribution among clients. In some scenarios, FL can be an effective alternative to traditional central or local training methods. Additionally, we introduce a new federated learning dataset from a real-world quality inspection setting.",

The architecture makes use of a data lake for scalable storage of diverse mobility data sets, on top of which separate computing and storage layers are implemented to allow independent scaling with a data operations toolbox providing all data operations. Furthermore, to cater for mobility analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence support, an edge analytics suite is provided that encompasses distributed algorithms for mobility analytics and federated learning, thereby exploiting edge computing technologies. In turn, this is supported by a resource allocator that monitors the energy consumption of data-intensive operations and provides this information to the platform for intelligent task placement in edge devices, aiming at energy-efficient operations. As a result, an end-to-end platform is proposed that combines data services and infrastructure services towards supporting mobility application domains, such as urban and maritime.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new sampling strategy, called smart active sapling, for quality inspections outside the production line. Based on the principles of active learning a machine learning model decides which samples are sent to quality inspection. On the one hand, this minimizes the production of scrap parts due to earlier detection of quality violations. On the other hand, quality inspection costs are reduced for smooth operation.",

            "abstract": "Coating chambers create thin layers that improve the mechanical and optical surface properties in jewelry production using physical vapor deposition. In such a process, evaporated material condensates on the walls of such chambers and, over time, causes mechanical defects and unstable processes. As a result, manufacturers perform extensive maintenance procedures to reduce production loss. Current rule-based maintenance strategies neglect the impact of specific recipes and the actual condition of the vacuum chamber. Our overall goal is to predict the future condition of the coating chamber to allow cost and quality optimized maintenance of the equipment. This paper describes the derivation of a novel health indicator that serves as a step toward condition-based maintenance for coating chambers. We indirectly use gas emissions of the chamber\u2019s contamination to evaluate the machine\u2019s condition. Our approach relies on process data and does not require additional hardware installation. Further, we evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms for a condition-based forecast of the health indicator that also reflects production planning. Our results show that models based on decision trees are the most effective and outperform all three benchmarks, improving at least 0.22 in the mean average error. Our work paves the way for cost and quality optimized maintenance of coating applications.",

            "abstract": "An increasing number of industrial assets are equipped with IoT sensor platforms and the industry now expects data-driven maintenance strategies with minimal deployment costs. However, gathering labeled training data for supervised tasks such as anomaly detection is costly and often difficult to implement in operational environments. Therefore, this work aims to design and implement a solution that reduces the required amount of data for training anomaly classification models on time series sensor data and thereby brings down the overall deployment effort of IoT anomaly detection sensors. We set up several in-lab experiments using three peristaltic pumps and investigated approaches for transferring trained anomaly detection models across assets of the same type. Our experiments achieved promising effectiveness and provide initial evidence that transfer learning could be a suitable strategy for using pre-trained anomaly classification models across industrial assets of the same type with minimal prior labeling and training effort. This work could serve as a starting point for more general, pre-trained sensor data embeddings, applicable to a wide range of assets.",

Recent advances in deep learning, especially long-short-term memory (LSTM) and autoencoders, offer promising methods for detecting anomalies in sensor data recordings. We compared autoencoders with various architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), LSTMs and convolutional neural networks (CNN) using a simple benchmark dataset, which we generated by operating a peristaltic pump under various operating conditions and inducing anomalies manually. Our preliminary results indicate that a single model can detect anomalies under various operating conditions on a four-dimensional data set without any specific feature engineering for each operating condition. We consider this work as being the first step towards a generic anomaly detection method, which is applicable for a wide range of industrial equipment.",
