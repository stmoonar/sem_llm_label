            "title": "Overview of the CLEF-2024 CheckThat! Lab Task 3 on Persuasion Techniques",
            "abstract": "We present an overview of CheckThat! Lab\u2019s 2024 Task 3, which focuses on detecting 23 persuasion techniques at the text-span level in online media. The task covers five languages, namely, Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Portuguese, and Slovene, and highly-debated topics in the media, e.g., the Isreali\u2013Palestian conflict, the Russia\u2013 Ukraine war, climate change, COVID-19, abortion, etc. A total of 23 teams registered for the task, and two of them submitted system responses which were compared against a baseline and a task organizers\u2019 system, which used a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. We provide a description of the dataset and the overall task setup, including the evaluation methodology, and an overview of the participating systems. The datasets accompanied with the evaluation scripts are released to the research community, which we believe will foster research on persuasion technique detection and analysis of online media content in various fields and contexts.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been at the center of the lives of many of us for at least a couple of years, during which periods of isolation and lockdowns were common. How all that affected our mental well-being, especially the ones\u2019 who were already in distress? To investigate the matter we analyse the online discussions on Sanctioned Suicide, a forum where users discuss suicide-related topics freely. We collected discussions starting from March 2018 (before pandemic) up to July 2022, for a total of 53K threads with 700K comments and 16K users. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the discussions in the forum. The data show that covid, while being present in the discussions, especially during the first lockdown, has not been the main reason why new users registered to the forum. However, covid appears to be indirectly connected to other causes of distress for the users, i.e. anxiety for the economy.",
