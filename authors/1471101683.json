            "title": "Energy-Efficient Coordinated Beamforming in Multi-Pair MISO Networks With CDI and Eavesdroppers",
            "abstract": "This paper investigates the energy-efficient coordinated beamforming design for multi-pair multiple-input single-output (MISO) networks with passive eavesdroppers. To be practical, it is assumed that only channel distribution information (CDI) of the network is known by the transmitters/sources, and the dynamic energy consumption model (DECM) is employed. In order to achieve a green network design, an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subjecting to the individual available power constraints, the rate outage probability constraints, and the information leakage probability constraints. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order lower bound are applied to transform the problem, and then an efficient algorithm is proposed based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach's approaches. The proposed algorithm is theoretically proved to converge to a stationary point of the considered problem. Further, a distributed version of the proposed algorithm is designed, with which each transmitter is able to optimize its own beamforming vector with local CDI. Moreover, the computational complexities and the signaling overheads of the two developed algorithms are analyzed and compared. Simulation results show that both algorithms achieve good EE performance, and the EE performance achieved by the distributed algorithm is very similar to that achieved by the centralized one. Additionally, it is shown that similar to the conventional scenarios without eavesdroppers, the achieved system EE also has a saturation point w.r.t. the available power of the transmitters, and by employing our proposed algorithms, the network security is significantly enhanced.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks with power splitting (PS) receivers and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). By exploiting the conjugated beamforming method, the closed-form expressions of the information rate and the total harvested power at each user equipment (UE) are derived. To improve the system spectral efficiency, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated subjecting to the quality of service requirement at each UE and the power budget constraint at each access point by optimizing the UE clustering, the power control coefficients, and the PS ratios. To solve the formulated non-convex and mixed combinatorial problem, a machine learning-based approach is designed. Particularly, the UE clustering is first optimized by using a K-means based method and then the power control coefficients and the PS ratios are jointly optimized by a proposed multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) based method. The impact of the discount factor of the MA-DQN based method on the derived result is discussed. It is proved that by setting the discount factor as zero, the performance loss is negligible. Based on this observation, a zero-discount MA-DQN (0- $\\gamma $ MA-DQN) based method is further proposed to improve the computational efficiency. Also, the computational complexity of the proposed machine learning-based approach is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed machine learning-based approach outperforms various existing approaches. Moreover, it indicates that CF-mMIMO and NOMA could enhance the propagation performance of SWIPT while the proposed machine learning-based approach could facilitate resource allocation.",

            "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been proposed as a wireless coverage enhancement enabler. However, due to the passive feature of the RIS, it is challenging to acquire the instantaneous channel state information for RIS-user links. This paper investigates the outage-constrained transmission design for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems under interference channel based on channel distribution information. The transmission design problem is formulated to maximize the sum transmission rate under constraints of the tolerable outage probability of each user, the power budget of each transmitter and the phase shift coefficient of each reflecting element. To solve the computational intractable problem, a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM)-based algorithm is proposed where the feasible set is separated w.r.t. variables into several blocks, and for each block, a computationally efficient surrogate subproblem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, the non-decreasing behavior and optimality performance of the proposed algorithms are theoretically analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is more computational efficient than traditional alternative optimization based algorithm, and the proposed the outage-constrained transmission design is able to suppress the average outage rate to a required level as well as maximizing the sum transmission rate.",

In order to pursue the green computing network design, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the transmit power at the HAP by jointly optimizing the time allocation ratio and the computing mode selection vector, under the energy causality constraints and the WSDs\u2019 computing rate requirements constraints. To efficiently solve the formulated non-convex problem in a distributed manner, it is first transformed into an approximate form, and then an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm is designed to solve the transformed problem, based on which the successive convex approximation (SCA) is adopted to improve the approximating precision in an iterative way. With the proposed ADMM-based distributed algorithm, each WSD is able to optimize its computing mode and offloading time with local channel state information (CSI), which thus is more suitable for large-scale networks. For comparison, a channel-sorting-based (CSB) centralized algorithm with global CSI is also presented, and the computational complexities of the proposed ADMM-based algorithm and the CSB algorithm are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm achieves a comparable performance with the CSB centralized algorithm and the exhaustive search method. It is also observed that to minimize the transmit power at the HAP, the WSDs with the better channel quality are inclined to select the LC mode, which is much different from traditional sum-computation-rate maximization design.",

            "abstract": "This letter investigates the deep learning enabled energy efficient beamforming design for multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) networks. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated and solved by a proposed block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM)-based algorithm. Then, the MU-MISO network is reformulated into a graph and input into a proposed graph attention network (GAT) which is utilized to embed the node features due to the inter-link interference. With the labeled datasets generated by the BSUM algorithm, the proposed GAT is trained to learn the mapping from the channel state information to the beamforming vectors with the aim of maximizing the EE. Some interpretable insights were presented in designing each layer of the GAT. Numerical results validate that the proposed GAT-based approach is able to derive near-optimal performance and adapt to the dynamic and scalable wireless networks with real-time computation.",

            "title": "Energy Efficiency Maximization in RIS-Assisted SWIPT Networks With RSMA: A PPO-Based Approach",
            "abstract": "This paper investigates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) networks with rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to the power budget at the transmitter and the quality of service (QoS) requirements of both information communication and energy harvesting, where the beamforming vectors, the power splitting (PS) ratios, the common message rates, and the discrete phase shifts are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convex problem with both discrete and continuous variables, a deep reinforcement learning-based approach is proposed with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) framework. Different from traditional optimization approaches which optimizes the beamforming vectors and phase shifts separately and alternatively, our proposed PPO-based approach optimizes all the variables in unison. Besides, to perform beamforming design in action space, the beamforming vectors for the common stream and the private stream are respectively designed based on the maximum-ratio transmission and the zero forcing to enhance both energy and information transmission. To evaluate the performance of the PPO-based approach, a successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach\u2019s method based solution scheme (named SCA-D scheme) is also presented. Simulation results show that the system EE obtained by the proposed PPO-based approach is close to that obtained by the SCA-D scheme while outperforming various benchmarks. The RSMA contributes to the EE of the system greatly compared with traditional scheme. As for the case of time-varying channels, the proposed PPO-based approach is with much smaller running time by only sacrificing a slight EE performance compared with the SCA-D scheme.",
