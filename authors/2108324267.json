            "abstract": "Heart rate is an important physiological indicator of human health status. Existing remote heart rate measurement methods typically involve facial detection followed by signal extraction from the region of interest (ROI). These SOTA methods have three serious problems: (a) inaccuracies even failures in detection caused by environmental influences or subject movement; (b) failures for special patients such as infants and burn victims; (c) privacy leakage issues resulting from collecting face video. To address these issues, we regard the remote heart rate measurement as the process of analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of the optical flow signal in the video. We apply chaos theory to computer vision tasks for the first time, thus designing a brain-inspired framework. Firstly, using an artificial primary visual cortex model to extract the skin in the videos, and then calculate heart rate by time-frequency analysis on all pixels. Our method achieves Robust Skin Tracking for Heart Rate measurement, called HR-RST. The experimental results show that HR-RST overcomes the difficulty of environmental influences and effectively tracks the subject movement. Moreover, the method could extend to other body parts. Consequently, the method can be applied to special patients and effectively protect individual privacy, offering an innovative solution.",

            "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) capture the information processing mechanism of the brain by taking advantage of spiking neurons, such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model neuron, which incorporates temporal dynamics and transmits information via discrete and asynchronous spikes. However, the simplified biological properties of LIF ignore the neuronal coupling and dendritic structure of real neurons, which limits the spatio-temporal dynamics of neurons and thus reduce the expressive power of the resulting SNNs. In this work, we leverage a more biologically plausible neural model with complex dynamics, i.e., a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), to improve the expressiveness and recognition performance of SNNs for vision tasks. The PCNN is a type of cortical model capable of emulating the complex neuronal activities in the primary visual cortex. We construct deep pulse-coupled neural networks (DPCNNs) by replacing commonly used LIF neurons in SNNs with PCNN neurons. The intra-coupling in existing PCNN models limits the coupling between neurons only within channels. To address this limitation, we propose inter-channel coupling, which allows neurons in different feature maps to interact with each other. Experimental results show that inter-channel coupling can efficiently boost performance with fewer neurons, synapses, and less training time compared to widening the networks. For instance, compared to the LIF-based SNN with wide VGG9, DPCNN with VGG9 uses only 50%, 53%, and 73% of neurons, synapses, and training time, respectively. Furthermore, we propose receptive field and time dependent batch normalization (RFTD-BN) to speed up the convergence and performance of DPCNNs.",

To improve interpretability, we investigate gait features in the embedding space based on Koopman operator theory. The transition matrix in this space captures complex kinematic features of gait cycles, namely the Koopman operator. The diagonal elements of the operator matrix can represent the overall motion trend, providing a physically meaningful descriptor. To reduce the computational cost of our algorithm, we use a reversible autoencoder to reduce the model size and eliminate convolutional layers to compress its depth, resulting in fewer floating-point operations. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method reduces computational cost to 1% compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive recognition accuracy 98% on non-occlusion datasets.",

            "abstract": "Exploring and establishing artificial neural networks with electrophysiological characteristics and high computational efficiency is a popular topic that has been explored for many years in the fields of pattern recognition and computer vision. Inspired by the working mechanism of the primary visual cortex, pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) can exhibit the characteristics of synchronous oscillation, refractory period, and exponential decay. These characteristics empower the PCNN model to group pixels with similar spatiality and gray values and to process digital images without training. However, electrophysiological evidence shows that the neurons exhibit highly complex nonlinear dynamics when stimulated by external periodic signals. This chaos phenomenon, also known as the \u2018butterfly effect,\u201d cannot be explained by all PCNN models. In this work, we analyze the main obstacle preventing PCNN models from imitating a real primary visual cortex. We consider neuronal excitation as a stochastic process. We then propose a novel neural network of the primary visual cortex, called a continuous-coupled neural network (CCNN). Theoretical analysis indicates that the dynamic behavior of the CCNN is distinct from the PCNN. Numerical results show that the CCNN model exhibits periodic behavior under a DC stimulus, and exhibits chaotic behavior under an AC stimulus, which is consistent with the testing results of primary visual cortex neurons. Furthermore, the image and video processing mechanisms of the CCNN model are analyzed. For image processing tasks, this model encodes the pixel intensity as the frequency of output signals so that it can group pixels with similar gray values. This image processing method can reduce the local gray level difference of the image, and compensate for small local discontinuities in the image. For video processing tasks, the CCNN encodes changing pixels as non-periodic chaotic signals, and it encodes static pixels as periodic signals. It thus achieves the purpose of moving target object recognition by distinguishing the dynamic states corresponding to different neuron clusters in the video. Experimental results on image segmentation indicate that the CCNN model has better performance than the state-of-the-art of visual cortex neural network models.",

Inspired by neuronal conduction characteristics in the primary visual cortex of cats, pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) can exhibit synchronous oscillation behavior, which can process digital images without training. However, according to the study of single cells in the cat primary visual cortex, when a neuron is stimulated by an external periodic signal, the interspike-interval (ISI) distributions represent a multimodal distribution. This phenomenon cannot be explained by all PCNN models. By analyzing the working mechanism of the PCNN, we present a novel neuron model of the primary visual cortex consisting of a continuous-coupled neural network (CCNN). Our model inherited the threshold exponential decay and synchronous pulse oscillation property of the original PCNN model, and it can exhibit chaotic behavior consistent with the testing results of cat primary visual cortex neurons. Therefore, our CCNN model is closer to real visual neural networks. For image segmentation tasks, the algorithm based on CCNN model has better performance than the state-of-art of visual cortex neural network model.

            "abstract": "Chaotic systems with hyperbolic sine nonlinearity have attracted the attention of researchers in the last two years. This paper introduces a new approach for generating a class of simple chaotic systems with hyperbolic sine. With nth-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), any desirable order of chaotic systems with hyperbolic sine nonlinearity can be easily constructed. Fourth-order, fifth-order, and tenth-order chaotic systems are taken as examples to verify the theory. To achieve simplicity of the electrical circuit, two back-to-back diodes represent hyperbolic sine nonlinearity without any multiplier or subcircuits. Thus, these systems can achieve both physical simplicity and analytic complexity at the same time.",
