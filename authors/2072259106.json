            "abstract": "\n We demonstrate EDA4Sum, a framework dedicated to generating guided multi-step data summarization pipelines for very large datasets. Data summarization is the process of producing interpretable and representative subsets of an input dataset. It is usually performed following a one-shot process with the purpose of finding the best summary. EDA4Sum leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to produce connected summaries in multiple steps, with the goal of maximizing their cumulative utility. A useful summary contains\n k individually uniform\n sets that are\n collectively diverse\n to be representative of the input data. EDA4Sum accommodates datasets with different characteristics by providing the ability to tune the weights of uniformity, diversity and novelty when generating multi-step summaries. We demonstrate the superiority of multi-step EDA summarization over single-step summarization for summarizing very large data, and the need to provide guidance to domain experts, by interacting with the VLDB'22 participants who will act as data analysts. The application is avilable at https://bit.ly/eda4sum_application.\n",

            "abstract": "\n Data summarization is the process of producing interpretable and representative subsets of an input dataset. It is usually performed following a one-shot process with the purpose of finding the best summary. A useful summary contains\n k individually uniform\n sets that are\n collectively diverse\n to be representative. Uniformity addresses interpretability and diversity addresses representativity. Finding such as summary is a difficult task when data is highly diverse and large. We examine the applicability of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to data summarization and formalize Eda4Sum, the problem of guided exploration of data summaries that seeks to sequentially produce connected summaries with the goal of maximizing their cumulative utility. Eda4Sum generalizes one-shot summarization. We propose to solve it with one of two approaches: (i) Top1Sum that chooses the most useful summary at each step; (ii) RLSum that trains a policy with Deep Reinforcement Learning that rewards an agent for finding a diverse and new collection of uniform sets at each step. We compare these approaches with one-shot summarization and top-performing EDA solutions. We run extensive experiments on three large datasets. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our approaches for summarizing very large data, and the need to provide guidance to domain experts.\n",

            "abstract": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides guidance to users to help them refine their needs and find items of interest in large volumes of structured data. In this paper, we develop GUIDES, a framework for guided Text-based Item Exploration (TIE). TIE raises new challenges: (i) the need to abstract and query textual data and (ii) the need to combine queries on both structured and unstructured content. GUIDES represents text dimensions such as sentiment and topics, and introduces new text-based operators that are seamlessly integrated with traditional EDA operators. To train TIE policies, it relies on a multi-reward function that captures different textual dimensions, and extends the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) architecture with multi-objective optimization. Our experiments on Amazon and IMDb, two real-world datasets, demonstrate the necessity of capturing fine-grained text dimensions, the superiority of using both text-based and attribute-based operators over attribute-based operators only, and the need for multi-objective optimization.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate DORA THE EXPLORER, a system that guides users in finding items of interest in a very large data set. DORA THE EXPLORER provides users with the full spectrum of exploration modes and is driven by Data Familiarity or Curiosity, as well as User Interventions. DORA THE EXPLORER is able to handle data and search scenario complexity, i.e., the difficulty to find scattered/clustered individual records in the data set, and user ability to express what s/he needs. DORA THE EXPLORER relies on Deep Reinforcement Learning that combines intrinsic (curiosity) and extrinsic (familiarity) rewards. DORA's main goal is to support scientific discovery from data. We describe the system architecture and illustrate it with three demonstration scenarios on a 2.6 mil-lion galaxies SDSS, a large sky survey data set1. A video of DORA THE EXPLORER is available at https://bit.ly/dora-demo, the codehttps://github.com/apersonnaz/rl-guided-galaxy-exploration, and the application at https://bit.ly/dora-application",

Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",

            "abstract": "The ability to find a set of records in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) hinges on the scattering of objects in the data set and the on users\u2019 knowledge of data and their ability to express their needs. This yields a wide range of EDA scenarios and solutions that differ in the guidance they provide to users. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between modeling curiosity and familiarity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and expressive data exploration operators. We formalize curiosity as intrinsic reward and familiarity as extrinsic reward. We examine the behavior of several policies learned for different weights for those rewards. Our experiments on SDSS, a very large sky survey data set1 provide several insights and justify the need for a deeper examination of combining DRL and data exploration operators that go beyond drill-downs and roll-ups.",
