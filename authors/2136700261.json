            "title": "Debiased Contrastive Learning for Time-Series Representation Learning and Fault Detection",
            "abstract": "Building reliable fault detection systems through deep neural networks is an appealing topic in industrial scenarios. In these contexts, the representations extracted by neural networks on available labeled time-series data can reflect system states. However, this endeavor remains challenging due to the necessity of labeled data. Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) is one of the effective approaches to deal with this challenge, but existing SSCL-based models suffer from sampling bias and representation bias problems. This article introduces a debiased contrastive learning framework for time-series data and applies it to industrial fault detection tasks. This framework first develops the multigranularity augmented view generation method to generate augmented views at different granularities. It then introduces the momentum clustering contrastive learning strategy and the expert knowledge guidance mechanism to mitigate sampling bias and representation bias, respectively. Finally, the experiments on a public bearing fault detection dataset and a widely used valve stiction detection dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed feature learning framework.",

            "abstract": "Grasping detection from single images in robotic applications poses a significant challenge. While contemporary deep learning techniques excel, their success often hinges on large annotated datasets and intricate network architectures. In this letter, we present LiteGrasp, a novel semi-supervised lightweight framework purpose-built for grasp detection, eliminating the necessity for exhaustive supervision and intricate networks. Our approach uses a limited amount of labeled data via a knowledge distillation method, introducing HRGrasp-Net, a model with high efficiency for extracting features and largely based on HRNet. We incorporate pseudo-label filtering within a mutual learning model set within a teacher-student paradigm. This enhances the transference of data from images with labels to those without. Additionally, we introduce the streamlined Lite HRGrasp-Net, acting as the student network which gains further distillation knowledge using a multi-level fusion cascade originating from HRGrasp-Net. Impressively, LiteGrasp thrives with just a fraction (4.3%) of HRGrasp-Net's original model size, and with limited labeled data relative to total data (25% ratio) across all benchmarks, regularly outperforming solely supervised and semi-supervised models. Taking just 6 ms for execution, LiteGrasp showcases exceptional accuracy (99.99% and 97.21% on Cornell and Jacquard data sets respectively), as well as an impressive 95.3% rate of success in grasping when deployed using a 6DoF UR5e robotic arm. These highlights underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of LiteGrasp for grasp detection, even under resource-limited conditions.",

            "title": "DCS: Debiased Contrastive Learning with Weak Supervision for Time Series Classification",
            "abstract": "Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has performed excellently on time series classification tasks. Most SSCL- based classification algorithms generate positive and negative samples in the time or frequency domains, focusing on mining similarities between them. However, two issues are not well addressed in the SSCL framework: the sampling bias and the task-agnostic representation problems. Sampling bias indicates fake negative sample selection in SSCL, and task- agnostic representation results in the unknown correlation between the extracted feature and downstream tasks. To address the issues, we propose Debiased Contrastive learning with weak Supervision framework, abbreviated as DCS. It employs the clustering operation to remove fake negative samples and introduces weak supervisory signals into the SSCL framework to guide feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a channel augmentation method that allows the DCS to extract features from local and global perspectives simultaneously. The comprehensive experiments on the widely used datasets show that DCS achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods on the widely used popular benchmark datasets.",

            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.",
