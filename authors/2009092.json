            "title": "Guidelines for Designing Social Networking Sites for Older Adults: A Systematic Review with Thematic Synthesis",
            "abstract": "Social networking site (SNS) inaccessibility remains a barrier for many older adults. Increasingly, research has sought to address these shortcomings with recommendations for design. However, commercial uptake of these findings remains limited, in part, due to the scattering of recommendations across publications, heterogeneity in the SNS systems and features examined, and a lack of sensitivity within the existing guidelines to the heterogeneity of the target demographic. To counter these challenges, we conducted a systematic review following a thematic synthesis approach of 25 empirical studies on SNS design recommendations for older adults. From these, we synthesized a cohesive set of ten distinct design recommendations. These include ensuring an easy-to-use interface, improving social connection features, ensuring personal privacy, and introducing customized features and personalized content. In synthesizing the results, particular care was taken to capture the ways in which population diversity moderates recommendations. The results of this review can serve as a resource for designers and practitioners working on inclusive SNS for older adults. They also highlight the need for additional research into understanding user diversity in relation to SNS accessibility.",

            "abstract": "In this position paper, we advocate for the design of more progressive online social networks and their web pages for the user base of older adults, arguing that in order to address the issue of misinformation, strategies attuned to this population of users in particular are needed. We discuss challenges that arise with misleading health information and with websites that support questionable positions with fake reviews (often generated by bots). We also discuss the contribution of search engine results to the difficulties that this population faces when navigating misinformation. We propose an approach where more interaction with users is promoted, and where education about the perils of the online world can be supported, as an additional tool for reducing misinterpretations which may lead to significant negative outcomes. The algorithms which we propose come from the computer science subfields of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction and information retrieval. The novel stance is insisting on solutions that fit the demographic in question especially well, instead of relying on one-size-fits all approaches, which may disadvantage users who are older adults.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we explore how various social networking platforms currently support the spread of misinformation. We then examine the potential of a few specific multiagent trust modeling algorithms from artificial intelligence, towards detecting that misinformation. Our investigation reveals that specific requirements of each environment may require distinct solutions for the processing. This then leads to a higher-level proposal for the actions to be taken in order to judge trustworthiness. Our final reflection concerns what information should be provided to users, once there are suspected misleading posts. Our aim is to enlighten both the organizations that host social networking and the users of those platforms, and to promote steps forward for more pro-social behaviour in these environments. As a look to the future and the growing need to address this vital topic, we reflect as well on two related topics of possible interest: the case of older adult users and the potential to track misinformation through dedicated data science studies, of particular use for healthcare.",

            "title": "A Think-Aloud Study to Understand Factors Affecting Online Health Search",
            "abstract": "The majority of US Internet users have searched the internet for health-related information. When people conduct these health searches, searching for information about medical treatments is among the more common reasons. While being a convenient and fast method to collect information, when used by people for health search, search engines can be biased toward results saying treatments are helpful, regardless of the truth. The presence of incorrect information in search results may potentially cause harm, especially if people believe what they read without further research or professional medical advice. In this paper, we aim to better understand the decision making process of determining the efficacy of medical treatments using search result pages. We conducted a think-aloud study in order to gain insights on strategies people use during online search for health related topics. We found that, even when participants are careful and focused on the task, biased search engine results can significantly influence people to make decisions consistent with the bias. The chief reason biased search engines results were able to influence participants is that participants often considered what the majority of the search results stated as part of their decision-making. We also found that participants looked for indications of authoritativeness and quality when evaluating online content. While rank bias and a bias towards wanting treatments to be helpful has been found in prior studies, our participants did not reveal these biases as part of their spoken thoughts. Our results imply that more attention should be paid to search engines' biases given people's bias towards accepting the most common answer in the results as the correct answer. When search results are biased toward incorrect results for health-related searches, dire consequences may be the result.",

Later, official relevance assessments were rendered by NIST for documents selected by depth-10 pooling augmented by move-to-front (MTF) pooling (Cormack et al. 1998), as well as the documents selected by our Dynamic Sampling effort. MAP estimates rendered from dynamically sampled assessments using the xinfAP statistical evaluator are comparable to those rendered from the complete set of official assessments using the standard trec_eval tool. MAP estimates rendered using only documents selected by pooling, on the other hand, differ substantially. The results suggest that the use of Dynamic Sampling without pooling can, for an order of magnitude less assessment effort, yield information-retrieval effectiveness estimates that exhibit lower bias, lower error, and comparable ability to rank system effectiveness.",

Search results can contain documents that present incorrect information that contradicts current established medical understanding on whether a treatment is helpful or not for a health issue. If people are influenced by the incorrect information found in search results, they can make harmful decisions about the appropriate treatment. To determine the extent to which people can be influenced by search engine results, we conducted a controlled laboratory study that biased search results towards correct or incorrect information for 10 different medical treatments. We found that search engine results can significantly influence people both positively and negatively. Importantly, study participants made more incorrect decisions when they interacted with search results biased towards incorrect information than when they had no interaction with search results at all. For search domains such as health information, search engine designers and researchers must recognize that not all non-relevant information is the same. Some non-relevant information is incorrect and potentially harmful when people use it to make decisions that may negatively impact their lives.",

We first show the effect of different cold-start users types on the Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique in several real-world datasets. Later, we propose a \"Trust-Aware Neighbourhood\" algorithm which addresses a performance issue of the former by limiting the trusted neighbourhood. We show the doubling of the rating coverage compared to the traditional CF technique, and a significant improvement in the accuracy for some datasets. Focusing specifically on cold-start users, we propose a \"Hybrid Trust-Aware Neighbourhood\" algorithm which expands the neighbourhood by considering both trust and rating history of the users. We show a near complete coverage with a rich trust network dataset-- Flixster. We conclude by discussing the potential implementation of this algorithm in a budget-constrained cloud environment.",

In this paper, we develop a clinical decision support system that, based on a short medical case description, can recommend research articles to answer some common medical questions (diagnosis, test and treatment articles). The two different full-text search engines we adopted in order to search over the collection of articles are Terrier and Apache Solr. We test each search engine with different settings and retrieval algorithms. Additionally, we combine the results of the two different search engines using reciprocal rank fusion. The evaluation of the submitted runs using partially marked results of Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) from the previous year shows that the methodologies are promising.",

            "abstract": "Over the last twenty years, several algorithms have been proposed for automatic rule/constraint discovery from data, for the purpose of data cleaning. These algorithms look for constraints such as functional dependencies (FDs), conditional FDs (CFDs), inclusion dependencies (INDs), conditional INDs (CINDs), association rules, integrity constraints (ICs) and denial constraints (DCs), among others. While some of these techniques are direct generalizations and extensions of others, many differ greatly from the rest in approach, characteristics and general flavour. Many of these algorithms have not been tested and compared against each other, therefore their core differences and relative strengths and weaknesses are hard to comprehend.",

            "abstract": "We present MAQSA, a system for social analytics on news. MAQSA provides an interactive topic-centric dashboard that summarizes news articles and social activity (e.g., comments and tweets) around them. MAQSA helps editors and publishers in newsrooms understand user engagement and audience sentiment evolution on various topics of interest. It also helps news consumers explore public reaction on articles relevant to a topic and refine their exploration via related entities, topics, articles and tweets. Given a topic, e.g., \"Gulf Oil Spill,\" or \"The Arab Spring\", MAQSA combines three key dimensions: time, geographic location, and topic to generate a detailed activity dashboard around relevant articles. The dashboard contains an annotated comment timeline and a social graph of comments. It utilizes commenters' locations to build maps of comment sentiment and topics by region of the world. Finally, to facilitate exploration, MAQSA provides listings of related entities, articles, and tweets. It algorithmically processes large collections of articles and tweets, and enables the dynamic specification of topics and dates for exploration. In this demo, participants will be invited to explore the social dynamics around articles on oil spills, the Libyan revolution, and the Arab Spring. In addition, participants will be able to define and explore their own topics dynamically.",
