            "abstract": "E-Commerce size and fit recommendations can be improved by using customer images to estimate body measurements. We are developing a body measurement fairness evaluation to determine if Zalando\u2019s AI/ML driven body measurement pipelines systematically underperform for customers of certain gender, body shape, or skin tone. The fairness evaluation produces four unfairness scores. The first is a gender unfairness score: the difference in average performance between genders. The second and third are body shape and skin tone unfairness scores: the difference in average performance between smallest and largest bodies, and lightest and deepest skin tones, respectively. The fourth is an intersectional unfairness score: the number of customers that are members of clusters associated with significant underperformance. We demonstrate the fairness pipeline on one body measurement pipeline candidate in the development stage showing that body shape receives the most significant unfairness score. This work allows us to catch unfair body measurement pipelines during experimentation and development stages to help our team avoid deploying unfair models into production.",

            "title": "ALiSNet: Accurate and Lightweight Human Segmentation Network for Fashion E-Commerce",
            "abstract": "Accurately estimating human body shape from photos can enable innovative applications in fashion, from mass customization, to size and fit recommendations and virtual try-on. Body silhouettes calculated from user pictures are effective representations of the body shape for downstream tasks. Smartphones provide a convenient way for users to capture images of their body, and on-device image processing allows predicting body segmentation while protecting users privacy. Existing off-the-shelf methods for human segmentation are closed source and cannot be specialized for our application of body shape and measurement estimation. Therefore, we create a new segmentation model by simplifying Semantic FPN with PointRend, an existing accurate model. We finetune this model on a high-quality dataset of humans in a restricted set of poses relevant for our application. We obtain our final model, ALiSNet, with a size of 4MB and 97.6$\\pm$1.0$\\%$ mIoU, compared to Apple Person Segmentation, which has an accuracy of 94.4$\\pm$5.7$\\%$ mIoU on our dataset.",
