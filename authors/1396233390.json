            "title": "BIP! NDR (NoDoiRefs): A Dataset of Citations From Papers Without DOIs in Computer Science Conferences and Workshops",
            "abstract": "In the field of Computer Science, conference and workshop papers serve as important contributions, carrying substantial weight in research assessment processes, compared to other disciplines. However, a considerable number of these papers are not assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), hence their citations are not reported in widely used citation datasets like OpenCitations and Crossref, raising limitations to citation analysis. While the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) previously addressed this issue by providing substantial coverage, its discontinuation has created a void in available data. BIP! NDR aims to alleviate this issue and enhance the research assessment processes within the field of Computer Science. To accomplish this, it leverages a workflow that identifies and retrieves Open Science papers lacking DOIs from the DBLP Corpus, and by performing text analysis, it extracts citation information directly from their full text. The current version of the dataset contains more than 510K citations made by approximately 60K open access Computer Science conference or workshop papers that, according to DBLP, do not have a DOI.",

            "title": "Comparing Data Store Performance for Full-Text Search: To SQL or to NoSQL?",
            "abstract": ": The amount of textual data produced nowadays is constantly increasing as the number and variety of both new and reproduced textual information created by humans and (lately) also by bots is unprecedented. Storing, handling and querying such high volumes of textual data have become more challenging than ever and both research and industry have been using various alternatives, ranging from typical Relational Database Management Systems to specialised text engines and NoSQL databases, in an effort to cope with the volume. However, all these decisions are, largely, based on experience or personal preference for one system over another, since there is no performance comparison study that compares the available solutions regarding full-text search and retrieval. In this work, we fill this gap in the literature by systematically comparing four popular databases in full-text search scenarios and reporting their performance across different datasets, full-text search operators and parameters. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to go beyond the comparison of characteristics, like expressiveness of the query language or popularity, and actually compare popular relational, NoSQL, and textual data stores in terms of retrieval efficiency for full-text search. Moreover, our findings quantify the differences in full-text search performance between the examined solutions and reveal both anticipated and less anticipated results.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of IoT applications and their use in various fields of everyday life has resulted in an escalated number of different possible cyber-threats, and has consequently raised the need of securing IoT devices. Collecting Cyber-Threat Intelligence (e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities or trending exploits) from various online sources and utilizing it to proactively secure IoT systems or prepare mitigation scenarios has proven to be a promising direction. In this work, we focus on social media monitoring and investigate real-time Cyber-Threat Intelligence detection from the Twitter stream. Initially, we compare and extensively evaluate six different machine-learning based classification alternatives trained with vulnerability descriptions and tested with real-world data from the Twitter stream to identify the best-fitting solution. Subsequently, based on our findings, we propose a novel social media monitoring system tailored to the IoT domain; the system allows users to identify recent/trending vulnerabilities and exploits on IoT devices. Finally, to aid research on the field and support the reproducibility of our results we publicly release all annotated datasets created during this process.",

            "abstract": "In today\u2019s world, technology has become deep-rooted and more accessible than ever over a plethora of different devices and platforms, ranging from company servers and commodity PCs to mobile phones and wearables, interconnecting a wide range of stakeholders such as households, organizations and critical infrastructures. The sheer volume and variety of the different operating systems, the device particularities, the various usage domains and the accessibility-ready nature of the platforms creates a vast and complex threat landscape that is difficult to contain. Staying on top of these evolving cyber-threats has become an increasingly difficult task that presently relies heavily on collecting and utilising cyber-threat intelligence before an attack (or at least shortly after, to minimize the damage) and entails the collection, analysis, leveraging and sharing of huge volumes of data. In this work, we put forward inTIME, a machine learning-based integrated framework that provides an holistic view in the cyber-threat intelligence process and allows security analysts to easily identify, collect, analyse, extract, integrate, and share cyber-threat intelligence from a wide variety of online sources including clear/deep/dark web sites, forums and marketplaces, popular social networks, trusted structured sources (e.g., known security databases), or other datastore types (e.g., pastebins). inTIME is a zero-administration, open-source, integrated framework that enables security analysts and security stakeholders to (i) easily deploy a wide variety of data acquisition services (such as focused web crawlers, site scrapers, domain downloaders, social media monitors), (ii) automatically rank the collected content according to its potential to contain useful intelligence, (iii) identify and extract cyber-threat intelligence and security artifacts via automated natural language understanding processes, (iv) leverage the identified intelligence to actionable items by semi-automatic entity disambiguation, linkage and correlation, and (v) manage, share or collaborate on the stored intelligence via open standards and intuitive tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution in the literature to provide an end-to-end cyber-threat intelligence management platform that is able to support the complete threat lifecycle via an integrated, simple-to-use, yet extensible framework.",

In this work, we focus on the information gathering task, and present a novel crawling architecture for transparently harvesting data from security websites in the clear web, security forums in the social web, and hacker forums/marketplaces in the dark web. The proposed architecture adopts a two-phase approach to data harvesting. Initially a machine learning-based crawler is used to direct the harvesting towards websites of interest, while in the second phase state-of-the-art statistical language modelling techniques are used to represent the harvested information in a latent low-dimensional feature space and rank it based on its potential relevance to the task at hand. The proposed architecture is realised using exclusively open-source tools, and a preliminary evaluation with crowdsourced results demonstrates its effectiveness.",

It relates to all cyber components of an organization such as networks, computers, and other types of information technology. In the recent years, due to the major increase of cyber-threats, CTI sharing is becoming increasingly important both as a subject of research and as a concept of providing additional security to organizations. However, selecting the proper tools and platforms for CTI sharing, is a challenging task, that pertains to a variety of aspects. In this paper, we start by overviewing the CTI procedure (threat types, categories, sources and the general CTI life-cycle). Then, we present a set of seven high-level CTI plaftorm recommendations that can be used to evaluate a platform and subsequently we survey six state-ofthe-art cyber-threat intelligence platforms. Finally, we compare and evaluate the six aforementioned platforms by means of the earlier proposed recommendations.",
