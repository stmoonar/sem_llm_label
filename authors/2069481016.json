            "abstract": "The previously introduced Modular Ontology Modeling methodology (MOMo) attempts to mimic the human analogical process by using modular patterns to assemble more complex concepts. To support this, MOMo organizes organizes ontology design patterns into design libraries, which are programmatically queryable, to support accelerated ontology development, for both human and automated processes. However, a major bottleneck to large-scale deployment of MOMo is the (to-date) limited availability of ready-to-use ontology design patterns. At the same time, Large Language Models have quickly become a source of common knowledge and, in some cases, replacing search engines for questions. In this paper, we thus present a collection of 104 ontology design patterns representing often occurring nouns, curated from the common-sense knowledge available in LLMs, organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library ready for use with MOMo.",

            "abstract": "Wikibase -- which is the software underlying Wikidata -- is a powerful platform for knowledge graph creation and management. However, it has been developed with a crowd-sourced knowledge graph creation scenario in mind, which in particular means that it has not been designed for use case scenarios in which a tightly controlled high-quality schema, in the form of an ontology, is to be imposed, and indeed, independently developed ontologies do not necessarily map seamlessly to the Wikibase approach. In this paper, we provide the key ingredients needed in order to combine traditional ontology modeling with use of the Wikibase platform, namely a set of \\emph{axiom} patterns that bridge the paradigm gap, together with usage instructions and a worked example for historical data.",
