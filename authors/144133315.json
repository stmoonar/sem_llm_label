            "abstract": "This article derives a new nonlinear stochastic model of the evolution of human beliefs that demonstrates how an increase in democratized information production and sharing, combined with consumers' confirmation bias and natural bias for outlying content, results in increased polarization. The model shows that the evolution of human beliefs can be approximated by a nonlinear diffusion\u2013drift equation, in which systematic psychological biases contribute to drift, whereas other random influences contribute to diffusion. The nonlinear formulation predicts a growth in polarization that is attributable to increasing information production and sharing. While the core contribution is analytical, an anecdotal model parameter fitting empirical data is also presented. Specifically, we show that our model closely predicts the changing and increasingly polarized distribution of ideology of members of the US congress over the last quarter century (taken as an approximate proxy for shifts in the US population ideology), when we take the mobile-phone penetration curve as a proxy for the democratization of information access. The model suggests that escaping the polarizing forces in the age of information access may be an uphill battle.",

Subsequently, their potential use as artificial confederates and surrogates in sociological experiments involving conversation is an exciting prospect. But how viable is this idea? This paper endeavors to test the limits of current-day LLMs with a pre-registered study integrating real people with LLM agents acting as people. The study focuses on debate-based opinion consensus formation in three environments: humans only, agents and humans, and agents only. Our goal is to understand how LLM agents influence humans, and how capable they are in debating like humans. We find that LLMs can blend in and facilitate human productivity but are less convincing in debate, with their behavior ultimately deviating from human's. We elucidate these primary failings and anticipate that LLMs must evolve further before being viable debaters.",

            "abstract": "Mapping network nodes and edges to communities and network functions is crucial to gaining a higher level of understanding of the network structure and functions. Such mappings are particularly challenging to design for covert social networks, which intentionally hide their structure and functions to protect important members from attacks or arrests. Here, we focus on correctly inferring the structures and functions of such networks, but our methodology can be broadly applied. Without the ground truth, knowledge about the allocation of nodes to communities and network functions, no single network based on the noisy data can represent all plausible communities and functions of the true underlying network. To address this limitation, we apply a generative model that randomly distorts the original network based on the noisy data, generating a pool of statistically equivalent networks. Each unique generated network is recorded, while each duplicate of the already recorded network just increases the repetition count of that network. We treat each such network as a variant of the ground truth with the probability of arising in the real world approximated by the ratio of the count of this network\u2019s duplicates plus one to the total number of all generated networks. Communities of variants with frequently occurring duplicates contain persistent patterns shared by their structures. Using Shannon entropy, we can find a variant that minimizes the uncertainty for operations planned on the network. Repeatedly generating new pools of networks from the best network of the previous step for several steps lowers the entropy of the best new variant. If the entropy is too high, the network operators can identify nodes, the monitoring of which can achieve the most significant reduction in entropy. Finally, we also present a heuristic for constructing a new variant, which is not randomly generated but has the lowest expected cost of operating on the distorted mappings of network nodes to communities and functions caused by noisy data.",

In this article, we extend the traditional NG model to encompass multiple committed opinions and investigate the system dynamics on the complete graph with an arbitrarily large population and random networks of finite size. For the fully connected complete graph, the homogeneous mixing condition enables us to use mean-field theory to analyze the opinion evolution of the system.

To mitigate this, we focus on a special scenario where the largest group of committed agents competes with a motley of committed groups, each of which is smaller than the largest one, while initially, most of uncommitted agents hold one unique opinion. This scenario is chosen for its recurrence in diverse societies and its potential for complexity reduction by unifying agents from smaller committed groups into one category. Our investigation reveals that when the size of the largest committed group reaches the critical threshold, most of uncommitted agents change their beliefs to this opinion, triggering a phase transition.

            "abstract": "Humanity for centuries has perfected skills of interpersonal interactions and evolved patterns that enable people to detect lies and deceiving behavior of others in face-to-face settings. Unprecedented growth of people's access to mobile phones and social media raises an important question: How does this new technology influence people's interactions and support the use of traditional patterns? In this article, we answer this question for homophily-driven patterns in social media. In our previous studies, we found that, on a university campus, changes in student opinions were driven by the desire to hold popular opinions. Here, we demonstrate that the evolution of online platform-wide opinion groups is driven by the same desire. We focus on two social media: Twitter and Parler, on which we tracked the political biases of their users. On Parler, an initially stable group of Right-biased users evolved into a permanent Right-leaning echo chamber dominating weaker, transient groups of members with opposing political biases. In contrast, on Twitter, the initial presence of two large opposing bias groups led to the evolution of a bimodal bias distribution, with a high degree of polarization. We capture the movement of users from the initial to final bias groups during the tracking period. We also show that user choices are influenced by side-effects of homophily. Users entering the platform attempt to find a sufficiently large group whose members hold political biases within the range sufficiently close to their own. If successful, they stabilize their biases and become permanent members of the group. Otherwise, they leave the platform. We believe that the dynamics of users' behavior uncovered in this article create a foundation for technical solutions supporting social groups on social media and socially aware networks.",

            "abstract": "Networks of interconnected agents are essential to study complex networked systems' state evolution, stability, resilience, and control. Nevertheless, the high dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics are vital factors preventing us from theoretically analyzing them. Recently, the dimension-reduction approaches reduced the system's size by mapping the original system to a one-dimensional system such that only one effective representative can capture its macroscopic dynamics. However, the approaches dramatically fail as the network becomes heterogeneous and has multiple community structures. Here, we bridge the gap by developing a generalized dimension reduction approach, which enables us to map the original system to a $m$-dimensional system that consists of $m$ interacting components. Notably, by validating it on various dynamical models, this approach accurately predicts the original system state and the tipping point, if any. Furthermore, the numerical results demonstrate that this approach approximates the system evolution and identifies the critical points for complex networks with time delay.",

The results of the research, conducted on the temporal social network generated using the CogSNet model and on the static topologies as a reference, indicate a significant influence of the network temporal dynamics on the outcome and flow of the learning process. It has been shown that not only the dynamics of reaching consensus is different compared to baseline models but also that previously unobserved phenomena appear, such as uninformed agents or different consensus states for disconnected components. It has also been observed that sometimes only the change of the network structure can contribute to reaching consensus. The introduced approach and the experimental results can be used to better understand the way how human communities collectively solve both complex problems at the scientific level and to inquire into the correctness of less complex but common and equally important beliefs' spreading across entire societies.",

            "abstract": "In social sciences, simulating opinion dynamics to study the ways in which the interplay between homophily and influence leads to the formation of echo chambers is of great importance. Given the wide variety of empirical systems involving the grouping of communities based upon local attribute consensus, simulating and analyzing such dynamics is highly relevant in many other fields as well. As such, in this paper we investigate echo chambers by implementing a unique social game in which we spawn in a large number of agents, each assigned one of the two opinions on an issue and a finite amount of influence in the form of a game currency. Agents attempt to have an opinion that is a majority at the end of the game, to obtain a reward also paid in the game currency. At the beginning of each round, a randomly selected agent is selected, referred to as a speaker. The second agent is selected in the radius of speaker influence (which is a set subset of the speaker\u2019s neighbors) to interact with the speaker as a listener. In this interaction, the speaker proposes a payoff in the game currency from their personal influence budget to persuade the listener to hold the speaker\u2019s opinion in future rounds until chosen listener again. The listener can either choose to accept or reject this payoff to hold the speaker\u2019s opinion for future rounds. The listener\u2019s choice is informed only by their estimate of global majority opinion through a limited view of the opinions of their neighboring agents. We show that the influence game leads to the formation of \u201decho chambers,\u201d or homogeneous clusters of opinions. We also investigate various scenarios to disrupt the creation of such echo chambers, including the introduction of resource disparity between agents with different opinions, initially preferentially assigning opinions to agents, and the introduction of committed agents, who never change their initial opinion.",
