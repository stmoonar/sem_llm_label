            "abstract": "Beamforming for multi-antenna wireless communication systems has been widely studied and applied in practice. However, its performance in high mobility scenarios deteriorates dramatically due to severe channel aging. This issue stimulates the research of channel prediction in high mobility scenarios. This paper studies the general high-mobility Doppler domain wireless channel characterization and reveals that: 1) the Doppler frequency of the cluster corresponding to the near scatterers varies approximately linearly over short periods; 2) the linear-fitting characteristics of autoregressive model leads to poor channel prediction performance; 3) the parameter estimation algorithms of the chirp model which encompasses the characteristics are particularly complex. Given the shortcomings of existing works, this paper adopts the short-time Fourier transform to pre-estimate the parameter range and leverages the polynomial Fourier transform to obtain the initial values of the parameters. The downhill simplex algorithm is used to search for the fine-grained values of the parameters. In addition, the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is utilized to reconstruct the sparse signal. Evaluation results under the COST2100 channel model and a channel measurement campaign indicate that the proposed scheme can enhance the channel prediction accuracy or reduce the computing overhead compared to the existing matrix completion and polynomial iteration method.",

Such a structure is beneficial to operators for flexible and low-cost network deployment, and to terminals for continuously evolving wireless technologies. Conventionally, they rely on General-Purpose-Processors (GPPs) such as Intel\u2019s x86 processors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for digital baseband signal processing.

            "abstract": "With the increasing on-board demand for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs), the fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems are being massively utilized in vehicular networks. As an essential component, content retrieval in the ICV provides a basis for vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure data interaction for many applications. However, content access is still subject to performance degradation due to congested communication channels, diverse requests patterns, and intermittent network connectivity. To mitigate these issues, in-network caching in 5G-enabled ICV has been leveraged to benefit content access by allowing edge nodes to store content for data generators. In this paper, we propose an in-network caching scheme to support various provisions of data sharing in the ICVs by exploring the advantages of information-centric networks (ICN). We first divide each on-board service into several content units. Then, we place these units at the ICV and small cell base stations (SBSs) to reduce the content retrieval delay, further model the proposed system as an integer nonlinear program (INLP) and attain the optimal QoE (Quality of Experience) by placing content units at appropriate cache entities. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and correctness of our proposed model through extensive simulations.",

Channel prediction, as an effective approach to acquire CSI, is considered a promising approach to improve the communication performance. However, most of the current prediction methods with the assumption of slowly varying channel components cannot cope with rapid variation. In this paper, we propose a novel channel prediction scheme to incorporate the mobility of both transceivers and scatterers. Based on the estimated mobility parameters, the component-wise channel extraction results are derived and then the channel frequency response is predicted. In addition, the prediction performance and the computational complexity of the proposed scheme are analyzed and evaluated, and the relationship between the mobility parameter estimation error and the channel component prediction accuracy is revealed as well. Through predicted results based on the simulated and measured data, the performance of the proposed scheme surpasses the conventional schemes with genie-aided information.",

            "abstract": ": Network slicing is a critical driver for guaranteeing the diverse service level agreements (SLA) in 5G and future networks. Inter-slice radio resource allocation (IS-RRA) in the radio access network (RAN) is very important. However, user mobility brings new challenges for optimal IS-RRA. This paper \ufb01rst proposes a soft and hard hybrid slicing framework where a common slice is introduced to realize a trade-off between isolation and spectrum ef\ufb01ciency (SE). To address the challenges posed by user mobility, we propose a two-step deep learning-based algorithm: joint long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network state prediction and deep Q network (DQN)-based slicing strategy. In the proposal, LSTM networks are em-ployed to predict traf\ufb01c demand and the location of each user in a slicing window level. Moreover, channel gain is mapped by location and a radio map. Then, the predicted channel gain and traf\ufb01c demand are input to the DQN to output the precise slicing adjustment. Finally, experiment results con\ufb01rm the effectiveness of our proposed slicing framework: the slices\u2019 SLA can be guaranteed well, and the proposed algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance in terms of the SLA satisfaction ratio, isolation degree and SE.",

            "abstract": "Utilizing high-frequency bands and massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology has become a major trend in wireless communications. One of the fundamental challenge is to understand the propagation characteristics of such channels. In this paper, we present a channel sounding methodology at 14 GHz with massive MIMO. The measurements are recorded at more than 50 locations including Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios. A $16\\times 4$ Uniform Panel Array (UPA) and a quadruple of 4 $\\times 4$ UPAs forming a square are both used for measuring the channel statistics. Then the small scale characteristics of an outdoor campus scenario are analyzed, including Root-Mean-Square (RMS) delay spread, cluster analysis and angle estimation. The results of RMS delay spread and angle spread measured by different antenna arrays show distinctive results in NLoS case. Specifically, the RMS delay spread and angle spread values are measured larger by the quadruple antenna arrays, wherein the RMS delay spread values are 12 ns and 15 ns respectively, and the angle spread values are 8.613\u00b0 and 169.0601\u00b0, respectively. It is reasonable that the multipath information is richer when the quadruple array is receiving signals from all directions.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, with the development of wireless communication systems, high-frequency bands are utilized together with low-frequency bands to provide better system throughput. However, systems based on high-frequency bands suffer from coverage problems significantly. In this paper, we consider utilizing the sounding signals from two frequency bands to improve the channel estimation accuracy of both bands, and therefore enhance the coverage. An algorithm based on Distributed Compressed Sensing (DCS) is proposed, combining with Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP) technology. We verify the algorithm performance by simulations and real-world channel measurements, which show that the proposed method can improve the channel estimation accuracy of two frequency bands with the same pilot cost, compared with the system wherein the channels are estimated independently for each band.",

            "title": "A Hard and Soft Hybrid Slicing Framework for Service Level Agreement Guarantee via Deep Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Network slicing is a critical driver for guaranteeing the diverse service level agreements (SLA) in 5G and future networks. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely utmzed for resource allocation in network slicing. However, existing related works do not consider the performance loss associated with the initial exploration phase of DRL. This paper proposes a new performance-guaranteed slicing strategy with a soft and hard hybrid slicing setting. Mainly, a common slice setting is applied to guarantee slices\u2019 SLA when training the neural network. Moreover, the resource of the common slice tends to precisely redistribute to slices with the training of DRL until it converges. Furthermore, experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed slicing framework: the slices\u2019 SLA of the training phase can be guaranteed, and the proposed algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance in terms of the SLA satisfaction ratio, isolation degree and spectrum efficiency after convergence.",
