            "title": "VUGA : a visual user group analytics system for user data",
            "abstract": "Along with the constant growth in the size of user data, the need to understand the behavior of user groups increases. The study of user data is known as User Group Analytics(UGA). UGA is used to give support in making the best decisions quickly and with greater credibility. In addition to addressing certain peculiarities such as noise and the dispersion of data, UGA is helping the scientific community to carry out studies and experiments on large-scale population. However, it also helps ordinary users to make more routine decisions either with people who think in a similar way as well as in a different way. The ability to explore and compare information of interest is within the core of UGA. While there are already automated systems that can identify and suggest potentially interesting groups, there is a need to filter results and improve the parameters as a user explores the data needs to finally provide a visual interface. Consequently, the combination of a visual and analytical interface with the opportunity for reevaluation filters and feedbacks are known as Visual Analytics (VA). In the present work, we describe VUGA, a VA system that explores groups of user data and improves other approaches based only on automated procedures.",

            "title": "UserDEV: A Mixed-Initiative System for User Group Analytics",
            "abstract": "The increasing availability of user data constitutes new opportunities in various applications ranging from behavioral analytics to recommendations. A common way of analyzing user data is through \"user group analytics\" whose purpose is to breakdown users into groups to gain a more focused understanding of their collective behavior. The process consists of group discovery, group exploration, and group visualization. To date, user group analytics is done using separate tools which makes it fragmented and burdensome for analysts. In this paper, we describe UserDEV, a full-fledged user group analytics pipeline which combines discovery, exploration, and visualization of user groups, in a fully-connected fashion. UserDEV contributes a star-like architecture as well as a common data exchange model to tighten connections between the analytics components. We provide a realistic use case to show how UserDEV helps analysts perform analytical tasks on user groups. While we report a preliminary user study, we also discuss opportunities for an end-to-end evaluation of a group analytics framework.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate VEXUS, an interactive visualization framework for exploring user data to fulfill tasks such as finding a set of experts, forming discussion groups and analyzing collective behaviors. User data is characterized by a combination of demographics like age and occupation, and actions such as rating a movie, writing a paper or following a medical treatment. The ubiquity of user data requires tools that help explorers, be they specialists or novice users, acquire new insights. VEXUS lets explorers interact with user data via visual primitives and builds an exploration profile to recommend the next exploration steps. VEXUS combines state-of-the-art visualization techniques with appropriate indexing of user data to provide fast and relevant exploration.",
