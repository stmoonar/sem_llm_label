            "title": "Fantastic Expressions and Where to Find Them: Chinese Simile Generation with Multiple Constraints",
            "abstract": "Similes occur in the creative context of describing a concept (i.e., tenor) by making a literally false yet figuratively meaningful comparison to another (i.e., vehicle). Previous efforts form simile generation as a context-free generation task, focusing on simile-style transfer or writing a simile from a given prefix. However, generated texts under such settings might be undesirable, such as hardly meeting the simile definition (e.g., missing vehicle) or difficult to address certain preferences of content as humans wish (e.g., describe the color of apples through the simile). We believe that a simile could be more qualified and user-oriented if incorporated with pre-specified constraints. To this end, we introduce controllable simile generation (CSG), a new task that requires the model to generate a simile with multiple simile elements, e.g., context and vehicle. To facilitate this task, we present GraCe, including 61.3k simile-element annotated Chinese similes. Based on it, we propose a CSG model Similor to benchmark this task, including a vehicle retrieval module Scorer to obtain the explicable comparison for a given tenor in the vehicle-unknown situation. Both statistical and experimental analyses show that GraCe is of high quality beyond all other Chinese simile datasets, in terms of the number (8 vs. 3) of annotation elements, Is-Simile accuracy (98.9% vs. 78.7%), and increasing model-performance gains for both uncontrollable and controllable simile generation. Meanwhile, Similor can serve as a strong baseline for CSG, especially with Scorer, which beats model-based retrieval methods without any re-training.",

            "abstract": "Conversational systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, show exceptional proficiency in context understanding and response generation. However, despite their impressive capabilities, they still possess limitations, such as providing randomly-guessed answers to ambiguous queries or failing to refuse users' requests, both of which are considered aspects of a conversational agent's proactivity. This raises the question of whether LLM-based conversational systems are equipped to handle proactive dialogue problems. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LLM-based conversational systems, specifically focusing on three aspects of proactive dialogue systems: clarification, target-guided, and non-collaborative dialogues. To trigger the proactivity of LLMs, we propose the Proactive Chain-of-Thought prompting scheme, which augments LLMs with the goal planning capability over descriptive reasoning chains. Empirical findings are discussed to promote future studies on LLM-based proactive dialogue systems.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.",

            "abstract": "Conversational systems are envisioned to provide social support or functional service to human users via natural language interactions. Conventional conversation researches mainly focus on the responseability of the system, such as dialogue context understanding and response generation, but overlooks the design of an essential property in intelligent conversations, i.e., goal awareness. The awareness of goals means the state of not only being responsive to the users but also aware of the target conversational goal and capable of leading the conversation towards the goal, which is a significant step towards higher-level intelligence and artificial consciousness. It can not only largely improve user engagement and service efficiency in the conversation, but also empower the system to handle more complicated conversation tasks that involve strategical and motivational interactions. In this tutorial, we will introduce the recent advances on the design of agent\u2019s awareness of goals in a wide range of conversational systems.",

            "abstract": "Learning hyperbolic embeddings for knowledge graph (KG) has gained increasing attention due to its superiority in capturing hierarchies. However, some important operations in hyperbolic space still lack good definitions, making existing methods unable to fully leverage the merits of hyperbolic space. Specifically, they suffer from two main limitations: 1) existing Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in hyperbolic space rely on tangent space approximation, which would incur approximation error in representation learning, and 2) due to the lack of inner product operation definition in hyperbolic space, existing methods can only measure the plausibility of facts (links) with hyperbolic distance, which is difficult to capture complex data patterns. In this work, we contribute: 1) a Full Poincar\\'{e} Multi-relational GCN that achieves graph information propagation in hyperbolic space without requiring any approximation, and 2) a hyperbolic generalization of Euclidean inner product that is beneficial to capture both hierarchical and complex patterns. On this basis, we further develop a \\textbf{F}ully and \\textbf{F}lexible \\textbf{H}yperbolic \\textbf{R}epresentation framework (\\textbf{FFHR}) that is able to transfer recent Euclidean-based advances to hyperbolic space. We demonstrate it by instantiating FFHR with four representative KGC methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FFHRs over their Euclidean counterparts as well as state-of-the-art hyperbolic embedding methods.",

            "abstract": "Attribute-based Controlled Text Generation (CTG) refers to generating sentences that satisfy desirable attributes (e.g., emotions and topics). Existing work usually utilize fine-tuning or resort to extra attribute classifiers, yet suffer from increases in storage and inference time. To address these concerns, we explore attribute-based CTG in a parameter-efficient manner. In short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained continuous vector i.e., single-attribute prompt), which guides the generation of a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM) to satisfy a pre-specified attribute. These prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole for multi-attribute CTG without any re-training. Nevertheless, this may raise problems of fluency downgrading and position sensitivity. To solve this, Tailor provides two solutions to enhance the combination. The former contains a multi-attribute prompt mask and a re-indexing position sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one single-attribute prompt for each task) and the testing stage (concatenating two prompts). The latter introduces a trainable prompt connector to further enhance the combinations. Experiments demonstrate that, only requiring 0.08% extra training parameters of the GPT-2, Tailor can achieve effective and general improvements on eleven attribute-specific generation tasks.",

Therefore, we introduce the Knowing-how&Knowing-that task that requires the model to answer factoid-style, procedure-style, and inconsistent questions about user manuals. We resolve this task by jointly representing the steps and facts in a graph TARA, which supports a unified inference of various questions. Towards a systematical benchmarking study, we design a heuristic method to automatically parse user manuals into TARAs and build an annotated dataset to test the model's ability in answering real-world questions. Empirical results demonstrate that representing user manuals as TARAs is a desired solution for the MRC of user manuals. An in-depth investigation of TARA further sheds light on the issues and broader impacts of future representations of user manuals. We hope our work can move the MRC of user manuals to a more complex and realistic stage.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) effectively address information asymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn interactions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences, i.e., users have a firm belief about the fine-grained preference for one or multiple target items. Under this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and treat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and reduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering. However, in reality, users\u2019 preferences are often vague and volatile, with uncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel scenario called Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR), whichconsidersusers\u2019vagueandvolatilepreferencesinCRS.VPMCR employsasoftestimationmechanismtoassignanon-zeroconfi-dencescoreforallcandidateitemstobedisplayed,naturallyavoid-ingtheover-filteringproblem.IntheVPMCRsetting,weintro-duceansolutioncalledAdaptiveVaguePreferencePolicyLearning (AVPPL),whichconsistsoftwomaincomponents:Uncertainty-awareSoftEstimation(USE)andUncertainty-awarePolicyLearn-ing(UPL).USEestimatestheuncertaintyofusers\u2019vaguefeedback andcapturestheirdynamicpreferencesusingachoice-basedprefer-encesextractionmoduleandatime-awaredecayingstrategy.UPL leveragesthepreferencedistributionestimatedbyUSEtoguidethe conversationandadapttochangesinusers\u2019preferencestomake recommendationsoraskforattributes.

            "abstract": "Fine-grained information on translation errors is helpful for the translation evaluation community. Existing approaches can not synchronously consider error position and type, failing to integrate the error information of both. In this paper, we propose Fine-Grained Translation Error Detection (FG-TED) task, aiming at identifying both the position and the type of translation errors on given source-hypothesis sentence pairs. Besides, we build an FG-TED model to predict the \\textbf{addition} and \\textbf{omission} errors -- two typical translation accuracy errors. First, we use a word-level classification paradigm to form our model and use the shortcut learning reduction to relieve the influence of monolingual features. Besides, we construct synthetic datasets for model training, and relieve the disagreement of data labeling in authoritative datasets, making the experimental benchmark concordant. Experiments show that our model can identify both error type and position concurrently, and gives state-of-the-art results on the restored dataset. Our model also delivers more reliable predictions on low-resource and transfer scenarios than existing baselines. The related datasets and the source code will be released in the future.",
