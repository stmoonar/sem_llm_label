            "title": "Multi-View Maximum Margin Clustering With Privileged Information Learning",
            "abstract": "Maximum margin clustering (MMC) is a typical clustering method which aims to maximize the margin between different clusters. However, in practical applications, a data object may be represented by multiple feature sets (views), with each feature set representing different information of the underlying data. The traditional MMC methods can handle only the data from a single view and are unable to utilize the multi-view data to enhance the clustering model. In multi-view clustering, there are two basic principles: the consensus principle and complementarity principle. Most multi-view clustering methods implement mainly the consensus principle, while the complementarity principle has not been sufficiently taken into account. Distinguished from the existing methods, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> introduces the idea of privileged information learning into multi-view clustering and implements both of the consensus principle and complementarity principle. Based on privileged information learning, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> embodies the complementarity principle by considering one view as the main learning information and the other views as the privileged information, so that multiple views can provide information to complement each other. The derived learning problem is then solved by applying the constrained concave\u2013convex procedure and cutting plane techniques. By employing these techniques, the computational time of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is able to scale linearly with respect to the dataset size. Numerical experiments on real-life multi-view datasets demonstrate that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text {M}^{3}\\text {CP}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is able to achieve better clustering accuracy and meanwhile needs less computational time, compared to state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.",

            "abstract": "In an edge-cloud cooperative computing network, the task offloading performance can be further improved by the edge-cloud and edge-edge cooperation, in which the tasks can be offloaded from an edge server to the cloud server or another edge server. Such edge-cloud cooperative task offloading can jointly utilize the resources of all the edge servers and the cloud server. This paper proposes a collaborative service placement, task scheduling, computing resource allocation, and transmission rate allocation scheme for a multi-task and multi-service scenario with edge-cloud cooperation. The objective of our optimization problem is to minimize the total task processing delay while guaranteeing long-term task queuing stability. Considering the high complexity of the original optimization problem, we transform the problem into a deterministic problem for each time slot based on the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we design an iterative algorithm to obtain the whole solution to the problem efficiently based on a hybrid method using multiple numerical techniques. Further, considering the inherent difference in the optimization periods of the service placement, resource allocation, and task scheduling sub-problems, we design a multi-timescale algorithm to solve the sub-problems with different optimization periods. The complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, and extensive simulations are conducted by varying multiple crucial parameters. The superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparison with 4 other schemes.",

            "title": "MESON: A Mobility-Aware Dependent Task Offloading Scheme for Urban Vehicular Edge Computing",
            "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is the transportation version of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in road scenarios. One key technology of VEC is task offloading, which allows vehicles to send their computation tasks to the surrounding Roadside Units (RSUs) or other vehicles for execution, thereby reducing computation delay and energy consumption. However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because vehicles with time-varying trajectories need to process massive data with high complexity and diversity. In this paper, a VEC-based computation offloading model is developed with consideration of data dependency of tasks. The minimization of the average response time and average energy consumption of the system is defined as a combinatorial optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobility-aware dependent task offloading (MESON) Scheme for urban VEC and develop a DRL-based algorithm to train the offloading strategy. To improve the training efficiency, a vehicle mobility detection algorithm is further designed to detect the communication time between vehicles and RSUs. In this way, MESON can avoid unreasonable decisions by lowering the size of the action space. Moreover, to improve the system stability and the offloading successful rate, we design a task priority determination scheme to prioritize the tasks in the waiting queue. The experimental results show that MESON is superior compared to other task offloading schemes in terms of the average response time, average system energy consumption, and offloading successful rate.",

            "abstract": "Due to the outstanding merits such as mobility, high maneuverability, and flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are viable mobile power transmitters that can be rapidly deployed in geographically constrained regions. They are good candidates for supplying power to energy-limited Sensor Nodes (SNs) with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-enabled WPT system that transmits power to a set of SNs at unknown positions. A key challenge is how to efficiently gather the locations of SNs and design a power transfer scheme. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize these objectives: maximization of UAV's search efficiency, maximization of total harvested energy, minimization of UAV's flight energy consumption and maximization of UAV's energy utilization efficiency. To tackle these issues, we present a two-stage strategy that includes a UAV Motion Control (UMC) algorithm for obtaining the coordinates of SNs and a Dynamic Genetic Clustering (DGC) algorithm for power transfer via grouping SNs into clusters. First, the UMC algorithm enables the UAV to autonomously control its own motion and conduct target search missions. The objective is to make the energy-restricted UAV find as many SNs as feasible without any priori known location information. Second, the DGC algorithm is used to optimize the energy consumption of the UAV by combining a genetic clustering algorithm with a dynamic clustering strategy to maximize the amount of energy harvested by SNs and the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. Finally, experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts.",

            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been advancing and gaining tremendous interests from both academia and industry. With the development of wireless technologies, a huge amount of data generated at the network edge provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop GANs applications. However, due to the constraints such as bandwidth, privacy, and legal issues, it is inappropriate to collect and send all data to the cloud or servers for analysis, training, and mining. Thus, deploying and training GANs at the edge becomes a promising alternative solution. The instability of GANs introduced by non-independent and identical data (Non-IID) poses significant challenges to training GANs. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel federated learning framework for GANs, namely, Collaborated gAme Parallel Learning (CAP). CAP supports parallel training of data and models for GANs, breaking the isolated training among generators that exists in the previous distributed algorithms, and achieving collaborative learning among cloud, edge servers, and devices. Then, to further enhance the ability of CAP-GAN for addressing Non-IID issues, we propose a Mix-Generator module (Mix-G) which divides a generator into the sharing layer and personalizing layer. The Mix-G module extracts the generic and personalization features and improves the performance of CAP-GAN on extremely personalizing datasets. Experimental results and analysis substantiate the usefulness and superiority of our proposed CAP-GAN scheme which can achieve better results in the Non-IID scenarios compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "title": "Leveraging GPT-4 for Food Effect Summarization to Enhance Product-Specific Guidance Development via Iterative Prompting",
            "abstract": "Food effect summarization from New Drug Application (NDA) is an essential component of product-specific guidance (PSG) development and assessment, which provides the basis of recommendations for fasting and fed bioequivalence studies to guide the pharmaceutical industry for developing generic drug products. However, manual summarization of food effect from extensive drug application review documents is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop automated methods to generate food effect summary. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have demonstrated great potential in improving the effectiveness of automated text summarization, but its ability with regard to the accuracy in summarizing food effect for PSG assessment remains unclear. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach,iterative prompting, which allows one to interact with ChatGPT or GPT-4 more effectively and efficiently through multi-turn interaction. Specifically, we propose a three-turn iterative prompting approach to food effect summarization in which the keyword-focused and length-controlled prompts are respectively provided in consecutive turns to refine the quality of the generated summary. We conduct a series of extensive evaluations, ranging from automated metrics to FDA professionals and even evaluation by GPT-4, on 100 NDA review documents selected over the past five years. We observe that the summary quality is progressively improved throughout the iterative prompting process. Moreover, we find that GPT-4 performs better than ChatGPT, as evaluated by FDA professionals (43% vs. 12%) and GPT-4 (64% vs. 35%). Importantly, all the FDA professionals unanimously rated that 85% of the summaries generated by GPT-4 are factually consistent with the golden reference summary, a finding further supported by GPT-4 rating of 72% consistency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a great potential for GPT-4 to draft food effect summaries that could be reviewed by FDA professionals, thereby improving the efficiency of the PSG assessment cycle and promoting generic drug product development.",

            "abstract": "Edge caching has emerged as a promising approach to meet explosive mobile data on 6G networks. One critical issue in edge caching is file popularity prediction. The federated learning (FL) based distributed algorithm is used to predict file popularity, which solves user privacy issues in centralized algorithms. However, due to the heterogeneity of user devices, the feedback time (i.e., the update and upload time of model parameters) is various for each user, which causes the feedback delay in the framework of FL-based edge caching. In this letter, we devise a feedback delay-tolerant proactive caching scheme (FLASH) based on FL in which each user utilizes hybrid filtering on stacked autoencoders to train the prediction model locally. Experimental results indicate that FLASH can effectively handle feedback delay and outperform counterpart algorithms in cache efficiency.",
