            "title": "Machine Learning Methods for Health-Index Prediction in Coating Chambers",
            "abstract": "Coating chambers create thin layers that improve the mechanical and optical surface properties in jewelry production using physical vapor deposition. In such a process, evaporated material condensates on the walls of such chambers and, over time, causes mechanical defects and unstable processes. As a result, manufacturers perform extensive maintenance procedures to reduce production loss. Current rule-based maintenance strategies neglect the impact of specific recipes and the actual condition of the vacuum chamber. Our overall goal is to predict the future condition of the coating chamber to allow cost and quality optimized maintenance of the equipment. This paper describes the derivation of a novel health indicator that serves as a step toward condition-based maintenance for coating chambers. We indirectly use gas emissions of the chamber\u2019s contamination to evaluate the machine\u2019s condition. Our approach relies on process data and does not require additional hardware installation. Further, we evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms for a condition-based forecast of the health indicator that also reflects production planning. Our results show that models based on decision trees are the most effective and outperform all three benchmarks, improving at least 0.22 in the mean average error. Our work paves the way for cost and quality optimized maintenance of coating applications.",

            "title": "Demonstrating Reinforcement Learning for Maintenance Scheduling in a Production Environment",
            "abstract": "As the automation of production lines in modern manufacturing environments becomes ubiquitous, their flexibility and resilience become increasingly important. Consequently, the scheduling of maintenance activities is growing more complex and at the same time ever more crucial for ensuring adequate system availability. In this paper a digital model of a production environment is presented, using building blocks and restrictions that can be found in most modern production environments. Maintenance and repair activities in the model are scheduled by a reinforcement learning agent for different proof-of-concept scenarios, which can be optimised using measures such as maximizing production capacity and minimizing maintenance costs. The results of this paper provide the basis for further work to improve the working conditions of human maintenance planners by providing a reliable decision support system which facilitates the task of scheduling planned and unplanned maintenance activities.",
