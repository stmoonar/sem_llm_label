            "title": "A Counterfactual Collaborative Session-based Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Most session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) focus on extracting information from the observed items in the current session of a user to predict a next item, ignoring the causes outside the session (called outer-session causes, OSCs) that influence the user\u2019s selection of items. However, these causes widely exist in the real world, and few studies have investigated their role in SBRSs. In this work, we analyze the causalities and correlations of the OSCs in SBRSs from the perspective of causal inference. We find that the OSCs are essentially the confounders in SBRSs, which leads to spurious correlations in the data used to train SBRS models. To address this problem, we propose a novel SBRS framework named COCO-SBRS (COunterfactual COllaborative Session-Based Recommender Systems) to learn the causality between OSCs and user-item interactions in SBRSs. COCO-SBRS first adopts a self-supervised approach to pre-train a recommendation model by designing pseudo-labels of causes for each user\u2019s selection of the item in data to guide the training process. Next, COCO-SBRS adopts counterfactual inference to recommend items based on the outputs of the pre-trained recommendation model considering the causalities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. As a result, COCO-SBRS can learn the causalities in data, preventing the model from learning spurious correlations. The experimental results of our extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over ten representative SBRSs.",

            "title": "Veracity-aware and Event-driven Personalized News Recommendation for Fake News Mitigation",
            "abstract": "Despite the tremendous efforts by social media platforms and fact-check services for fake news detection, fake news and misinformation still spread wildly on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter). Consequently, fake news mitigation strategies are urgently needed. Most of the existing work on fake news mitigation focuses on the overall mitigation on a whole social network while ignoring developing concrete mitigation strategies to deter individual users from sharing fake news. In this paper, we propose a novel veracity-aware and event-driven recommendation model to recommend personalised corrective true news to individual users for effectively debunking fake news. Our proposed model Rec4Mit (Recommendation for Mitigation) not only effectively captures a user\u2019s current reading preference with a focus on which event, e.g., US election, from her/his recent reading history containing true and/or fake news, but also accurately predicts the veracity (true or fake) of candidate news. As a result, Rec4Mit can recommend the most suitable true news to best match the user\u2019s preference as well as to mitigate fake news. In particular, for those users who have read fake news of a certain event, Rec4Mit is able to recommend the corresponding true news of the same event. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Rec4Mit significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommendation methods in terms of the capability to recommend personalized true news for fake news mitigation.",

            "title": "Next-item Recommendations in Short Sessions",
            "abstract": "The changing preferences of users towards items trigger the emergence of session-based recommender systems (SBRSs), which aim to model the dynamic preferences of users for next-item recommendations. However, most of the existing studies on SBRSs are based on long sessions only for recommendations, ignoring short sessions, though short sessions, in fact, account for a large proportion in most of the real-world datasets. As a result, the applicability of existing SBRSs solutions is greatly reduced. In a short session, quite limited contextual information is available, making the next-item recommendation very challenging. To this end, in this paper, inspired by the success of few-shot learning (FSL) in effectively learning a model with limited instances, we formulate the next-item recommendation as an FSL problem. Accordingly, following the basic idea of a representative approach for FSL, i.e., meta-learning, we devise an effective SBRS called INter-SEssion collaborativeRecommender neTwork (INSERT) for next-item recommendations in short sessions. With the carefully devised local module and global module, INSERT is able to learn an optimal preference representation of the current user in a given short session. In particular, in the global module, a similar session retrieval network (SSRN) is designed to find out the sessions similar to the current short session from the historical sessions of both the current user and other users, respectively. The obtained similar sessions are then utilized to complement and optimize the preference representation learned from the current short session by the local module for more accurate next-item recommendations in this short session. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed INSERT over the state-of-the-art SBRSs when making next-item recommendations in short sessions.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Extracting buildings from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery automatically is considered as an important task in many applications. The huge differences in the appearance and spatial distribution of man-made buildings make it a challenging issue. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made remarkable progress in computer vision. Many published papers have applied deep CNNs to remote sensing successfully. However, most contributions require complex structure and a big number of parameters which lead to redundant computations, and limit the application of the models. To address these issues, we propose a deep residual learning serial segmentation network called SSNet, an end-to-end semantic segmentation network, to extract buildings from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. SSNet reduces the network complexity and computations by drawing on the advantages of U-Net and ResNet, and improves the detection accuracy. The SSNet is extensively evaluated on two large remote sensing datasets covering a wide range of urban settlement appearances. The comparison of SSNet and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model for building extraction.",

            "title": "A Block-based Generative Model for Attributed Networks Embedding",
            "abstract": "Attributed network embedding has attracted plenty of interests in recent years. It aims to learn task-independent, low-dimension, and continuous vectors for nodes preserving both topology and attribute information. Most existing methods, such as GCN and its variations, mainly focus on the local information, i.e., the attributes of the neighbors. Thus, they have been well studied for assortative networks but ignored disassortative networks, which are common in real scenes. To address this issue, we propose a block-based generative model for attributed network embedding on a probability perspective inspired by the stochastic block model (SBM). Specifically, the nodes are assigned to several blocks wherein the nodes in the same block share the similar link patterns. These patterns can define assortative networks containing communities or disassortative networks with the multipartite, hub, or any hybrid structures. Concerning the attribute information, we assume that each node has a hidden embedding related to its assigned block, and then we use a neural network to characterize the nonlinearity between the node embedding and its attribute. We perform extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic attributed networks, and the experimental results show that our proposed method remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art embedding methods for both clustering and classification tasks, especially on disassortative networks.",

The structure of flexible multi-terminal DC micro-grid and the modularized method of network construction are discussed. The feasibility of the study is confirmed by a specific example of DC micro-grid. On the basis of the above research, the hierarchical control method of DC micro-grid, the specific control method and control logic in each layer are determined.

            "abstract": "An important and widespread topic in cloud computing is text analyzing. People often use topic model which is a popular and effective technology to deal with related tasks. Among all the topic models, sLDA is acknowledged as a popular supervised topic model, which adds a response variable or category label with each document, so that the model can uncover the latent structure of a text dataset as well as retains the predictive power for supervised tasks. However, sLDA needs to process all the documents at each iteration in the training period. When the size of dataset increases to the volume that one node cannot deal with, sLDA will no longer be competitive. In this paper we propose a novel model named Mr.sLDA which extends sLDA with stochastic variational inference (SVI) and MapReduce. SVI can reduce the computational burden of sLDA and MapReduce extends the algorithm with parallelization. Mr.sLDA makes the training become more efficient and the training method can be easily implemented in a large computer cluster or cloud computing. Empirical results show that our approach has an efficient training process, and similar accuracy with sLDA.",
