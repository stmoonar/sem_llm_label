            "title": "Lightweight Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Accurate Arrhythmia Detection in Clinical 12-Lead ECG Data",
            "abstract": "Although significant progress has been made in diagnosing arrhythmias, current deep neural network (DNN)-based methods still suffer from misdiagnosis and redundant parameters. One reason for this is the lack of high-quality clinical 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets and the absence of a systematic set of general task-oriented network lightweight methods. The objective of this article is to propose a lightweight optimization method of deep learning models for accurate arrhythmia detection in clinical 12-lead ECG data. We show that the proposed optimized module replacement method can provide a strategy for arrhythmia detection in the lightweight network design for clinical 12-lead classification. The key of this method is to design compact convolution to replace standard convolutions based on module functional equivalence and identify the accuracy fractured segment (AFS). To achieve this, we randomly choose a network base (the initial model) that achieves satisfactory classification performance on a given classification task, replace larger-scale parameter convolutions with smaller-scale parameter convolutions, observe the degenerated process of accuracy until an AFS is found, and conduct tests in the candidate models. We validate the proposed method against the three-year 12-lead ECGs of patients who have undergone ECG detection at Shanghai First People\u2019s Hospital and achieve an overall accuracy of 95.532%, a precision score of 0.927, a recall score of 0.910, and a specificity score of 0.990, which are better than other methods. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed method can not only effectively reduce network parameters but also boost model performance for specific classification tasks.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion models, as a novel generative paradigm, have achieved remarkable success in various image generation tasks such as image inpainting, image-to-text translation, and video generation. Graph generation is a crucial computational task on graphs with numerous real-world applications. It aims to learn the distribution of given graphs and then generate new graphs. Given the great success of diffusion models in image generation, increasing efforts have been made to leverage these techniques to advance graph generation in recent years. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of generative diffusion models on graphs, In particular, we review representative algorithms for three variants of graph diffusion models, i.e., Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics (SMLD), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), and Score-based Generative Model (SGM). Then, we summarize the major applications of generative diffusion models on graphs with a specific focus on molecule and protein modeling. Finally, we discuss promising directions in generative diffusion models on graph-structured data.",

            "title": "A Novel Interpretable Method Based on Dual-Level Attentional Deep Neural Network for Actual Multilabel Arrhythmia Detection",
            "abstract": "Arrhythmia accounts for more than 80% of sudden cardiac death, and its incidence rate has increased rapidly recently. Nowadays, many studies have applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to arrhythmia detection. Deep learning approaches can improve model performance but lack the capability to mine the relationship between the electrocardiogram (ECG) samples and final results. Furthermore, most arrhythmia diagnosis methods aim at only multiclassification problems. However, in many cases, an ECG recording may have more than one arrhythmia disease. In this article, we develop an accurate and interpretable model for multilabel ECG signals, which is called dual-level attentional convolutional long short-term memory neural network (DLA-CLSTM). Convolutional layers, bidirectional long short-term memory layers, and attention mechanisms are used for extracting beat- and rhythm-level information. Notably, the attention mechanism helps the model be more interpretable. In addition, we design a weighted multilabel classifier to address multilabel and imbalance problems. Finally, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the 1st China Physiological Signal Challenge dataset are utilized to evaluate DLA-CLSTM. Compared with existing methods, DLA-CLSTM can improve the accuracy by 22.50% and the F1-macro by 20.51% on average. Further analysis shows that the areas focused by DLA-CLSTM match the clinical judgment basis to some extent. Collectively, DLA-CLSTM has good potential for assisting clinicians in real applications.",

            "abstract": "In the actual scenario, it is difficult for an automatic diagnosis system to detect each heartbeat when facing new patients. In this article, a novel active dual-scale residual convolutional long short-term memory neural network is proposed to classify heartbeats interactively and automatically. First, each heartbeat and electrocardiogram segment including current heartbeat are combined to build dual-scale input information. In addition, convolution layers, residual block, and bidirectional long short memory are integrated to extract features from dual-scale inputs. Furthermore, active learning approach with random breaking-ties selection strategy is introduced to choose the most representative unlabeled samples for labeling and fine-tune the trained model with these representative labeled samples. The experimental results show that the proposed method uses only 5.14% of the additional data set and improves the model accuracy and macro F1 score by 13.23% and 35.62%, respectively. The proposed structure has good representative ability and our selection strategy can reduce the workload of experts and improve the performance greatly. Thus, the proposed interactive and incremental method has good potential in real applications.",

In order to guarantee the quality of the collected brain waves, we designed an embedded real-time impedance measurement system for the EEG. The system uses the ADS1299 chip, which depends on the on-chip current source to generate an alternating current which is higher than the frequency of the EEG signal as the output signal for impedance measurement. After A/D conversion, the obtained signals contain both EEG signals and impedance measurement signals. Furthermore, the system uses stm32f723 as the main control chip to design a filter to separate the two kinds of signals, and calculate the impedance value between the electrode and scalp in real time. In this system, the EEG signal and the impedance value data are stored in the SD card in BDF format at the same time, which provides the basis for judging the effective EEG data in the later signal processing. At the same time, the impedance value is compared with the preset threshold, and the LED is used to indicate whether the scalp is in good contact. Based on stm32F723 embedded system, the whole system has high integration, small volume, high measurement accuracy and strong real-time performance, which is of great significance for obtaining high-quality EEG data.",

In order to address this issue, the article provides a strategy for a six-way synthetic HIFU therapy system aiming to improve the power of the output ultrasonic beam. In this study, a quasi-self-focusing ultrasonic transducer is presented as a solution to the design of large-caliber self-focusing ultrasonic transducers, which makes it possible to achieve higher ultrasonic utilization by adding a backing layer. Its six-way synthetic large power radio frequency (RF) drive system is also discussed. With the realization of adjustable frequency, phase and excitation value of the driving signal, the presented drive system can operate effectively. Additionally, the acoustic field radiated by the transducer was scanned and a few parameters were measured to assess the transducer's appropriateness for HIFU therapy.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to find a method to locate the scattering centers in spatial domain; by using this information, the mean scatter spacing (MSS) can be estimated, and the spatial information is the one-dimensional imaging of scattering centers. This paper presents a method that can locate the scattering centers in spatial domain robustly and automatically. By incorporating it with fast Fourier transformation, the MSS can be estimated. The three foremost processes, matched filtering, envelope extraction, and peak reconstruction, are incorporated in the authors' algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is a robust one to locate scattering centers in spatial domain, and has a better performance than spectrum-based MSS estimation techniques. Especially exploited in estimating MSS which varies from 0.6 to 1.2\u2009mm in the range of human mean trabecular bone spacing, the proposed method shows great potential in medical use. Simple but widely used phantom experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the capacity to locate scattering centers in spatial domain.",

            "abstract": "Falls in elderly remain a very important public health care issue. The wearable devices based on tri-axial accelerator proves to be an effective tool for fall detection in the recent years. In this paper, we propose an approach to distinguish falls and normal activities of daily living (ADL). A novel method 3D Kernel Principal Component Analysis (3D KPCA) to improve (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) KPCA based feature extraction is developed which can extract the statistical features without the loss of 3D data structure information. Additionally, the threshold techniques and AdaBoost are combined for prediction. The fall detection based on KPCA and 3D KPCA algorithm for feature extraction is firstly proposed in the paper and the experiment conducted on the public database (UCI) shows the efficiency of the approach.",
