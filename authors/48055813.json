            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Satellite image segmentation is crucial in various fields, but acquiring a large amount of labeled data can be challenging. Often, remote sensing images are unlabeled due to the high cost of manual labeling, which hampers training effectiveness and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a spatially and temporally informed graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for satellite image segmentation based on Poisson learning. The main difference to traditional Poisson learning is that our distance function that we use to compute similarity between pixels considers spectral, spatial, and temporal information. Experimental results on the Sentinel-2 time series demonstrate that our approach outperforms other traditional approaches, achieving robust performance in remote sensing image segmentation, especially at a very low label rate.",

            "abstract": "Multiresolution deep learning approaches, such as the UNet architecture, have achieved high performance in classifying and segmenting images. Most traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures commonly use pooling to enlarge the receptive field, which usually results in irreversible information loss. The UNet architecture avoids this information loss by introducing skip connections that allow the reconstruction of lost information. Leveraging this property of the UNet, this study proposes to include a Riesz-Quincunx (RQ) wavelet transform, which combines: 1) higher order Riesz wavelet transform and 2) orthogonal Quincunx wavelets (commonly used to reduce blur in medical images) inside the UNet to reduce noise in satellite images and their time-series. Combining both approaches, we introduce a hybrid RQ-UNet variational autoencoder (RQUNet-VAE) scheme for image and time series decomposition used to reduce noise in satellite imagery. By including denoising capabilities directly inside the UNet architecture, we hypothesize that our RQUNet-VAE may improve downstream image processing tasks that use the traditional UNet architecture. We present qualitative and quantitative experimental results that demonstrate that our proposed RQUNet-VAE is effective at reducing noise in satellite imagery yielding results similar to other state-of-the-art noise reduction methods. We further show that our RQUNet-VAE outperforms the UNet architecture specifically in cases where images exhibit high levels of noise. We show this result in two down-stream applications for multiband satellite images, including image time-series decomposition and image segmentation.",

Effective generalization, will allow land cover classification models trained in data-rich regions to be applied to data-poor regions, with minimal increases in error. This study investigated cross-location generalization through model transfer of convolutional neural networks (CNN), in a series of experiments spread across eight counties within the Chesapeake Bay Catchment. The model transfer was effective (> 80% accuracy), even with as little training as 80/class, across distances up to 600 km. Classification accuracy and to a lesser extent, image similarity in CNN feature space, decreased with geographic distance, but are not the overriding factors governing model transfer.",

A considerable disadvantage of buses is their slow speed, which is in part due to frequent stops, but also due to the lack of segregation from other vehicles in traffic. As such, assessing bus routes is an important aspect of route planning, scheduling, and the creation of dedicated bus lanes. In this work, we use bus tracking data from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to discover speed patterns in relation to bus stops throughout the day. This gives us an insight on whether the routes are affected by traffic congestion or more random events such as traffic lights. We first employ a macro-level qualitative analysis to identify patterns across different trips. A micro-level quantitative analysis further refines this approach by analyzing the speed patterns around bus stops. Our analysis is based on bus odometer data, which is a one-dimensional representation of trips that has considerable accuracy when looking at speed patterns. Exploiting route metadata in relation to stops, we use Dynamic Time Warping to cluster different stops based on their speed profiles throughout the day. The clustering can be used to generate a spatiotemporal route profile and we show how such a profile provides actionable intelligence for route planning purposes.",
