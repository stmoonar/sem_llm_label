            "abstract": "Machine Learning is often challenged by insufficient labeled data. Previous methods employing implicit commonsense knowledge of pre-trained language models (PLMs) or pattern-based symbolic knowledge have achieved great success in mitigating manual annotation efforts. In this paper, we focus on the collaboration among different knowledge sources and present KICE, a Knowledge-evolving framework by Iterative Consolidation and Expansion with the guidance of PLMs and rule-based patterns. Specifically, starting with limited labeled data as seeds, KICE first builds a Rule Generator by prompt-tuning to stimulate the rich knowledge distributed in PLMs, generate seed rules, and initialize the rules set. Afterwards, based on the rule-labeled data, the task model is trained in a self-training pipeline where the knowledge in rules set is consolidated with self-learned high-confidence rules. Finally, for the low-confidence rules, KICE solicits human-enlightened understanding and expands the knowledge coverage for better task model training. Our framework is verified on relation extraction (RE) task, and the experiments on TACRED show that the model performance (F1) grows from 33.24% to 79.84% with the enrichment of knowledge, outperforming all the baselines including other knowledgeable methods.",

            "abstract": "We present $\\textbf{$\\texttt{SkillQG}$}$: a question generation framework with controllable comprehension types for assessing and improving machine reading comprehension models. Existing question generation systems widely differentiate questions by $\\textit{literal}$ information such as question words and answer types to generate semantically relevant questions for a given context. However, they rarely consider the $\\textit{comprehension}$ nature of questions, i.e. the different comprehension capabilities embodied by different questions. In comparison, our $\\texttt{SkillQG}$ is able to tailor a fine-grained assessment and improvement to the capabilities of question answering models built on it. Specifically, we first frame the comprehension type of questions based on a hierarchical skill-based schema, then formulate $\\texttt{SkillQG}$ as a skill-conditioned question generator. Furthermore, to improve the controllability of generation, we augment the input text with question focus and skill-specific knowledge, which are constructed by iteratively prompting the pre-trained language models. Empirical results demonstrate that $\\texttt{SkillQG}$ outperforms baselines in terms of quality, relevance, and skill-controllability while showing a promising performance boost in downstream question answering task.",

            "abstract": "RGB-D salient object detection aims to detect visually distinctive objects or regions from a pair of the RGB image and the depth image. State-of-the-art RGB-D saliency detectors are mainly based on convolutional neural networks but almost suffer from an intrinsic limitation relying on the labeled data, thus degrading detection accuracy in complex cases. In this work, we present a self-supervised self-ensembling network (S $^3$ Net) for semi-supervised RGB-D salient object detection by leveraging the unlabeled data and exploring a self-supervised learning mechanism. To be specific, we first build a self-guided convolutional neural network (SG-CNN) as a baseline model by developing a series of three-layer cross-model feature fusion (TCF) modules to leverage complementary information among depth and RGB modalities and formulating an auxiliary task that predicts a self-supervised image rotation angle. After that, to further explore the knowledge from unlabeled data, we assign SG-CNN to a student network and a teacher network, and encourage the saliency predictions and self-supervised rotation predictions from these two networks to be consistent on the unlabeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our network quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) reveals the ability to understand a given text passage and answer questions based on it. Existing research works in MRC rely heavily on large-size models and corpus to improve the performance evaluated by metrics such as Exact Match (EM) and F_1. However, such a paradigm lacks sufficient interpretation to model capability and can not efficiently train a model with a large corpus. In this paper, we argue that a deep understanding of model capabilities and data properties can help us feed a model with appropriate training data based on its learning status. Specifically, we design an MRC capability assessment framework that assesses model capabilities in an explainable and multi-dimensional manner. Based on it, we further uncover and disentangle the connections between various data properties and model performance. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MRC capability assessment framework, we incorporate it into a curriculum learning pipeline and devise a Capability Boundary Breakthrough Curriculum (CBBC) strategy, which performs a model capability-based training to maximize the data value and improve training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance, achieving up to an 11.22% / 8.71% improvement of EM / F_1 on MRC tasks.",

            "abstract": "Training deep models for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) often requires a large number of labeled RGB-D images. However, RGB-D data is not easily acquired, which limits the development of RGB-D SOD techniques. To alleviate this issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network (DS-Net) to leverage unlabeled RGB images for boosting RGB-D saliency detection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network (DDCNN), which contains a depth estimation branch and a saliency detection branch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used to estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the paired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and depth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned as the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning. Moreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention and saliency maps for the unlabeled data, as well as a supervised depth and saliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DDCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate that our semi-supervised DS-Net can further improve the performance, even when using an RGB image with the pseudo depth map.",

            "abstract": "Graph edit distance / similarity is widely used in many tasks, such as graph similarity search, binary function analysis, and graph clustering. However, computing the exact graph edit distance (GED) or maximum common subgraph (MCS) between two graphs is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose the hierarchical graph matching network (HGMN), which learns to compute graph similarity from data. HGMN is motivated by the observation that two similar graphs should also be similar when they are compressed into more compact graphs. HGMN utilizes multiple stages of hierarchical clustering to organize a graph into successively more compact graphs. At each stage, the earth mover distance (EMD) is adopted to obtain a one-to-one mapping between the nodes in two graphs (on which graph similarity is to be computed), and a correlation matrix is also derived from the embeddings of the nodes in the two graphs. The correlation matrices from all stages are used as input for a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is trained to predict graph similarity by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE). Experimental evaluation on 4 datasets in different domains and 4 performance metrics shows that HGMN consistently outperforms existing baselines in the accuracy of graph similarity approximation.",

It also speeds up the graph drawing algorithm by ignoring repulsive force far away from the vertex, and prevents the nearly disconnected graph from being pushed to the border. Moreover, the key cliques of the email networks are placed in the central of the layout.
