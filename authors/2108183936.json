            "title": "Graph Clustering with Embedding Propagation",
            "abstract": "In the past decade, the amount of attributed network data has skyrocketed, and the problem of identifying their underlying group structures has received significant attention. By leveraging both attribute and link information, recent state-of-the-art network clustering methods have achieved significant improvements on relatively clean datasets. However, the noisy nature of real-world attributed networks has long been over-looked, which leads to degraded performance facing missing or inaccurate attributes and links. In this work, we overcome such weaknesses by marrying the strengths of clustering and embedding on attributed networks. Specifically, we propose GRACE (GRAph Clustering with Embedding propagation), to simultaneously learn network representations and identify net-work clusters in an end-to-end manner. It employs deep denoise autoencoders to generate robust network embeddings from node attributes, propagates the embeddings in the network to capture node interactions, and detects clusters based on the stable state of embedding propagation. To provide more insight, we further analyze GRACE in a theoretical manner and find its underlying connections with two canonical approaches for network modeling. Extensive experiments on six real-world attributed networks demonstrate the superiority of GRACE over various baselines from the state-of-the-art. Remarkably, GRACE improves the averaged performance of the strongest baseline from 0.43 to 0.52, yielding a 21% relative improvement. Controlled experiments and case studies further verify our intuitions and demonstrate the ability of GRACE to handle noisy information in real-world attributed networks.",

            "abstract": "Given a query, unlike traditional IR that finds relevant documents or entities, in this work, we focus on retrieving both entities and their connections for insightful knowledge summarization. For example, given a query \"computer vision'' on a CS literature corpus, rather than returning a list of relevant entities like \"cnn'', \"imagenet'' and \"svm'', we are interested in the connections among them, and furthermore, the evolution patterns of such connections along particular ordinal dimensions such as time. Particularly, we hope to provide structural knowledge relevant to the query, such as \"svm'' is related to \"imagenet'' but not \"cnn''. Moreover, we aim to model the changing trends of the connections, such as \"cnn'' becomes highly related to \"imagenet'' after 2010, which enables the tracking of knowledge evolutions. In this work, to facilitate such a novel insightful search system, we propose SetEvolve, which is a unified framework based on nonparanomal graphical models for evolutionary network construction from large text corpora. Systematic experiments on synthetic data and insightful case studies on real-world corpora demonstrate the utility of SetEvolve.",

            "title": "Graph Clustering with Dynamic Embedding",
            "abstract": "Graph clustering (or community detection) has long drawn enormous attention from the research on web mining and information networks. Recent literature on this topic has reached a consensus that node contents and link structures should be integrated for reliable graph clustering, especially in an unsupervised setting. However, existing methods based on shallow models often suffer from content noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose to utilize deep embedding for graph clustering, motivated by the well-recognized power of neural networks in learning intrinsic content representations. Upon that, we capture the dynamic nature of networks through the principle of influence propagation and calculate the dynamic network embedding. Network clusters are then detected based on the stable state of such an embedding. Unlike most existing embedding methods that are task-agnostic, we simultaneously solve for the underlying node representations and the optimal clustering assignments in an end-to-end manner. To provide more insight, we theoretically analyze our interpretation of network clusters and find its underlying connections with two widely applied approaches for network modeling. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets including both social networks and citation networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art.",
