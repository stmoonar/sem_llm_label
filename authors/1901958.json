            "title": "LoGoNet: Towards Accurate 3D Object Detection with Local-to-Global Cross- Modal Fusion",
            "abstract": "LiDAR-camera fusion methods have shown impressive performance in 3D object detection. Recent advanced multi-modal methods mainly perform global fusion, where image features and point cloud features are fused across the whole scene. Such practice lacks fine-grained region-level information, yielding suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we present the novel Local-to-Global fusion network (LoGoNet), which performs LiDAR-camerafusion at both local and global levels. Concretely, the Global Fusion (GoF) of LoGoNet is built upon previous literature, while we exclusively use point centroids to more precisely represent the position of voxel features, thus achieving better crossmodal alignment. As to the Local Fusion (LoF), we first divide each proposal into uniform grids and then project these grid centers to the images. The image features around the projected grid points are sampled to be fused with position-decorated point cloud features, maximally uti-lizing the rich contextual information around the proposals. The Feature Dynamic Aggregation (FDA) module is further proposed to achieve information interaction between these locally and globally fused features, thus producing more informative multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI datasets show that LoGoNet outperforms all state-of-the-art 3D detection methods. Notably, LoGoNet ranks 1st on Waymo 3D object detection leaderboard and obtains 81.02 mAPH (L2) detection performance. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, the detection performance on three classes surpasses 80 APH (L2) simultaneously. Code will be available at https://github.com/sankin97/LoGoNet.",

            "abstract": "Despite extensive studies, the underlying reason as to why overparameterized neural networks can generalize remains elusive. Existing theory shows that common stochastic optimizers prefer flatter minimizers of the training loss, and thus a natural potential explanation is that flatness implies generalization. This work critically examines this explanation. Through theoretical and empirical investigation, we identify the following three scenarios for two-layer ReLU networks: (1) flatness provably implies generalization; (2) there exist non-generalizing flattest models and sharpness minimization algorithms fail to generalize, and (3) perhaps most surprisingly, there exist non-generalizing flattest models, but sharpness minimization algorithms still generalize. Our results suggest that the relationship between sharpness and generalization subtly depends on the data distributions and the model architectures and sharpness minimization algorithms do not only minimize sharpness to achieve better generalization. This calls for the search for other explanations for the generalization of over-parameterized neural networks.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent theoretical progress on the non-convex optimization of two-layer neural networks, it is still an open question whether gradient descent on neural networks without unnatural modifications can achieve better sample complexity than kernel methods. This paper provides a clean mean-field analysis of projected gradient flow on polynomial-width two-layer neural networks. Different from prior works, our analysis does not require unnatural modifications of the optimization algorithm. We prove that with sample size $n = O(d^{3.1})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the inputs, the network trained with projected gradient flow converges in $\\text{poly}(d)$ time to a non-trivial error that is not achievable by kernel methods using $n \\ll d^4$ samples, hence demonstrating a clear separation between unmodified gradient descent and NTK. As a corollary, we show that projected gradient descent with a positive learning rate and a polynomial number of iterations converges to low error with the same sample complexity.",

            "abstract": "Based on the versatility and effectiveness of the siamese neural network, the technology of unmanned aerial vehicle visual object tracking has found widespread application in various fields including military reconnaissance, intelligent transportation, and visual positioning. However, due to complex factors, such as occlusions, viewpoint changes, and interference from similar objects during UAV tracking, most existing siamese neural network trackers struggle to combine superior performance with efficiency. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel SiamSTM tracker that is based on Slight Aware Enhancement Transformer and Multiple matching networks for real-time UAV tracking. The SiamSTM leverages lightweight transformers to encode robust target appearance features while using the Multiple matching networks to fully perceive response map information and enhance the tracker\u2019s ability to distinguish between the target and background. The results are impressive: evaluation results based on three UAV tracking benchmarks showed superior speed and precision. Moreover, SiamSTM achieves over 35 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, which satisfies the real-time requirements in engineering.",

            "abstract": "Automatically generating human-readable text describing the functionality of a program is the intent of source code summarization. Although neural language models achieve significant performance in this field, they are limited by their inability to access external knowledge. To address this limitation, an emerging trend is combining neural models with external knowledge through retrieval methods. Previous methods have relied on the sentence-level retrieval paradigm on the encoder side. However, this paradigm is coarse-grained, noise-filled and cannot directly take advantage of the high-quality retrieved summary tokens on the decoder side. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Token-level retrieval-augmented mechanism (Tram) on the decoder side rather than the encoder side to enhance the performance of neural models and produce more low-frequency tokens in generating summaries. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of token-level retrieval in capturing contextual code semantics, we also propose integrating code semantics into individual summary tokens. The results of extensive experiments and human evaluation show that our token-level retrieval-augmented approach significantly improves performance and is more interpretable.",

This study applies SmartRock, a wireless embedded sensor widely used in track health monitoring, to the long-term SHM of asphalt pavement to achieve its residual life assessment. According to the structural characteristics of asphalt pavement, a novel processing method of SmartRock monitoring data is proposed. First, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) for back-calculation of pavement dynamic modulus using SmartRock monitoring data is proposed. Then, the evaluated dynamic moduli are used to predict the residual rutting life andresidual fatigue life of the pavement structure. Finally, the two types of residual life are combined to achieve the pavement residual life. This research uses the real-time monitoring data of a test road in Shandong Province, China, to carry out a case study to verify the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in autonomous driving have relied on data-driven approaches, which are widely adopted but face challenges including dataset bias, overfitting, and uninterpretability. Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capabilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that integrates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component to address this question. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously. Extensive experiments prove DiLu's capability to accumulate experience and demonstrate a significant advantage in generalization ability over reinforcement learning-based methods. Moreover, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage knowledge-driven capability in decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Through the proposed DiLu framework, LLM is strengthened to apply knowledge and to reason causally in the autonomous driving domain. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/DiLu/",

In this article, we propose a quantization-based DFL (Q-DFL) mechanism in a D2D network and prove its convergence. Q-DFL contains two phases: 1) in phase I, a local model is trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm on each IIoT device and then exchanges the quantified model parameters between neighboring nodes and 2) in phase II, a quantitative consensus mechanism is designed to ensure the local models converge to the same global model. We also propose an adaptive stopping mechanism and a synchronization protocol to fulfill the phase transition from phase I to phase II. Simulation results reveal that with Q-DFL, a 1-bit quantizer can be employed without affecting the model convergence at the price of slight accuracy reduction, which achieves significant transmission bandwidth saving. Further simulation of Q-DFL for the MobileNet model is fulfilled with different quantization bit levels, which reveals their performance tradeoff among the system information flow consumption, the system time delay, and the system energy cost.",

            "abstract": "UAV visual-object-tracking technology based on Siamese neural networks has great scientific research and practical application value, and it is widely used in geological surveying, reconnaissance monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Due to the limited onboard computational resources and complex real-world environments of drones, most of the existing tracking systems based on Siamese neural networks struggle to combine excellent performance with high efficiency. Therefore, the key issue is to study how to improve the accuracy of target tracking under the challenges of real-time performance and the above factors. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a real-time UAV tracking system based on interframe saliency transformer and lightweight multidimensional attention network (SiamITL). Specifically, interframe saliency transformer is used to continuously perceive spatial and temporal information, making the network more closely related to the essence of the tracking task. Additionally, a lightweight multidimensional attention network is used to better capture changes in both target appearance and background information, improving the ability of the tracker to distinguish between the target and background. SiamITL is effective and efficient: extensive comparative experiments and ablation experiments have been conducted on multiple aerial tracking benchmarks, demonstrating that our algorithm can achieve more robust feature representation and more accurate target state estimation. Among them, SiamITL achieved success and accuracy rates of 0.625 and 0.818 in the UAV123 benchmark, respectively, demonstrating a certain level of leadership in this field. Furthermore, SiamITL demonstrates the potential for real-time operation on the embedded platform Xavier, highlighting its potential for practical application in real-world scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Reconfigurable devices and circuits have long been sought for their flexibility, cost reduction, energy efficiency, scalability, and versatility. One good example of a reconfigurable device is a ferroelectric transistor, where the carrier concentration in the channel can be programmed due to the gradual switching properties of ferroelectrics. There have been ongoing efforts to further introduce ferroelectrics into high electron mobility transistors, which could enable enhanced-mode operation, dynamic Vth tuning, and reconfigurable radio-frequency/microwave applications.1, 2 Recent studies have demonstrated that by alloying IIIB element, e.g., Sc, with conventional III-nitride semiconductors, the polarity switching barrier of III-nitride materials could be greatly reduced, resulting in a new class of ferroelectric materials with giant polarization, including ScAlN and ScGaN.3\u20135 The giant polarization provides ample design space for ferroelectric charge coupling in the channel, potentially supporting broader threshold voltage tuning window, which is tantalizing for memory and reconfigurable RF/microwave applications.6, 7 Herein, we report the first experimental demonstration of ferroelectric switching in ultrathin (5 nm) ScAlN, as well as the realization of fully epitaxial ScAlN/AlGaN/GaN based ferroelectric high electron mobility transistors (FeHEMTs).",
