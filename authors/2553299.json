            "title": "CAPER: Enhancing Career Trajectory Prediction using Temporal Knowledge Graph and Ternary Relationship",
            "abstract": "The problem of career trajectory prediction (CTP) aims to predict one's future employer or job position. While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions-i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.",

However, they often suffer from fairness issues due to inherent biases in node attributes and graph structure, leading to unfair predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN framework, DAB-GNN, that Disentangles, Amplifies, and deBiases attribute, structure, and potential biases in the GNN mechanism. DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and amplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through specialized disentanglers, followed by a debiasing module that minimizes the distance between subgroup distributions to ensure fairness. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors in terms of achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and fairness.",

            "abstract": "The goal of directed network embedding is to represent the nodes in a given directed network as embeddings that preserve the asymmetric relationships between nodes. While a number of directed network embedding methods have been proposed, we empirically show that the existing methods lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities against degree-related distributional shifts. To mitigate this problem, we propose ODIN (Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding), a new directed NE method where we model multiple factors in the formation of directed edges. Then, for each node, ODIN learns multiple embeddings, each of which preserves its corresponding factor, by disentangling interest factors and biases related to in- and out-degrees of nodes. Our experiments on four real-world directed networks demonstrate that disentangling multiple factors enables ODIN to yield out-of-distribution generalized embeddings that are consistently effective under various degrees of shifts in degree distributions. Specifically, ODIN universally outperforms 9 state-of-the-art competitors in 2 LP tasks on 4 real-world datasets under both identical distribution (ID) and non-ID settings.

            "abstract": "As the number of TV shows increases, designing recommendation systems to provide users with their favorable TV shows becomes more important. In a TV show domain, watching a TV show (i.e., giving implicit feedback to the show) among the TV shows broadcast at the same time frame implies that the currently watching show is the winner in the competition with others (i.e., losers). However, in previous studies, such a notion of limited competitions has not been considered in estimating the user\u2019s preferences for TV shows. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation framework to take this new notion into account based on pair-wise models. Our framework is composed of the following ideas: (i) identify winners and losers by determining pairs of competing TV shows; (ii) learn the pairs of competing TV shows based on the confidence for the pair-wise preference between the winner and the loser; (iii) recommend the most favorable TV shows by considering the time factors with respect to users and TV shows. Using a real-world TV show dataset, our experimental results show that our proposed framework consistently improves the accuracy of recommendation by up to 38%, compared with the best state-of-the-art method.

A successful solution to CLIPP holds significance as it facilitates the distribution of valuable information to a larger audience and prevents the proliferation of misinfor- mation. Notably, solving CLIPP is non-trivial as inter-community relationships and influence are unknown, information spread is multi-modal, and new content and new communities appear over time. In this work, we address CLIPP by collecting large-scale, multi-modal datasets to examine the diffusion of online YouTube videos on Reddit. We analyze these datasets to construct community influence graphs (CIGs) and develop a novel dynamic graph frame- work, INPAC (Information Pathway Across Online Communities), which incorporates CIGs to capture the temporal variability and multi-modal nature of video propagation across communities. Ex- perimental results in both warm-start and cold-start scenarios show that INPAC outperforms seven baselines in CLIPP. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/claws-lab/INPAC",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to predict user preferences by analyzing users' past behavior. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the key techniques employed in recommender systems that uses explicit (e.g., ratings) and implicit (e.g., browsing) feedback from users to predict unknown feedback, providing top-N recommendations. However, CF faces challenges when dealing with sparse data, which can decrease the accuracy of recommendations. To overcome these inherent challenges in recommender systems, this article introduces the concept of \"uninteresting items\" that have not been rated by a user, but are unlikely to be liked even when recommended. We then review our previous works that utilize both positive preferences from rated items and negative preferences from uninteresting items to improve recommendation accuracy. Specifically, we discuss a family of our eight CF methods that are assisted by the uninteresting items: Zero-injection (ZI), l-injection, Imputation, RAGAN, and Deep-ZI, which are designed for explicit feedback, as well as gOCCF, M-BPR, and CNS, which are designed for implicit feedback. Also, we report some evaluation results for showing their effectiveness.",

            "title": "AiRS: A Large-Scale Recommender System at NAVER News",
            "abstract": "Online news providers such as Google News, Bing News, and NAVER News collect a large number of news articles from a variety of presses and distribute these articles to users via their portals. Dynamic nature of a news domain causes the problem of information overload that makes it difficult for a user to find her preferable news articles. Motivated by this situation, NAVER Corp., the largest portal company in South Korea, identified four design considerations (DCs) for news recommendation that reflect the unique characteristics of a news domain. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale news recommender system named as AiRS, present how it jointly leverages the four DCs for NAVER News service. Specifically, AiRS first generates candidate articles for recommendation to a target user based on collaborative filtering (CF), quality estimation (QE), and social impact (SI) models; then, it ranks the candidate articles based on the scores computed by considering their multi-type feature scores (e.g., user's section preference and article's recency), finally recommending the top-$k$ news articles that a target user is likely to prefer. Also, we present how to build the architecture for online deployment of AiRS at NAVER News. Through extensive offline and online A/B tests using the real-world datasets, we validate that AiRS successfully reflects all of the DCs into the news recommendation process, all design choices employed in AiRS help improve the recommendation accuracy, and AiRS significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art news recommendation approaches in terms of accuracy.",
