            "abstract": "In this article, a scheme for estimating system state and sensor fault based on dynamic observer and neural network is proposed for autonomous vehicles. For simultaneous state and sensor fault estimation, the sensor fault is augmented as model state. Since the longitudinal velocity is a time-varying parameter which brings challenges to observer design, the vehicle model is converted to a Takagi-Sugneo (T-S) fuzzy form. Moreover, the modeling uncertainty caused by linearization, unmodeled dynamics, and exogenous disturbance degrades the estimation performance. To cope with the state-estimation problem with modeling uncertainty, a novel scheme is established. This scheme incorporates a neural network to accurately estimate modeling uncertainty, along with a robust dynamic observer to estimate the state of the augmented model with compensation of modeling uncertainty. Finally, simulation and experiment are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. From the comparison results, we find that the proposed scheme has great improvement on estimation accuracy and convergence rate.",

            "abstract": "Tire characteristics highly influence vehicle dynamics and control performances. Although extensive research in tire models has been carried out, a general control-oriented tire model that could be implemented for all road environments has not been thoroughly explored. To deal with this, we propose a general control-oriented tire model considering the effect of friction coefficient, vertical force, and combined slip. Proposed tire model is in linear parameter varying (LPV) form, which facilitates stability analysis and controller design. The number of unknown parameters in proposed tire model is minimized and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) method is adopted to identify the unknown parameters. Comparisons between proposed tire model and tire test data from CarSim validate the accuracy of proposed model. Based on proposed tire model, lateral stability analysis and path-following controller design methods are introduced. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of proposed tire model compared with benchmark tire models.",

            "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress made in learning-based stereo-matching algorithms, it is an open challenge for stereo-matching in disparity discontinuities and textureless regions. In this paper, we propose the deep Markov Random Field based cost aggregation network (DMCA-Net) for stereo matching, which is an end-to-end model-driven network architecture. This architecture introduces an efficient feature extraction network to extract richer textual and contextual feature information for stereo feature similarity representation at multi-stages and levels. Furthermore, with the aim of alleviating the edge-fattening phenomenon at disparity discontinuities and generating accurate disparities in textureless regions, we proposed the differentiable Markov Random Field model for cost aggregation, where the model\u2019s data term utilizes image detail information, such as boundary and contour features, to guide matching cost aggregation, and the model\u2019s smoothness term penalizes the adjacency similarity of the cost between the four-nearest neighboring pixel pairs to predict the disparity in textureless regions. The detailed experiment demonstrates that DMCA network achieves competitive performance on the SceneFlow, KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Middlebury 2014 datasets.",

            "abstract": "To meet the realistic demands of autonomous transportation for quadrotor suspended-payload systems, it is necessary to investigate load trajectory tracking control using only onboard sensing. This article proposes a nonlinear payload trajectory tracking strategy based on the force sensor. The system employs a force sensor to measure the tension on the cable, in conjunction with the position of the quadrotor, to provide a real-time estimate of the payload position. A payload velocity observer is designed to ensure its status is always available. Furthermore, in order to meet the needs of transporting objects of varying weights, the system utilizes data feedback from the force sensor to autonomously adapt to various payload masses. Based on the payload state estimation, a payload trajectory tracking controller that only relies on onboard sensing to achieve outdoor operation is designed. And multiple sets of simulations and real-world outdoor experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the controller. Experimental results show that the proposed control strategy achieves satisfied performance for different payloads and different trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Human-machine mutual trust has become one of the important factors restricting steer-by-wire vehicles due to the removal of mechanical connections. To this end, this article proposes a hierarchical shared steering control framework based on the human-machine mutual trust evaluation. The upper level of the framework aims to evaluate the human-machine mutual trust level. The driver's trust level in the machine is evaluated by the human-machine steering difference. And the machine's trust level in the driver is evaluated by driver skills. The lower level is to dynamically optimize the authority allocation considering varying human-machine mutual trust states. The fuzzy method is adopted to calculate the reference value of the human-machine authority based on the mutual trust level. Through minimizing the lateral acceleration and tracking error, the fuzzy rule database for the authority reference level is further tuned offline. Furthermore, to improve the smoothness of authority transfer and path tracking, the model prediction control is used to optimize the human-machine authority levels online. The proposed authority allocation strategy is verified with the driver-in-the-loop test bench. The results show the effectiveness of improving driving performance under different human-machine mutual trust levels.",

            "abstract": "In the community of automotive millimeter wave radar, the recently developed concept of four-dimensional (4D) radar can provide high-resolution point clouds image with enhanced imaging performance. Currently, the density of point clouds for single-frame image is usually too sparse to satisfy the demands of target classification and recognition due to the limitation of Doppler and angle resolutions. To address the aforementioned issues, a novel algorithm is proposed for 4D high-resolution imagery generation of point clouds with extremely high Doppler and angle resolutions in this paper. For high Doppler resolution with high-dynamic, a novel velocity ambiguity resolution algorithm is proposed using a dual pulse repetition frequency (dual-PRF) waveform design embedded in an innovative time-division multiplexing & Doppler-division multiplexing MIMO (TDM-DDM-MIMO) framework. Meanwhile, an attractive complex-valued deep convolutional network (CV-DCN) of super-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is proposed only using single-frame data. To be specific, a spatial smoothing operator on array data is applied as input of the network, and a CV-DCN is designed to learn the transformation of the spatial spectrum from the end-to-end to effectively protect the spectrum extraction. Furthermore, experimental analysis is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed super-resolution DOA estimation algorithm. Finally, the 4D high-resolution imagery of point clouds is obtained by experiments in the parking lot.",

            "abstract": "A novel deep learning-based proportional multiple-integral (DL-PMI) observer is presented in this article to reconstruct actuator faults of quadrotors. The DL-PMI observer is composed of a deep neural network (DNN) observer, a nonlinear saturation function and a linear-parameter-varying-based PMI observer. The DNN observer is trained to provide an accurate actuator fault estimation, which is then introduced into the PMI observer as a correction term to improve the estimation accuracy. But in some untrained scenarios, the DNN observer estimation results may be inaccurate, leading to the estimation divergence of the DL-PMI observer. To deal with this problem, a nonlinear saturation function is designed to bound the estimation difference between the DNN observer and the PMI observer. Moreover, the PMI observer is designed based on the robust $\\mathcal {H}_\\infty$ method, which guarantees the estimation error of the DL-PMI observer is bounded. Finally, the convergence and robustness of the DL-PMI observer is proved based on Lyapunov theory. The experimental results demonstrate that the DL-PMI observer has higher estimation accuracy for actuator faults than the PMI observer while the convergence can still be guaranteed.",

            "abstract": "The utilization of discrete speech tokens, divided into semantic tokens and acoustic tokens, has been proven superior to traditional acoustic feature mel-spectrograms in terms of naturalness and robustness for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Recent popular models, such as VALL-E and SPEAR-TTS, allow zero-shot speaker adaptation through auto-regressive (AR) continuation of acoustic tokens extracted from a short speech prompt. However, these AR models are restricted to generate speech only in a left-to-right direction, making them unsuitable for speech editing where both preceding and following contexts are provided. Furthermore, these models rely on acoustic tokens, which have audio quality limitations imposed by the performance of audio codec models. In this study, we propose a unified context-aware TTS framework called UniCATS, which is capable of both speech continuation and editing. UniCATS comprises two components, an acoustic model CTX-txt2vec and a vocoder CTX-vec2wav. CTX-txt2vec employs contextual VQ-diffusion to predict semantic tokens from the input text, enabling it to incorporate the semantic context and maintain seamless concatenation with the surrounding context. Following that, CTX-vec2wav utilizes contextual vocoding to convert these semantic tokens into waveforms, taking into consideration the acoustic context. Our experimental results demonstrate that CTX-vec2wav outperforms HifiGAN and AudioLM in terms of speech resynthesis from semantic tokens. Moreover, we show that UniCATS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both speech continuation and editing. Audio samples are available at https://cpdu.github.io/unicats.",

            "abstract": "Multi-channel speech enhancement seeks to utilize spatial information to distinguish target speech from interfering signals. While deep learning approaches like the dual-path convolutional recurrent network (DPCRN) have made strides, challenges persist in effectively modeling inter-channel correlations and amalgamating multi-level information. In response, we introduce the Parallel Dual-Path Convolutional Recurrent Network (PDPCRN). This acoustic modeling architecture has two key innovations. First, a parallel design with separate branches extracts complementary features. Second, bi-directional modules enable cross-branch communication. Together, these facilitate diverse representation fusion and enhanced modeling. Experimental validation on TIMIT datasets underscores the prowess of PDPCRN. Notably, against baseline models like the standard DPCRN, PDPCRN not only outperforms in PESQ and STOI metrics but also boasts a leaner computational footprint with reduced parameters.",
