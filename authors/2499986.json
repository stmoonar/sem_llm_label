            "abstract": "This paper studies a category of visual question answering tasks, in which accessing external knowledge is necessary for answering the questions. This category is called outside-knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA). A major step in developing OK-VQA systems is to retrieve relevant documents for the given multi-modal query. Current state-of-the-art asymmetric dense retrieval model for this task uses an architecture with a multi-modal query encoder and a uni-modal document encoder. Such an architecture requires a large amount of training data for effective performance. We propose an automatic data generation pipeline for pre-training passage retrieval models for OK-VQA tasks. The proposed approach leads to 26.9% Precision@5 improvements compared to the current state-of-the-art asymmetric architecture. Additionally, the proposed pre-training approach exhibits a good ability in zero-shot retrieval scenarios.",

            "abstract": "This paper highlights the importance of personalization in large language models and introduces the LaMP benchmark -- a novel benchmark for training and evaluating language models for producing personalized outputs. LaMP offers a comprehensive evaluation framework with diverse language tasks and multiple entries for each user profile. It consists of seven personalized tasks, spanning three text classification and four text generation tasks. We additionally propose two retrieval augmentation approaches that retrieve personal items from each user profile for personalizing language model outputs. To this aim, we study various retrieval models, including term matching, semantic matching, and time-aware methods. Extensive experiments on LaMP for zero-shot and fine-tuned language models demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed retrieval augmentation approach and highlight the impact of personalization in various natural language tasks.",

            "abstract": "Developing a universal model that can efficiently and effectively respond to a wide range of information access requests-from retrieval to recommendation to question answering---has been a long-lasting goal in the information retrieval community. This paper argues that the flexibility, efficiency, and effectiveness brought by the recent development in dense retrieval and approximate nearest neighbor search have smoothed the path towards achieving this goal. We develop a generic and extensible dense retrieval framework, called framework, that can handle a wide range of (personalized) information access requests, such as keyword search, query by example, and complementary item recommendation. Our proposed approach extends the capabilities of dense retrieval models for ad-hoc retrieval tasks by incorporating user-specific preferences through the development of a personalized attentive network. This allows for a more tailored and accurate personalized information access experience. Our experiments on real-world e-commerce data suggest the feasibility of developing universal information access models by demonstrating significant improvements even compared to competitive baselines specifically developed for each of these individual information access tasks. This work opens up a number of fundamental research directions for future exploration.",

These representations are often in the form of a vector representation and their similarities are often computed using the dot product function. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning framework for dense retrieval. Instead of learning a vector for each query and document, our framework learns a multivariate distribution and uses negative multivariate KL divergence to compute the similarity between distributions. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, we assume that the distributions are multivariate normals and then train large language models to produce mean and variance vectors for these distributions. We provide a theoretical foundation for the proposed framework and show that it can be seamlessly integrated into the existing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms to perform retrieval efficiently. We conduct an extensive suite of experiments on a wide range of datasets, and demonstrate significant improvements compared to competitive dense retrieval models.",

            "title": "Generalized Weak Supervision for Neural Information Retrieval",
            "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have demonstrated effective performance in several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, training NRMs often requires large-scale training data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, one can train NRMs via weak supervision, where a large dataset is automatically generated using an existing ranking model (called the weak labeler) for training NRMs. Weakly supervised NRMs can generalize from the observed data and significantly outperform the weak labeler. This paper generalizes this idea through an iterative re-labeling process, demonstrating that weakly supervised models can iteratively play the role of weak labeler and significantly improve ranking performance without using manually labeled data. The proposed Generalized Weak Supervision (GWS) solution is generic and orthogonal to the ranking model architecture. This paper offers four implementations of GWS: self-labeling, cross-labeling, joint cross- and self-labeling, and greedy multi-labeling. GWS also benefits from a query importance weighting mechanism based on query performance prediction methods to reduce noise in the generated training data. We further draw a theoretical connection between self-labeling and Expectation-Maximization. Our experiments on four retrieval benchmarks suggest that our implementations of GWS lead to substantial improvements compared to weak supervision if the weak labeler is sufficiently reliable.",

            "abstract": "Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which often describe user preferences and context \u2013 this may be used to bootstrap training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we explore a Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) task, where the collection includes documents in multiple languages. We demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art approaches developed for cross-lingual information retrieval to MLIR tasks leads to sub-optimal performance. This is due to the heterogeneous and imbalanced nature of multilingual collections -- some languages are better represented in the collection and some benefit from large-scale training data. To address this issue, we present KD-SPD, a novel soft prompt decoding approach for MLIR that implicitly \"translates'' the representation of documents in different languages into the same embedding space. To address the challenges of data scarcity and imbalance, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy. The teacher model is trained on rich English retrieval data, and by leveraging bi-text data, our distillation framework transfers its retrieval knowledge to the multilingual document encoder. Therefore, our approach does not require any multilingual retrieval training data. Extensive experiments on three MLIR datasets with a total of 15 languages demonstrate that KD-SPD significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all cases. We conduct extensive analyses to show that our method has less language bias and better zero-shot transfer ability towards new languages.",

            "abstract": "Methods for making high-quality recommendations often rely on learning latent representations from interaction data. These methods, while performant, do not provide ready mechanisms for users to control the recommendation they receive. Our work tackles this problem by proposing LACE, a novel concept value bottleneck model for controllable text recommendations. LACE represents each user with a succinct set of human-readable concepts through retrieval given user-interacted documents and learns personalized representations of the concepts based on user documents. This concept based user profile is then leveraged to make recommendations. The design of our model affords control over the recommendations through a number of intuitive interactions with a transparent user profile. We first establish the quality of recommendations obtained from LACE in an offline evaluation on three recommendation tasks spanning six datasets in warm-start, cold-start, and zero-shot setups. Next, we validate the controllability of LACE under simulated user interactions. Finally, we implement LACE in an interactive controllable recommender system and conduct a user study to demonstrate that users are able to improve the quality of recommendations they receive through interactions with an editable user profile.",
