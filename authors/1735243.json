            "abstract": "We work towards a vocabulary to represent processes and temporal logic specifications as graph-structured data. Different fields use incompatible terminologies for describing essentially the same process-related concepts. In addition, processes can be represented from different perspectives and levels of abstraction: both state-centric and event-centric perspectives offer distinct insights into the underlying processes. In this work, we strive to unify the representation of processes and related concepts by leveraging the power of knowledge graphs. We survey approaches to representing processes and reasoning with process descriptions from different fields and provide a selection of scenarios to help inform the scope of a unified representation of processes. We focus on processes that can be executed and observed via web interfaces. We propose to provide a representation designed to combine state-centric and event-centric perspectives while incorporating temporal querying and reasoning capabilities on temporal logic specifications. A standardised vocabulary and representation for processes and temporal specifications would contribute towards bridging the gap between the terminologies from different fields and fostering the broader application of methods involving temporal logics, such as formal verification and program synthesis.",

            "title": "Overcoming Challenges of Synthetic Data Generation",
            "abstract": "There are several shortcomings in current methods of generating synthetic data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). First, they tend to only emulate certain attributes of the original dataset. Second, they do not effectively model unbalanced discrete columns, long tails, or bimodal distributions of continuous columns. Lastly, these approaches often do not consider the potential for information leakage from the generated data. We propose UniformGAN, a GAN with a novel uniform loss function, which addresses these challenges and provides strong privacy guarantees using differential privacy. UniformGAN pre-processes datasets to transpose each column into a uniform distribution. We use a modified Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) architecture in which we replace ReLU activation functions with the more robust SeLU, which has significantly better performance and better convergence properties, and apply Dense-Sparse-Dense training to our network. We also use differential privacy to add noise to the discriminator during training. Along with UniformGAN, we provide a configurable command-line tool to generate and evaluate synthetic datasets on numerous metrics. It allows users to generate synthetic datasets from CTGAN, TableGAN, UniformGAN, or a custom framework and analyze the resultant datasets. This tool will help data scientists and industry users compare different synthetic dataset generation models and enable them to improve existing methods. We evaluated UniformGAN using multiple datasets, including the Adult, Covertype, and Credit Kaggle datasets, as well as two insurance-related Kaggle datasets. The results show that, when used on datatsets containing a large number of continuous columns, UniformGAN out performs other methods by producing synthetic data with similar correlations and distributions as the original dataset while ensuring privacy.",

We demonstrate how Semantic Web and biomedical researchers can utilize Punya to rapidly prototype mobile semantic apps. Apps developed with Punya can consume Linked Data, thus exploiting the vast biomedical data sources available on the Web; while producing RDF from the app for downstream analysis. Researchers can also write semantic rules to encode clinical guideline recommendations in a visual manner within the Punya framework. Due to the intuitive and visual editing environment, researchers can easily tweak complex decision-logic rules.",

            "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) refers to the collaborative training of a model on a dataset where the features of the dataset are split among multiple data owners, while label information is owned by a single data owner. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Multi Vertical Federated Learning (Multi-VFL), to train VFL models when there are multiple data and label owners. Our approach is the first to consider the setting where $D$-data owners (across which features are distributed) and $K$-label owners (across which labels are distributed) exist. This proposed configuration allows different entities to train and learn optimal models without having to share their data. Our framework makes use of split learning and adaptive federated optimizers to solve this problem. For empirical evaluation, we run experiments on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Our results show that using adaptive optimizers for model aggregation fastens convergence and improves accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Complex machines, such as autonomous vehicles, are unable to reconcile conflicting behaviors between their underlying subsystems, which leads to accidents and other negative consequences. Existing approaches to error and anomaly detection are not equipped to detect and mitigate inconsistencies among parts. In this paper, we present \u201cAnomaly Detection through Explanations\u201d or ADE, a multimodal monitoring architecture to reconcile critical discrepancies under uncertainty. ADE uses symbolic explanations as a debugging language, by examining underlying reasons for those decisions. Further, when decisions conflict, our method uses a synthesizer, along with a priority hierarchy, to process subsystem outputs along with their underlying reasons and transparently judges the conflicts. We show the accuracy and performance of ADE on autonomous vehicle scenarios and data, and discuss other error evaluations for future work.",

            "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are deep learning architectures capable of generating synthetic datasets. Despite producing high-quality synthetic images, the default GAN has no control over the kinds of images it generates. The Information Maximizing GAN (InfoGAN) is a variant of the default GAN that introduces feature-control variables that are automatically learned by the framework, hence providing greater control over the different kinds of images produced. Due to the high model complexity of InfoGAN, the generative distribution tends to be concentrated around the training data points. This is a critical problem as the models may inadvertently expose the sensitive and private information present in the dataset. To address this problem, we propose a differentially private version of InfoGAN (DP-InfoGAN). We also extend our framework to a distributed setting (DPD-InfoGAN) to allow clients to learn different attributes present in other clients' datasets in a privacy-preserving manner. In our experiments, we show that both DP-InfoGAN and DPD-InfoGAN can synthesize high-quality images with flexible control over image attributes while preserving privacy.",
