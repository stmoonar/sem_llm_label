            "abstract": "Machine-intelligence has become a driving factor in modern society. However, its demand outpaces the underlying electronic technology due to limitations given by fundamental physics such as capacitive charging of wires, but also by system architecture of storing and handling data, both driving recent trends towards processor heterogeneity. Here we introduce a novel amplitude-only Fourier-optical processor paradigm capable of processing large-scale ~(1,000 x 1,000) matrices in a single time-step and 100 microsecond-short latency. Conceptually, the information-flow direction is orthogonal to the two-dimensional programmable-network, which leverages 10^6-parallel channels of display technology, and enables a prototype demonstration performing convolutions as pixel-wise multiplications in the Fourier domain reaching peta operations per second throughputs. The required real-to-Fourier domain transformations are performed passively by optical lenses at zero-static power. We exemplary realize a convolutional neural network (CNN) performing classification tasks on 2-Megapixel large matrices at 10 kHz rates, which latency-outperforms current GPU and phase-based display technology by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. Training this optical convolutional layer on image classification tasks and utilizing it in a hybrid optical-electronic CNN, shows classification accuracy of 98% (MNIST) and 54% (CIFAR-10). Interestingly, the amplitude-only CNN is inherently robust against coherence noise in contrast to phase-based paradigms and features an over 2 orders of magnitude lower delay than liquid crystal-based systems. Beyond contributing to novel accelerator technology, scientifically this amplitude-only massively-parallel optical compute-paradigm can be far-reaching as it de-validates the assumption that phase-information outweighs amplitude in optical processors for machine-intelligence.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxyl tagging velocimetry (HTV) is characterized for the first time at extended pressures (1 and 3 atm) and temperatures (295 K to 673 K) in an attempt to improve measurement precision for low speed flows. While previous investigations have focused on ambient and flame temperatures (>1400 K), the present study investigates between these two extreme conditions, wherein both the local chemistry and thermodynamic state of the gas may hinder or aid the functionality of the technique. Effects of temperature and pressure on the hydroxyl (OH) excitation spectrum are assessed and compared to simulations to determine the optimal laser frequency, and OH species lifetime and tracer line diffusion are examined to determine the relative efficiency of the photo-dissociation process and the quality of the resulting signal. A two-fold increase in the photo-dissociation efficiency is observed at elevated temperatures. Tag line spread was found to be dominated by shear rather than molecular diffusion. Velocity measurement precision was characterized for time delays ranging from 5 \u03bcs to 3.2 ms and was found to be inversely proportional to the time delay selected, supporting the need for the extended tracer lifetimes observed at higher temperatures when used for lowvelocity applications. Velocity profiles measured in heated jets of nitrogen and air indicate measurement uncertainties as low as 0.1 m s\u22121 (at 68% confidence level), while comparison with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements showed peak deviations in the observed velocity profiles to be less than 2%. The results suggest the high utility of HTV at making measurements in low-velocity flows at moderate temperatures.",

            "abstract": "A joint experimental and numerical campaign is conducted to provide validation dataset of high-fidelity fluid\u2013structure interaction (FSI) models of nuclear fuel assemblies during seismic loading. A refractive index-matched (RIM) flow loop is operated on a six-degree-of-freedom shake table and instrumented with nonintrusive optical diagnostics. The test section can house up to three full-height fuel assemblies. To guarantee reproducible and controlled initial conditions, special care is given to the test section inlet plenum; in particular, it is designed to minimize secondary pulsatile flow that may arise due to ground acceleration. A single transparent surrogate 6\u00d76 fuel subassembly is used near prototypical Reynolds number, Re=105 based on hydraulic diameter. To preserve dynamic similarity of the model with prototype, the main dimensionless parameters are matched and custom spacer grids are designed. Special instruments are developed to characterize fluid and structure response and to operate in this challenging shaking environment. In parallel to the earlier experiments, we also conducted fully coupled direct numerical simulations, where the equations for the fluid and the structure are simultaneously advanced in time using a partitioned scheme. To deal with the highly complex geometrical configuration, which also involves large displacements and deformations, we utilize a second-order accurate, immersed boundary (IB) formulation, where the geometry is immersed in a block-structured grid with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). To explore a wide parametric range, we will consider several subsets of the experimental configuration. A typical computation involves 60,000 cores, on leadership high-performance computing facilities (i.e., IBM Blue-Gene Q\u2013MIRA).",
