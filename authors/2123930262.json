            "title": "Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion",
            "abstract": "Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \\textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.",

            "abstract": "Multiplex influence maximization (MIM) asks us to identify a set of seed users such as to maximize the expected number of influenced users in a multiplex network. MIM has been one of central research topics, especially in nowadays social networking landscape where users participate in multiple online social networks (OSNs) and their influences can propagate among several OSNs simultaneously. Although there exist a couple combinatorial algorithms to MIM, learning-based solutions have been desired due to its generalization ability to heterogeneous networks and their diversified propagation characteristics. In this paper, we introduce MIM-Reasoner, coupling reinforcement learning with probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the complex propagation process within and between layers of a given multiplex network, thereby tackling the most challenging problem in MIM. We establish a theoretical guarantee for MIM-Reasoner as well as conduct extensive analyses on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate our MIM-Reasoner's performance.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing a highly useful, task-agnostic foundation for a wide range of applications. However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging direction critical for large language model applications. First, we propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes the LLM domain-specialization techniques based on the accessibility to LLMs and summarizes the framework for all the subcategories as well as their relations and differences to each other. Second, we present an extensive taxonomy of critical application domains that can benefit dramatically from specialized LLMs, discussing their practical significance and open challenges. Last, we offer our insights into the current research status and future trends in this area.",

Over the past few years, plenty of studies have leveraged various forms of external knowledge to augment the reasoning capabilities of deep models, tackling challenges such as effective knowledge integration, implicit knowledge mining, and problems of tractability and optimization. However, there is a dearth of a comprehensive technical review of the existing knowledge-enhanced reasoning techniques across the diverse range of application domains. This survey provides an in-depth examination of recent advancements in the field, introducing a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing knowledge-enhanced methods into two primary categories and four subcategories. We systematically discuss these methods and highlight their correlations, strengths, and limitations. Finally, we elucidate the current application domains and provide insight into promising prospects for future research.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel DynAttGraph2Seq framework to model complex dynamic transitions of an individual user's activities and the textual information of the posts over time in online health forums and learning how these correspond to his/her health stage. To achieve this, we first formulate the transition of user activities as a dynamic attributed graph with multi-attributed nodes that evolves over time, then formalize the health stage inference task as a dynamic attributed graph to sequence learning problem. Our proposed model consists of a novel dynamic graph encoder along with a two-level sequential encoder to capture the semantic features from user posts and an interpretable sequence decoder that learn the mapping between a sequence of time-evolving user activity graphs as well as user posts to a sequence of target health stages. We go on to propose new dynamic graph regularization and dynamic graph hierarchical attention mechanisms to facilitate the necessary multi-level interpretability. A comprehensive experimental analysis of its use for a health stage prediction task demonstrates both the effectiveness and the interpretability of the proposed models.",

RAPTA offers multiple advantages compared to prior work: 1) It has superior accuracy with errors std ranges 3.9ps~16.05ps in 32nm technology. 2) RAPTA's architecture does not change with feature-set size, 3) RAPTA does not require manual input feature engineering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work, in which Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) representation learning is used to digest raw information for feature engineering, where generation of latent features and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based regression for timing prediction can be trained end-to-end.",

            "title": "DeepGAR: Deep Graph Learning for Analogical Reasoning",
            "abstract": "Analogical reasoning is the process of discovering and mapping correspondences from a target subject to a base subject. As the most well-known computational method of analogical reasoning, Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT) abstracts both target and base subjects into relational graphs and forms the cognitive process of analogical reasoning by finding a corresponding subgraph (i.e., correspondence) in the target graph that is aligned with the base graph. However, incorporating deep learning for SMT is still under-explored due to several obstacles: 1) the combinatorial complexity of searching for the correspondence in the target graph; 2) the correspondence mining is restricted by various cognitive theory-driven constraints. To address both challenges, we propose a novel framework for Analogical Reasoning (DeepGAR) that identifies the correspondence between source and target domains by assuring cognitive theory-driven constraints. Specifically, we design a geometric constraint embedding space to induce subgraph relation from node embeddings for efficient subgraph search. Furthermore, we develop novel learning and optimization strategies that could end-to-end identify correspondences that are strictly consistent with constraints driven by the cognitive theory. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DeepGAR over existing methods.

            "abstract": "Biometric authentication is increasingly being used for large scale human authentication and identification, creating the risk of leaking the biometric secrets of millions of users in the case of database compromise. Powerful \"fuzzy\" cryptographic techniques for biometric template protection, such as secure sketches, could help in principle, but go unused in practice. This is because they would require new biometric matching algorithms with potentially much diminished accuracy. We introduce a new primitive called a multisketch that generalizes secure sketches. Multisketches can work with existing biometric matching algorithms to generate strong cryptographic keys from biometric data reliably. A multisketch works on a biometric database containing multiple biometrics --- e.g., multiple fingerprints --- of a moderately large population of users (say, thousands). It conceals the correspondence between users and their biometric templates, preventing an attacker from learning the biometric data of a user in the advent of a breach, but enabling derivation of user-specific secret keys upon successful user authentication. We design a multisketch over tenprints --- fingerprints of ten fingers --- called TenSketch. We report on a prototype implementation of TenSketch, showing its feasibility in practice. We explore several possible attacks against TenSketch database and show, via simulations with real tenprint datasets, that an attacker must perform a large amount of computation to learn any meaningful information from a stolen TenSketch database.",
