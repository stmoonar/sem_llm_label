            "abstract": "The mission of Just Eat Takeaway is to empower users\u2019 every food moment. A big part of fulfilling that mission is ensuring that we show the right restaurants to the right users. To do this, we design large-scale machine learning recommendation systems that can learn which types of users tend to enjoy which types of restaurants. A crucial part of this process is being able to compare the quality of different recommendation systems, in order to decide which is most effective. The gold standard approach to this evaluation problem is A/B testing allow the different systems to recommend items to randomly selected groups of users, and compare their relative performance. However, A/B testing is both slow, taking time to reach sufficient statistical power, and expensive [5, 1] if we serve poor recommendations to a subset of users. Therefore, evaluating recommender systems in offline fashion without running A/B tests is of significant importance. These offline approaches avoid serving experimental recommenders to users, and instead evaluates them using old online data, where users were served recommendations from a different system. Metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error [2] Mean Average Precision, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hit Rate have been used repeatedly for offline evaluation. All of these evaluation approaches are prone to selection, presentation and position biases [11, 6] and therefore the results from offline evaluation",

In this line, we derive a novel Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and items in an embedded space as well as the preference relation of users over the pairs of items and give theoretical analysis. In addition we contribute to the creation of two novel, publicly available, collections for recommendations that record the behavior of customers of European Leaders in eCommerce advertising, Kelkoofootnote{url{https://www.kelkoo.com/}} and Purchfootnote{label{purch}url{http://www.purch.com/}}. Both datasets gather implicit feedback, in form of clicks, of users, along with a rich set of contextual features regarding both customers and offers. Purch's dataset, is affected by popularity bias. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective strategy on how to overcome the popularity bias introduced while designing an efficient and scalable recommendation algorithm by introducing diversity based on an appropriate representation of items. Further, this collection contains contextual information about offers in form of text. We make use of this textual information in novel time-aware topic models and show the use of topics as contextual information in Factorization Machines that improves performance. In this vein and in conjunction with a detailed description of the datasets, we show the performance of six state-of-the-art recommender models.Keywords.

            "abstract": "Internet advertising has become a major economic challenge for online selling companies that have to optimise their catalogs in real time, in order to propose to users products that fit the best to their interests and preferences. Conventional collaborative filtering engines cannot be applied in this context as there are very few ordinal information, corresponding mainly to past purchases, linking users to the products of their interests. In the other hand relevant information, mainly quantitative, can be obtained from the analyses of user sessions. The particularity of past purchases and the real-value indicators obtained from such analyses is their interdependency and also their nature, as ordinal outputs can be considered as ground truth while real-valued outputs are predicted from user profiling tools and may contain noise. The main objective of this project is to develop the new generation of recommendation system for online advertisement that can handle both ordinal and quantitative information, associating users to products. To attain this goal, we first propose to establish a theoretical framework for multi-target learning for recommendation systems that takes into account the interdependencies between the two types of outputs, relating users to products, and also their nature. The interdependency between the outputs could be studied using the hierarchical decomposition of products and a statistical tool for empirical processes extending the Hoeffding inequality. From this analysis we expect to obtain a transformation allowing to reduce the primal multi-target learning problem into simpler dual multi-label classification and regression problems that will path the way for the development of new generation recommendation engines. The user profiling has to be done using the very few labeled data available and by exploiting the graph of users having the same interest, this requires the development of a graph-based semi-supervised model to propagate information over similar users. The overall model needs to be scalable having very low recommendation time. The thesis is a common project with Kelkoo and Best of Media which will provide the data necessary for developing the framework and the models. For this position, we are looking for highly motivated people, with a passion to work in machine learning, information retrieval and the skills to develop algorithms for prediction in real-life applications. We are looking for an inquisitive mind with the curiosity to use a new and challenging technology that requires a rethinking visual processing to achieve a high payoff in terms of speed and efficiency.",

The learning objective is based on two ranking losses that control the ability of the model to respect the ordering over the items induced from the users preferences, as well as, the capacity of the dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The proposed model is by nature suitable for both implicit and explicit feedback and involves the estimation of only very few parameters. Through extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks, both explicit and implicit, we show the interest of learning the preference and the embedding simultaneously when compared to learning those separately. We also demonstrate that our approach is very competitive with the best state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques proposed independently for explicit and implicit feedback.",

            "abstract": "Social media has become a major source for analyzing all aspects of daily life. Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in using social media to monitor people\u2019s health over time. The use of tweets has several benefits including instantaneous data availability at virtually no cost. Early monitoring of health data is complementary to post-factum studies and enables a range of applications such as measuring behavioral risk factors and triggering health campaigns. We formulate two problems: health transition detection and  health transition prediction. We first propose the Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model (TM\u2013ATAM), a new latent model dedicated to solving the first problem by capturing transitions that involve health-related topics. TM\u2013ATAM is a non-obvious extension to ATAM that was designed to extract health-related topics. It learns health-related topic transitions by minimizing the prediction error on topic distributions between consecutive posts at different time and geographic granularities. To solve the second problem, we develop T\u2013ATAM, a Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model where time is treated as a random variable natively inside ATAM. Our experiments on an 8-month corpus of tweets show that TM\u2013ATAM outperforms TM\u2013LDA in estimating health-related transitions from tweets for different geographic populations. We examine the ability of TM\u2013ATAM to detect transitions due to climate conditions in different geographic regions. We then show how T\u2013ATAM can be used to predict the most important transition and additionally compare T\u2013ATAM with CDC (Center for Disease Control) data and Google Flu Trends.",
