            "title": "A Bi-Objective Approach for Product Recommendations",
            "abstract": "We propose a bi-objective formulation for product recommendations. Our formulation goes beyond traditional recommendations by capturing two conflicting objectives: utility that serves customers\u2019 interests, and profit margin, a business-oriented goal. To satisfy the needs of our business partners, we formulate a new problem, namely generating a result containing all sets of k products such that there does not exist any other set of k products that dominates the returned sets, i.e., whose cumulative values for each objective is higher than a set of k products in the result. We study properties of k-Pareto sets that enable us to reduce the number of candidates, as well as the number of dominance tests between candidate sets. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that leverages those properties to prune the space of solutions. We generalize traditional measures of recommendation accuracy to be applicable to sets of k products. Our experiments on a large set of real customer transactions validate the need for a bi-objective optimization to reconcile customer and business interests, and the scalability of our solution.",

            "abstract": "The SoC-Trace project aims to develop a set of methods and tools based on execution traces of multicore embedded applications to meet the growing needs of observability and 'debogability' required by the industry. The project aims in particular the development of new analytical methods, based on different data analysis techniques such as probabilistic analysis, data mining, and data aggregation. They should allow the automatic identification of anomalies, the analysis of complex correlations and dependencies between different components of an embedded application and control of the volume traces that can now exceed the gigabyte. The aim of the thesis is to provide a high-level representation of information in the trace based semantics. It will initially develop an effective tool for comparing traces, to define a semantic distance for execution traces, then a second time to analyze and interpret the results of comparisons of traces based on the defined distance.",

            "title": "SOCLE: Towards a framework for data preparation in social applications",
            "abstract": "The web has evolved from a technological platform to a real social milieu thereby be- coming a continuous source of Big Social Data (BSD). BSD is characterized by a combination of factual content such as the coordinates of a restaurant, the content of a webpage or the title of a movie, behavior data such as exchanges between social relationships, as well as subjective data such as users' opinions, reviews, and tags. The goal of a social application is to analyze BSD and process it in order to understand it and transform it into valuable content to users. Building social applications requires an essential data preparation step during which raw BSD is sanitized, normalized, enriched, pruned, and transformed making it readily available for fur- ther processing. We argue for the need to formalize data preparation and develop appropriate tools to enable easy prototyping of social applications. We describe SOCLE, our framework for BSD preparation. We provide an architecture inspired from typical social applications, the state of the art of existing languages and algebras for manipulating BSD, and the scientific challenges and opportunities underlying the development of SOCLE.

            "abstract": "Execution traces have become essential resources that many developers analyze to debug their applications. Ideally, a developer wants to quickly detect whether there are anomalies on his application or not. However, in practice, the size of multimedia applications trace can reach gigabytes, which makes their exploitation very complex. Usually, developers use visualization tools before stating a hypothesis. In this paper, we argue that this solution is not satisfactory and propose to automatically provide a diagnosis by comparing execution traces. We use distance-based models and conduct a user case to show how TED, our automatic trace diagnosis tool, provides semantic added-value information to the developer. Performance evaluation over real world data shows that our approach is scalable.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of multimedia application traces can reveal important information to enhance program execution comprehension. However typical size of traces can be in gigabytes, which hinders their effective exploitation by application developers. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of sequences of events that allows a reduced-size rewriting of the original trace. These sequences of events, that we call blocks, can simplify the exploration of large execution traces by allowing application developers to see an abstraction instead of low-level events. The problem of computing such set of blocks is NP-hard and naive approaches lead to prohibitive running times that prevent analysing real world traces. We propose a novel algorithm that directly mines the set of blocks. Our experiments show that our algorithm can analyse real traces of up to two hours of video. We also show experimentally the quality of the set of blocks proposed, and the interest of the rewriting to understand actual trace data.",

However traces can be very large, which hinders their effective exploitation. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a k-golden set of blocks that best characterize data. Sequential pattern mining can help to automatically discover the blocks, and we called k-golden set, a set of k blocks that maximally covers the trace. These kind of blocks can simplify the exploration of large traces by allowing programmers to see an abstraction instead of low-level events. We propose an approach for mining golden blocks and finding coverage of frames. The experiments carried out on video and audio application decoding show very promising results.",
