            "title": "Hybrid Structured and Similarity Queries over Wikidata plus Embeddings with Kypher-V",
            "abstract": "Augmenting large knowledge graphs such as Wikidata with unstructured sources represented by embedding vectors is important for a number of applications, such as similarity-based search, recommendation systems, question answering, entity linking, etc. However, building such hybrid systems today requires ad hoc combinations of disparate technologies such as structured query languages with approximate nearest neighbor search, since there are no truly hybrid query systems available aimed at simultaneously querying large knowledge graphs and vector data. Moreover, similarity search over large vector data is very resource and main-memory intensive requiring high-end compute servers with large amounts of RAM. This paper introduces Kypher-V , an extension to KGTK\u2019s Kypher query language and processor, that allows users to augment Wikidata and other KGs with large-scale vector data and efficiently query it through a hybrid query system using a structured query language based on Cypher. We show that Kypher-V can efficiently store, index and query 40M 1024-d vectors and effectively filter and join results with Wikidata-size datasets on a laptop.",

            "abstract": "Application developers today have three choices for exploiting the knowledge present in Wikidata: they can download the Wikidata dumps in JSON or RDF format, they can use the Wikidata API to get data about individual entities, or they can use the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint. None of these methods can support complex, yet common, query use cases, such as retrieval of large amounts of data or aggregations over large fractions of Wikidata. This paper introduces KGTK Kypher, a query language and processor that allows users to create personalized variants of Wikidata on a laptop. We present several use cases that illustrate the types of analyses that Kypher enables users to run on the full Wikidata KG on a laptop, combining data from external resources such as DBpedia. The Kypher queries for these use cases run much faster on a laptop than the equivalent SPARQL queries on a Wikidata clone running on a powerful server with 24h time-out limits.",

At the core of our approach is a process of anti-error compounding which identifies likely redundant extractions that are based on at least partially independent evidence, and aggregates them into more reliable results exploiting the redundancies. We use mention overlap, string matching and within and cross-document coreference provided by an EDL system to determine likely equivalent extractions. We also exploit relative system performance estimates based on preliminary scoring or past performance where available. Our system does not require any training. By merging the top-5 recall KBs created by different teams based on preliminary score estimates distributed with the TAC-KBP 2016 SFV evaluation package, our system improved the best overall English SF-All-Micro f1 score for Hop-0 queries from 0.319 to 0.350, and for Hop-0+1 queries from 0.270 to 0.286. For Spanish and Chinese we could not create any improvements due to a lack of run diversity for Spanish and a token-based name and value matcher that was not working sufficiently for Chinese.",

KRes is a logic-based inference system aimed at improving statistical relation extraction by deduction and abduction inference towards the best document-level interpretation. For the 2015 evaluation we focused on transitioning our English Slot Filling system used in TACKBP 2014 to the more complex Cold Start Knowledge Base Population task. Our 2015 system has some slightly improved slot-filling coverage of 22 slots (as compared to 19 from last year, not counting inverses), and an improved f1=0.24 measured on a 50 query slot filling test set from TAC-KBP 2012 compared to 0.212 of our 2014 system. We used RPI\u2019s Name Clustering toolkit to perform cross-document entity detection. The integration of clustered entities with entities linked by the UIUC Wikifier did not get ready in time for the evaluation, hence, our submission is a baseline that we are currently improving upon by adding additional inference and linking functionality. Our combined (ALL) scores were f1=0.0938 (LDC MAX Micro) and 0.0517 (SF Micro). Our system produced good precision but low recall due to our only partial coverage of slot types and the preliminary nature of our entity linking component.",

In this position paper, we draw from examples in a small number of biomedical domains to advocate the importance of developing systems based primarily on scientific evidence rather than interpretations. As an explanatory methodology, we base this argument primarily on a worked example from a cancer biology study and previous work in knowledge engineering. We emphasize how interpretative models that form the basis of scientific theories are themselves created to fit, explain and predict experimental data. Within an empiricallydriven field such as biomedicine, scientists typically use a rich, intuitive understanding of experimental methodology directly in their work and developing methods to incorporate that expertise into informatics systems remains a challenging but important goal.",

            "title": "RIPTIDE: Learning violation prediction models from boarding activity data",
            "abstract": "Part of the U.S. Coast Guard's mission is to monitor vessels and their operators for compliance with a large body of safety and fisheries regulations. Recently the Coast Guard has devised a system called OPTIDE, which aims at improving operations efficiency by ranking vessels via a risk score computed from current information and aggregated past boarding observations. Ships with higher risk should be preferentially boarded, since they have higher probability of being in violation of some regulation. To improve upon OPTIDE, we developed RIPTIDE which uses machine learning to automatically learn a more fine-grained and data-driven violation prediction and ranking model from past boarding activity data. The learning problem is challenging, since the data is very unbalanced (only about 20% of all boardings actually find some violation), it has significant sampling bias, and in general the signal for predicting violations is weak. Nevertheless, our best RIPTIDE model outperforms OPTIDE by up to 86% on a ranking experiment. The main reason for this improvement comes from being able to distinguish vessels in a more fine-grained manner, which allows RIPTIDE to make winning decisions more often, even if the underlying signal is very weak. A software package implementing RIPTIDE has been developed to allow the Coast Guard to experiment with the learned models and apply them to operational data.",
