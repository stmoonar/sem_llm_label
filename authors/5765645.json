            "abstract": "Large language models~(LLM) like ChatGPT have become indispensable to artificial general intelligence~(AGI), demonstrating excellent performance in various natural language processing tasks. In the real world, graph data is ubiquitous and an essential part of AGI and prevails in domains like social network analysis, bioinformatics and recommender systems. The training corpus of large language models often includes some algorithmic components, which allows them to achieve certain effects on some graph data-related problems. However, there is still little research on their performance on a broader range of graph-structured data. In this study, we conduct an extensive investigation to assess the proficiency of LLMs in comprehending graph data, employing a diverse range of structural and semantic-related tasks. Our analysis encompasses 10 distinct tasks that evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in graph understanding. Through our study, we not only uncover the current limitations of language models in comprehending graph structures and performing associated reasoning tasks but also emphasize the necessity for further advancements and novel approaches to enhance their graph processing capabilities. Our findings contribute valuable insights towards bridging the gap between language models and graph understanding, paving the way for more effective graph mining and knowledge extraction.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is an important research direction in recommender systems that aims to make recommendations given the information on user-item interactions. Graph CF has attracted more and more attention in recent years due to its effectiveness in leveraging high-order information in the user-item bipartite graph for better recommendations. Specifically, recent studies show the success of graph neural networks (GNN) for CF is attributed to its low-pass filtering effects. However, current researches lack a study of how different signal components contributes to recommendations, and how to design strategies to properly use them well. To this end, from the view of spectral transformation, we analyze the important factors that a graph filter should consider to achieve better performance. Based on the discoveries, we design JGCF, an efficient and effective method for CF based on Jacobi polynomial bases and frequency decomposition strategies. Extensive experiments on four widely used public datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods, which brings at most 27.06% performance gain on Alibaba-iFashion. Besides, the experimental results also show that JGCF is better at handling sparse datasets, which shows potential in making recommendations for cold-start users.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of the World Wide Web (WWW), heterogeneous graphs (HG) have explosive growth. Recently, heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) has shown great potential in learning on HG. Current studies of HGNN mainly focus on some HGs with strong homophily properties (nodes connected by meta-path tend to have the same labels), while few discussions are made in those that are less homophilous. Recently, there have been many works on homogeneous graphs with heterophily. However, due to heterogeneity, it is non-trivial to extend their approach to deal with HGs with heterophily. In this work, based on empirical observations, we propose a meta-path-induced metric to measure the homophily degree of a HG. We also find that current HGNNs may have degenerated performance when handling HGs with less homophilous properties. Thus it is essential to increase the generalization ability of HGNNs on non-homophilous HGs. To this end, we propose HDHGR, a homophily-oriented deep heterogeneous graph rewiring approach that modifies the HG structure to increase the performance of HGNN. We theoretically verify HDHGR. In addition, experiments on real-world HGs demonstrate the effectiveness of HDHGR, which brings at most more than 10% relative gain.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the user's next action based on the ongoing sessions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in modeling the user preference evolution to capture the fine-grained user interests. While latent user preferences behind the sessions drift continuously over time, most existing approaches still model the temporal session data in discrete state spaces, which are incapable of capturing the fine-grained preference evolution and result in sub-optimal solutions. To this end, we propose Graph Nested GRU ordinary differential equation (ODE), namely GNG-ODE, a novel continuum model that extends the idea of neural ODEs to continuous-time temporal session graphs. The proposed model preserves the continuous nature of dynamic user preferences, encoding both temporal and structural patterns of item transitions into continuous-time dynamic embeddings. As the existing ODE solvers do not consider graph structure change and thus cannot be directly applied to the dynamic graph, we propose a time alignment technique, called t-Alignment, to align the updating time steps of the temporal session graphs within a batch. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that GNG-ODE significantly outperforms other baselines.",

            "title": "Efficiently Leveraging Multi-level User Intent for Session-based Recommendation via Atten-Mixer Network",
            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the user's next action based on short and dynamic sessions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in utilizing various elaborately designed graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the pair-wise relationships among items, seemingly suggesting the design of more complicated models is the panacea for improving the empirical performance. However, these models achieve relatively marginal improvements with exponential growth in model complexity. In this paper, we dissect the classical GNN-based SBR models and empirically find that some sophisticated GNN propagations are redundant, given the readout module plays a significant role in GNN-based models. Based on this observation, we intuitively propose to remove the GNN propagation part, while the readout module will take on more responsibility in the model reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Multi-Level Attention Mixture Network (Atten-Mixer), which leverages both concept-view and instance-view readouts to achieve multi-level reasoning over item transitions. As simply enumerating all possible high-level concepts is infeasible for large real-world recommender systems, we further incorporate SBR-related inductive biases, i.e., local invariance and inherent priority to prune the search space. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal. We also have already launched the proposed techniques to a large-scale e-commercial online service since April 2021, with significant improvements of top-tier business metrics demonstrated in the online experiments on live traffic.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next action based on previous actions in the current session. The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph (MIHSG) which captures the interactions between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking (IFR) module to compose the recommendation results from various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods, we achieve as large as 10.21% gain on HR@20 and 15.53% gain on MRR@20.",
