            "title": "KGTrust: Evaluating Trustworthiness of SIoT via Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Social Internet of Things (SIoT), a promising and emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (i.e., things), paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation. Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward way such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node characteristics, which ignores the valuable semantic knowledge attached to nodes. Moreover, the underlying structure of SIoT is usually complex, including both the heterogeneous graph structure and pairwise trust relationships, which renders hard to preserve the properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. To address these aforementioned problems, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced graph neural network (KGTrust) for better trust evaluation in SIoT. Specifically, we first extract useful knowledge from users\u2019 comment behaviors and external structured triples related to object descriptions, in order to gain a deeper insight into the semantics of users and objects. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative convolutional layer that utilizes heterogeneous graph structure, node semantics, and augmented trust relationships to learn node embeddings from the perspective of a user as a trustor or a trustee, effectively capturing multi-aspect properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. Finally, a trust prediction layer is developed to estimate the trust relationships between pairwise nodes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of KGTrust over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Graph Neural Network for Higher-Order Dependency Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) has become a popular tool to analyze the graph data. Existing GNNs only focus on networks with first-order dependency, that is, conventional networks following the Markov property. However, many networks in real life own the higher-order dependency, such as click-stream data where the choice of the next page depends not only on the current page but also on previous pages. This kind of sequential data from complex systems (including natural dependencies) are often ignored by existing GNNs which makes them ineffective. To address this problem, we propose for the first time new GNN approaches for higher-order networks in this paper. First, we form sequence fragments by the current node and its predecessor nodes of different orders as candidate higher-order dependencies. When the fragment significantly affects the probability distribution of different successor nodes of the current node, we include it in the higher-order dependency set. We formulize the network with higher-order dependency as an augmented conventional first-order network, and then feed it into GNNs to derive network embeddings. Moreover, we further propose a new end-to-end GNN framework for dealing with higher-order networks directly in the model. Specifically, the higher-order dependency is used as the neighbor aggregation controller when the node is embedded and updated. In the graph convolutional layer, in addition to the first-order neighbor information, we also aggregate the middle node information from the higher-order dependency segment. We finally test the new approaches on three real networks with higher-order dependency, and compare with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show significant improvements of the new approaches which consider higher-order dependency.",
