            "abstract": "The field of fair AI aims to counter biased algorithms through computational modelling. However, it faces increasing criticism for perpetuating the use of overly technical and reductionist methods. As a result, novel approaches appear in the field to address more socially-oriented and interdisciplinary (SOI) perspectives on fair AI. In this paper, we take this dynamic as the starting point to study the tension between computer science (CS) and SOI research. By drawing on STS and CSCW theory, we position fair AI research as a matter of 'organizational alignment': what makes research 'doable' is the successful alignment of three levels of work organization (the social world, the laboratory, and the experiment). Based on qualitative interviews with CS researchers, we analyze the tasks, resources, and actors required for doable research in the case of fair AI. We find that CS researchers engage with SOI research to some extent, but organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of SOI research for them. Based on our findings, we identify and discuss problems for aligning CS and SOI as fair AI continues to evolve.",

            "abstract": "With increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous. AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and (moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns.",

            "abstract": "This Manifesto was produced from the Perspectives Workshop 18262 entitled \u201c10 Years of Web Science\u201d that took place at Schloss Dagstuhl from June 24 \u2013 29, 2018. At the Workshop, we revisited the origins of Web Science, explored the challenges and opportunities of the Web, and looked ahead to potential futures for both the Web and Web Science. We explain issues that society faces in the Web by the ambivalences that are inherent in the Web. All the enormous benefits that the Web offers \u2013 for information sharing, collective organization and distributed activity, social inclusion and economic growth \u2013 will always carry along negative consequences, too, and 30 years after its creation negative consequences of the Web are only too apparent. The Web continues to evolve and its next major step will involve Artificial Intelligence (AI) at large. AI has the potential to amplify positive and negative outcomes, and we explore these possibilities, situating them within the wider debate about the future of regulation and governance for the Web. Finally, we outline the need to extend Web Science as the science that is devoted to the analysis and engineering of the Web, to strengthen our role in shaping the future of the Web and present five key directions for capacity building that are necessary to achieve this: (i) , supporting interdisciplinarity, (ii) , supporting collaboration, (iii) , supporting the sustainable Web, (iv) , supporting the Intelligent Web, and (v) , supporting the Inclusive Web. Our writing reflects our background in several disciplines of the social and technical sciences and that these disciplines emphasize topics to various extents. We are acutely aware that our observations occupy a particular point in time and are skewed towards our experience as Western scholars \u2013 a limitation that Web Science will need to overcome.",

Companies use these data to optimize their services or products, but these data are also of interest to researchers studying human behavior. As most of these data are owned by private companies and their collection requires adherence to their terms of service, research with digital trace data often entails some form of public-private partnership. Private companies and academic researchers each have their own interests, some of which are shared, while others may conflict. In this article, we explore different types of private-public partnerships for research with digital trace data. Based on general considerations and particular experiences from a research project with linked digital trace data, we propose strategies for identifying and productively negotiating both shared and conflicting interests in these relationships.",

            "abstract": "This perspective article suggests considering the everyday research data management work required to accomplish social media research along different phases in a data lifecycle to inform the ongoing discussion of social media research data\u2019s quality and validity. Our perspective is informed by practical experience of archiving social media data, by results from a series of qualitative interviews with social media researchers, as well as by recent literature in the field. We emphasize how social media researchers are entangled in complexities between social media platform providers, social media users, other actors, as well as legal and ethical frameworks, that all affect their everyday research practices. Research design decisions are made iteratively at different stages, involving many decisions that may potentially impact the quality of research. We show that these decisions are often hidden, but that making them visible allows us to better understand what drives social media research into specific directions. Consequently, we argue that untangling and documenting choices during the research lifecycle, especially when researchers pursue specific approaches and may have actively decided against others (often due to external factors) is necessary and will help to spot and address structural challenges in the social media research ecosystem that go beyond critiques of individual opportunistic approaches to easily accessible data.",

When using the internet as a tool or a space of research web scientists are confronted with a continuously expanding set of ethical dilemmas. Participants of the tutorial will actively engage with concrete example cases of common, not so common, tricky, interesting and puzzling ethical dilemmas. Some in-depth ethical thinking and theory, as well as very practical and creative solutions, will be explored. Participants will also have the chance to bring their own questions or ethical dilemmas to the workshop (it will be possible to 'submit' cases in advance to be discussed in an ethics 'clinic') for discussion and help to find solutions.",

            "abstract": "Sharing social media research datasets allows for reproducibility and peer-review, but it is very often difficult or even impossible to achieve due to legal restrictions and can also be ethically questionable. What is more, research data repositories and other research infrastructure and research support institutions are only starting to target social media researchers. In this paper, we present a practical solution to sharing social media data with the help of a social science data archive. Our aim is to contribute to the effort of enhancing comparability and reproducibility in social media research by taking some first steps towards setting standards for sustainable data archiving. We present a showcase for sharing social media data with the example of a big dataset containing geotagged tweets (several months of continued geotagged tweets from the United States from 2014 and 2015; nearly half a billion tweets in total) through a research data archive. We provide a general background to the process of long-term archiving of research data. After some consideration of the current obstacles for sharing and archiving social media data, we present our solution of archiving the specific dataset of geotagged tweets at the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences, a publicly funded German data archive for secure and long-term archiving of social science data. We archived and documented tweet IDs and additional information to improve reproducibility of the initial research while also attending to ethical and legal considerations, and taking into account Twitter\u2019s terms of service in particular.",

            "abstract": "Organizational factors influence the success of security initiatives in software development. Security audits and developer training can motivate development teams to adopt security practices, but their interplay with organizational structures and routines remains unclear. We studied how security consultancy affected organizational routines in a software development group. Security consultants tested their product, reported vulnerabilities, and delivered a security training. We followed the group during and after consultancy events. As a result of the consultancy, group members improved their understanding of security issues, but could not effect a change of routines within the given organizational structure. They handled vulnerabilities in a stabilization routine without changes in feature development, where security remained intangible. Interestingly, group members acknowledged an unfulfilled need for change but defended the structure inhibiting change. Security initiatives need to consider this interplay of structure and situated practice, and manage change in addition to providing expertise and tools.",
