            "title": "MultiLexBATS: Multilingual Dataset of Lexical Semantic Relations",
            "abstract": "Understanding the relation between the meanings of words is an important part of comprehending natural language. Prior work has either focused on analysing lexical semantic relations in word embeddings or probing pretrained language models (PLMs), with some exceptions. Given the rarity of highly multilingual benchmarks, it is unclear to what extent PLMs capture relational knowledge and are able to transfer it across languages. To start addressing this question, we propose MultiLexBATS, a multilingual parallel dataset of lexical semantic relations adapted from BATS in 15 languages including low-resource languages, such as Bambara, Lithuanian, and Albanian. As experiment on cross-lingual transfer of relational knowledge, we test the PLMs\u2019 ability to (1) capture analogies across languages, and (2) predict translation targets. We find considerable differences across relation types and languages with a clear preference for hypernymy and antonymy as well as romance languages.",

            "title": "DICE: a Dataset of Italian Crime Event news",
            "abstract": "Extracting events from news stories as the aim of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications (e.g., question answering, news recommendation, news summarization) is not a trivial task, due to the complexity of natural language and the fact that news reporting is characterized by journalistic style and norms. Those aspects entail scattering an event description over several sentences within one document (or more documents), applying a mechanism of gradual specification of event-related information. This implies a widespread use of co-reference relations among the textual elements, conveying non-linear temporal information. In addition to this, despite the achievement of state-of-the-art results in several tasks, high-quality training datasets for non-English languages are rarely available. This paper presents our preliminary study to develop an annotated Dataset for Italian Crime Event news (DICE). The contribution of the paper are: (1) the creation of a corpus of 10,395 crime news; (2) the annotation schema; (3) a dataset of 10,395 news with automatic annotations; (4) a preliminary manual annotation using the proposed schema of 1000 documents. The first tests on DICE have compared the performance of a manual annotator with that of single-span and multi-span question answering models and shown there is still a gap in the models, especially when dealing with more complex annotation tasks and limited training data. This underscores the importance of investing in the creation of high-quality annotated datasets like DICE, which can provide a solid foundation for training and testing a wide range of NLP models.",

In particular it focused on four core tasks in the production/publication of linked data: generation, interlinking, publication, and validation. We discuss the importance of GLs and BPs for LLD before describing the survey and its results in full.
