            "title": "Learning Multi-granularity Consecutive User Intent Unit for Session-based Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next action based on previous actions in the current session. The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph (MIHSG) which captures the interactions between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking (IFR) module to compose the recommendation results from various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods, we achieve as large as 10.21% gain on HR@20 and 15.53% gain on MRR@20.",

            "abstract": "Graph Attention Network (GAT) focuses on modelling simple undirected and single relational graph data only. This limits its ability to deal with more general and complex multi-relational graphs that contain entities with directed links of different labels (e.g., knowledge graphs). Therefore, directly applying GAT on multi-relational graphs leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose r-GAT, a relational graph attention network to learn multi-channel entity representations. Specifically, each channel corresponds to a latent semantic aspect of an entity. This enables us to aggregate neighborhood information for the current aspect using relation features. We further propose a query-aware attention mechanism for subsequent tasks to select useful aspects. Extensive experiments on link prediction and entity classification tasks show that our r-GAT can model multi-relational graphs effectively. Also, we show the interpretability of our approach by case study.",

            "title": "Graph-based Regularization on Embedding Layers for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Neural networks have been extensively used in recommender systems. Embedding layers are not only necessary but also crucial for neural models in recommendation as a typical discrete task. In this article, we argue that the widely used l2 regularization for normal neural layers (e.g., fully connected layers) is not ideal for embedding layers from the perspective of regularization theory in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. More specifically, the l2 regularization corresponds to the inner product and the distance in the Euclidean space where correlations between discrete objects (e.g., items) are not well captured. Inspired by this observation, we propose a graph-based regularization approach to serve as a counterpart of the l2 regularization for embedding layers. The proposed regularization incurs almost no extra computational overhead especially when being trained with mini-batches. We also discuss its relationships to other approaches (namely, data augmentation, graph convolution, and joint learning) theoretically. We conducted extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets from various domains with two state-of-the-art recommendation models. Results show that given a kNN (k-nearest neighbor) graph constructed directly from training data without external information, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the l2 regularization on all the datasets and achieves more notable improvements for long-tail users and items.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the embedding-based recommendation models (e.g., matrix factorization and deep models) have been prevalent in both academia and industry due to their effectiveness and flexibility. However, they also have such intrinsic limitations as lacking explainability and suffering from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end joint learning framework to get around these limitations without introducing any extra overhead by distilling structured knowledge from a differentiable path-based recommendation model. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art recommendation performance and meanwhile provide interpretable recommendation reasons.",
