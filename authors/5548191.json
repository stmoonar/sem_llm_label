            "abstract": "Recording the provenance of scientific computation results is key to the support of traceability, reproducibility and quality assessment of data products. Several data models have been explored to address this need, providing representations of workflow plans and their executions as well as means of packaging the resulting information for archiving and sharing. However, existing approaches tend to lack interoperable adoption across workflow management systems. In this work we present Workflow Run RO-Crate, an extension of RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) and Schema.org to capture the provenance of the execution of computational workflows at different levels of granularity and bundle together all their associated objects (inputs, outputs, code, etc.). The model is supported by a diverse, open community that runs regular meetings, discussing development, maintenance and adoption aspects. Workflow Run RO-Crate is already implemented by several workflow management systems, allowing interoperable comparisons between workflow runs from heterogeneous systems. We describe the model, its alignment to standards such as W3C PROV, and its implementation in six workflow systems. Finally, we illustrate the application of Workflow Run RO-Crate in two use cases of machine learning in the digital image analysis domain.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Understanding life cannot be accomplished without making full use of biological data, which are scattered across databases of diverse categories in life sciences. To connect such data seamlessly, identifier (ID) conversion plays a key role. However, existing ID conversion services have disadvantages, such as covering only a limited range of biological categories of databases, not keeping up with the updates of the original databases and outputs being hard to interpret in the context of biological relations, especially when converting IDs in multiple steps. Results TogoID is an ID conversion service implementing unique features with an intuitive web interface and an application programming interface (API) for programmatic access. TogoID currently supports 65 datasets covering various biological categories. TogoID users can perform exploratory multistep conversions to find a path among IDs. To guide the interpretation of biological meanings in the conversions, we crafted an ontology that defines the semantics of the dataset relations. Availability and implementation The TogoID service is freely available on the TogoID website (https://togoid.dbcls.jp/) and the API is also provided to allow programmatic access. To encourage developers to add new dataset pairs, the system stores the configurations of pairs at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/togoid/togoid-config) and accepts the request of additional pairs. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

            "abstract": "Abstract ChIP-Atlas (https://chip-atlas.org) is a web service providing both GUI- and API-based data-mining tools to reveal the architecture of the transcription regulatory landscape. ChIP-Atlas is powered by comprehensively integrating all data sets from high-throughput ChIP-seq and DNase-seq, a method for profiling chromatin regions accessible to DNase. In this update, we further collected all the ATAC-seq and whole-genome bisulfite-seq data for six model organisms (human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, nematode, and budding yeast) with the latest genome assemblies. These together with ChIP-seq data can be visualized with the Peak Browser tool and a genome browser to explore the epigenomic landscape of a query genomic locus, such as its chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation status, and protein\u2013genome interactions. This epigenomic landscape can also be characterized for multiple genes and genomic loci by querying with the Enrichment Analysis tool, which, for example, revealed that inflammatory bowel disease-associated SNPs are the most significantly hypo-methylated in neutrophils. Therefore, ChIP-Atlas provides a panoramic view of the whole epigenomic landscape. All datasets are free to download via either a simple button on the web page or an API.",

            "abstract": "Validating RDF data becomes necessary in order to ensure data compliance against the conceptualization model it follows, e.g., schema or ontology behind the data, and improve data consistency and completeness. There are different approaches to validate RDF data, for instance, JSON schema, particularly for data in JSONLD format, as well as Shape Expression and Shapes Constraint Language, which can be used with other serialization as well, e.g., RDF/XML or Turtle. Currently, no validation approach is prevalent regarding others, selection commonly depends on data characteristics, background knowledge and personal preferences . In some cases, the approaches are interchangeable; however, that is not always the case, making it necessary to identify a subset among them that can be seamlessly translated from one to another. During the NBDC/DBCLS 2019 BioHackathon, we worked on a variety of topics related to RDF data validation, including (i) development of ShEx shapes for a number of datasets, (ii) development of a tool to semi-automatically create ShEx shapes, (iii) improvements to the RDFShape tool, and (iv) enabling validation schema conversion from one format to the other. Here we report on our BioHackathon achievements.",

            "abstract": "Publishing databases in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) model is becoming widely accepted to maximize the syntactic and semantic interoperability of open data in life sciences. Here we report advancements made in the 6th and 7th annual BioHackathons which were held in Tokyo and Miyagi respectively. This review consists of two major sections covering: 1) improvement and utilization of RDF data in various domains of the life sciences and 2) meta-data about these RDF data, the resources that store them, and the service quality of SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints. The first section describes how we developed RDF data, ontologies and tools in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics and by literature text mining. The second section describes how we defined descriptions of datasets, the provenance of data, and quality assessment of services and service discovery. By enhancing the harmonization of these two layers of machine-readable data and knowledge, we improve the way community wide resources are developed and published. \u00a0Moreover, we outline best practices for the future, and prepare ourselves for an exciting and unanticipatable variety of real world applications in coming years.",

The previous article showed an introduction to the Galaxy system and the basic usage of the public Galaxy server \u201cGalaxy Main.\u201d In this article, using the last article\u2019s results, we present the features to share the analysis results (history) with the other users, or ones to apply the analysis procedures (workflow) to the other data. We also show the useful Galaxy\u2019s features such as copying data across histories, or the direct data import from remote servers. We found a compatibility issue on Internet Explorer with the Galaxy system. Thus we recommend using Google Chrome or Firefox to try the procedures we show in this article.

ChIP\u2010Atlas is able to show alignment and peak\u2010call results for all public ChIP\u2010seq and DNase\u2010seq data archived in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), which encompasses data derived from GEO, ArrayExpress, DDBJ, ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and the scientific literature. All peak\u2010call data are integrated to visualize multiple histone modifications and binding sites of transcriptional regulators (TRs) at given genomic loci. The integrated data can be further analyzed to show TR\u2013gene and TR\u2013TR interactions, as well as to examine enrichment of protein binding for given multiple genomic coordinates or gene names. ChIP\u2010Atlas is superior to other platforms in terms of data number and functionality for data mining across thousands of ChIP\u2010seq experiments, and it provides insight into gene regulatory networks and epigenetic mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Background Container virtualization technologies such as Docker became popular in the bioinformatics domain as they improve portability and reproducibility of software deployment. Along with software packaged in containers, the workflow description standards Common Workflow Language also enabled to perform data analysis on multiple different computing environments with ease. These technologies accelerate the use of on-demand cloud computing platform which can scale out according to the amount of data. However, to optimize the time and the budget on a use of cloud, users need to select a suitable instance type corresponding to the resource requirements of their workflows. Results We developed CWL-metrics, a system to collect runtime metrics of Docker containers and workflow metadata to analyze resource requirement of workflows. We demonstrated the analysis by using seven transcriptome quantification workflows on six instance types. The result showed instance type options of lower financial cost and faster execution time with required amount of computational resources. Conclusions The summary of resource requirements of workflow executions provided by CWL-metrics can help users to optimize the selection of cloud computing instance. The runtime metrics data also accelerate to share workflows among different workflow management frameworks.",

            "title": "DNApod: DNA polymorphism annotation database from next-generation sequence read archives",
            "abstract": "With the rapid advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), datasets for DNA polymorphisms among various species and strains have been produced, stored, and distributed. However, reliability varies among these datasets because the experimental and analytical conditions used differ among assays. Furthermore, such datasets have been frequently distributed from the websites of individual sequencing projects. It is desirable to integrate DNA polymorphism data into one database featuring uniform quality control that is distributed from a single platform at a single place. DNA polymorphism annotation database (DNApod; http://tga.nig.ac.jp/dnapod/) is an integrated database that stores genome-wide DNA polymorphism datasets acquired under uniform analytical conditions, and this includes uniformity in the quality of the raw data, the reference genome version, and evaluation algorithms. DNApod genotypic data are re-analyzed whole-genome shotgun datasets extracted from sequence read archives, and DNApod distributes genome-wide DNA polymorphism datasets and known-gene annotations for each DNA polymorphism. This new database was developed for storing genome-wide DNA polymorphism datasets of plants, with crops being the first priority. Here, we describe our analyzed data for 679, 404, and 66 strains of rice, maize, and sorghum, respectively. The analytical methods are available as a DNApod workflow in an NGS annotation system of the DNA Data Bank of Japan and a virtual machine image. Furthermore, DNApod provides tables of links of identifiers between DNApod genotypic data and public phenotypic data. To advance the sharing of organism knowledge, DNApod offers basic and ubiquitous functions for multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree construction by using orthologous gene information.",
