            "title": "Predicting Thermoelectric Power Factor of Bismuth Telluride During Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing",
            "abstract": "An additive manufacturing (AM) process, like laser powder bed fusion, allows for the fabrication of objects by spreading and melting powder in layers until a freeform part shape is created. In order to improve the properties of the material involved in the AM process, it is important to predict the material characterization property as a function of the processing conditions. In thermoelectric materials, the power factor is a measure of how efficiently the material can convert heat to electricity. While earlier works have predicted the material characterization properties of different thermoelectric materials using various techniques, implementation of machine learning models to predict the power factor of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) during the AM process has not been explored. This is important as Bi2Te3 is a standard material for low temperature applications. Thus, we used data about manufacturing processing parameters involved and in-situ sensor monitoring data collected during AM of Bi2Te3, to train different machine learning models in order to predict its thermoelectric power factor. We implemented supervised machine learning techniques using 80% training and 20% test data and further used the permutation feature importance method to identify important processing parameters and in-situ sensor features which were best at predicting power factor of the material. Ensemble-based methods like random forest, AdaBoost classifier, and bagging classifier performed the best in predicting power factor with the highest accuracy of 90% achieved by the bagging classifier model. Additionally, we found the top 15 processing parameters and in-situ sensor features to characterize the material manufacturing property like power factor. These features could further be optimized to maximize power factor of the thermoelectric material and improve the quality of the products built using this material.",

            "abstract": "Engagement is enhanced by the ability to access the state of flow during a task, which is described as a full immersion experience. We report two studies on the efficacy of using physiological data collected from a wearable sensor for the automated prediction of flow. Study 1 took a two-level block design where activities were nested within its participants. A total of five participants were asked to complete 12 tasks that aligned with their interests while wearing the Empatica E4 sensor. This yielded 60 total tasks across the five participants. In a second study representing daily use of the device, a participant wore the device over the course of 10 unstructured activities over 2 weeks. The efficacy of the features derived from the first study were tested on these data. For the first study, a two-level fixed effects stepwise logistic regression procedure indicated that five features were significant predictors of flow. In total, two were related to skin temperature (median change with respect to the baseline and skewness of the temperature distribution) and three were related to acceleration (the acceleration skewness in the x and y directions and the kurtosis of acceleration in the y direction). Logistic regression and na\u00efve Bayes models provided a strong classification performance (AUC > 0.7, between-participant cross-validation). For the second study, these same features yielded a satisfactory prediction of flow for the new participant wearing the device in an unstructured daily use setting (AUC > 0.7, leave-one-out cross-validation). The features related to acceleration and skin temperature appear to translate well for the tracking of flow in a daily use environment.",

            "title": "Pain Forecasting using Self-supervised Learning and Patient Phenotyping: An attempt to prevent Opioid Addiction",
            "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic genetic disorder characterized by recurrent acute painful episodes. Opioids are often used to manage these painful episodes; the extent of their use in managing pain in this disorder is an issue of debate. The risk of addiction and side effects of these opioid treatments can often lead to more pain episodes in the future. Hence, it is crucial to forecast future patient pain trajectories to help patients manage their SCD to improve their quality of life without compromising their treatment. It is challenging to obtain many pain records to design forecasting models since it is mainly recorded by patients' self-report. Therefore, it is expensive and painful (due to the need for patient compliance) to solve pain forecasting problems in a purely supervised manner. In light of this challenge, we propose to solve the pain forecasting problem using self-supervised learning methods. Also, clustering such time-series data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patients' prognoses by identifying\"similar\"patients, and designing treatment guidelines tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. Hence, we propose a self-supervised learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future pain profiles. Experiments on five years of real-world datasets show that our models achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identify meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Heart failure is a syndrome which occurs when the heart is not able to pump blood and oxygen to support other organs in the body. Treatment and management of heart failure in patients include understanding the diagnostic codes and procedure reports of these patients during their hospitalization. Identifying the underlying themes in these diagnostic codes and procedure reports could reveal the clinical phenotypes associated with heart failure. These themes could also help clinicians to predict length of stay in the patients using their clinical notes. Understanding clinical phenotypes on the basis of these themes is important to group patients based on their similar characteristics which could also help in predicting patient outcomes like length of stay. These clinical phenotypes usually have a probabilistic latent structure and hence, as there has been no previous work on identifying phenotypes in clinical notes of heart failure patients using a probabilistic framework and to predict length of stay of these patients using data-driven artificial intelligence-based methods, we apply natural language processing technique, topic modeling, to identify the themes present in diagnostic codes and in procedure reports of 1,200 patients admitted for heart failure at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System (UI Health). Topic modeling identified twelve themes each in diagnostic codes and procedure reports. These themes revealed information about different phenotypes related to various perspectives about heart failure, which could help to study patients\u2019 profiles and discover new relationships among medical concepts. Each theme had a set of keywords and each clinical note was labeled with two themes \u2014 one corresponding to its diagnostic code and the other corresponding to its procedure reports along with their percentage contribution. We used these themes and their percentage contribution to predict length of stay. We found that the themes discovered in diagnostic codes and procedure reports using topic modeling together were able to predict length of stay of the patients with an accuracy of 61.1% and an Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) value of 0.828.",

            "abstract": "The ability to monitor mental effort during a task using a wearable sensor may improve productivity for both work and study. The use of the electrodermal activity (EDA) signal for tracking mental effort is an emerging area of research. Through analysis of over 92 h of data collected with the Empatica E4 on a single participant across 91 different activities, we report on the efficacy of using EDA features getting at signal intensity, signal dispersion, and peak intensity for prediction of the participant\u2019s self-reported mental effort. We implemented the logistic regression algorithm as an interpretable machine learning approach and found that features related to signal intensity and peak intensity were most useful for the prediction of whether the participant was in a self-reported high mental effort state; increased signal and peak intensity were indicative of high mental effort. When cross-validated by activity moderate predictive efficacy was achieved (AUC = 0.63, F1 = 0.63, precision = 0.64, recall = 0.63) which was significantly stronger than using the model bias alone. Predicting mental effort using physiological data is a complex problem, and our findings add to research from other contexts showing that EDA may be a promising physiological indicator to use for sensor-based self-monitoring of mental effort throughout the day. Integration of other physiological features related to heart rate, respiration, and circulation may be necessary to obtain more accurate predictions.",

            "abstract": "As part of the large number of scientific articles being published every year, the publication rate of biomedical literature has been increasing. Consequently, there has been considerable effort to harness and summarize the massive amount of biomedical research articles. While transformer-based encoder-decoder models in a vanilla source document-to-summary setting have been extensively studied for abstractive summarization in different domains, their major limitations continue to be entity hallucination (a phenomenon where generated summaries constitute entities not related to or present in source article(s)) and factual inconsistency. This problem is exacerbated in a biomedical setting where named entities and their semantics (which can be captured through a knowledge base) constitute the essence of an article. The use of named entities and facts mined from background knowledge bases pertaining to the named entities to guide abstractive summarization has not been studied in biomedical article summarization literature. In this paper, we propose an entity-driven fact-aware framework for training end-to-end transformer-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization of biomedical articles. We call the proposed approach, whose building block is a transformer-based model, EFAS, Entity-driven Fact-aware Abstractive Summarization. We conduct a set of experiments using five state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder-decoder models (two of which are specifically designed for long document summarization) and demonstrate that injecting knowledge into the training/inference phase of these models enables the models to achieve significantly better performance than the standard source document-to-summary setting in terms of entity-level factual accuracy, N-gram novelty, and semantic equivalence while performing comparably on ROUGE metrics. The proposed approach is evaluated on ICD-11-Summ-1000, a dataset we build for abstractive summarization of biomedical literature, and PubMed-50k, a segment of a large-scale benchmark dataset for abstractive summarization of biomedical literature.",

            "abstract": "While there has been recent progress in abstractive summarization as applied to different domains including news articles, scientific articles, and blog posts, the application of these techniques to clinical text summarization has been limited. This is primarily due to the lack of large-scale training data and the messy/unstructured nature of clinical notes as opposed to other domains where massive training data come in structured or semi -structured form. Further, one of the least explored and critical components of clinical text summarization is factual accuracy of clinical summaries. This is specifically crucial in the healthcare domain, cardiology in particular, where an accurate summary generation that preserves the facts in the source notes is critical to the well-being of a patient. In this study, we propose a framework for improving the factual accuracy of abstractive summarization of clinical text using knowledge-guided multi-objective optimization. We propose to jointly optimize three cost functions in our proposed architecture during training: generative loss, entity loss and knowledge loss and evaluate the proposed architecture on 1) clinical notes of patients with heart failure (HF), which we collect for this study; and 2) two benchmark datasets, Indiana University Chest X-ray collection (IU X-Ray), and MIMIC-CXR, that are publicly available. We experiment with three transformer encoder-decoder architectures and demonstrate that optimizing different loss functions leads to improved performance in terms of entity-level factual accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience lifelong struggles with both chronic and acute pain, often requiring medical interventMaion. Pain can be managed with medications, but dosages must balance the goal of pain mitigation against the risks of tolerance, addiction and other adverse effects. Setting appropriate dosages requires knowledge of a patient\u2019s subjective pain, but collecting pain reports from patients can be difficult for clinicians and disruptive for patients, and is only possible when patients are awake and communicative. Here we investigate methods for estimating SCD patients\u2019 pain levels indirectly using vital signs that are routinely collected and documented in medical records. Using machine learning, we develop both sequential and non-sequential probabilistic models that can be used to infer pain levels or changes in pain from sequences of these physiological measures. We demonstrate that these models outperform null models and that objective physiological data can be used to inform estimates for subjective pain.",

            "abstract": "Irregularly sampled time series data are common in a variety of fields. Many typical methods for drawing insight from data fail in this case. Here we attempt to generalize methods for clustering trajectories to irregularly and sparsely sampled data. We first construct synthetic data sets, then propose and assess four methods of data alignment to allow for application of spectral clustering. We also repeat the same process for real data drawn from medical records of patients with sickle cell disease -- patients whose subjective experiences of pain were tracked for several months via a mobile app. We find that different methods for aligning irregularly sampled sparse data sets can lead to different optimal numbers of clusters, even for synthetic data with known properties. For the case of sickle cell disease, we find that three clusters is a reasonable choice, and these appear to correspond to (1) a low pain group with occasionally acute pain, (2) a group which experiences moderate mean pain that fluctuates often from low to high, and (3) a group that experiences persistent high levels of pain. Our results may help physicians and patients better understand and manage patients' pain levels over time, and we expect that the methods we develop will apply to a wide range of other data sources in medicine and beyond.",
