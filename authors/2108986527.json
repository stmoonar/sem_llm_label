            "title": "New Frontiers of Scientific Text Mining: Tasks, Data, and Tools",
            "abstract": "Exploring the vast amount of rapidly growing scientific text data is highly beneficial for real-world scientific discovery. However, scientific text mining is particularly challenging due to the lack of specialized domain knowledge in natural language context, complex sentence structures in scientific writing, and multi-modal representations of scientific knowledge. This tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of recent research and development on scientific text mining, focusing on the biomedical and chemistry domains. First, we introduce the motivation and unique challenges of scientific text mining. Then we discuss a set of methods that perform effective scientific information extraction, such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction. We also introduce real-world applications such as textual evidence retrieval, scientific topic contrasting for drug discovery, and molecule representation learning for reaction prediction. Finally, we conclude our tutorial by demonstrating, on real-world datasets (COVID-19 and organic chemistry literature), how the information can be extracted and retrieved, and how they can assist further scientific discovery. We also discuss the emerging research problems and future directions for scientific text mining.",

            "abstract": "Some of the most widely deployed IoT devices in urban areas are smartphones in the possession of urban individuals. Their proliferation has led to the emergence of crowdsensing/crowdsourcing services, where humans collect data about their environment (using phones), and servers aggregate the data for various application purposes of interest. With the emergence of social media, a common alternative form of human data entry has become media posts (e.g., on Twitter). This leads to the prospect of building crowdsensing services on top of social media content, exploiting humans as ``sensors\". In this paper, we develop one such service, called {\\em StoryLine}. The service detects and tracks physical urban events of interest to the user, such as car accidents, infrastructure damage (in the aftermath of a natural disaster), or instances of civil unrest. It offers an interface to client-side software that allows browsing such events in real time, as well as an interface for software applications to a structured representation of the events and their related statistics. The service embodies novel algorithms for real-time detection, demultiplexing, and tracking of physical events using social media data. In our evaluation with Twitter feeds, we show that our service outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in event detection and demultiplexing. We also conduct two case-studies to show the effectiveness of the real-time event detection capability and event tracking performance of our system.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the design and evaluation of GreenDrive, a smartphone-based system that helps drivers save fuel by judiciously advising on driving speed to match the signal phase and timing (SPAT) of upcoming signalized traffic intersections. In the absence of such advice, the default driver behavior is usually to accelerate to (near) the maximum legally allowable speed, traffic conditions permitting. This behavior is suboptimal if the traffic light ahead will turn red just before the vehicle arrives at the intersection. GreenDrive uses collected real-time vehicle mobility data to predict exact signal timing a few tens of seconds ahead, which allows it to offer advice on speed that saves fuel by avoiding unnecessary acceleration that leads to arriving too soon and stopping at red lights. Our work differs from previous work in three respects. First and most importantly, we tackle the more challenging scenario, where some phases (such as left-turn arrows) are added or skipped dynamically, in accordance with real-time traffic demand. Second, our approach can accommodate a low system penetration rate and low vehicle density. Third, GreenDrive treats user-specified travel time requirements as soft deadlines and chooses appropriate speed adaptation strategies according to the user time budget. Using SUMO traffic simulator with real and large-scale road network, we show that GreenDrive learns phase durations with an average error below 2s, and reduces fuel consumption by up to 23.9%. Real-world experiments confirm 31.2% fuel saving and the ability to meet end-to-end travel time requirements.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of an ultra-low power cluster, built upon the Intel Edison based micro servers. The improved performance and high energy efficiency of micro servers have driven both academia and industry to explore the possibility of replacing conventional brawny servers with a larger swarm of embedded micro servers. Existing attempts mostly focus on mobile-class micro servers, whose capacities are similar to mobile phones. We, on the other hand, target on sensor-class micro servers, which are originally intended for uses in wearable technologies, sensor networks, and Internet-of-Things. Although sensor-class micro servers have much less capacity, they are touted for minimal power consumption (< 1 Watt), which opens new possibilities of achieving higher energy efficiency in datacenter workloads. Our systematic evaluation of the Edison cluster and comparisons to conventional brawny clusters involve careful workload choosing and laborious parameter tuning, which ensures maximum server utilization and thus fair comparisons. Results show that the Edison cluster achieves up to 3.5x improvement on work-done-per-joule for web service applications and data-intensive MapReduce jobs. In terms of scalability, the Edison cluster scales linearly on the throughput of web service workloads, and also shows satisfactory scalability for MapReduce workloads despite coordination overhead.",

            "abstract": "Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems are widely used in numerous Internet-Of-Things (IoT) applications such as environment monitoring, supply chain tracing, healthcare, and vehicle networks. In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.",

The intellectual contribution lies in an algorithm for joint estimation of the current state of the workflow together with correction of noisy sensor measurements, given only the noisy measurements and an overall workflow description. We demonstrate through simulations and a physical implementation the degree to which knowledge of workflow can increase sensing accuracy.

            "title": "Scalable social sensing of interdependent phenomena",
            "abstract": "The proliferation of mobile sensing and communication devices in the possession of the average individual generated much recent interest in social sensing applications. Significant advances were made on the problem of uncovering ground truth from observations made by participants of unknown reliability. The problem, also called fact-finding commonly arises in applications where unvetted individuals may opt in to report phenomena of interest. For example, reliability of individuals might be unknown when they can join a participatory sensing campaign simply by downloading a smartphone app. This paper extends past social sensing literature by offering a scalable approach for exploiting dependencies between observed variables to increase fact-finding accuracy. Prior work assumed that reported facts are independent, or incurred exponential complexity when dependencies were present. In contrast, this paper presents the first scalable approach for accommodating dependency graphs between observed states. The approach is tested using real-life data collected in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy on availability of gas, food, and medical supplies, as well as extensive simulations. Evaluation shows that combining expected correlation graphs (of outages) with reported observations of unknown reliability, results in a much more reliable reconstruction of ground truth from the noisy social sensing data. We also show that correlation graphs can help test hypotheses regarding underlying causes, when different hypotheses are associated with different correlation patterns. For example, an observed outage profile can be attributed to a supplier outage or to excessive local demand. The two differ in expected correlations in observed outages, enabling joint identification of both the actual outages and their underlying causes.",
