            "title": "Fairness in AI: challenges in bridging the gap between algorithms and law",
            "abstract": "In this paper we examine algorithmic fairness from the perspective of law aiming to identify best practices and strategies for the specification and adoption of fairness definitions and algorithms in real-world systems and use cases. We start by providing a brief introduction of current anti-discrimination law in the European Union and the United States and discussing the concepts of bias and fairness from an legal and ethical viewpoint. We then proceed by presenting a set of algorithmic fairness definitions by example, aiming to communicate their objectives to non-technical audiences. Then, we introduce a set of core criteria that need to be taken into account when selecting a specific fairness definition for real-world use case applications. Finally, we enumerate a set of key considerations and best practices for the design and employment of fairness methods on real-world AI applications.",

            "abstract": "Fairness is steadily becoming a crucial requirement of Machine Learning (ML) systems. A particularly important notion is subgroup fairness, i.e., fairness in subgroups of individuals that are defined by more than one attributes. Identifying bias in subgroups can become both computationally challenging, as well as problematic with respect to comprehensibility and intuitiveness of the finding to end users. In this work we focus on the latter aspects; we propose an explainability method tailored to identifying potential bias in subgroups and visualizing the findings in a user friendly manner to end users. In particular, we extend the ALE plots explainability method, proposing FALE (Fairness aware Accumulated Local Effects) plots, a method for measuring the change in fairness for an affected population corresponding to different values of a feature (attribute). We envision FALE to function as an efficient, user friendly, comprehensible and reliable first-stage tool for identifying subgroups with potential bias issues.",

            "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations have emerged as an important tool to understand, debug, and audit complex machine learning models. To offer global counterfactual explainability, state-of-the-art methods construct summaries of local explanations, offering a trade-off among conciseness, counterfactual effectiveness, and counterfactual cost or burden imposed on instances. In this work, we provide a concise formulation of the problem of identifying global counterfactuals and establish principled criteria for comparing solutions, drawing inspiration from Pareto dominance. We introduce innovative algorithms designed to address the challenge of finding global counterfactuals for either the entire input space or specific partitions, employing clustering and decision trees as key components. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, considering various instances of the problem and comparing our proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the consistent capability of our algorithms to generate meaningful and interpretable global counterfactual explanations.",
