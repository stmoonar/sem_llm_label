            "title": "MM-EMOG: Multi-Label Emotion Graph Representation for Mental Health Classification on Social Media",
            "abstract": "More than 80% of people who commit suicide disclose their intention to do so on social media. The main information we can use in social media is user-generated posts, since personal information is not always available. Identifying all possible emotions in a single textual post is crucial to detecting the user\u2019s mental state; however, human emotions are very complex, and a single text instance likely expresses multiple emotions. This paper proposes a new multi-label emotion graph representation for social media post-based mental health classification. We first construct a word\u2013document graph tensor to describe emotion-based contextual representation using emotion lexicons. Then, it is trained by multi-label emotions and conducts a graph propagation for harmonising heterogeneous emotional information, and is applied to a textual graph mental health classification. We perform extensive experiments on three publicly available social media mental health classification datasets, and the results show clear improvements.",

            "title": "3M-Health: Multimodal Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Mental Health Detection",
            "abstract": "The significance of mental health classification is paramount in contemporary society, where digital platforms serve as crucial sources for monitoring individuals' well-being. However, existing social media mental health datasets primarily consist of text-only samples, potentially limiting the efficacy of models trained on such data. Recognising that humans utilise cross-modal information to comprehend complex situations or issues, we present a novel approach to address the limitations of current methodologies. In this work, we introduce a Multimodal and Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation model for Mental Health Classification, leveraging insights from cross-modal human understanding. Unlike conventional approaches that often rely on simple concatenation to integrate diverse features, our model addresses the challenge of appropriately representing inputs of varying natures (e.g., texts and sounds). To mitigate the computational complexity associated with integrating all features into a single model, we employ a multimodal and multi-teacher architecture. By distributing the learning process across multiple teachers, each specialising in a particular feature extraction aspect, we enhance the overall mental health classification performance. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our model in achieving improved performance.",

            "abstract": "For preventing youth suicide, social media platforms have received much attention from researchers. A few researches apply machine learning, or deep learning-based text classification approaches to classify social media posts containing suicidality risk. This paper replicated competitive social media-based suicidality detection/prediction models. We evaluated the feasibility of detecting suicidal ideation using multiple datasets and different state-of-the-art deep learning models, RNN-, CNN-, and Attention-based models. Using two suicidality evaluation datasets, we evaluated 28 combinations of 7 input embeddings with 4 commonly used deep learning models and 5 pretrained language models in quantitative and qualitative ways. Our replication study confirms that deep learning works well for social media-based suicidality detection in general, but it highly depends on the dataset's quality.",

            "title": "Utilizing Text Mining, Data Linkage and Deep Learning in Police and Health Records to Predict Future Offenses in Family and Domestic Violence",
            "abstract": "Family and Domestic violence (FDV) is a global problem with significant social, economic, and health consequences for victims including increased health care costs, mental trauma, and social stigmatization. In Australia, the estimated annual cost of FDV is $22 billion, with one woman being murdered by a current or former partner every week. Despite this, tools that can predict future FDV based on the features of the person of interest (POI) and victim are lacking. The New South Wales Police Force attends thousands of FDV events each year and records details as fixed fields (e.g., demographic information for individuals involved in the event) and as text narratives which describe abuse types, victim injuries, threats, including the mental health status for POIs and victims. This information within the narratives is mostly untapped for research and reporting purposes. After applying a text mining methodology to extract information from 492,393 FDV event narratives (abuse types, victim injuries, mental illness mentions), we linked these characteristics with the respective fixed fields and with actual mental health diagnoses obtained from the NSW Ministry of Health for the same cohort to form a comprehensive FDV dataset. These data were input into five deep learning models (MLP, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, BERT) to predict three FDV offense types (\u201chands-on,\u201d \u201chands-off,\u201d \u201cApprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) breach\u201d). The transformer model with BERT embeddings returned the best performance (69.00% accuracy; 66.76% ROC) for \u201cADVO breach\u201d in a multilabel classification setup while the binary classification setup generated similar results. \u201cHands-off\u201d offenses proved the hardest offense type to predict (60.72% accuracy; 57.86% ROC using BERT) but showed potential to improve with fine-tuning of binary classification setups. \u201cHands-on\u201d offenses benefitted least from the contextual information gained through BERT embeddings in which MLP with categorical embeddings outperformed it in three out of four metrics (65.95% accuracy; 78.03% F1-score; 70.00% precision). The encouraging results indicate that future FDV offenses can be predicted using deep learning on a large corpus of police and health data. Incorporating additional data sources will likely increase the performance which can assist those working on FDV and law enforcement to improve outcomes and better manage FDV events.",
