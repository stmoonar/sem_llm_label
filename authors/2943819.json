            "title": "Through the Wall Detection and Localization of Autonomous Mobile Device in Indoor Scenario",
            "abstract": "In the intelligent logistics and warehouses, the autonomous mobile device (AMD) holds a key position as it is equipped with the ability to carry out functions like material transportation and inventory inspection. Nevertheless, the effective execution of these functions necessitates the location of the AMD. Given the increasing proliferation of networks like WiFi and 5G, leveraging these signals to achieve AMD localization is a desirable solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a channel state information (CSI) based system for through-the-wall (TTW) passive AMD detection and localization, named T-DeLo. T-DeLo first establishes a reference channel and utilizes it to cancel the strong signal interference (SSI) and phase errors, ensuring that the reflections introduced by the AMD can be estimated. Built upon this core, it uses the proposed novel two-dimensional matrix pencil algorithm to estimate jointly the path length change rate (PLCR) and time of flight (ToF) of the AMD induced reflections, in the TTW scenario. Unlike existing algorithms, this algorithm aggregates multiple measurements to improve the estimation performance under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, leveraging the estimated ToF and PLCR, T-DeLo realizes TTW AMD detection and localization via statistical and geometric analysis, respectively. In the TTW glass and brick wall scenarios, the extensive experimental evaluation shows that the AMD detection accuracy of T-DeLo is 0.964 and 0.952, while the median localization errors are 1.65 m and 2.05 m, respectively, laying a solid foundation for practical and ubiquitous AMD passive detection and localization.",

            "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables communication users with limited computation power to offload computation-intensive tasks to the edge server, thus dramatically enhancing the limited computing capabilities of the users. As the reality of scarce spectrum resources and the energy-constrained nature of communication users, this paper introduces non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) techniques to achieve more efficient task offloading in MEC. To minimize the number of computationally failed tasks while simultaneously satisfying different quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, a joint resource management problem of the spectrum, computation, and energy resources is formulated. Due to the non-convexity of the offloading optimization problem and the stochastic nature of the constructed MEC environment, a multiple agents deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based resource management algorithm is proposed to manage each user\u2019s multidimensional resources without collaborating. The simulation results show that compared to other benchmark schemes, the proposed algorithm can effectively improve both the communication and computational performances in MEC.",

In this paper, we present a hybrid coded edge computing network whereby users can choose to complete their computation task through: i) local computation with the wireless power transfer derived from base stations, ii) coded edge offloading, or iii) hybrid computation involving edge offloading and local computation. To minimize the overall network cost, we propose a stochastic resource optimization approach. Given the stochastic nature of wireless charging efficiency and edge servers computation capacities, which can only be observed <italic>ex-post</italic>, a computation strategy for each user is determined using the two-stage stochastic integer programming (SIP). To address the complexity of the SIP problem which scales with the size of the network, we introduce the efficient computation methods of Benders\u2019 decomposition and sample average approximation. Besides, we present a special case of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$z$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"xiong-ieq1-3246994.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-stage stochastic offloading optimization that is applicable when the corrective edge offloading action can be executed in multiple stages, e.g., for non-time-sensitive tasks that do not need to be completed by stage two. Finally, we provide extensive sensitivity analyses to evaluate the performance of the proposed cost minimization approach amid varying network parameters. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms deterministic optimization approaches for in-network cost minimization.",

            "abstract": "Groundbreaking applications such as ChatGPT have heightened research interest in generative artificial intelligence (GAI). Essentially, GAI excels not only in content generation but also signal processing, offering support for wireless sensing. Hence, we introduce a novel GAI-assisted human flow detection system (G-HFD). Rigorously, G-HFD first uses the channel state information (CSI) to estimate the velocity and acceleration of propagation path length change of the human induced reflection (HIR). Then, given the strong inference ability of the diffusion model, we propose a unified weighted conditional diffusion model (UW-CDM) to denoise the estimation results, enabling detection of the number of targets. Next, we use the CSI obtained by a uniform linear array with wavelength spacing to estimate the HIR\u2019s time of flight and direction of arrival (DoA). In this process, UW-CDM solves the problem of ambiguous DoA spectrum, ensuring accurate DoA estimation. Finally, through clustering, G-HFD determines the number of subflows and the number of targets in each subflow, i.e., the subflow size. The evaluation based on practical downlink communication signals shows G-HFD\u2019s accuracy of subflow size detection can reach 91%. This validates its effectiveness and underscores the significant potential of GAI in the context of wireless sensing.",

            "abstract": "With the recent development of the Metaverse, people are more connected with each other. Avatars are used to represent the people, to communicate with one another, and they can build the community virtually. In these processes, a massive amount of data is exchanged between the physical and the virtual world. However, the existing communication technologies are insufficient to support the Metaverse, and the energy consumption of the Metaverse is huge. Therefore, semantic communication is one of the emerging communication paradigms to reduce the size of the data transmitted and reduce energy consumption while maintaining its meaning. Virtual service providers (VSPs) who provide services in the Metaverse can purchase semantic data from the nearby edge sensing units by using two subscription plans: reservation and on-demand. However, in practice, the demand of the VSPs is uncertain due to the variability of the Metaverse. To minimize the cost of the network and prevent over- and under-subscription of the resources, we propose a two-phase stochastic semantic resource allocation (SSRA) scheme. In phase one, a double dutch auction performs a one-to-one matching between VSPs and edge sensing units. The matching is dynamic and depends on the quality of experience (QoE) from the Metaverse users and the semantic data transmission cost from the edge sensing units. The matching changes whenever QoE and the semantic data transmission cost vary. In phase two, we consider the demand uncertainty and matching result from the phase one to formulate a distributed robust optimization (DRO) problem to minimize the operation cost of the VSPs. Using a real-world dataset, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is fully dynamic and minimizes the operation cost/energy consumption of VSPs in the presence of stochastic uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Semantic Communication (SemCom) plays a pivotal role in 6G networks, offering a viable solution for future efficient communication. Deep Learning (DL)-based semantic codecs further enhance this efficiency. However, the vulnerability of DL models to security threats, such as adversarial attacks, poses significant challenges for practical applications of SemCom systems. These vulnerabilities enable attackers to tamper with messages and eavesdrop on private information, especially in wireless communication scenarios. Although existing defenses attempt to address specific threats, they often fail to simultaneously handle multiple heterogeneous attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based SemCom system. This system comprises a gating network and multiple experts, each specializing in different security challenges. The gating network adaptively selects suitable experts to counter heterogeneous attacks based on user-defined security requirements. Multiple experts collaborate to accomplish semantic communication tasks while meeting the security requirements of users. A case study in vehicular networks demonstrates the efficacy of the MoE-based SemCom system. Simulation results show that the proposed MoE-based SemCom system effectively mitigates concurrent heterogeneous attacks, with minimal impact on downstream task accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has brought daunting challenges in the areas of service latency, security, and trustworthiness. Recently researchers have presented the edge AIGC paradigm, effectively optimizing the service latency by distributing AIGC services to edge devices. However, AIGC products are still unprotected and vulnerable to tampering and plagiarization. Moreover, as a kind of online non-fungible digital property, the free circulation of AIGC products is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness in open networks. For the first time, in this article, we present a blockchain-empowered framework to manage the lifecycle of edge AIGC products. Specifically, leveraging fraud proofability, we first propose a protocol to protect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely execution of the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we implement a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme with which AIGC producers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and can reliably handle their services. Through the use of test data, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Last but not least, we discuss important open directions for further research.",

            "abstract": "Performance optimization is a critical concern in networking, on which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved great success. Nonetheless, DRL training relies on precisely defined reward functions, which formulate the optimization objective and indicate the positive/negative progress towards the optimal. With the ever-increasing environmental complexity and human participation in Next-Generation Networking (NGN), defining appropriate reward functions become challenging. In this article, we explore the applications of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in NGN. Particularly, if DRL aims to find optimal solutions to the problem, IRL finds a problem from the optimal solutions, where the optimal solutions are collected from experts, and the problem is defined by reward inference. Specifically, we first formally introduce the IRL technique, including its fundamentals, workflow, and difference from DRL. Afterward, we present the motivations of IRL applications in NGN and survey existing studies. Furthermore, to demonstrate the process of applying IRL in NGN, we perform a case study about human-centric prompt engineering in Generative AI-enabled networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using both DRL and IRL techniques and prove the superiority of IRL.",

In this survey, we explore the integration of MoE and GAI to enable Artificial General Intelligence in IoV, which can enable the realization of full autonomy for IoV with minimal human supervision and applicability in a wide range of mobility scenarios, including environment monitoring, traffic management, and autonomous driving. In particular, we present the fundamentals of GAI, MoE, and their interplay applications in IoV. Furthermore, we discuss the potential integration of MoE and GAI in IoV, including distributed perception and monitoring, collaborative decision-making and planning, and generative modeling and simulation. Finally, we present several potential research directions for facilitating the integration.",
