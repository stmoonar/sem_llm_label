            "title": "Federated Multilingual Models for Medical Transcript Analysis",
            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a novel machine learning approach that allows the model trainer to access more data samples, by training the model across multiple decentralized data sources, while data access constraints are in place. Such trained models can achieve significantly higher performance beyond what can be done when trained on a single data source. As part of FL's promises, none of the training data is ever transmitted to any central location, ensuring that sensitive data remains local and private. These characteristics make FL perfectly suited for large-scale applications in healthcare, where a variety of compliance constraints restrict how data may be handled, processed, and stored. Despite the apparent benefits of federated learning, the heterogeneity in the local data distributions pose significant challenges, and such challenges are even more pronounced in the case of multilingual data providers. In this paper we present a federated learning system for training a large-scale multi-lingual model suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks such as medical entity tagging. Our work represents one of the first such production-scale systems, capable of training across multiple highly heterogeneous data providers, and achieving levels of accuracy that could not be otherwise achieved by using central training with public data. Finally, we show that the global model performance can be further improved by a training step performed locally.",

            "abstract": "Most works on adversarial examples for deep-learning based image classifiers use noise that, while small, covers the entire image. We explore the case where the noise is allowed to be visible but confined to a small, localized patch of the image, without covering any of the main object(s) in the image. We show that it is possible to generate localized adversarial noises that cover only 2% of the pixels in the image, none of them over the main object, and that are transferable across images and locations, and successfully fool a state-of-the-art Inception v3 model with very high success rates.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a new surrogate loss function called orbit loss in the structured prediction framework, which has good theoretical and practical advantages. While the orbit loss is not convex, it has a simple analytical gradient and a simple perceptron-like learning rule. We analyze the new loss theoretically and state a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound. We also prove that the new loss is consistent in the strong sense; namely, the risk achieved by the set of the trained parameters approaches the infimum risk achievable by any linear decoder over the given features. Methods that are aimed at risk minimization, such as the structured ramp loss, the structured probit loss and the direct loss minimization require at least two inference operations per training iteration. In this sense, the orbit loss is more efficient as it requires only one inference operation per training iteration, while yields similar performance. We conclude the paper with an empirical comparison of the proposed loss function to the structured hinge loss, the structured ramp loss, the structured probit loss and the direct loss minimization method on several benchmark datasets and tasks.",
