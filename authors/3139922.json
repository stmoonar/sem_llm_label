            "title": "Relational Perspective on Graph Query Languages",
            "abstract": "We study a relational perspective of graph database querying. Such a perspective underlies various graph database systems but very few theoretical investigations have been conducted on it. This perspective offers a powerful and unified framework to study graph database querying, by which algorithms and complexity follow from classical results. We provide two concrete applications. The first is querying property graphs. The property graph data model supersedes previously proposed graph models and underlies the new standard GQL for graph query languages. We show that this standard can be, by and large, expressed by extensions of relational calculus with transitive closure operators (FO[TC]) and existential second-order quantifiers (ESO). With this, we obtain optimal data complexity bounds, along with extensions including schema validation. The second application is incorporating data from concrete domains (e.g., numbers) in graph database querying. We use embedded finite model theory and, by exploiting a generic Restricted Quantifier Collapse (RQC) result for FO[TC] and ESO, we obtain optimal data complexity bounds for GQL with arithmetics and comparisons. Moreover, we show that Regular Data Path Querying with operations on data (i.e. using register automata formalisms) can be captured in FO[TC] over embedded finite graphs while preserving nondeterministic logspace data complexity.",

            "title": "GQL and SQL/PGQ: Theoretical Models and Expressive Power",
            "abstract": "SQL/PGQ and GQL are very recent international standards for querying property graphs: SQL/PGQ specifies how to query relational representations of property graphs in SQL, while GQL is a standalone language for graph databases. The rapid industrial development of these standards left the academic community trailing in its wake. While digests of the languages have appeared, we do not yet have concise foundational models like relational algebra and calculus for relational databases that enable the formal study of languages, including their expressiveness and limitations. At the same time, work on the next versions of the standards has already begun, to address the perceived limitations of their first versions. Motivated by this, we initiate a formal study of SQL/PGQ and GQL, concentrating on their concise formal model and expressiveness. For the former, we define simple core languages -- Core GQL and Core PGQ -- that capture the essence of the new standards, are amenable to theoretical analysis, and fully clarify the difference between PGQ's bottom up evaluation versus GQL's linear, or pipelined approach. Equipped with these models, we both confirm the necessity to extend the language to fill in the expressiveness gaps and identify the source of these deficiencies. We complement our theoretical analysis with an experimental study, demonstrating that existing workarounds in full GQL and PGQ are impractical which further underscores the necessity to correct deficiencies in the language design.",

            "abstract": "Guess who is a two-player search game in which each player chooses a character from a deck of 24 cards, and has to infer the other player\u2019s character by asking yes-no questions. A simple binary search strategy allows the starting player find the opponent\u2019s character by asking 5 questions only, when the opponent is honest. Real-life observations show that in more realistic scenarios, the game is played against adversaries that do not strictly follow the rules, e.g., kids. Such players might decide to answer all questions at once, answer only part of the questions as they do not know the answers to all, and even lie occasionally. We devise strategies for such scenarios using techniques from error-correcting and erasure codes. This connects to a recent line of work on search problems on graphs and trees with unreliable auxiliary information, and could be of independent interest.",

Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Data provenance consists in bookkeeping meta information during query evaluation, in order to enrich query results with their trust level, likelihood, evaluation cost, and more. The framework of semiring provenance abstracts from the specific kind of meta information that annotates the data. While the definition of semiring provenance is uncontroversial for unions of conjunctive queries, the picture is less clear for Datalog. Indeed, the original definition might include infinite computations, and is not consistent with other proposals for Datalog semantics over annotated data. \nIn this work, we propose and investigate several provenance semantics, based on different approaches for defining classical Datalog semantics. We study the relationship between these semantics, and introduce properties that allow us to analyze and compare them.",

            "abstract": "Queries with aggregation and arithmetic operations, as well as incomplete data, are common in real-world database, but we lack a good understanding of how they should interact. On the one hand, systems based on SQL provide ad-hoc rules for numerical nulls, on the other, theoretical research largely concentrates on the standard notions of certain and possible answers. In the presence of numerical attributes and aggregates, however, these answers are often meaningless, returning either too little or too much. Our goal is to define a principled framework for databases with numerical nulls and answering queries with arithmetic and aggregations over them. Towards this goal, we assume that missing values in numerical attributes are given by probability distributions associated with marked nulls. This yields a model of probabilistic bag databases in which tuples are not necessarily independent since nulls can repeat. We provide a general compositional framework for query answering and then concentrate on queries that resemble standard SQL with arithmetic and aggregation. We show that these queries are measurable, and their outputs have a finite representation. Moreover, since the classical forms of answers provide little information in the numerical setting, we look at the probability that numerical values in output tuples belong to specific intervals. Even though their exact computation is intractable, we show efficient approximation algorithms to compute such probabilities.",

            "abstract": "The development of practical query languages for graph databases runs well ahead of the underlying theory. The ISO committee in charge of database query languages is currently developing a new standard called Graph Query Language (GQL) as well as an extension of the SQL Standard for querying property graphs represented by a relational schema, called SQL/PGQ. The main component of both is the pattern matching facility, which is shared by the two standards. In many aspects, it goes well beyond RPQs, CRPQs, and similar queries on which the research community has focused for years. Our main contribution is to distill the lengthy standard specification into a simple Graph Pattern Calculus (GPC) that reflects all the key pattern matching features of GQL and SQL/PGQ, and at the same time lends itself to rigorous theoretical investigation. We describe the syntax and semantics of GPC, along with the typing rules that ensure its expressions are well-defined, and state some basic properties of the language. With this paper we provide the community a tool to embark on a study of query languages that will soon be widely adopted by industry.",

A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",

            "title": "SQL Nulls and Two-Valued Logic",
            "abstract": "The design of SQL is based on a three-valued logic (3VL), rather than the familiar two-valued Boolean logic (2VL). In addition totrue andfalse, 3VL addsunknown to handle nulls. Viewed as indispensable for SQL expressiveness, it is often criticized for unintuitive behavior of queries and for being a source of programmer mistakes. We show that, contrary to the widely held view, SQL could have been designed based on 2VL, without any loss of expressiveness. Similarly to SQL's WHERE clause, which only keeps true tuples, we conflate false and unknown for conditions involving nulls to obtain an equally expressive 2VL-based version of SQL. This applies to the core of the 1999 SQL Standard. Queries written under the 2VL semantics can be efficiently translated into the 3VL SQL and thus executed on any existing RDBMS. We show that 2VL enables additional optimizations. To gauge its applicability, we establish criteria under which 2VL and 3VL semantics coincide, and analyze common benchmarks such as TPC-H and TPC-DS to show that most of their queries are such. For queries that behave differently under 2VL and 3VL, we undertake a user study to show a consistent preference for the 2VL semantics.",
