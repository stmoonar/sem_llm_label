            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as the backbone of many applications such as recommendation systems and question answering. All these applications require reasoning about the relevance of facts in a KG to downstream applications. In this work, we describe our efforts in building a solution to reason about the importance of facts over continuously updated industry-scale KGs. We focus on the problem of fact ranking and evaluate to what extent modern knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models provide a representation for addressing this problem. To this end, we discuss unique challenges associated with solving this task in industrial settings and evaluate how accurately different KGE models and text-based embedding models can solve the problem of fact ranking.",

            "title": "High-Throughput Vector Similarity Search in Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "There is an increasing adoption of machine learning for encoding data into vectors to serve online recommendation and search use cases. As a result, recent data management systems propose augmenting query processing with online vector similarity search. In this work, we explore vector similarity search in the context of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Motivated by the tasks of finding related KG queries and entities for past KG query workloads, we focus on hybrid vector similarity search (hybrid queries for short) where part of the query corresponds to vector similarity search and part of the query corresponds to predicates over relational attributes associated with the underlying data vectors. For example, given past KG queries for a song entity, we want to construct new queries for new song entities whose vector representations are close to the vector representation of the entity in the past KG query. But entities in a KG also have non-vector attributes such as a song associated with an artist, a genre, and a release date. Therefore, suggested entities must also satisfy query predicates over non-vector attributes beyond a vector-based similarity predicate. While these tasks are central to KGs, our contributions are generally applicable to hybrid queries. In contrast to prior works that optimize online queries, we focus on enabling efficient batch processing of past hybrid query workloads. We present our system, HQI, for high-throughput batch processing of hybrid queries. We introduce a workload-aware vector data partitioning scheme to tailor the vector index layout to the given workload and describe a multi-query optimization technique to reduce the overhead of vector similarity computations. We evaluate our methods on industrial workloads and demonstrate that HQI yields a 31\u00d7 improvement in throughput for finding related KG queries compared to existing hybrid query processing approaches.",

            "abstract": "Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) enable finer-grained resource allocation and tuning of transmission configurations for right-sized resource allocation. These features make EONs excellent choice for 5G transport networks supporting highly dynamic traffic with diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. 5G network slices are expected to host applications with a dynamic nature (e.g., augmented/virtual reality broadcasting), which will result in slice resource requirement changing over time. The initial resource allocation to network slices has to be adapted to accommodate such changes without causing significant disruption to existing traffic and using minimal additional resources. In this paper, we address the problem of scaling bandwidth demand of network slices on an EON-enabled 5G transport network. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we do not assume any specific technologies for minimizing disruption when accommodating the scaling request. Rather, we propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and a heuristic algorithm for accommodating scaling requests by choosing from a comprehensive set of reconfiguration actions. We carefully design a novel cost model for capturing traffic disruptions and additional resource usage by these different actions. Our extensive simulations using realistic network topologies shed light on the trade-off between additional resource usage and disruption while accommodating slice scaling requests by employing a comprehensive set of reconfiguration actions. Simulation results also show that our heuristic algorithm can find solutions that remain within 10% of ILP-based solutions, while executing several orders of magnitude faster than ILP.",

            "abstract": "In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has recently emerged as a means of achieving per-packet near real-time visibility into the network. INT capable network devices can directly embed device internal state such as packet processing time, queue occupancy and link utilization information in each passing packet. INT is enabling new network monitoring applications and is currently being used in production for providing fine-grained feedback to congestion control mechanisms. The microscopic network visibility facilitated by INT comes at the expense of increased data plane overhead. INT piggybacks telemetry information on user data traffic and can significantly increase packet size. A direct consequence of increasing packet size for carrying telemetry data is a substantial drop in network goodput. This paper aims at striking a balance between reducing INT data plane overhead and the accuracy of network view constructed from telemetry data. To this end, we propose LINT, an accuracy-adaptive and Lightweight INT mechanism that can be implemented on commodity programmable devices. Our evaluation of LINT using real network traces on a fat tree topology demonstrates that LINT can reduce INT data plane overhead by \u224825% while ensuring more than 0.9 recall for monitoring queries trying to identify congested flows and switches in the network.",

In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we show that it is possible to mitigate such misbehavior leveraging emerging programmable data planes while not requiring any end-host or protocol modifications. A key challenge in doing so is to implement expressive, complex and stateful functions in the data plane within its restricted programming model.

            "abstract": "This paper addresses Co<italic>nnectivity-aware</italic> Vi<italic>rtual</italic> N<italic>etwork</italic> E<italic>mbedding</italic> (<italic>CoViNE</italic>) problem, which consists in embedding a virtual network (VN) on a substrate network while ensuring VN connectivity (without any bandwidth guarantee) against multiple substrate link failures. <italic>CoViNE</italic> provides a weaker form of survivability incurring less resource overhead than traditional VN survivability models. To optimally solve <italic>CoViNE</italic>, we present an Integer Linear Program (ILP), namely <italic>CoViNE-opt</italic>. <italic>CoViNE-opt</italic> enumerates an exponential number of edge-cuts in a VN severely limiting its scalability. Therefore, we decompose CoViNE into three sub-problems: i) augmenting a VN with virtual links to provide necessary connectivity, ii) identifying the virtual links that should be embedded disjointly, and iii) computing a VN embedding while satisfying the disjointness constraints. We introduce <italic>conflicting set</italic> abstraction that allows to address sub-problems (i) and (ii) without enumerating all the edge-cuts of a VN. We propose two novel solutions to <italic>CoViNE</italic> leveraging conflicting set, namely <italic>CoViNE-ILP</italic> and <italic>CoViNE-fast</italic>. <italic>CoViNE-ILP</italic> uses a heuristic algorithm to address sub-problems (i) and (ii), while an ILP is used for sub-problem (iii). In contrast, <italic>CoViNE-fast</italic> uses heuristics for solving all three sub-problems. Through simulation, we evaluate the optimality and scalability of our solutions and demonstrate a failure restoration use-case enabled by <italic>CoViNE</italic>.",
