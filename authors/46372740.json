            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Spatial databases have a wide range of applications such as urban planning, engineering management and data visualization for epidemic investigation. The number of users in spatial databases becomes significantly large due to the increasing demand of application requirements. Users send their queries and analysis tasks to the system and receive the corresponding feedback. However, there is a lack of research on natural language interfaces in spatial databases. In this demo, we present NALSD, a natural language transformation system designed specifically for spatial data queries. NALSD comprises two core components: (i) natural language understanding and (ii) natural language translation. The system enables automatic translation of natural language query on spatial data into executable language for the underlying database, and supports range query, nearest neighbor query and spatial join query. We demonstrate how to obtain database executable language and visualize query results based on the SECONDO system.",

            "title": "Efficiently Answering Top-k Window Aggregate Queries: Calculating Coverage Number Sequences over Hierarchical Structures",
            "abstract": "Given a set of spatio-temporal objects, a top-k window aggregate query reports top-k tuples that are ordered with respect to the number of objects during a given time interval and within a spatial range. For example, when analyzing traffic density in a city, one wishes to retrieve top-k time intervals in a certain area that are decreasingly ordered according to the number of vehicles passing by. As simply performing sequential scan over all objects is a costly procedure, an index structure is typically built to enhance the query performance. A crucial step during the evaluation is to determine the number of objects in an arbitrary node, called coverage number sequence. This is a challenging task since objects appear and disappear at different time points such that the number of objects in the query node changes over time. Also, as a hierarchical index structure, the value of a node at high level is achieved by performing the aggregation over its child nodes. Simply enumerating all objects rooted in the query node suffers from performance issues mainly due to (i) traversing the sub-tree to retrieve a large number of time points and (ii) repeatedly performing the aggregation at certain time points. We propose an efficient approach to solve the performance issue for both R-tree and Octree and support updating for new arrival data objects being inserted into the index. Our approach outperforms alternative methods in general according to a thorough analysis on the complexity. Coverage number sequences as well as proposed optimization techniques are utilized to enhance the performance of window aggregate queries. We confirm the superiority of our approach over alternative methods by performing a comprehensive experimental evaluation over large real datasets in a database system.",

            "abstract": "The rise of GPS-equipped mobile devices has led to the emergence of big trajectory data. The collected raw data usually contain errors and anomalies information caused by device failure, sensor error, and environment influence. Low-quality data fails to support application requirements and therefore raw data will be comprehensively cleaned before usage. Existing methods are suboptimal to detect GPS data errors and do the repairing. To solve the problem, we propose a framework called GPSClean to analyze the anomalies data and develop effective methods to repair the data. There are primarily four modules in GPSClean: (i) data preprocessing, (ii) data filling, (iii) data repairing, and (iv) data conversion. For (i), we propose an approach named MDSort (Maximum Disorder Sorting) to efficiently solve the issue of data disorder. For (ii), we propose a method named NNF (Nearest Neighbor Filling) to fill missing data. For (iii), we design an approach named RCSWS (Range Constraints and Sliding Window Statistics) to repair anomalies and also improve the accuracy of data repairing by mak7ing use of driving direction. We use 45 million real trajectory data to evaluate our proposal in a prototype database system SECONDO. Experimental results show that the accuracy of RCSWS is three times higher than an alternative method SCREEN and nearly an order of magnitude higher than an alternative method EWMA.",

            "abstract": "A multi-attribute trajectory consists of a spatio-temporal trajectory and a set of descriptive attributes. Such data enrich the representation of traditional spatio-temporal trajectories to have comprehensive knowledge of moving objects. Range query is a fundamental operator over multi-attribute trajectories. Such a query contains two predicates, spatio-temporal and attribute, and returns the objects whose locations are within a distance threshold to the query trajectory and attributes contain expected values. There are different execution plans for answering the query. To enhance the capability of a trajectory database, an optimizer is essentially required to (i) accurately estimate the cost for alternative query strategies in terms of disk accesses, (ii) build a decision-making module that automatically sorts the data in an appropriate way and selects the optimal query plan, and (iii) update the analytical models when new trajectories are arrived. The cost model supports both uniform and non-uniform spatio-temporal data distribution and incorporates attribute distribution. The optimizer is fully developed inside a database system kernel and comprehensively evaluated in terms of accuracy and effectiveness by using large real and synthetic datasets.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the rise of mobile devices has led to the emergence of big trajectory data. Raw GPS records usually include many errors and abnormal information due to equipment error and environment influence. To provide high quality data for applications, an important task is to efficiently detect and effectively repair different types of anomalies in GPS records. In this demo, we develop a tool called GPSClean to detect and repair abnormal GPS data. The tool well supports repairing five kinds of anomalies in GPS data and is developed in an open source database system for managing trajectory data. We demonstrate GPSClean by using large real GPS data.",

            "abstract": "Moving objects databases (MODs) have been extensively studied due to their wide variety of applications including traffic management, tourist service and mobile commerce. However, queries in natural languages are still not supported in MODs. Since most users are not familiar with structured query languages, it is essentially important to bridge the gap between natural languages and the underlying MODs system commands. Motivated by this, we design a natural language interface for moving objects, named NALMO. In general, we use semantic parsing in combination with a location knowledge base and domain-specific rules to interpret natural language queries. We design a corpus of moving objects queries for model training, which is later used to determine the query type. Extracted entities from parsing are mapped through deterministic rules to perform query composition. NALMO is able to well translate moving objects queries into structured (executable) languages. We support four kinds of queries including time interval queries, range queries, nearest neighbor queries and trajectory similarity queries. We develop the system in a prototype system SECONDO and evaluate our approach using 240 natural language queries extracted from popular conference and journal papers in the domain of moving objects. Experimental results show that (i) NALMO achieves accuracy and precision 98.1 and 88.1, respectively, and (ii) the average time cost of translating a query is 1.47s.",

            "abstract": "Predicting query cost plays an important role in moving object databases. Accurate predictions help database administrators effectively schedule workloads and achieve optimal resource allocation strategies. There are some works focusing on query cost prediction, but most of them employ analytical methods to obtain an index-based cost prediction model. The accuracy can be seriously challenged as the workload of the database management system becomes more and more complex. Differing from the previous work, this paper proposes a method called CPRQ (Cost Prediction of Range Query) which is based on machine-learning techniques. The proposed method contains four learning models: the polynomial regression model, the decision tree regression model, the random forest regression model, and the KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) regression model. Using R-squared and MSE (Mean Squared Error) as measurements, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation. The results demonstrate that CPRQ achieves high accuracy and the random forest regression model obtains the best predictive performance (R-squared is 0.9695 and MSE is 0.154).",

            "abstract": "Emerging applications over spatio-temporal trajectories require representing the data from diverse aspects. We study multi-attribute trajectories each of which consists of a sequence of time-stamped locations and a set of attributes characterizing diverse aspects. We investigate continuous range queries over multi-attribute trajectories. Such a query returns trajectories whose attributes contain expected values and whose locations are always within a distance threshold to the query trajectory during the entire overlapping time period. To efficiently answer the query, an optimal method of partitioning the trajectories is proposed and an index structure is developed to support the combined search using both spatio-temporal parameters and attribute values. Query algorithms and auxiliary structures are developed, accompanied with optimization strategies and thorough theoretical analysis. Using both real and synthetic datasets, we carry out comprehensive experiments in a prototype database system to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of our designs. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms six alternative approaches by a factor of 5-50x on large datasets.",

            "abstract": "Due to the widespread use of GPS-enabled devices such as smartphones, the research field of moving objects databases has been quite active in the past decade. Human movements are recorded, managed and analyzed for a plethora of applications. In this demo, we introduce a toolbox named IMO to simulate and query infected moving objects. This is primarily motivated by COVID-19 virus pandemic recently. We model the spreading behavior to demonstrate when and where people are infected. The protection policy is simulated such that one can see the isolation and self protection effects such as human movement restriction and the wearing of masks. Optimization techniques are developed to enhance the performance, including data storage, data partition and index structures. This is not a standalone software but a toolbox embedded in SECONDO, an open source and extensible database system. To the best of our knowledge, simulating and querying infected objects are not supported in existing moving objects prototype systems. Demo attendees can conveniently pose their queries and adjust parameters in the interface and the system will visualize the result after only a short delay.
