            "title": "Burstiness-aware Bipartite Graph Neural Networks for Fraudulent User Detection on Rating Platforms",
            "abstract": "As the digital commerce landscape continues to expand with rating platforms, the consumer base has similarly grown, marking a pivotal reliance on user ratings and reviews. However, the rise of fraudulent users leveraging deceitful conduct, such as manipulation of product rankings, challenges the credibility of these platforms and compels the necessity for an effective detection model. Amid the challenges of evolving fraudulent patterns and label scarcity, this paper presents a novel model, Burstiness-aware Bipartite Graph Neural Networks (BurstBGN), which combats fraud by exploiting user-product bipartite graphs and timestamped rating activities. BurstBGN encapsulates two key ideas: the modeling of user-product interaction via historical rating data through an Edge-time GNN module and the exhaustive mapping of bursty fraudulent user activities. The performance of BurstBGN is demonstrated through rigorous benchmarking against established methods across three datasets. Our results show that BurstBGN consistently outperforms these methods under both transductive and inductive settings, confirming its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent users from limited annotated data, and thereby providing a safeguard for maintaining user trust in e-commerce platforms.",

            "abstract": "In this survey, we dive into Tabular Data Learning (TDL) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a domain where deep learning-based approaches have increasingly shown superior performance in both classification and regression tasks compared to traditional methods. The survey highlights a critical gap in deep neural TDL methods: the underrepresentation of latent correlations among data instances and feature values. GNNs, with their innate capability to model intricate relationships and interactions between diverse elements of tabular data, have garnered significant interest and application across various TDL domains. Our survey provides a systematic review of the methods involved in designing and implementing GNNs for TDL (GNN4TDL). It encompasses a detailed investigation into the foundational aspects and an overview of GNN-based TDL methods, offering insights into their evolving landscape. We present a comprehensive taxonomy focused on constructing graph structures and representation learning within GNN-based TDL methods. In addition, the survey examines various training plans, emphasizing the integration of auxiliary tasks to enhance the effectiveness of instance representations. A critical part of our discussion is dedicated to the practical application of GNNs across a spectrum of GNN4TDL scenarios, demonstrating their versatility and impact. Lastly, we discuss the limitations and propose future research directions, aiming to spur advancements in GNN4TDL. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a thorough understanding of GNNs' role in revolutionizing TDL and pointing towards future innovations in this promising area.",

            "abstract": "Customs officials across the world encounter huge volumes of transactions. Associated with customs transactions is customs fraud-the intentional manipulation of goods declarations to avoid taxes and duties. Due to limited manpower, the customs offices can only manually inspect a small number of declarations, necessitating the automation of customs fraud detection by machine learning techniques. The limited availability of manually inspected ground truth data makes it essential for the ML approach to generalize well on unseen data. However, current customs fraud detection models are not well suited or designed for this setting. In this work, we propose GraphFC (Graph Neural networks for Customs Fraud), a model-agnostic, domain-specific, graph neural network based customs fraud detection model that is designed to work in a real-world setting with limited ground truth data. Extensive experimentation using real customs data from two countries demonstrates that GraphFC generalizes well over unseen data and outperforms various baselines and other models by a large margin.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning-based approaches to Tabular Data Learning (TDL) have shown promising performance compared to their conventional counterparts. However, these methods often fail to account for the latent correlation among data instances and feature values. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention across various application domains, including TDL, for their ability to model relations and interactions between different data entities. By creating appropriate graph structures from the input tabular data and employing GNNs for learning, the performance of TDL can be improved significantly. In this tutorial, we systematically introduce the methodologies of designing and applying GNNs to TDL. Our discussion covers the foundations and overview of GNN-based TDL methods, with a focus on formulating TDL as different graph structures. We also provide a comprehensive taxonomy of constructing graph structures and representation learning in GNN-based TDL methods. We describe the TDL model training framework, which includes different auxiliary tasks and supports open-world learning. Additionally, we discuss how to apply GNNs to various TDL application scenarios and tasks. Finally, we outline the limitations of current research and future directions for this field.",

Given a source message, our goal is to determine whether it is fake without using labeled data and without requiring user interacted with the given message. We present a novel learning framework, Recommendation-aware Message Representation (RecMR), to achieve the goal. The key idea is to learn user preferences and have them encoded into the representation of the source message through jointly training the tasks of user recommendation and binary detection. Experiments conducted on two real Twitter datasets exhibit the promising performance of RecMR, and show the effectiveness of recommended users in unsupervised detection.",

This paper aims at boosting the performance of top-N sequential recommendation based on a state-of-the-art model, Caser. We point out three insufficiencies of Caser - do not model variant-sized sequential patterns, treating the impact of each past time step equally, and cannot learn cumulative features. Then we propose a novel Convolutional Attentional Recurrent Embedding (CARE) learning model. Experiments conducted on a large-scale user-location check-in dataset exhibit promising performance, comparing to Caser.",

            "abstract": "Financial technology (FinTech) has drawn much attention among investors and companies. While conventional stock analysis in FinTech targets at predicting stock prices, less effort is made for profitable stock recommendation. Besides, in existing approaches on modeling time series of stock prices, the relationships among stocks and sectors (i.e., categories of stocks) are either neglected or pre-defined. Ignoring stock relationships will miss the information shared between stocks while using pre-defined relationships cannot depict the latent interactions or influence of stock prices between stocks. In this work, we aim at recommending the top-K profitable stocks in terms of return ratio using time series of stock prices and sector information. We propose a novel deep learning-based model, Financial Graph Attention Networks (FinGAT), to tackle the task under the setting that no pre-defined relationships between stocks are given. The idea of FinGAT is three-fold. First, we devise a hierarchical learning component to learn short-term and long-term sequential patterns from stock time series. Second, a fully-connected graph between stocks and a fully-connected graph between sectors are constructed, along with graph attention networks, to learn the latent interactions among stocks and sectors. Third, a multi-task objective is devised to jointly recommend the profitable stocks and predict the stock movement. Experiments conducted on Taiwan Stock, S&P 500, and NASDAQ datasets exhibit remarkable recommendation performance of our FinGAT, comparing to state-of-the-art methods.",
