            "abstract": "The density and complexity of urban environments present significant challenges for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, ensuring pedestrians' safety and protecting personal privacy are crucial considerations in these environments. Smart city intersections and AI-powered traffic management systems will be essential for addressing these challenges. Therefore, our research focuses on creating an experimental framework for the design of applications that support the secure and efficient management of traffic intersections in urban areas. We integrated two cameras (street-level and bird's eye view), both viewing an intersection, and a programmable edge computing node, deployed within the COSMOS testbed in New York City, with a central management platform provided by Kentyou. We designed a pipeline to collect and analyze the video streams from both cameras and obtain real-time traffic/pedestrian-related information to support smart city applications. The obtained information from both cameras is merged, and the results are sent to a dedicated dashboard for real-time visualization and further assessment (e.g., accident prevention). The process does not require sending the raw videos in order to avoid violating pedestrians' privacy. In this demo, we present the designed video analytic pipelines and their integration with Kentyou central management platform.",

            "abstract": "A quarter of global greenhouse emissions come from transport, with modern cities producing more than 60% of these emissions. To reduce carbon footprint, several solutions on soft mobility (e.g., optimizing electric vehicles locations) have been proposed using IoT resources and AI techniques. However, these solutions either lack replicability since they ignore city\u2019s needs per area and economic restrictions or lack algorithmic fairness since they account no social criteria (e.g., disabled, age, gender). In this work, we developed AI-based methods to automatically detect the different areas (e.g., rural, urban) and propose two heuristics which incorporate social, environmental and economic criteria of the area in their decision making in the form of sustainability policy templates. Our heuristics solve the p-median problem; they minimize the distance of stations to important points constrained by the cost of new stations. We show that our proposed solution is able to disperse the new stations within the city while covering local neighbourhoods. This work is replicated in two big European cities adapted to different open data and demonstrated by a dedicated visual dashboard.",

Despite the interest in HAR for a wide spectrum of domains (technological, medical, etc.) only a few works exist, which study the variability in IoT data. To correctly perceive this variability, it is essential to dynamically model the evolving context of daily-life activities. Additionally, it is required to reduce the calculation cost of HAR, which is crucial for security and real-time applications. For the purpose of dynamically modeling, three context-aware approaches are formalized along with a context-free baseline. This study demonstrates improvements in terms of both of accuracy and calculation cost by considering variability in IoT data; our experimental study on real datasets reduced calculation cost by 20% while increasing accuracy by 20%.",

            "abstract": "Indoor occupancy estimation is a critical analytical task for several applications (e.g., social isolation of elderlies). The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices enabled the occupancy estimation, as it provided access to a mass amount of data. Several works have been proposed exploiting the IoT Passive Inference (PIR) or environmental (e.g., CO2) features. These works however are traditionally selecting the feature space at the learning phase and passively using it over time. Hence, they ignore the dynamics of indoor occupancy, such as the location of the occupant or his motion patterns, leading to a decreasing accuracy over time. In this paper, we study those dynamics and show that motion patterns, along with environmental features favor the occupancy estimation. We design a Location-Aware Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which dynamically adapts the feature space based on the occupant's location. Our experiments on real data show that Location-Aware HMM can reach up to 10% better accuracy than Conventional HMM.",

We propose rating maps, a collection of (population segment, rating distribution) pairs, where a segment, e.g., {18-29 year old males in CA} has a rating distribution in the form of a histogram that aggregates its ratings for a set of items (e.g., movies starring Russel Crowe). We formalize the problem of building rating maps dynamically given desired input distributions. Our problem raises two challenges: (i) the choice of an appropriate measure for comparing rating distributions, and (ii) the design of efficient algorithms to find segments. We show that the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is well-adapted to comparing rating distributions and prove that finding segments whose rating distribution is close to input ones is NP-complete. We propose an efficient algorithm for building Partition Decision Trees and heuristics for combining the resulting partitions to further improve their quality.

            "abstract": "Variability in Big Data refers to data whose meaning changes continuously. For instance, data derived from social platforms and from monitoring applications, exhibits great variability. This variability is essentially the result of changes in the underlying data distributions of attributes of interest, such as user opinions/ratings, computer network measurements, etc. Difference Analysis aims to study variability in Big Data. To achieve that goal, data scientists need: (a) measures to compare data in various dimensions such as age for users or topic for network traffic, and (b) efficient algorithms to detect changes in massive data. In this thesis, we identify and study three novel analytical tasks to capture data variability: Difference Exploration, Difference Explanation and Difference Evolution. Difference Exploration is concerned with extracting the opinion of different user segments (e.g., on a movie rating website). We propose appropriate measures for comparing user opinions in the form of rating distributions, and efficient algorithms that, given an opinion of interest in the form of a rating histogram, discover agreeing and disagreeing populations. Difference Explanation tackles the question of providing a succinct explanation of differences between two datasets of interest (e.g., buying habits of two sets of customers). We propose scoring functions designed to rank explanations, and algorithms that guarantee explanation conciseness and informativeness. Finally, Difference Evolution tracks change in an input dataset over time and summarizes change at multiple time granularities. We propose a query-based approach that uses similarity measures to compare consecutive clusters over time. Our indexes and algorithms for Difference Evolution are designed to capture different data arrival rates (e.g., low, high) and different types of change (e.g., sudden, incremental). The utility and scalability of all our algorithms relies on hierarchies inherent in data (e.g., time, demographic). We run extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets to validate the usefulness of the three analytical tasks and the scalability of our algorithms. We show that Difference Exploration guides end-users and data scientists in uncovering the opinion of different user segments in a scalable way. Difference Explanation reveals the need to parsimoniously summarize differences between two datasets and shows that parsimony can be achieved by exploiting hierarchy in data. Finally, our study on Difference Evolution provides strong evidence that a query-based approach is well-suited to tracking change in datasets with varying arrival rates and at multiple time granularities. Similarly, we show that different clustering approaches can be used to capture different types of change.",

            "abstract": "Gaining deep insights of the social Web content is a challenging Big Data analytics problem, especially when dealing with social posts of high volume and arrival rate consisting of high variable topics. Detecting and tracking the topics that the users discuss in popular microblogging applications like Twitter and studying the evolution of each topic reveals crowd interests and intelligence. The evolution summarizes the changes that are occurring on the topics over a given time horizon inside the evolving data stream. For instance, some topics may disappear at some point in time due to lack of users' interest, while others are retained over time adopting either a stable or an evolving behaviour. The analysis and storage of such dynamic and massive content with spatio-thematic properties poses new challenges for research.",
