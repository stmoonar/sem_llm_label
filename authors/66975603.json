            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you all to the 7th International Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks (DMSN'10), which takes place in Singapore on September 13, 2010. The annual DMSN workshop is a leading international forum that covers all important aspects of sensor data management, including data acquisition, processing, and storage in remote wireless networks; the handling of uncertain sensor data; and the management of heterogeneous and sometimes sensitive sensor data in databases. It brings together a wide range of researchers, practitioners, and users to explore and share scientific and industrial challenges that arise in the aforementioned contexts. We hope you find the workshop academically stimulating and the location interesting and enjoyable. \n \nOne of our main objectives was to bring forward an exciting research program, spanning both predominant and emerging fields in data management for sensor networks. DMSN'10 received 10 submissions for research papers, out of those we accepted only 6 papers. The accepted papers were thematically organized in the following categories: Data Provenance, Query Processing, Mobile Sensor Networks and Outlier Detection in Sensor Networks. In addition to research contributions, DMSN'10 features an exciting keynote talk by Prof. Kian-Lee Tan (National University of Singapore, Singapore), with title: \"What's NExT? Sensor + Cloud!?\" Finally, the program also features a panel discussion with title \"Future Directions in Sensor Data Management: A Panel Discussion\", with panelists Dr. Yanlei Diao (University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA), Prof. Le Gruenwald (National Science Foundation, USA), Prof. Christian S. Jensen (Aarhus University) and Prof. Kian-Lee Tan (National University of Singapore, Singapore) \n \nBesides authors that provided the content of the program, several other people have contributed to the successful organization of DMSN'10. In particular, we would like to thank our technically and geographically diverse Technical Program Committee (TPC), which enabled us to make high quality decisions. Our TPC comprised of 32 members that spanned the following continents: North America (50%), Europe (31%) and Asia (19%). Our TPC board came from both Academia (87%) and Industrial Research Labs (13%). We owe our sincere gratitude to all of these members for their excellent work in reviewing the papers and providing valuable feedback under a tight schedule. Every paper was reviewed at least by 3 TPC members. We would like to thank Microsoft for granting us permission to use the Microsoft Conference Management System (CMT) and the entire CMT support team, for their help in setting up and managing the online review process. The latest features in CMT made it extremely easy to cope with virtually all aspects of the paper evaluation process.",

            "title": "Future directions in sensor data management: a panel discussion",
            "abstract": "We will soon celebrate 10 years of research and development in the area of sensor networks. During this decade, we have witnessed the emergence of specialized embedded systems, operating systems, data-oriented management systems as well as programming languages for ad-hoc monitoring of the environment at a high fidelity. All the advances have brought us one step closer to the initial Smartdust vision. The first signs of data management approaches to cope with the inherent complexities of sensor networks arose in 2003, with the release of prototype database systems and the spin off of specialized research conferences (i.e., IPSN in 2003) and workshops (i.e., DMSN in 2004). In the recent years, we have been witnessing a paradigm shift from the initial target of sensor networks, which focused on low-power embedded sensing devices utilized for environmental and habitant monitoring, to new domains involving more powerful devices (such as smartphone devices) and applications (such as people-oriented social networking applications). We have also been witnessing the emergence of complementary technologies such as stream processors, cloud data analytic frameworks, semantic web technologies and others. Although many of these frameworks have similar assumptions and goals, it is not clear how these can drive or be driven in the future by sensor data management research. The aim of this panel is to discuss: (1) to what extend the vision of applying data management techniques to sensor network research has been successful over the years (e.g., adoption of ideas proposed by the community); ii) to examine the significance of recent advances and to identify new directions that can foster research in sensor data management.",
