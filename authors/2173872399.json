            "title": "Improving Distinguishability of Class for Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and applications due to their excellent performance in graph representation learning. Most existing GNNs can only aggregate 1-hop neighbors in a GNN layer, so they usually stack multiple GNN layers to obtain more information from larger neighborhoods. However, many studies have shown that model performance experiences a significant degradation with the increase of GNN layers. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of distinguishability of class to indirectly evaluate the learned node representations, and verify the positive correlation between distinguishability of class and model performance. Then, we propose a Graph Neural Network guided by Distinguishability of class (Disc-GNN) to monitor the representation learning, so as to learn better node representations and improve model performance. Specifically, we first perform inter-layer filtering and initial compensation based on Local Distinguishability of Class (LDC) in each layer, so that the learned node representations have the ability to distinguish different classes. Furthermore, we add a regularization term based on Global Distinguishability of Class (GDC) to achieve global optimization of model performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have shown that the competitive performance of Disc-GNN to the state-of-the-art methods on node classification and node clustering tasks.",

            "title": "Unveiling Implicit Deceptive Patterns in Multi-Modal Fake News via Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning",
            "abstract": "In the current Internet landscape, the rampant spread of fake news, particularly in the form of multi-modal content, poses a great social threat. While automatic multi-modal fake news detection methods have shown promising results, the lack of explainability remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches provide superficial explainability by displaying learned important components or views from well-trained networks, but they often fail to uncover the implicit deceptive patterns that reveal how fake news is fabricated. To address this limitation, we begin by predefining three typical deceptive patterns, namely image manipulation, cross-modal inconsistency, and image repurposing, which shed light on the mechanisms underlying fake news fabrication. Then, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Latent Model called NSLM, that not only derives accurate judgments on the veracity of news but also uncovers the implicit deceptive patterns as explanations. Specifically, the existence of each deceptive pattern is expressed as a two-valued learnable latent variable, which is acquired through amortized variational inference and weak supervision based on symbolic logic rules. Additionally, we devise pseudo-siamese networks to capture distinct deceptive patterns effectively. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our NSLM achieves the best performance in fake news detection while providing insightful explanations of deceptive patterns.",

            "title": "RAW-GNN: RAndom Walk Aggregation based Graph Neural Network",
            "abstract": "Graph-Convolution-based methods have been successfully applied to representation learning on homophily graphs where nodes with the same label or similar attributes tend to connect with one another. Due to the homophily assumption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that these methods use, they are not suitable for heterophily graphs where nodes with different labels or dissimilar attributes tend to be adjacent. Several methods have attempted to address this heterophily problem, but they do not change the fundamental aggregation mechanism of GCNs because they rely on summation operators to aggregate information from neighboring nodes, which is implicitly subject to the homophily assumption. Here, we introduce a novel aggregation mechanism and develop a RAndom Walk Aggregation-based Graph Neural Network (called RAW-GNN) method. The proposed approach integrates the random walk strategy with graph neural networks. The new method utilizes breadth-first random walk search to capture homophily information and depth-first search to collect heterophily information. It replaces the conventional neighborhoods with path-based neighborhoods and introduces a new path-based aggregator based on Recurrent Neural Networks. These designs make RAW-GNN suitable for both homophily and heterophily graphs. Extensive experimental results showed that the new method achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of homophily and heterophily graphs.",
