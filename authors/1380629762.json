            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model training solution, denoted as Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective function that aims to concentrate each class\u2019s features toward their corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to, effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2) anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity training. Gravity\u2019s efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10 classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks but also effectively improves the model training accuracy.",

AVATAR is a side-channel delay-based testing solution that is assisted by a learning model (process watchdog) for tracking the process drift and systematic process variation. AVATAR\u2019s process watchdog model is trained using a limited number of test samples, collected at test time, to tightly correlate the Static Timing Analysis results (generated at design time) to the test results (generated from clock frequency sweeping test). The experimental results confirm that AVATAR detects over 98% of (small) Trojans inserted in the selected benchmarks. We have complemented our proposed solution with a diagnostic test that 1) further reduces the false-positive rate of AVATAR Trojan detection to zero or near zero, and 2) pinpoints the net-location of the Trojan Trigger or Payload.",

However, with the increase in the depth of the networks, the computational complexity is growing exponentially. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to reduce the computational complexity of convolutional neural network models used for many class image classification. Our proposed technique breaks the classification task into two steps: 1) coarse-grain classification, in which the input samples are classified among a set of hyper-classes, 2) fine-grain classification, in which the final labels are predicted among those hyper-classes detected at the first step. We illustrate that our proposed classifier can reach the level of accuracy reported by the best in class classification models with less computational complexity (Flop Count) by only activating parts of the model that are needed for the image classification.",

            "abstract": "With the outsourcing of design flow, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of integrated circuits has become more challenging. Among the security threats, IC counterfeiting and recycled ICs have received a lot of attention due to their inferior quality, and in turn, their negative impact on the reliability and security of the underlying devices. Detecting recycled ICs is challenging due to the effect of process variations and process drift occurring during the chip fabrication. Moreover, relying on a golden chip as a basis for comparison is not always feasible. Accordingly, this paper presents a recycled IC detection scheme based on delay side-channel testing. The proposed method relies on the features extracted during the design flow and the sample delays extracted from the target chip to build a Neural Network model using which the target chip can be truly identified as new or recycled. The proposed method classifies the timing paths of the target chip into two groups based on their vulnerability to aging using the information collected from the design and detects the recycled ICs based on the deviation of the delay of these two sets from each other.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel solution to reduce the computational complexity of convolutional neural network models used for many class image classification. Our proposed model breaks the classification task into three stages: 1) general feature extraction, 2) Mid-level clustering, and 3) hyper-class classification. Steps 1 and 2 could be repeated to build larger hierarchical models. We illustrate that our proposed classifier can reach the level of accuracy reported by the best in class classification models with far less computational complexity (Flop Count) by only activating parts of the model that are needed for the image classification.",

Our proposed solution, unlike the prior art, does not require a Golden IC. Instead, it trains a Neural Network to act as a process tracking watchdog for correlating the static timing data (produced at design time) to the delay information obtained from clock frequency sweeping (at test time) for the purpose of Trojan detection. Using the LASCA flow, we detect close to 90% of Hardware Trojans in the simulated scenarios.",
