            "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are two promising technologies in future communication systems. The integration between RIS and NOMA has attracted the attention of researchers. However, NOMA hasn\u2019t been investigated in multi-cell scenario assisted by multi-RIS with inter-RIS reflection. In this letter, we study the power minimization problem of an uplink multi-RIS assisted cooperative multi-cell NOMA network where RISs, with inter-RIS reflection, are deployed near both the BSs and users. Besides, a new NOMA scheme based on inter-group interference cancellation (IGIC) is proposed to further reduce interference from center users to edge users. Specifically, inter-group interference is eliminated by NOMA, while intra-group interference is mitigated by the joint design of equalizer, transmit power and RIS phase shift matrix. In the simulation stage, the minimum transmit power of different RIS deployment strategies and NOMA schemes are compared. The results show that our proposed scheme based on IGIC and multi-reflection RIS achieves lower total transmit power.",

            "abstract": "Large vision and language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), are rapidly becoming the industry norm for matching images and texts. In order to improve its zero-shot recognition performance, current research either adds additional web-crawled image-text pairs or designs new training losses. However, the additional costs associated with training from scratch and data collection substantially hinder their deployment. In this paper, we present H ELIP , a low-cost strategy for boosting the performance of well-trained CLIP models by \ufb01netuning them with hard samples over original training data. Mixing hard examples into each batch, the well-trained CLIP model is then \ufb01ne-tuned using the conventional contrastive alignment objective and a margin loss to distinguish between normal and hard negative data. H ELIP is deployed in a plug-and-play fashion to existing models. On a comprehensive zero-shot and retrieval benchmark, without training the model from scratch or utilizing additional data, H ELIP consistently boosts existing models to achieve leading performance. In particular, H ELIP boosts ImageNet zero-shot accuracy of SLIP by 3.05 and 4.47 when pretrained on CC3M and CC12M respectively. In addition, a systematic evaluation of zero-shot and linear probing experiments across \ufb01ne-grained classi\ufb01cation datasets demonstrates a consistent performance improvement and validates the ef\ufb01cacy of",

Most existing personalized product search methods model users' individual search interests based on their historical search logs to generate personalized search results. However, the search logs may be sparse or noisy in the real scenario, which is difficult for existing methods to learn accurate and robust user representations. To address this issue, we propose a contrastive learning framework CoPPS that aims to learn high-quality user representations for personalized product search. Specifically, we design three data augmentation and contrastive learning strategies to construct self-supervision signals from the original search behaviours. The contrastive learning tasks utilize an external knowledge graph and exploit the correlations within and between user sequences, thereby facilitating the discovery of more meaningful search patterns and ultimately enhancing the quality of personalized search. Experimental results on the public Amazon datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Modern dataset search platforms employ ML task-based utility metrics instead of relying on metadata-based keywords to comb through extensive dataset repositories. In this setup, requesters provide an initial dataset, and the platform identifies complementary datasets to augment (join or union) the requester's dataset such that the ML model (e.g., linear regression) performance is improved most. Although effective, current task-based data searches are stymied by (1) high latency which deters users, (2) privacy concerns for regulatory standards, and (3) low data quality which provides low utility. We introduce Mileena, a fast, private, and high-quality task-based dataset search platform. At its heart, Mileena is built on pre-computed semi-ring sketches for efficient ML training and evaluation. Based on semi-ring, we develop a novel Factorized Privacy Mechanism that makes the search differentially private and scales to arbitrary corpus sizes and numbers of requests without major quality degradation. We also demonstrate the early promise in using LLM-based agents for automatic data transformation and applying semi-rings to support causal discovery and treatment effect estimation.",

            "abstract": "The volume-wise labeling of 3D medical images is expertise-demanded and time-consuming; hence semi-supervised learning (SSL) is highly desirable for training with limited labeled data. Imbalanced class distribution is a severe problem that bottlenecks the real-world application of these methods but was not addressed much. Aiming to solve this issue, we present a novel Dual-debiased Heterogeneous Co-training (DHC) framework for semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose two loss weighting strategies, namely Distribution-aware Debiased Weighting (DistDW) and Difficulty-aware Debiased Weighting (DiffDW), which leverage the pseudo labels dynamically to guide the model to solve data and learning biases. The framework improves significantly by co-training these two diverse and accurate sub-models. We also introduce more representative benchmarks for class-imbalanced semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which can fully demonstrate the efficacy of the class-imbalance designs. Experiments show that our proposed framework brings significant improvements by using pseudo labels for debiasing and alleviating the class imbalance problem. More importantly, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods, demonstrating the potential of our framework for the more challenging SSL setting.

            "abstract": "Land cover change (LCC) is increasingly affecting global climate change, energy cycle, carbon cycle, and water cycle, with far-reaching consequences to human well-being. Web service-based online change detection applications have bloomed over the past decade for monitoring land cover change. Currently, massive processing services and data services have been published and used over the internet. However, few studies consider both service integration and resource sharing in land cover domain, making end-users rarely able to acquire the LCC information timely. The behavior interaction between services is also growing more complex due to the increasing use of web service composition technology, making it challenging for static web services to provide collaboration and matching between diverse web services. To address the above challenges, a Dynamic Service Computing Model (DSCM) was proposed for monitoring LCC. Three dynamic computation strategies were proposed according to different users\u2019 requirements of change detection. WMS-LCC was first developed by extending the existing WMS for ready-use LCC data access. Spatial relation-based LCC data integration was then proposed for extracting LCC information based on multi-temporal land cover data. Processing service encapsulation and service composition methods were also developed for chaining various land cover services to a complex service chain. Finally, a prototype system was implemented to evaluate the validity and feasibility of the proposed DSCM. Two walk-through examples were performed with GlobeLand30 datasets and muti-temporal Landsat imagery, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed DSCM approach was more effective and applicable to a wider range of issues in land cover change detection.",

            "title": "Evaluating Intent Sharing Communication using Real Connected Vehicles",
            "abstract": "In this paper we experimentally evaluate intent sharing, an emerging vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication class that allows vehicles to share their intended future motion. Using commercially available radios, we implement intent sharing messages according to two different realizations of vehicle intent: (i) bounds of kinematic variables over a time horizon; (ii) expected trajectory specified as target road segments. We test intent messages using real vehicles on highways both in rural and urban environments. The collected data is used to evaluate the performance in terms of packet delivery ratio. Furthermore, using numerical simulations, we reveal the benefits of intent sharing in resolving conflicts during cooperative maneuvers and investigate the effects of packet delivery ratio on the gained benefits.",
