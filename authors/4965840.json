            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for clustering multivariate time-series data. However, real-world time-series data often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we present a S elf-supervised L earning-based A pproach to C lustering multivariate T ime-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding challenge surrounding deep learning algorithms is unpacking and understanding how they make their decisions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) offers methods to provide explanations of internal functions of algorithms and reasons behind their decisions in ways that are interpretable and understandable to human users. . Numerous XAI approaches have been developed thus far, and a comparative analysis of these strategies seems necessary to discern their relevance to clinical prediction models. To this end, we first implemented two prediction models for short- and long-term outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) utilizing structured tabular as well as time-series physiologic data, respectively. Six different interpretation techniques were used to describe both prediction models at the local and global levels. We then performed a critical analysis of merits and drawbacks of each strategy, highlighting the implications for researchers who are interested in applying these methodologies. The implemented methods were compared to one another in terms of several XAI characteristics such as understandability, fidelity, and stability. Our findings show that SHAP is the most stable with the highest fidelity but falls short of understandability. Anchors, on the other hand, is the most understandable approach, but it is only applicable to tabular data and not time series data.",

            "title": "WindowSHAP: An Efficient Framework for Explaining Time-series Classifiers based on Shapley Values",
            "abstract": "Unpacking and comprehending how black-box machine learning algorithms (such as deep learning models) make decisions has been a persistent challenge for researchers and end-users. Explaining time-series predictive models is useful for clinical applications with high stakes to understand the behavior of prediction models, e.g., to determine how different variables and time points influence the clinical outcome. However, existing approaches to explain such models are frequently unique to architectures and data where the features do not have a time-varying component. In this paper, we introduce WindowSHAP, a model-agnostic framework for explaining time-series classifiers using Shapley values. We intend for WindowSHAP to mitigate the computational complexity of calculating Shapley values for long time-series data as well as improve the quality of explanations. WindowSHAP is based on partitioning a sequence into time windows. Under this framework, we present three distinct algorithms of Stationary, Sliding and Dynamic WindowSHAP, each evaluated against baseline approaches, KernelSHAP and TimeSHAP, using perturbation and sequence analyses metrics. We applied our framework to clinical time-series data from both a specialized clinical domain (Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI) as well as a broad clinical domain (critical care medicine). The experimental results demonstrate that, based on the two quantitative metrics, our framework is superior at explaining clinical time-series classifiers, while also reducing the complexity of computations. We show that for time-series data with 120 time steps (hours), merging 10 adjacent time points can reduce the CPU time of WindowSHAP by 80% compared to KernelSHAP. We also show that our Dynamic WindowSHAP algorithm focuses more on the most important time steps and provides more understandable explanations. As a result, WindowSHAP not only accelerates the calculation of Shapley values for time-series data, but also delivers more understandable explanations with higher quality.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms have been moderately successful in diagnoses of diseases by analyzing medical images especially through neuroimaging that is rich in annotated data. Transfer learning methods have demonstrated strong performance in tackling annotated data. It utilizes and transfers knowledge learned from a source domain to target domain even when the dataset is small. There are multiple approaches to transfer learning that result in a range of performance estimates in diagnosis, detection, and classification of clinical problems. Therefore, in this paper, we reviewed transfer learning approaches, their design attributes, and their applications to neuroimaging problems. We reviewed two main literature databases and included the most relevant studies using predefined inclusion criteria. Among 50 reviewed studies, more than half of them are on transfer learning for Alzheimer's disease. Brain mapping and brain tumor detection were second and third most discussed research problems, respectively. The most common source dataset for transfer learning was ImageNet, which is not a neuroimaging dataset. This suggests that the majority of studies preferred pre-trained models instead of training their own model on a neuroimaging dataset. Although, about one third of studies designed their own architecture, most studies used existing Convolutional Neural Network architectures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was the most common imaging modality. In almost all studies, transfer learning contributed to better performance in diagnosis, classification, segmentation of different neuroimaging diseases and problems, than methods without transfer learning. Among different transfer learning approaches, fine-tuning all convolutional and fully-connected layers approach and freezing convolutional layers and fine-tuning fully-connected layers approach demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy. These recent transfer learning approaches not only show great performance but also require less computational resources and time.",

            "abstract": "Ineffective computerized alerts for potential Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) is a longstanding informatics issue. Prescribing clinicians often ignore or override such alerts due to lack of context and clinical relevance, among various other reasons. In this study, we reveiwed published data on the rate of DDI alert overrides and medications involved in the overrides. We identified 34 eligible studies from sites across Asia, Europe, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The override rate of DDI alerts ranged from 55% to 98%, with more than half of the studies reporting the most common drug pairs or medications involved in acceptance or overriding of alerts. The high prevalance of alert overrides highlights the need for decision support systems that take user, drug, and institutional factors into consideration, as well as actionable metrics to better characterize harm associated with overrides.",

            "abstract": "We developed a prognostic model for longer-term outcome prediction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) using an attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN). The model was trained on admission and time series data obtained from a multi-site, longitudinal, observational study of TBI patients. We included 110 clinical variables as model input and Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOSE) at six months after injury as the outcome variable. Designed to handle missing values in time series data, the RNN model was compared to an existing TBI prognostic model using 10-fold cross validation. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the RNN model is 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) for binary outcomes, whereas the AUC of the comparison model is 0.69 (95% CI 0.67-0.71). We demonstrated that including time series data into prognostic models for TBI can boost the discriminative ability of prediction models with either binary or ordinal outcomes.",
