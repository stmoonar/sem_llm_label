            "title": "DMSTG: Dynamic Multiview Spatio-Temporal Networks for Traffic Forecasting",
            "abstract": "Traffic sensor networks are widely applied in smart cities to monitor traffic in real-time. Exploiting such data to forecast future traffic conditions has the potential to enhance the decision-making capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, which attracts widespread attention from both industries and academia. Among them, network-wide prediction based on graph convolutional neural networks(GCN) has become mainstream. It models the spatial dependencies of sensors in a graph with a pre-defined Laplacian matrix. However, understanding spatio-temporal traffic patterns is quite challenging as there is a huge difference in terms of traffic patterns during different periods or in different regions. In addition, the actual data collected can be polluted due to unavoidable data loss from severe communication conditions or sensor failures. Considering these issues, we propose a novel dynamic multiview spatial-temporal prediction framework which takes into consideration various factors, including local/global, short/long term spatio-temporal dependencies and their dynamic changes. We creatively design two different modules to comprehensively perceive the changes in traffic patterns. We first propose a dynamic learning module based on our theoretical derivation to estimate the Laplacian matrix of the graph for GCN timely. We also design a self-attention based module to dynamically assign a weight to each part in traffic data. The spatio-temporal features from multiple views are deeply fused by a feature fusion module. The forecasting performance is evaluated with 5 real-time traffic datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines and be more robust under noisy environments.",

            "title": "A Light-Weight and Robust Tensor Convolutional Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Robust PCA is a popular anomaly detection technique and has been widely used in many applications. Although Robust PCA is promising, it is usually designed in a two-order matrix form, which is inferior to the tensor that can capture multilinearity features of data. Moreover, the detection accuracy under Robust PCA further suffers due to its sensitivity to the rank parameter which is hard to set in practice and the limitation of PCA method in capturing the non-linear feature in the data. To address the issues, we propose a Robust Tensor Convolutional Autoencoder (RTCAE) where the autoencoder instead of SVD is exploited to recover the normal data from the corrupted measurement tensor data. However, directly exploiting deep autoencoder may suffer from the problem of high memory consumption and computation overhead due to the large number of parameters used in autoencoder. To make our anomaly detection lightweight, we further design a Light Convolutional Autoencoder (LightCAE) which contains a compressed autoencoder by exploiting tensor factorization to largely compress the parameters while significantly reducing the computation complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on three real data traces to compare the performance of our proposed schemes (RTCAE and lightCAE) with that of seven baseline algorithms. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed RTCAE achieves the highest anomaly detection accuracy. Moreover, our LightCAE requires over 60 times smaller memory storage than that required in RTCAE while achieving the similar anomaly detection accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Traffic Matrix (TM) is important for network operation and management. However, it is hard to measure the complete TM due to the high measurement cost. Few recent studies propose using sparse measurement with only a subset of origin and destination pairs (OD pairs) while the other OD pairs are reconstructed through matrix completion. Although effective, current sparse network monitoring schemes can hardly support online network monitoring which requires scheduling the sample taking adaptively in each new time slot one by one. To meet the online network monitoring scenario, we propose a sparse network monitoring scheme by exploiting subspace-based matrix completion. Several novel techniques are proposed in our scheme. First, to capture the dynamic rank feature, we design the scheme based on sliding window and propose an algorithm to estimate the rank of current window even though we don't know the data of the upcoming time slot. Secondly, based on the rank estimated, we propose an adaptive sampling scheduling algorithm. Finally, we propose a lightweight algorithm to speed up the reconstruction process by reusing the matrix calculation results in the previous time slot. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme guarantees the high precision of network-wide TM monitoring while significantly reducing the measurement cost.",

            "abstract": "Network monitoring systems struggle with the issue that the measurement data is incomplete, with only a subset of origin-destination (OD) pairs or time slots observed, due to the high deployment and measurement cost. Recent studies show that the missing data can be inferred from partial measurements using neural network models and tensor methods. However, these recovery approaches fail to achieve accuracy, adaptability and high speed, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose RecMon, a deep learning-based data recovery system that satisfies the above three criteria. A global spatio-temporal attention mechanism and a data augmentation algorithm are proposed to improve the recovery accuracy. A semi-supervised learning-based scheme is devised for fast and effective model updates. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to compare RecMon with four state-of-the-art methods in terms of online recovery performance. The experimental results show that RecMon can adapt to the latest state of the network and accurately recover network measurement data in less than 100 milliseconds. When 90% of the data is missing, the recovery accuracy of RecMon improves over the strongest baseline method by 22.7%, 16.0%, and 8.2% in the three datasets, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Detecting anomalous traffic is a crucial task for network management. Although many anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed recently, constrained by their matrix-based traffic data model, existing algorithms often suffer from low detection accuracy. To fully utilize the multi-dimensional information hidden in the traffic data, this paper uses the tensor model for more accurate Internet anomaly detection. Only considering the low-rank linearity features hidden in the data, current tensor factorization techniques would result in low anomaly detection accuracy. We propose a novel Graph-based Tensor Recovery model (Graph-TR) to well explore both low-rank linearity features as well as the non-linear proximity information hidden in the traffic data for better anomaly detection. We encode the non-linear proximity information of the traffic data by constructing nearest neighbor graphs and incorporate this information into the tensor factorization using the graph Laplacian. Moreover, to facilitate the quick building of neighbor graph, we propose a nearest neighbor searching algorithm with the simple locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). Besides only detecting random anomalies, our algorithm can also effectively detect structured anomalies that appear as bursts. We have conducted extensive experiments using Internet traffic trace data Abilene and G\u00c8ANT. Compared with the state of art algorithms on matrix-based anomaly detection and tensor recovery approach, our Graph-TR can achieve higher Accuracy and Recall.",

            "abstract": "Network measurements provide critical inputs for a wide range of network management. Existing network-wide monitoring methods face the challenge of incurring a high measurement cost. Some recent studies show that network-wide measurement data such as end-to-end latency and flow traffic, have hidden spatio-temporal correlations and thus low-rank features. Taking advantage of the low-rank feature, enlightened by tensor model's strong capability of information representation and extracting, this paper studies a novel sparse measurement scheduling problem which selects a proportion of Origin and Destination (OD) pairs to take measurements in the future time slots, while ensuring the data of the remaining un-measured OD pairs be accurately inferred through tensor completion. It is challenging to find the optimal sampling points (OD pairs) without knowing the structure of the future data and also infer the un-measured data in the presence of noise in the measurement samples. To conquer the challenges, we propose several techniques: a tripartite graph to illustrate the relationship between sample locations and tensor factorization, a graph-based sample selection algorithm, and a graph-based robust tensor completion algorithm. We have conducted extensive experiments based on two real network latency monitoring traces (PlanetLab and Harvard) and two other network monitoring traces (including a traffic trace Abilene and a throughput trace WS-Dream). Our results demonstrate that, even with a sampling ratio of less than 5%, our scheme can accurately obtain the complete network-wide monitoring data by inferring the missing ones based on the samples taken. To achieve similar recovery performance, the best peer tensor completion algorithm needs a significantly larger number of samples, with the sampling ratio up to 25-150 times ours.",

            "abstract": "Network traffic anomaly detection is critical for advanced network applications. However, network traffic monitoring data arrive in a streaming fashion and could be infinite, which makes the offline algorithms that attempt to store the entire stream monitoring data for analysis not scalable. To well utilize the strong ability of tensor model, we use a tensor to represent the prior non-anomalous traffic matrices and propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework that can be used to detect anomalies in a streaming fashion by making only one pass over the data while utilizing limited storage. In the framework, we propose a succinct tensor sketch to maintain, in a streaming model, the subspace that can well represent all prior non-anomalous data detected. Using the subspace, anomalies in each new incoming traffic monitoring data can be quickly detected based on a simple outlier score calculation. Further, we prove that the tensor sketch is mergeable. Exploiting this property, we propose a distributed anomaly detection framework in which the distributed node only needs to upload its succinct tensor sketch instead of the raw monitoring data to the central node to calculate the global subspace of the whole network, which greatly saves the transmission cost. We theoretically prove that our tensor sketch based anomaly detection algorithm compares favorably with the offline approach which calculates the subspace based on expensive global Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over other popular online anomaly detection algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Recovery of missing network monitoring data is of great significance for network operation and maintenance tasks such as anomaly detection and traffic prediction. To exploit historical data for more accurate missing data recovery, some recent studies combine the data together as a tensor to learn more features. However, the need of performing high cost data decomposition compromises their speed and accuracy, which makes them difficult to track dynamic features from streaming monitoring data. To ensure fast and accurate recovery of network monitoring data, this paper proposes NMMF-Stream, a stream-processing scheme with a context extraction module and a generation module. To achieve fast feature extraction and missing data filling with a low sampling rate, we propose several novel techniques, including the context extraction based on both positive and negative monitoring data, context validation via measuring the Pointwise Mutual Information, GRU-based temporal feature learning and memorization, and a new composite loss function to guide the fast and accurate data filling. We have done extensive experiments using two real network traffic monitoring data sets and one network latency data set. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three baselines, NMMF-Stream can fill the newly arrived monitoring data very quickly with much higher accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Network-wide monitoring is important for many network functions. However, monitoring data are often incomplete due to the need of sampling to reduce high measurement cost, system failure, and unavoidable transmission loss under severe communication. Instead of only targeting to estimate all missing monitoring data entries with a small set of measurement samples, we study a new order-preserved monitoring data estimation problem to accurately estimate the missing data entries while preserving the data entries\u2019 order in the dataset. We propose a novel order-preserved tensor completion model that integrates both the low rank property and the order information into a joint learning problem to estimate the missing data. With well designed non-convex function to directly approximate the tensor rank and order-preserved constraint under the linear self-recovery method, our model can not only more accurately capture the low-rank property of monitoring data to increase the estimation performance of missing data, but also can capture the order information in monitoring data to ensure the estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments using four real datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art tensor completion algorithms, our proposed algorithm can provide more accurate estimation and keep the value order of recovered entries to more effectively retrieve top-k large entries.",

            "title": "Fast Retrieval of Large Entries With Incomplete Measurement Data",
            "abstract": "In network-wide monitoring, finding the large monitoring data entries is a fundamental network management function. However, the retrieval of large entries is extremely difficult and challenging as a result of incompleteness of network measurement data. Enlightened by tensor model\u2019s strong capability of information representation and extraction, we model the network-wide monitoring data as a 3-way tensor. With tensor completion, the retrieval can be performed after recovering all missing entries. However, this not only incurs an extremely high cost when the tensor is large, but is also unnecessary. Instead, to quickly retrieve large entries at low cost, we transform the large entry retrieving problem to a cosine similarity searching problem, and propose two algorithms: 1) Quickly reordering the factor vectors based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) hash table so that vectors with small cosine distances are placed in the same hash bucket; 2) Quickly finding the similar vector of a queried one that the two together determine a large entry without incurring the high cost of recovering all entries through the dot products. In the process of LSH table building and similarity query, several novel techniques are proposed, including LSH table representation with the LSH forest, good hash table building to support the flexible search of cosine similarity, and bit-shifting-based quick similarity query. Our experimental studies on 4 real world datasets indicate that our technique is at least up to 60 times faster than the approach based on direct tensor completion.",
