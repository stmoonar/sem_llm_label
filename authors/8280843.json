            "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid advancement of China\u2019s urbanization, the contradiction between urban development and the ecological environment has become increasingly prominent, and the urban ecological system now faces severe challenges. In this study, we proposed an ecological index-based approach to monitor and evaluate the ecological environment using a Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform and Landsat time series. Firstly, a long-term series of Landsat images was obtained to construct and calculate the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI). Then, the Theil\u2013Sen median estimation and the Mann\u2013Kendall test were used to evaluate the trend and significance of the RSEI time series and combined with the Hurst index to predict the future development trend of the ecological environment in the study area. Finally, the coefficient of variation method was used to determine the temporal stability of the ecological environment. Taking Zhoushan Archipelago, China, as the study area, we mapped the distribution of the ecological environment using a spatial resolution of 30 m and evaluated the ecological environment from 1985 to 2020. The results show that (1) from 1985 to 2020, the average RSEI in the Zhoushan Archipelago decreased from 0.7719 to 0.5817, increasing at a rate of \u221224.64%. (2) The changes in the areas of each level of ecological environmental quality show that the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago generally exhibited a decreasing trend. During the study period, the proportion of the areas with excellent ecological environmental quality decreased by 38.83%, while the proportion of areas with poor and relatively poor ecological environmental quality increased by 20.03%. (3) Based on the overall change trend, the degradation in the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago was greater than the improvement, with the degradation area accounting for 84.35% of the total area, the improvement area accounting for 12.61% of the total area, and the stable area accounting for 3.05% of the total area. (4) From the perspective of the sustainability of the changes, in 86.61% of the study area, the RSEI exhibited positive sustainability, indicating that the sustainability of the RSEI was relatively strong. (5) The coefficient of variation in the RSEI was concentrated in the range of 0\u20130.40, having an average value of 0.1627 and a standard deviation of 0.1467, indicating that the RSEI values in the Zhoushan Archipelago during the study period were concentrated, the interannual fluctuations of the data were small, and the time series was relatively stable. The results of this study provide theoretical methods and a decision-making basis for the dynamic monitoring and regional governance of the ecological environment in island areas.",

            "abstract": "Floating islands in Lake Victoria, the world\u2019s second-largest fresh water lake, disrupt transportation, fisheries, irrigation, and water quality. Despite their impact, the dynamics of these islands remain unexplored. This study investigates island dynamics within the Nalubaale, Kiira, and Bujagali dams in Uganda, exploring the causes of their formation and the subsequent impact on hydropower production. The study collects data of Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020, CHIRPS precipitation, and Lake Victoria\u2019s water level datasets from 2004, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2020. The results reveal a strong correlation between precipitation, fluctuating water levels, and floating island formation, with nutrient-rich runoff from municipal waste and agriculture promoting island growth. In addition, rising water levels lead to the dislodging of rocks and soil, contributing to floating island formation, which may manifest with a lag time of up to one month. The analysis shows higher correlations between precipitation, water levels, and floating islands during the long (March\u2013May) and short (September\u2013November) rainy seasons as opposed to drier periods (June\u2013August, December\u2013February). The findings indicate that southeast monsoon winds, which transport floating vegetation, also are essential in influencing island dynamics. Consequently, the major drivers of floating islands in Lake Victoria are identified as precipitation, water level fluctuations and wind variations. Finally, a negative correlation between floating island eutrophication and power production at Kiira and Nalubaale stations suggests that the increased eutrophication caused by the presence of floating islands leads to reduced power output at both Kiira and Nalubaale power stations.",

            "abstract": "Transport infrastructure is a fundamental component of the whole infrastructure system and socio-economic development. However, it is still a challenge to identify factors affecting large-scale infrastructure due to the lack of high-quality data and inconsistent methods. To address this issue, this study developed a comparison of data- and knowledge-driven approaches in exploring factors affecting road infrastructure performance in Western Australia using network-level high-resolution road defects data. In data-driven analysis, an optimal parameters-based geographical detectors (OPGD) model, developed based on spatial heterogeneity, was developed to investigate the contributions of explanatory factors from a spatial data perspective. In knowledge-driven analysis, a questionnaire survey was performed through group interviews with regional road management teams to analyze potential explanatory factors. A spatial analytic hierarchy process (S-AHP) approach was implemented to quantify the contributions of factors based on the survey. Finally, the consistency and difference between data- and knowledge-driven approaches are evaluated based on contributions of factors and the predictions of defect risks across the road network. The results indicate that the contributions of factors tend to be similar in both approaches, and the spatial distributions of defect risks predicted by both approaches are highly correlated. The factors and risks analyzed using both methods in rural areas are more consistent than those in urban areas due to the complexity and uncertainty of road defects. Findings from this study are critical to understanding data- and knowledge-driven approaches in transport infrastructure management and determining reasonable approaches for decision-making.",

            "title": "Land Use Quantile Regression Modeling of Fine Particulate Matter in Australia",
            "abstract": "Small data samples are still a critical challenge for spatial predictions. Land use regression (LUR) is a widely used model for spatial predictions with observations at a limited number of locations. Studies have demonstrated that LUR models can overcome the limitation exhibited by other spatial prediction models which usually require greater spatial densities of observations. However, the prediction accuracy and robustness of LUR models still need to be improved due to the linear regression within the LUR model. To improve LUR models, this study develops a land use quantile regression (LUQR) model for more accurate spatial predictions for small data samples. The LUQR is an integration of the LUR and quantile regression, which both have advantages in predictions with a small data set of samples. In this study, the LUQR model is applied in predicting spatial distributions of annual mean PM2.5concentrations across the Greater Sydney Region, New South Wales, Australia, with observations at 19 valid monitoring stations in 2020. Cross validation shows that the goodness-of-fit can be improved by 25.6\u201332.1% by LUQR models when compared with LUR, and prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) can be reduced by 10.6\u201313.4% and 19.4\u201324.7% by LUQR models, respectively. This study also indicates that LUQR is a more robust model for the spatial prediction with small data samples than LUR. Thus, LUQR has great potentials to be widely applied in spatial issues with a limited number of observations.",

            "abstract": "Road network conditions and road quality are directly linked with the performance of an entire infrastructure system. As sensor monitoring of road deteriorations has rapidly increased, road infrastructure performance can now be assessed using multiple measures. However, more effective and accurate quantitative analysis methods are increasingly required. This research explores road infrastructure performance using road deterioration network data in the Mid West Gascoyne region, Australia. A spatial heterogeneity-based segmentation (SHS) model is developed for redefining road segments across the network in terms of sensor monitoring data, and for both project-level and network-level infrastructure systems management. To evaluate the model effectiveness and accuracy, an evaluation system is proposed from four aspects: segment number, homogeneity within segments, heterogeneity among segments, and segment morphology. The SHS model is compared with two widely used road network segmentation methods. The results show that the SHS model can use fewer segments to ensure higher homogeneity within segments and heterogeneity among segments across the network. Meanwhile, the segment lengths are more uniformly distributed as compared with results from other methods. The developed model and findings from this research can significantly improve the utilization of sensor monitoring network data and support multi-scale infrastructure systems management.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Geographical variables are usually not independent of each other. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the effect of interactions among explanatory variables on a response variable to characterize spatially enhanced or weakened relationships among all variables. The geographical detector (GD) model identifies zones for each explanatory variable, divides the study area into spatial units by overlapping these zones, and quantifies spatial associations as the power of interactive determinant (PID) between a response variable and explanatory variables. Consequently, the PID values depend upon the distributions of explanatory variables (i.e. spatial characteristics) and the subsequent division of spatial units out of these explanatory variables. This study has therefore proposed an Interactive Detector for Spatial Associations (IDSA) to optimize spatial division and improve PID. IDSA utilizes spatial autocorrelation of each explanatory variable and optimizes spatial units based on spatial fuzzy overlay to compute PID. We test the IDSA on both a simulation study and practical case that analyzes road deterioration in Australia. Results showed that the IDSA model could effectively assess the PID while existing GD overestimated PID. Hence, the IDSA improves the GD with refined spatial units based on explanatory variables to enhance their local spatial associations with a response variable.",

            "abstract": "Climatic impact on re-established ecosystems at reclaimed mined lands may have changed. However, little knowledge is available about the difference in vegetation\u2013climate relationships between reclaimed and unmined lands. In this study, ecological responses to climatic variability on reclaimed and neighbouring unmined lands were estimated using remote-sensing data at the Pingshuo Mega coal mine, one of the largest coal mines with long-term reclamation history in China. Time-series MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data and meteorological data from 1997 to 2017 were collected. Results show significantly different vegetation\u2013climate relationships between reclaimed and unmined lands. First, the accumulation periods of all climatic variables were much longer on reclaimed mining lands. Second, vegetation on reclaimed lands responded to variabilities in temperature, rainfall, air humidity, and wind speed, while undisturbed vegetation only responded to variabilities of temperature and air humidity. Third, climatic variability made a much higher contribution to EVI variation on reclaimed land (20.0\u201346.5%) than on unmined land (0.7\u20131.7%). These differences were primarily caused by limited ecosystem resilience, and changed site hydrology and microclimate on reclaimed land. Thus, this study demonstrates that the legacy effects of surface mining can critically change on-site vegetation\u2013climate relationships, which impacts the structure, functions, and stability of reclaimed ecosystems. Vegetation\u2013climate relationships of reclaimed ecosystems deserve further research, and remote-sensing vegetation data are an effective source for relevant studies.",

            "abstract": "Strategic maintenance is essential for sustainable road infrastructure development. Accurate estimation of road maintenance effects can support the assessment of maintenance strategies and reasonable allocation of budgets and resources. Road deterioration is affected by sophisticated factors, but accurate investigation of the integrated deterioration factors is limited. This study developed a dynamic trade-off model (DTOM), a hybrid nonlinear and machine learning method, for quantifying temporally varied impacts of factors and examining maintenance effects at the network level. Pavement deterioration factors are classified into three categories: (i) historical observations of roughness, (ii) pavement age, and (iii) traffic, climate and environment factors. Their respective impacts on pavements are estimated using a non-linear least square regression, a joinpoint regression and a random forest model, respectively. Vehicle-based laser scanner monitored high-resolution deterioration data was collected for a large spatial scale road network in Western Australia from 2007 to 2018. Results show that the resurfacing and rehabilitation are essential for strategic reduction of deterioration. Twelve-year maintenance activities reduced the distress of roughness by 7.5% and increased road performance (the percentage of roads with roughness lower than 2.085 IRI) by 14.5% for the whole road network. The DTOM has great potentials in accurately assessing infrastructure maintenance effects and predicting deterioration scenarios.",

            "title": "Nonlocal Band-Weighted Iterative Spectral Mixture Model for Hyperspectral Imagery Denoising",
            "abstract": "Although efficient hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising relies on complete and accurate description and modeling the spatial\u2013spectral signal in HSI, the current approaches do not fully account for key characteristics of HSI, i.e., the mixed spectra effect, the spatial nonstationarity effect, and noise variance heterogeneity effect. To address this issue, this article presents a linear spectral mixture model with nonlocal means constraint (LSMM-NLMC), with the following advantages. First, LSMM-NLMC can effectively learn the signal in mixed pixels in HSI by estimating clean endmembers and abundances for image restoration. Second, LSMM-NLMC can efficiently address nonstationary spatial correlation effect by imposing NLMC on the latent scene signal. Last, LSMM-NLMC provides accurate noise characterization by accounting for noise variance heterogeneity effect using a band-dependent noise model and a band-weighted Mahalanobis distance for similarity measurement. A novel optimization method based on the expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm and the purified means approach is used to efficiently solve the resulting maximum a posterior (MAP) problem. The experiments on both simulated and real HSI data sets demonstrate that the visual quality and denoising accuracy are significantly improved by the proposed LSMM-NLMC compared with previous methods.",
