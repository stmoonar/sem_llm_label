            "title": "Federated Learning with Client-Exclusive Classes",
            "abstract": "Existing federated classification algorithms typically assume the local annotations at every client cover the same set of classes. In this paper, we aim to lift such an assumption and focus on a more general yet practical non-IID setting where every client can work on non-identical and even disjoint sets of classes (i.e., client-exclusive classes ), and the clients have a common goal which is to build a global classification model to identify the union of these classes. Such heterogeneity in client class sets poses a new challenge: how to ensure different clients are operating in the same latent space so as to avoid the drift after aggregation? We observe that the classes can be described in natural languages (i.e., class names) and these names are typically safe to share with all parties. Thus, we formulate the classification problem as a matching process between data representations and class representations and break the classification model into a data encoder and a label encoder. We leverage the natural-language class names as the common ground to anchor the class representations in the label encoder. In each iteration, the label encoder updates the class representations and regulates the data representations through matching. We further use the updated class representations at each round to annotate data samples for locally-unaware classes according to similarity and distill knowledge to local models. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method can outperform various classical and state-of-the-art federated learning methods designed for learning with non-IID data.",

            "title": "Task Offloading for Post-disaster Rescue in Vehicular Fog Computing-assisted UAV Networks",
            "abstract": "Due to more flexible mobility, better line-of-sight (LOS) and faster on-demand deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a unique role for assisting post-disaster rescues, which often require UAVs to perform computationintensive rescue missions. However, UAVs generally have inherent limited computational capacity and battery storage, which makes it challenging to complete the heavy computing tasks within short period of time during the complicated postdisaster recovery. To overcome this issue, we introduce the vehicular fog computing (VFC) system in which a UAV splits and assigns the heavy tasks to the ground vehicles. First, to evaluate the performance of the VFC-assisted UAV network task offloading, the task processing latency and energy consumption are incorporated into a system utility construction. Moreover, we propose a joint UAV and vehicular task assignment scheme (JUVTAS) with the aim of optimizing the performance of the network. Specifically, we propose a genetic algorithminvasive weed optimization (GA-IWO) algorithm to achieve the approximately optimal task assignment strategy. The GA-IWO algorithm combines the global search ability of genetic algorithm and the local search ability of invasive weed optimization to achieve a better optimization performance. Simulation results show that the proposed JUVTAS is able to effectively reduce the latency and energy consumption for task processing. Moreover, JUVTAS achieves superior performance compared to several conventional methods.",

Firstly, based on human body movements collected by Kinect camera, we calculated 3D data of joint point with pinhole model, and established space model of robot and skeleton model of human. Then, we transformed 3D coordinates of human joints into joint values by space vector method, mapping to the joints of the robot and guides the robot to move. Finally, with semi-autonomous control experiment, it shows that humanoid robot action mapping strategy is feasible and effective. Compared with the existing similar research, this paper implements the action guidance control of humanoid robot, enhances the intelligent degree of robot and expands the application scene and scope of humanoid robot. Depending on the human-like appearance, humanoid robot with action mapping could provide a much more intelligent interaction method.",

This paper focuses on detecting and analyzing the interactions on GitHub from several perspectives. First, from a global viewpoint, we build an interaction graph based on GitHub Events to investigate the general structure and attributes of the GitHub interaction network. Second, from the perspective of important users on GitHub, we pay particular attention to those who bridge social circles by spanning across communities. Concretely, we apply the structural hole theory to identify and explore the structural hole spanners in this interaction network. Last but not least, we compare structural hole spanners with ordinary users in several aspects and excavate distinctions between them. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that applies structural hole theory to the interaction graph of a leading social network. It not only provides a unique standpoint on user interactions, but also gives a comprehensive inspection of structural hole spanners.",

            "title": "Blacklight: Scalable Defense for Neural Networks against Query-Based Black-Box Attacks",
            "abstract": "Deep learning systems are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. In particular, query-based black-box attacks do not require knowledge of the deep learning model, but can compute adversarial examples over the network by submitting queries and inspecting returns. Recent work largely improves the efficiency of those attacks, demonstrating their practicality on today's ML-as-a-service platforms. We propose Blacklight, a new defense against query-based black-box adversarial attacks. The fundamental insight driving our design is that, to compute adversarial examples, these attacks perform iterative optimization over the network, producing image queries highly similar in the input space. Blacklight detects query-based black-box attacks by detecting highly similar queries, using an efficient similarity engine operating on probabilistic content fingerprints. We evaluate Blacklight against eight state-of-the-art attacks, across a variety of models and image classification tasks. Blacklight identifies them all, often after only a handful of queries. By rejecting all detected queries, Blacklight prevents any attack to complete, even when attackers persist to submit queries after account ban or query rejection. Blacklight is also robust against several powerful countermeasures, including an optimal black-box attack that approximates white-box attacks in efficiency. Finally, we illustrate how Blacklight generalizes to other domains like text classification.",
