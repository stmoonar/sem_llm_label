            "abstract": "To meet the connection requirements of massive mobile devices (MDs), balance network loads, fully utilize network resources, achieve green and secure communications, joint security service assignment, power control and multi-step computation offloading is performed in ultra-dense multi-task networks, minimizing the network-wide (total/system) energy consumption under users' latency and security cost constraints. To properly manage the severe interferences caused by the deployment of ultra-dense base stations, a frequency band division mechanism is first introduced. Then, in order to eliminate co-channel interferences and further improve bandwidth utilization, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is utilized. To solve the formulated problem in a nonlinear mixed-integer form, we develop a further improved whale optimization algorithm (FIWOA) by improving an existing algorithm (i.e., improved whale optimization algorithm, IWOA). In addition, we also develop another algorithm by enhancing the adaptive genetic algorithm with diversity-guided mutation (AGADGM) using FIWOA, which is named as genetic whale optimization algorithm (GWOA). As for the designed algorithms, some detailed analyses have been made for the convergence, complexity, and parallel implementation. Simulation results show that FIWOA may achieve lower network-wide energy consumption than other algorithms, and GWOA may achieve lower one than AGADGM under strict constraints of delay and security breach costs.",

            "abstract": "Recently, backdoor attacks have become a serious security threat to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Backdoor attacks involve embedding a hidden backdoor into a DNN model, compelling it to correctly classify benign images while erroneously classifying images with backdoor triggers as the target label. However, both current backdoor attacks and defenses have their limitations. In backdoor attacks, they are either non-stealthy or vulnerable to well-designed backdoor defense strategies. As for backdoor defenses, they often rely heavily on additional assumptions (such as determined extra clean images) and are not universally applicable, which may become impractical in the face of the latest backdoor attacks. To address the above problems, in this paper, we investigate the backdoor attack and defense strategies from a multi-channel perspective. Specifically, in terms of attacks, we propose a recolorization based attack method (RC-Attack) to generate triggers in color ab channels, which is more stealthy and effective. In terms of defenses, we propose a reconstruction-based defense method (RC-Defense) to reconstruct the color AB channels and lightness channel respectively, thus making the triggers in the reconstructed images ineffective, which is a more practical solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed RC-Attack in terms of effectiveness, stealthiness and defense-resistance, and also to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RC-Defense.",

Then, under such OFDMA, the system energy consumed by all users [mobile devices (MDs)] and base stations (BSs) is minimized to reduce the huge energy consumed by ultradense small BSs (SBSs) and prolong the standby time of MDs, jointly optimizing the spectrum partitioning factor, local and remote computation capacities, local power, and binary offloading decision. According to the coupling form of optimization parameters in the formulated problem, this problem is first cut into a joint power control and resource (frequency spectrum) partitioning (PCRP) subproblem, a joint user association, and a computation capacity optimization (UACCO) subproblem. Then, we try to design an effective iteration algorithm to attain the solutions to these problems using convex optimization methods. As for this algorithm, we give some detailed convergence, computation complexity, and simulation analyses. The simulation results show that it may achieve a guaranteed offloading performance and lower energy consumption than other existing algorithms.",

However, it contradicts FL\u2019s low communication latency requirement to rely on the cloud to transmit information with data owners in model training tasks. Furthermore, data owners may not be willing to contribute their resources for free. To address this, we propose a single contract to dual contract approach to incentivize both model owners and workers to participate in FL-based machine learning tasks. The single-contract incentivizes model owners to contribute their model parameters, and the dual contract incentivizes workers to use their latest data to participate in the training task. The latest data draw out the trade-off between data quantity and data update frequency. Performance evaluation shows that our dual contract satisfies different preferences for data quantity and update frequency, and validates that the proposed incentive mechanism is incentive compatible and flexible.",

            "abstract": "As one of the significant supporting technologies for mobile virtual reality (MVR), computer vision is latency-sensitive and always requires real-time response and accurate object analysis. However, the limited computational resources of mobile devices lead to high service delay and low analysis quality, resulting in poor quality of service (QoS). By placing the edge service entities (SEs) of the video tasks on the edge server close to the mobile users, a satisfactory QoS can be obtained for MVR systems. Most of the previous works are restricted to optimizing QoS through service placement, while ignoring the key impact of the network access point and video frame resolution selections on QoS. In this paper, we propose an edge service entity placement model, which aims to jointly optimize service delay and analysis quality for MVR systems. Specifically, we design an efficient dynamic edge service entity placement scheme (EDSP-Edge) based on the block coordinate descent theory, which dynamically determines the selection strategies of network access points, service entities and video frame resolutions for users to effectively improve the QoS. We theoretically analyze the performance of EDSP-Edge and get the gap between EDSP-Edge and the optimal performance. Finally, extensive real-data driven simulations are conducted to show that the EDSP-Edge performs close to the optimal scheme and achieves at least 22% performance improvement compared with previous works.",

            "abstract": "Parking violation is a common urban problem in major cities all over the world. Traditional approaches for detecting parking violations mainly rely on fixed deployed sensors and enforcement agencies, which suffer from high deployment costs and limited coverage. With the rapid development of mobile networks, Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has been an effective sensing paradigm. The crowdsensing data can help predict the future parking violation distribution, and the prediction results can provide guidance for user scheduling, i.e., sending the mobile users to patrol areas where many parking violation events may occur. Inspired by this idea, we propose a comprehensive data-driven crowdsensing framework, which incorporates the nested design of a generative model for spatial-temporal data and a user scheduling model. The generative model extracts parking violation hotspots via a data completion module and violation prediction module. Since crowdsensing data is usually temporally sparse and unevenly distributed, a data completion module is proposed to infer the missing statistics in unsensed areas. The violation prediction module then predicts the parking violation distribution. Given the predicted results, the deep reinforcement learning-based user scheduling model coordinates users to visit hotspots for violation detection. Iteratively, the newly collected data can be used to predict the future violation distribution. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations based on two real-world datasets from two large urban cities. The simulation verifies the prediction accuracy and scheduling effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with the baselines.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed extensive applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in various vision tasks. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial images crafted by introducing perturbations into inputs to induce incorrect predictions. Unlike $L_{p}$-norm restricted adversarial attacks, many unrestricted attacks have been proposed by modifying attributes of the image (e.g., edge, color), while the critical components of the image are preserved. However, most existing unrestricted attacks easily introduce unnatural distortions, colors, stains and schemes, in the generated adversarial images. This paper proposes a novel unrestricted attack (named AdvST) to create stylized, natural-looking, and high-transferability adversarial images. The basic idea of AdvST is to embed adversarial perturbations when transferring the style from the reference image onto the original image (i.e., rendering the original image's semantic contents into the reference image's style). To further improve the image quality of generated adversarial images, we refine two kinds of reference images (i.e., photographs and artworks) based on different attractive styles and design two attacks accordingly. For photorealistic attack, we incorporate semantic information obtained from segmentation maps to improve the photo realism of adversarial images. For artistic attack, we propose integrating edge information extracted by the Laplace operator to preserve the structural integrity of the original image. Extensive experimental results validate the superior performance of AdvST in terms of adversarial image quality and black-box transferability compared to benchmark methods.",

To minimize the task processing cost of all users, we try jointly optimizing computational offloading decisions, task offloading proportion, and allocation of communication and computation resources in this paper. Herein, the task processing cost is mainly caused by local energy consumption, wireless communication, and edge computing. Although the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we design an efficient algorithm to find its optimum solution. Specifically, by taking advantage of both the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (IAFSA) and the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), a hierarchical algorithm used for computation offloading (HACO) is designed. Then, the convergence, complexity, and parallel implementation of such an algorithm are analyzed. Finally, compared with other existing algorithms through simulation experiments, it is verified that the designed algorithm may achieve better performance in reducing the task processing cost under strict delay constraints.",

            "title": "Learning Distinct Relationship in Package Recommendation With Graph Attention Networks",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems have been widely developed and extensively used in various websites and platforms to promote products or services to interested users. However, in quite a few sale scenarios, the platform has the necessity to display users a series of items, which is called package recommendation. There is very little research in this area. This article develops a novel and realistic package recommendation system named package graph attention network (PGAT) based on graph neural network. PGAT integrates users, items, and packages to build a unified heterogeneous graph and treat them as a whole. PGAT incorporates an attention mechanism in the first-order neighborhood aggregation operation, which can differentiate the weight of different neighbor nodes to the center node. By performing graph attention and graph convolution operations on the tripartite graph, PGAT can learn node embeddings more expressively and address the problem of data sparse to a large extent. Extensive experiment results on two real-world datasets validate the outstanding performance of PGAT, which is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines by 0.77%\u201310.12%.",

            "title": "DTrust: Toward Dynamic Trust Levels Assessment in Time-Varying Online Social Networks",
            "abstract": "The social trust assessment can spur extensive applications such as social recommendations, shopping, financial investment strategies, etc, but remain a challenging problem having limited exploration. Such explorations mainly limit their studies to static network topology or simplified dynamic networks, toward the social trust relationship prediction. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the social trust by taking into account the time-varying online social networks whereas the social trust relationship may vary over time. The DTrust, a dynamic graph neural network-based solution, will be proposed for accurate social trust prediction. In particular, DTrust is composed of a static aggregation unit and a dynamic unit, respectively responsible for capturing both the spatial dependence features and temporal dependence features. In the former unit, we stack multiple NNConv layers derived from the edge-conditioned convolution network for capturing the spatial dependence features correlated to the network topology and the observed social relationships. In the latter unit, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed for learning the evolution law of social interaction and social trust relationships. Based on the extracted spatial and temporal features, we then employ a fully connected neural network for learning, able to predict the social trust relationships for both current and future time slots. Extensive experimental results exhibit that our DTrust can outperform the benchmark counterparts on two real-world datasets.",
