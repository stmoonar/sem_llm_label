            "title": "$k$-local Graphs",
            "abstract": "In 2017 Day et al. introduced the notion of locality as a structural complexity-measure for patterns in the field of pattern matching established by Angluin in 1980. In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search. Finally, we perform a case study on a DBLP subgraph to demonstrate the potential of $k$-locality for knowledge discovery.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is a widely used and powerful technique to reveal insights into various artificial neural network (ANN) architectures. LRP is often used in the context of image classification. The aim is to understand, which parts of the input sample have highest relevance and hence most influence on the model prediction. Relevance can be traced back through the network to attribute a certain score to each input pixel. Relevance scores are then combined and displayed as heat maps and give humans an intuitive visual understanding of classification models. Opening the black box to understand the classification engine in great detail is essential for domain experts to gain trust in ANN models. However, there are pitfalls in terms of model-inherent artifacts included in the obtained relevance maps, that can easily be missed. But for a valid interpretation, these artifacts must not be ignored. Here, we apply and revise LRP on various ANN architectures trained as classifiers on geospatial and synthetic data. Depending on the network architecture, we show techniques to control model focus and give guidance to improve the quality of obtained relevance maps to separate facts from artifacts.",

            "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful methods for many hard problems (e.g. image classification or time series prediction). However, these models are often difficult to interpret. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is a widely used technique to understand how ANN models come to their conclusion and to understand what a model has learned. Here, we focus on Echo State Networks (ESNs) as a certain type of recurrent neural networks. ESNs are easy to train and only require a small number of trainable parameters. We show how LRP can be applied to ESNs to open the black-box. We also show an efficient way of how ESNs can be used for image classification: Our ESN model serves as a detector for El Nin\u0303o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from sea surface temperature anomalies. ENSO is a well-known problem. Here, we use this problem to demonstrate how LRP can significantly enhance the explainablility of ESNs.",

Additionally, we propose to use a hierarchical approach for clustering in order to get rid of the problem of choosing an appropriate density threshold for community detection, a severe limitation of the applicability and usefulness of the SCAN and DENGRAPH algorithms in real life applications.
