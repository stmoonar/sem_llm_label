            "title": "Large Language Model Agent for Fake News Detection",
            "abstract": "In the current digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms presents significant challenges to societal well-being, public trust, and democratic processes, influencing critical decision making and public opinion. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for automated fake news detection mechanisms. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, prompting exploration into their potential for verifying news claims. Instead of employing LLMs in a non-agentic way, where LLMs generate responses based on direct prompts in a single shot, our work introduces FactAgent, an agentic approach of utilizing LLMs for fake news detection. FactAgent enables LLMs to emulate human expert behavior in verifying news claims without any model training, following a structured workflow. This workflow breaks down the complex task of news veracity checking into multiple sub-steps, where LLMs complete simple tasks using their internal knowledge or external tools. At the final step of the workflow, LLMs integrate all findings throughout the workflow to determine the news claim's veracity. Compared to manual human verification, FactAgent offers enhanced efficiency. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FactAgent in verifying claims without the need for any training process. Moreover, FactAgent provides transparent explanations at each step of the workflow and during final decision-making, offering insights into the reasoning process of fake news detection for end users. FactAgent is highly adaptable, allowing for straightforward updates to its tools that LLMs can leverage within the workflow, as well as updates to the workflow itself using domain knowledge. This adaptability enables FactAgent's application to news verification across various domains.",

            "abstract": "Online news platforms commonly employ personalized news recommendation methods to assist users in discovering interesting articles, and many previous works have utilized language model techniques to capture user interests and understand news content. With the emergence of large language models like GPT-3 and T-5, a new recommendation paradigm has emerged, leveraging pre-trained language models for making recommendations. ChatGPT, with its user-friendly interface and growing popularity, has become a prominent choice for text-based tasks. Considering the growing reliance on ChatGPT for language tasks, the importance of news recommendation in addressing social issues, and the trend of using language models in recommendations, this study conducts an initial investigation of ChatGPT's performance in news recommendations, focusing on three perspectives: personalized news recommendation, news provider fairness, and fake news detection. ChatGPT has the limitation that its output is sensitive to the input phrasing. We therefore aim to explore the constraints present in the generated responses of ChatGPT for each perspective. Additionally, we investigate whether specific prompt formats can alleviate these constraints or if these limitations require further attention from researchers in the future. We also surpass fixed evaluations by developing a webpage to monitor ChatGPT's performance on weekly basis on the tasks and prompts we investigated. Our aim is to contribute to and encourage more researchers to engage in the study of enhancing news recommendation performance through the utilization of large language models such as ChatGPT.",

            "title": "PBNR: Prompt-based News Recommender System",
            "abstract": "Online news platforms often use personalized news recommendation methods to help users discover articles that align with their interests. These methods typically predict a matching score between a user and a candidate article to reflect the user's preference for the article. Some previous works have used language model techniques, such as the attention mechanism, to capture users' interests based on their past behaviors, and to understand the content of articles. However, these existing model architectures require adjustments if additional information is taken into account. Pre-trained large language models, which can better capture word relationships and comprehend contexts, have seen a significant development in recent years, and these pre-trained models have the advantages of transfer learning and reducing the training time for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, prompt learning is a newly developed technique that leverages pre-trained language models by building task-specific guidance for output generations. To leverage textual information in news articles, this paper introduces the pre-trained large language model and prompt-learning to the community of news recommendation. The proposed model\"prompt-based news recommendation\"(PBNR) treats the personalized news recommendation as a text-to-text language task and designs personalized prompts to adapt to the pre-trained language model -- text-to-text transfer transformer (T5). Experimental studies using the Microsoft News dataset show that PBNR is capable of making accurate recommendations by taking into account various lengths of past behaviors of different users. PBNR can also easily adapt to new information without changing the model architecture and the training objective. Additionally, PBNR can make recommendations based on users' specific requirements, allowing human-computer interaction in the news recommendation field.",

            "abstract": "News recommendation systems (RS) play a pivotal role in the current digital age, shaping how individuals access and engage with information. The fusion of natural language processing (NLP) and RS, spurred by the rise of large language models such as the GPT and T5 series, blurs the boundaries between these domains, making a tendency to treat RS as a language task. ChatGPT, renowned for its user-friendly interface and increasing popularity, has become a prominent choice for a wide range of NLP tasks. While previous studies have explored ChatGPT on recommendation tasks, this study breaks new ground by investigating its fine-tuning capability, particularly within the news domain. In this study, we design two distinct prompts: one designed to treat news RS as the ranking task and another tailored for the rating task. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance in news recommendation by eliciting direct responses through the formulation of these two tasks. More importantly, we unravel the pivotal role of fine-tuning data quality in enhancing ChatGPT's personalized recommendation capabilities, and illustrates its potential in addressing the longstanding challenge of the\"cold item\"problem in RS. Our experiments, conducted using the Microsoft News dataset (MIND), reveal significant improvements achieved by ChatGPT after fine-tuning, especially in scenarios where a user's topic interests remain consistent, treating news RS as a ranking task. This study illuminates the transformative potential of fine-tuning ChatGPT as a means to advance news RS, offering more effective news consumption experiences.",

            "title": "Making Smart Recommendations for Perishable and Stockout Products",
            "abstract": "Food waste and stockouts are widely recognized as an important global challenge. While inventory management aims to address these challenges, the tools available to inventory managers are often limited and the usefulness of their decisions is dependent on demand realizations, which are not within their control. Recommender systems (RS) can influence and direct customer demand, e.g., by sending personalized emails with promotions for different items. We propose a novel approach that combines the opportunities provided by RS with inventory management considerations. Under the assumption that there is a known set of customers to receive a promotion consisting of \ud835\udc58 items, we use mixed-integer programming (MIP) to allocate recommended items across customers taking both individual preferences and the current state of inventory with uncertainties into account. Our approach can solve problems with both stochastic supply (inventory and perishability) and demand. We propose heuristics to improve scalability and compare their performance with the optimal solution using data from an online grocery retailer. The goal is to target the right set of customers who are likely to purchase an item, while simultaneously considering which items are prone to expire or be out-of-stock soon. We show that creating recommendation lists exclusively considering user preferences can be counterproductive to users due to possible excessive stockouts. Similarly, focusing only on the retailer can be counterproductive to retailer sales due to the number of expired products that can be considered lost income. We thus avoid the loss of customer goodwill due to stockouts and reduce waste by selling inventory before it expires.",

The main goal for the workshop was to facilitate the exchange of ideas and networking among researchers, media companies, and practitioners within the news recommendation and analytics domain. News consumption has shifted online and increasingly toward social media. Intelligent systems have entered the picture to support users in finding relevant content. These news recommender systems alleviate the problem of information overload via personalizing information access. At the same time, societies face new problems. More and more people doubt the credibility of news\u2014a phenomenon referred to as \u2018fake news.\u2019 News platforms can create filter bubbles, where users only encounter information and opinions that reinforce and conform to their own beliefs. Businesses have emerged for collecting, analyzing, and marketing data concerning readers\u2019 interactions with information sources. Some news outlets blend information and advertising in \u2018native advertising.\u2019 Social media\u2019s influence on readers\u2019 information consumption has reached levels that let governments call into question their status as platform providers.

Furthermore, the defined topics in McClatchy are not mutually exclusive. Some predictions identified as inaccurate are in fact classified into reasonable topics. We further provide a visualization of stories from various defined topics. The predicted results and the visualization of news stories illustrate the untrustworthiness of labeled classes and the intrinsic difficulty of categorizing news stories.",
