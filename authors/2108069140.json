            "abstract": "Motivated by the problem of human-tra\ufb03cking, where it is often observed that criminal organizations are linked and behave similarly over time, we introduce the problem of Coupled Clustering of Time-series and their underlying Network . The goal is to \ufb01nd tightly connected subgroups of nodes that also have similar node-speci\ufb01c time series (temporal\u2014not necessarily structural\u2014behavior). We formulate the problem as a coupled matrix factorization for the time series, combined with regularization for network smoothness. We propose CCTN , and an incrementally-updated counterpart, CCTN-inc , which e\ufb03ciently handles network updates. Extensive experiments show that CCTN is up to 4 \u00d7 more accurate than baselines that consider graph structure or time series alone, and CCTN-inc is up to 55 \u00d7 faster than CCTN . As an application, we explore an exclusive database with millions of online ads on human tra\ufb03cking, and successfully deploy our technique to detect criminal organizations.",

            "abstract": "How do graph clustering techniques compare with respect to their summarization power? How well can they summarize a million-node graph with a few representative structures? Graph clustering or community detection algorithms can summarize a graph in terms of coherent and tightly connected clusters. In this paper, we compare and contrast different techniques: METIS, Louvain, spectral clustering, SlashBurn and KCBC, our proposed k-core-based clustering method. Unlike prior work that focuses on various measures of cluster quality, we use vocabulary structures that often appear in real graphs and the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to obtain a graph summary per clustering method. Our main contributions are: (i) Formulation: We propose a summarization-based evaluation of clustering methods. Our method, VOG-OVERLAP, concisely summarizes graphs in terms of their important structures which lead to small edge overlap, and large node/edge coverage; (ii) Algorithm: we introduce KCBC, a graph decomposition technique, in the heart of which lies the k-core algorithm (iii) Evaluation: We compare the summarization power of five clustering techniques on large real graphs, and analyze their compression performance, summary statistics and runtimes.",
