            "abstract": "Given the growing popularity of graphs, data models like Property Graph and corresponding query languages like Cypher, have become popular in industry and research. However, real-time graph data analysis and management are increasingly important for today's businesses. Still, graph query languages lack the features to handle streaming graph data and their continuous query evaluation. % This demonstration showcases Seraph, a Cypher-based language supporting native continuous querying features. Seraph is formally defined, declarative, and backwards compatible with Cypher. This demonstration gives a comprehensive overview of the language with three use cases and a carefully design Web UI, allowing the execution of continuous queries on the property graphs stream.",

            "abstract": "Aerospace manufacturing companies, such as Thales Alenia Space, design, develop, integrate, verify, and validate products characterized by high complexity and low volume. They carefully document all phases for each product but analyses across products are challenging due to the heterogeneity and unstructured nature of the data in documents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and validate data contained in these documents. We consider a case study focused on test data related to electronic boards for satellites. To do so, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. We store the metadata of the reports in a KG, while the actual test results are stored in parquet accessible via a Virtual Knowledge Graph. The validation process is managed using an LLM-based approach. We also conduct a benchmarking study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in executing this task. Finally, we analyze the costs and benefits of automating preexisting processes of manual data extraction and validation for subsequent cross-report analyses.",

            "abstract": "The high expressiveness and elasticity of graphs has led to the design of a wealth of graph models and query languages, used by practitioners to model real-world processes. The property graph model and corresponding query languages, such as the widely used Cypher, have become popular in both industry and research. However, real-time data analysis and management is becoming increasingly important for today\u2019s businesses, but graph query languages lack the features to handle streaming graph data and their continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, a Cypher-based language supporting native streaming features within industry-ready property graph query languages. We formally define the Seraph semantics by combining stream processing with property graphs and time-varying relations while treating time as a first-class citizen of the underlying semantics, thus laying a formal foundation necessary for future implementations. We further propose its syntax and showcase the usage of Seraph for emerging graph-based continuous queries of real-world industrial use cases.",

Streaming Machine Learning algorithms analyze data streams one sample at a time, progressively updating their models. However, is it necessary to utilize all the data for model updates? This paper introduces the Online Ensemble SPaced Learning (OE-SPL) strategy, an ensemble meta-strategy that combines online ensemble learning and the Spaced Learning heuristic to rapidly learn underlying concepts without using all samples. We evaluated OE-SPL on synthetic and real data streams containing various concept drifts, providing statistical evidence that OE-SPL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art ensemble models while recovering from multiple concept drift occurrences more efficiently, using less time and RAM-Hours.",

The study utilizes leg movement data from wearable sensors on players\u2019 shoes to differentiate between pass and nonpass actions. Balanced, imbalanced and rebalanced datasets are created and analyzed. Several traditional and streaming algorithms are tested, and statistical analyses are performed to assess their performance. The findings indicate that Streaming Machine Learning can achieve comparable or better performance than traditional methods, especially on larger rebalanced datasets. This research highlights the potential of Streaming Machine Learning for online sports analytics and suggests future directions for exploring player tendencies and edge device adaptability.",

Accurately forecasting if the infections will increase or decrease has a high impact, but it is challenging because the pandemic spreads and contracts periodically. Technically, the flow of data is said to be imbalanced and subject to concept drifts because signs of decrements are the minority class during the spreading periods, while they become the majority class in the contraction periods and the other way round. In this paper, we propose a case study applying the Continuous Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (C-SMOTE), a novel meta-strategy to pipeline with Streaming Machine Learning (SML) classification algorithms, to forecast the COVID-19 pandemic trend. Benchmarking SML pipelinesthat use C-SMOTE against state-of-the-art methods on a COVID-19 dataset, we bring statistical evidence that models learned using C-SMOTE are better.",

            "title": "IEBench: Benchmarking Streaming Learners on Imbalanced Evolving Data Streams",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, data coming from electronic devices surround us. Analyzing them all in real-time, also considering the class imbalance and concept drift challenges is a big challenge and the starting point to understand where to innovate. This paper proposes IEBench, an easy-to-use benchmarking environment for comparing streaming learners. We implemented various state-of-art algorithms, and we conducted a comprehensive experimental campaign with IEBench. We evaluated the algorithms on artificial and real data streams with different imbalance levels and concept drift types. We collected empirical evidence of the role and impact of existing methods for rebalancing data streams in improving performance during different types of concept drift. IEBench eases the practitioners\u2019 task of testing existing algorithms on a new data stream and the scientists\u2019 one of developing new algorithms and systematically comparing them with the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "The scientific community has been studying graph data models for decades. Their high expressiveness and elasticity led the scientific community to design a variety of graph data models and graph query languages, and the practitioners to use them to model real-world cases and extract useful information. Recently, property graphs and, in particular, Cypher 9 (the first open version of the well-known Neo4j Inc.'s language) are gaining popularity. Practitioners find Cypher useful and applicable in many scenarios. However, we are living in a streaming world where data continuously flows. A growing number of Cypher's users show interest in continuously querying graph data to act in a timely fashion. Indeed, Cypher lacks the features for dealing with streams of (graph) data and continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, an extension of Cypher, as a first attempt to introduce streaming features in the context of property graph query languages. Specifically, we define Seraph semantics, we propose a first version of Seraph syntax, and we discuss the potential impacts from a user perspective.",

            "title": "Kalman Filtering for Learning with Evolving Data Streams",
            "abstract": "Processing data streams gained much importance in recent years. Standard machine learning algorithms do not cope well with non-stationary streaming data, where decision models evolve and generate so-called concept drift. Online adaptive algorithms emerged to solve these issues. They learn incrementally and generally require explicit forgetting mechanisms to adapt to concept drift. In this paper, we propose the application of Kalman filtering to handle evolving data streams. This novel approach addresses data stream mining and concept drift management challenges from a new perspective, directly modelling a representation suitable for the data streams. First, we study a Kalman filter based learning a pproach and investigate its integration into the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm, namely KalmanNB. Additionally, we propose the Hoeffding Kalman Tree, a combination of the Hoeffding Tree with KalmanNB. Empirical results demonstrate that the Kalman filter based approach inherently manages concept drifts, and it adapts to the emerging concept more rapidly than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, it is an accurate and robust approach and requires less storage while still being faster.",
