            "abstract": "The proliferation of smart technologies has provided significant advances in the way people receive information and interact in smart cities. For instance, smart traffic monitoring systems allow citizens and city operators to receive in real-time alerts about traffic conditions. At the same time, alternative means of transport, such as bike sharing systems, have enjoyed tremendous success in many major cities around the world today and can provide real-time information regarding the mobility of the users. It is quite clear that smart cities systems generate vast amounts of data during their daily operation. Researchers typically focus on analyzing such urban data in order to identify mobility patterns or infer user preferences to provide services to the crowd, such as traffic warning applications. In this thesis, we aimed at analyzing the vast amounts of urban data generated in these systems, that are large in volume, and typically heterogeneous, to identify key insights in their operation and develop a suite of crowdsourcing techniques to improve the working of smart city applications and ultimately enhance the sustainability of smart cities.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of all-or-nothing resource allocation for tasks with diverse resource demands in resource-constrained heterogeneous systems. We observed that allocation approaches based on max-min fairness or admission control, despite their desirable properties, may fall short of satisfying task demands and utilizing the full potential of the heterogeneous system. This becomes particularly clear in high-demand scenarios where certain resource types may be insufficient to satisfy all task demands. We present Pricefair, a new all-or-nothing resource allocation mechanism for task demands in heterogeneous systems. The key contribution of Pricefair lies in its approach to high-demand scenarios when specific types of resources are exhausted. Rather than denying those tasks, Pricefair tries to allocate the surplus of that type of resource to less-loaded, better-performing, although more expensive, nodes in the cluster. In such instances, to maintain fairness, Pricefair employs a dynamic pricing model. By using the concept of price parity, Pricefair ensures that all users with resources in the exhausted tiers share the price increase and pay proportionally based on their resource requests. Through our experimental evaluation in realistic, high-demand scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of Pricefair.",

To offer global counterfactual explainability, state-of-the-art methods construct summaries of local explanations, offering a trade-off among conciseness, counterfactual effectiveness, and counterfactual cost or burden imposed on instances. In this work, we provide a concise formulation of the problem of identifying global counterfactuals and establish principled criteria for comparing solutions, drawing inspiration from Pareto dominance. We introduce innovative algorithms designed to address the challenge of finding global counterfactuals for either the entire input space or specific partitions, employing clustering and decision trees as key components. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, considering various instances of the problem and comparing our proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the consistent capability of our algorithms to generate meaningful and interpretable global counterfactual explanations.",

Recently, a new era of Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) infrastructures has emerged to support smart city applications that aim to address the challenges raised due to the spatio-temporal dynamics of the urban crowd as well as bring scalability and on-demand computing capacity to urban system applications for timely response. In these, resource capabilities are distributed at the edge of the network and in close proximity to end-users, making it possible to perform computation and data processing at the network edge. However, there are important challenges related to real-time execution, not only due to the highly dynamic and transient crowd, the bursty and highly unpredictable amount of requests but also due to the resource constraints imposed by the Mobile Edge Cloud environment. In this paper, we present TIMBER, our framework for efficiently supporting mobile daTa processing pIpelines in MoBile cloud EnviRonments that effectively addresses the aforementioned challenges. Our detailed experimental results illustrate that our approach can reduce the operating costs by 66.245% on average and achieve up to 96.4% similar throughput performance for agnostic workloads.",

            "abstract": "The imminent need to interpret the output of a Machine Learning model with counterfactual (CF) explanations - via small perturbations to the input \u2013 has been notable in the research community. Although the variety of CF examples is important, the aspect of them being feasible at the same time, does not necessarily apply in their entirety. This work uses different benchmark datasets to examine through the preservation of the logical causal relations of their attributes, whether CF examples can be generated after a small amount of changes to the original input, be feasible and actually useful to the enduser in a real-world case. To achieve this, we used a black box model as a classifier, to distinguish the desired from the input class and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate feasible CF examples. As an extension, we also extracted two-dimensional manifolds (one for each dataset) that located the majority of the feasible examples, a representation that adequately distinguished them from infeasible ones. For our experimentation we used three commonly used datasets and we managed to generate feasible and at the same time sparse, CF examples that satisfy all possible predefined causal constraints, by confirming their importance with the attributes in a dataset.",

            "abstract": "In recent years Serverless Computing has emerged as a compelling cloud based model for the development of a wide range of data-intensive applications. However, rapid container provisioning introduces non-trivial challenges for FaaS cloud providers, as (i) real-world FaaS workloads may exhibit highly dynamic request patterns, (ii) applications have service-level objectives (SLOs) that must be met, and (iii) container provisioning can be a costly process. In this paper, we present SLOPE, a prediction framework for serverless FaaS platforms to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, it trains a neural network model that utilizes knowledge from past runs in order to estimate the number of instances required to satisfy the invocation rate requirements of the serverless applications. In cases that a priori knowledge is not available, SLOPE makes predictions using a graph edit distance approach to capture the similarities among serverless applications. Our experimental results illustrate the efficiency and benefits of our approach, which can reduce the operating costs by 66.25% on average.",

            "abstract": "The problem of privacy protection of trajectory data has received increasing attention in recent years with the significant grow in the volume of users that contribute trajectory data with rich user information. This creates serious privacy concerns as exposing an individual's privacy information may result in attacks threatening the user's safety. In this demonstration we present $TP^{3}$ a novel practical framework for supporting trajectory privacy preservation in Mobile Cloud Environments (MCEs). In $TP^{3}$, non-expert users submit their trajectories and the system is responsible to determine their privacy exposure before sharing them to data analysts in return for various benefits, e.g. better recommendations. $TP^{3}$ makes a number of contributions: (a) It evaluates the privacy exposure of the users utilizing various privacy operations, (b) it is latency-efficient as it implements the privacy operations as serverless functions which can scale automatically to serve an increasing number of users with low latency, and (c) it is practical and cost-efficient as it exploits the serverless model to adapt to the demands of the users with low operational costs for the service provider. Finally, $TP^{3}$'s Web-UI provides insights to the service provider regarding the performance and the respective revenue from the service usage, while enabling the user to submit the trajectories with recommended preferences of privacy.",

Thus, addressing these privacy risks is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we present $TP^{3}$, a Privacy Protection system for Trajectory analytics. Our contributions are the following: (1) we model a new type of attack, namely \u201csocial link exploitation attack\u201d, (2) we utilize the coresets theory, a fast and accurate technique which approximates well the original data using a small data set, and running queries on the coreset produces similar results to the original data, and (3) we employ the Serverless computing paradigm to accommodate a set of privacy operations for achieving high system performance with minimized provisioning costs, while preserving the users' privacy. We have developed these techniques in our $TP^{3}$ system that works with state-of-the-art trajectory analytics apps and applies different types of privacy operations.

            "abstract": "Bike-sharing systems have enjoyed tremendous success in many major cities around the world today as a new means of urban public transportation offering a green and facile solution for daily commuters and tourists. One common problem featured in these systems is that the distribution of bikes among stations can be quite uneven, due to topography, rush hours or during the occurrence of major events around the city. This often results in shortage of bikes or bike parking racks. An unbalanced bike system means an unreliable form of transportation and disappointed users. Existing works in the literature are limited as they are not designed to handle fluctuating, high or unpredictable demand during large city events that typically affect multiple stations and require rebalancing in real-time, during the event, to ensure seamless operation. In this work, we present \u201cSmartBIKER\u201d, a cost-effective framework for bike sharing systems focusing on major city events. SmartBIKER models bike demand trends during major events, identifies bike stations with low or high demand using a trend forecasting model and determines a relocation strategy that minimizes the relocation cost while maximizing the utility of the stations. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is practical, efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art relocation and prediction schemes.",
