            "title": "Effective Clustering on Large Attributed Bipartite Graphs",
            "abstract": "Attributed bipartite graphs (ABGs) are an expressive data model for describing the interactions between two sets of heterogeneous nodes that are associated with rich attributes, such as customer-product purchase networks and author-paper authorship graphs. Partitioning the target node set in such graphs into k disjoint clusters (referred to as k-ABGC) finds widespread use in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. However, the majority of existing solutions towards k-ABGC either overlook attribute information or fail to capture bipartite graph structures accurately, engendering severely compromised result quality. The severity of these issues is accentuated in real ABGs, which often encompass millions of nodes and a sheer volume of attribute data, rendering effective k-ABGC over such graphs highly challenging. In this paper, we propose TPO, an effective and efficient approach to k-ABGC that achieves superb clustering performance on multiple real datasets. TPO obtains high clustering quality through two major contributions: (i) a novel formulation and transformation of the k-ABGC problem based on multi-scale attribute affinity specialized for capturing attribute affinities between nodes with the consideration of their multi-hop connections in ABGs, and (ii) a highly efficient solver that includes a suite of carefully-crafted optimizations for sidestepping explicit affinity matrix construction and facilitating faster convergence. Extensive experiments, comparing TPO against 19 baselines over 5 real ABGs, showcase the superior clustering quality of TPO measured against ground-truth labels. Moreover, compared to the state of the arts, TPO is often more than 40x faster over both small and large ABGs.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous to model complex data. There are urgent needs on powerful heterogeneous graph neural networks to effectively support important applications. We identify a potential semantic mixing issue in existing message passing processes, where the representations of the neighbors of a node $v$ are forced to be transformed to the feature space of $v$ for aggregation, though the neighbors are in different types. That is, the semantics in different node types are entangled together into node $v$'s representation. To address the issue, we propose SlotGAT with separate message passing processes in slots, one for each node type, to maintain the representations in their own node-type feature spaces. Moreover, in a slot-based message passing layer, we design an attention mechanism for effective slot-wise message aggregation. Further, we develop a slot attention technique after the last layer of SlotGAT, to learn the importance of different slots in downstream tasks. Our analysis indicates that the slots in SlotGAT can preserve different semantics in various feature spaces. The superiority of SlotGAT is evaluated against 13 baselines on 6 datasets for node classification and link prediction. Our code is at https://github.com/scottjiao/SlotGAT_ICML23/.",

            "title": "BOURNE: Bootstrapped Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Unified Graph Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its critical application in a wide range of domains, such as social networks, financial risk management, and traffic analysis. Existing GAD methods can be categorized into node and edge anomaly detection models based on the type of graph objects being detected. However, these methods typically treat node and edge anomalies as separate tasks, overlooking their associations and frequent co-occurrences in real-world graphs. As a result, they fail to leverage the complementary information provided by node and edge anomalies for mutual detection. Additionally, state-of-the-art GAD methods, such as CoLA and SL-GAD, heavily rely on negative pair sampling in contrastive learning, which incurs high computational costs, hindering their scalability to large graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified graph anomaly detection framework based on bootstrapped self-supervised learning (named BOURNE). We extract a subgraph (graph view) centered on each target node as node context and transform it into a dual hypergraph (hypergraph view) as edge context. These views are encoded using graph and hypergraph neural networks to capture the representations of nodes, edges, and their associated contexts. By swapping the context embeddings between nodes and edges and measuring the agreement in the embedding space, we enable the mutual detection of node and edge anomalies. Furthermore, BOURNE can eliminate the need for negative sampling, thereby enhancing its efficiency in handling large graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of BOURNE in detecting both node and edge anomalies.",

            "abstract": "We study route planning that utilizes historical trajectories to predict a realistic route from a source to a destination on a road network at given departure time. Route planning is a fundamental task in many location-based services. It is challenging to capture latent patterns implied by complex trajectory data for accurate route planning. Recent studies mainly resort to deep learning techniques that incur immense computational costs, especially on massive data, while their effectiveness are complicated to interpret.\n \n This paper proposes DRPK, an effective and efficient route planning method that achieves state-of-the-art performance via a series of novel algorithmic designs. In brief, observing that a route planning query (RPQ) with closer source and destination is easier to be accurately predicted, we fulfill a promising idea in DRPK to first detect the key segment of an RPQ by a classification model KSD, in order to split the RPQ into shorter RPQs, and then handle the shorter RPQs by a destination-driven route planning procedure DRP. Both KSD and DRP modules rely on a directed association (DA) indicator, which captures the dependencies between road segments from historical trajectories in a surprisingly intuitive but effective way. Leveraging the DA indicator, we develop a set of well-thought-out key segment concepts that holistically consider historical trajectories and RPQs. KSD is powered by effective encoders to detect high-quality key segments, without inspecting all segments in a road network for efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on 5 large-scale datasets. DRPK consistently achieves the highest effectiveness, often with a significant margin over existing methods, while being much faster to train. Moreover, DRPK is efficient to handle thousands of online RPQs in a second,\n e.g.\n , 2768 RPQs per second on a PT dataset,\n i.e.\n , 0.36 milliseconds per RPQ.\n",

            "abstract": "Hypergraphs are an omnipresent data structure used to represent high-order interactions among entities. Given a hypergraph H wherein nodes are associated with attributes, attributed hypergraph clustering (AHC) aims to partition the nodes in H into k disjoint clusters, such that intra-cluster nodes are closely connected and share similar attributes, while inter-cluster nodes are far apart and dissimilar. It is highly challenging to capture multi-hop connections via nodes or attributes on large attributed hypergraphs for accurate clustering. Existing AHC solutions suffer from issues of prohibitive computational costs, sub-par clustering quality, or both. In this paper, we present AHCKA, an efficient approach to AHC, which achieves state-of-the-art result quality via several algorithmic designs. Under the hood, AHCKA includes three key components: (i) a carefully-crafted K-nearest neighbor augmentation strategy for the optimized exploitation of attribute information on hypergraphs, (ii) a joint hypergraph random walk model to devise an effective optimization objective towards AHC, and (iii) a highly efficient solver with speedup techniques for the problem optimization. Extensive experiments, comparing AHCKA against 15 baselines over 8 real attributed hypergraphs, reveal that AHCKA is superior to existing competitors in terms of clustering quality, while often being up to orders of magnitude faster.",

            "abstract": "A bipartite graph contains inter-set edges between two disjoint vertex sets, and is widely used to model real-world data, such as user-item purchase records, author-article publications, and biological interactions between drugs and proteins. k-Bipartite Graph Clustering (k-BGC) is to partition the target vertex set in a bipartite graph into k disjoint clusters. The clustering quality is important to the utility of k-BGC in various applications like social network analysis, recommendation systems, text mining, and bioinformatics, to name a few. Existing approaches to k-BGC either output clustering results with compromised quality due to inadequate exploitation of high-order information between vertices, or fail to handle sizable bipartite graphs with billions of edges. Motivated by this, this paper presents two efficient k-BGC solutions, HOPE and HOPE+, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale bipartite graphs. HOPE obtains high scalability and effectiveness through a new k-BGC problem formulation based on the novel notion of high-order perspective (HOP) vectors and an efficient technique for low-rank approximation of HOP vectors. HOPE+ further elevates the k-BGC performance to another level with a judicious problem transformation and a highly efficient two-stage optimization framework. Two variants, HOPE+ (FNEM) and HOPE+ (SNEM) are designed when either the Frobenius norm or spectral norm is applied in the transformation. Extensive experiments, comparing HOPE and HOPE+ against 13 competitors on 10 real-world datasets, exhibit that our solutions, especially HOPE+, are superior to existing methods in terms of result quality, while being up to orders of magnitude faster. On the largest dataset MAG with 1.1 billion edges, HOPE+ is able to produce clusters with the highest clustering accuracy within 31 minutes, which is unmatched by any existing solution for k-BGC.",

            "abstract": "Given a bipartite graph G consisting of inter-set weighted edges connecting the nodes in two disjoint sets U and V, bipartite network embedding (BNE) maps each node ui in U and vj in V to compact embedding vectors that capture the hidden topological features surrounding the nodes, to facilitate downstream tasks. Effective BNE should preserve not only the direct connections between nodes but also the multi-hop relationships formed alternately by the two types of nodes in G, which can incur prohibitive overheads, especially on massive bipartite graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges. Existing solutions are hardly scalable to massive bipartite graphs, and often produce low-quality results. This paper proposes GEBE, a generic BNE framework achieving state-of-the-art performance on massive bipartite graphs, via four main algorithmic designs. First, we present two generic measures to capture the multi-hop similarity/proximity between homogeneous/heterogeneous nodes respectively, and the measures can be instantiated with three popular probability distributions, including Poisson, Geometric, and Uniform distributions. Second, GEBE formulates a novel and unified BNE objective to preserve the two measures of all possible node pairs. Third, GEBE includes several efficiency designs to get high-quality embeddings on massive graphs. Finally, we observe that GEBE achieves the best performance when instantiating MHS and MHP using a Poisson distribution, and thus, we further develop GEBEp based on Poisson-instantiated MHS and MHP, with non-trivial efficiency optimizations. Extensive experiments, comparing 15 competitors on 10 real datasets, demonstrate that our solutions, especially GEBEp, obtain superior result utility than all competitors for top-N recommendation and link prediction, while being up to orders of magnitude faster.",

            "title": "Efficiently Answering k-hop Reachability Queries in Large Dynamic Graphs for Fraud Feature Extraction",
            "abstract": "Instant messaging client (IMC) is now an essential tool for mobile users. In the representative IMC We Chat, cybercriminals deceive frauds, causing financial loss to normal users. Through statistical analysis, we find that certain fraud interactions commonly occur among WeChat users who are not k-hop neighbors. Therefore, efficiently answering whether the distance between two vertices is not longer than k at a certain time point (i.e., k-hop reachability queries) over the dynamic social graph of WeChat becomes a crucial task for fraud feature extraction in the detection system: it can help human experts quickly identify suspicious user interactions and the query results can be further used as the input feature to the downstream machine learning based detection methods. In this paper, we illustrate Bidirectional k-hop Reachability Query Processing over a Dynamic Graph (BREAD) that is used in WeChat for extracting the k-hop reachability feature for fraud detection. BREAD adopts the idea of estimating Personalized PageRank value. It first conducts the backward search from the destination vertex to construct an intermediate vertex set. Then, it performs a certain amount of random walks from the start vertex to see whether they can hit the intermediate vertex set, and the results are returned to answer k-hop reachability queries. We further propose $\\text{BREAD}++$ that leverages the massive parallel processing power of GPU to achieve a considerable performance gain. Experiments on several large-scale dynamic graph benchmarks and the social graph of WeChat have demonstrated that $\\text{BREAD}/\\text{BREAD}++$ is superior than existing index-free competitors: our methods provide not only fast but also accurate responses and they are of practical value to k-hop reachability feature extraction in the fraud detection system of WeChat. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/XMUDM/BREAD.",
