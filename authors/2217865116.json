            "title": "M3KE: A Massive Multi-Level Multi-Subject Knowledge Evaluation Benchmark for Chinese Large Language Models",
            "abstract": "Large language models have recently made tremendous progress in a variety of aspects, e.g., cross-task generalization, instruction following. Comprehensively evaluating the capability of large language models in multiple tasks is of great importance. In this paper, we propose M3KE, a Massive Multi-Level Multi-Subject Knowledge Evaluation benchmark, which is developed to measure knowledge acquired by Chinese large language models by testing their multitask accuracy in zero- and few-shot settings. We have collected 20,477 questions from 71 tasks. Our selection covers all major levels of Chinese education system, ranging from the primary school to college, as well as a wide variety of subjects, including humanities, history, politics, law, education, psychology, science, technology, art and religion. All questions are multiple-choice questions with four options, hence guaranteeing a standardized and unified assessment process. We've assessed a number of state-of-the-art open-source Chinese large language models on the proposed benchmark. The size of these models varies from 335M to 130B parameters. Experiment results demonstrate that they perform significantly worse than GPT-3.5 that reaches an accuracy of ~ 48% on M3KE. The dataset is available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/M3KE.",

            "title": "A Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework for Fake News Detection",
            "abstract": "Recently, the wanton dissemination of fake news on social media has adversely affected our lives, rendering automatic fake news detection a pressing issue. Current methods are often fully supervised and typically employ deep neural networks (DNN) to learn implicit relevance from labeled data, ignoring explicitly shared properties (e.g., inflammatory expressions) across fake news. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-theoretic framework, called Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework (GDMRFF), that inherits the capability of deep learning while at the same time exploiting the correlations among the news articles (including labeled and unlabeled data). Specifically, we first leverage a DNN-based module to learn implicit relations, which we then reveal as the unary function of MRF. Pairwise functions with refining effects to encapsulate human insights are designed to capture the explicit association among all samples. Meanwhile, an event removal module is introduced to remove event impact on pairwise functions. Note that we train GDMRFF with the semi-supervised setting, which decreases the reliance on labeled data while maximizing the potential of unlabeled data. We further develop an Ambiguity Learning Guided MRF (ALGM) model as a concretization of GDMRFF. Experiments show that ALGM outperforms the compared methods significantly on two datasets, especially when labeled data is limited.",
