            "abstract": "Video super-resolution (SR) reconstruction technology aims at obtaining high quality reconstruction of high-resolution (HR) video sequences by inferring the lost detailed information from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. However, this technology is an ill-posed problem because significant detailed information is lost in the process of video degrading. The existing learning-based SR reconstruction methods can be adapted to a larger super-resolution factor, but it cannot be guaranteed that any low-resolution image block can find its corresponding high-resolution block matching in a limited-scale training set. Some noise and over smooth phenomenon usually exist while dealing with some unique features that rarely appear in a given training data set. The self-similarity based SR methods do not rely on accurate sub-pixel motion estimation and thus can be adapted to complex motion patterns. However, under conditions of insufficient internal similar blocks, some visual flaws are usually produced due to the mismatched internal instances.",

Existing graph-based SBR methods all lack the ability to differentiate between sessions with the same last item, and suffer from severe popularity bias. Inspired by nowadays emerging contrastive learning methods, this paper presents a Simple Contrastive Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation (SimCGNN). In SimCGNN, we first obtain normalized session embeddings on constructed session graphs. We next construct positive and negative samples of the sessions by two forward propagation and a novel negative sample selection strategy, and then calculate the constructive loss. Finally, session embeddings are used to give prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-word datasets show our SimCGNN achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, with the increase of social investment in scientific research, the number of research results in various fields has increased significantly. Accurately and effectively predicting the trends of future research topics can help researchers discover future research hotspots. However, due to the increasingly close correlation between various research themes, there is a certain dependency relationship between a large number of research themes. Viewing a single research theme in isolation and using traditional sequence problem processing methods cannot effectively explore the spatial dependencies between these research themes. To simultaneously capture the spatial dependencies and temporal changes between research topics, we propose a deep neural network-based research topic hotness prediction algorithm, a spatiotemporal convolutional network model. Our model combines a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), specifically, GCNs are used to learn the spatial dependencies of research topics a and use space dependence to strengthen spatial characteristics. TCN is used to learn the dynamics of research topics' trends. Optimization is based on the calculation of weighted losses based on time distance. Compared with the current mainstream sequence prediction models and similar spatiotemporal models on the paper datasets, experiments show that, in research topic prediction tasks, our model can effectively capture spatiotemporal relationships and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "To address the problems in the existing video super-resolution methods, such as noise, over smooth and visual artifacts, which are caused by the reliance on limited external training or mismatch of internal similarity patch instances, this study proposes a novel video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on deep learning and spatio-temporal feature similarity (DLSS-VSR). The video super-resolution reconstruction mechanism with the joint internal and external constraints is established utilizing the complementary advantages of both external deep correlation mapping learning and internal spatio-temporal nonlocal self-similarity prior constraint. A deep learning model based on deep convolutional neural network is constructed to learn the nonlinear correlation mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution video frame patches. A novel spatio-temporal feature similarity calculation method is proposed, which considers both internal video spatio-temporal self-similarity and external clean nonlocal similarity. For the internal spatio-temporal feature self-similarity, we improve the accuracy and robustness of similarity matching by proposing a similarity measure strategy based on spatio-temporal moment feature similarity and structural similarity. The external nonlocal similarity prior constraint is learned by the patch group-based Gaussian mixture model. The time efficiency for spatio-temporal similarity matching is further improved based on saliency detection and region correlation judgment strategy, which achieves a better tradeoff between super-resolution accuracy and speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLSS-VSR algorithm achieves competitive super-resolution quality compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in both subjective and objective evaluations.",

The continuous growth of scientific publications has brought challenges to track the development trends of scientific research topics. The existing topic trend prediction methods have proved that the research topic trend of a publication is influenced by other peer publications. However, they ignore the fact that the research topics of different publications belong to different research topic space. Moreover, the existing topic prediction methods do not fully consider the interactive influence among publications that the research topic of one publication affects the topics of other publications, it is also influenced by the research topics of other publications. In line with this, this paper proposes a scientific research topic trend prediction model based on multi\u2010long short\u2010term memory (multi\u2010LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Network. Specifically, multiple LSTMs are employed to map research topics of different publications into their respective topic space. Then, the graph convolutional neural network is applied to learn the scientific influence context of each publication, so that the research topic of each publication not only integrates the influence of neighbor nodes, but also considers the influence of the neighbors of the neighbor node on the research topic of the publication, so as to more accurately fuse scientific influence context of research topic of peer publications. Experiments results on the data set of scientific research papers in the field of artificial intelligence and data mining demonstrate that the model improves the prediction precision and achieves the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art research topic trend prediction effect compared with the other baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Cross-media retrieval of scientific and technological information is one of the important tasks in the cross-media study. Cross-media scientific and technological information retrieval obtain target information from massive multi-source and heterogeneous scientific and technological resources, which helps to design applications that meet users' needs, including scientific and technological information recommendation, personalized scientific and technological information retrieval, etc. The core of cross-media retrieval is to learn a common subspace, so that data from different media can be directly compared with each other after being mapped into this subspace. In subspace learning, existing methods often focus on modeling the discrimination of intra-media data and the invariance of inter-media data after mapping; however, they ignore the semantic consistency of inter-media data before and after mapping and media discrimination of intra-semantics data, which limit the result of cross-media retrieval. In light of this, we propose a scientific and technological information oriented Semantics-adversarial and Media-adversarial Cross-media Retrieval method (SMCR) to find an effective common subspace. Specifically, SMCR minimizes the loss of inter-media semantic consistency in addition to modeling intra-media semantic discrimination, to preserve semantic similarity before and after mapping. Furthermore, SMCR constructs a basic feature mapping network and a refined feature mapping network to jointly minimize the media discriminative loss within semantics, so as to enhance the feature mapping network's ability to confuse the media discriminant network. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed SMCR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-media retrieval.",
