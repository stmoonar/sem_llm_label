            "abstract": "Automated prognosis has been a topic of intense research. Many works have sought to learn from Electronic Health Records using Recurrent Neural Networks that, despite promising results, have been overcome by novel techniques. We introduce APEHR, a Transformer approach that leverages medical prognosis using the latest technology Neural Network Transformer, which has demonstrated superior results in problems whose data is organized in sequential fashion. We contribute with an innovative problem modeling along with a detailed discussion of how Transformers can be used in the medical domain. Our results demonstrate a prognostic performance that surpasses previous works by at least 6% for metric Recall@k in the public dataset MIMIC-III.",

            "title": "Augmentation Techniques for Sequential Clinical Data to Improve Deep Learning Prediction Techniques",
            "abstract": "Methods based on neural networks have become more and more attractive in the medical domain as Deep Learning frameworks mature and popularize. One application in this context refers to the use of recurrent networks to predict the most probable clinical conditions of a patient, given his/her history of hospital/medical admissions. The problem is that clinical data to support machine learning is scarce, mainly due to privacy matters and to ill-structured medical databases. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to augment clinical data to improve the performance of automatic predictive systems. We introduce two methods to create synthetic clinical histories (trajectories) based on existing data; the first one extracts subsequences of trajectories to emphasize the transition in between hospital admissions; the second method benefits from the hierarchical structure of standard diagnosis codes (like ICD-9) trajectories whose characteristics resemble those of real-world clinics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in two datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of data augmentation in the clinical scenario. Our results shall inspire the augmentation of data in several other scenarios related to the medical domain.",

            "abstract": "Echo State Network (ESN) has been widely studied and applied to many problems due to the simplicity of its training phase. This is because since in this network only the output weights are trained, avoiding to deal with the gradient\u2019s vanishing problem presents in most of the recurrent neural networks. However, this technique has been criticized recently because of the echo property limitation and its random topology that may cause chaotic activity in the reservoir layer. In this paper, we present an application of the classic ESN model modifying the reservoir topology to a non-random approaches: clustered and complex networks, as an alternative solution to the chaotic activity problem. Further, the modified and classical models are compared considering two study cases: R\u00f6ssler and Lorenz systems. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model has a better performance than the classical model.",

This dataset is composed of almost 17 thousand observations made to astronomical objects to identify pulsars (HTRU2). The methodological proposal based on evaluating the accuracy of these different models on the same database treated with two different strategies for unbalanced data. The results show that in spite of the noise and unbalance of classes present in this type of data, it is possible to apply them on standard ML algorithms and obtain promising accuracy ratios.",
