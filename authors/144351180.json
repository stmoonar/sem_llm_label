            "abstract": "This paper proposes a density grid-based algorithm (C_UStream) for clustering on uncertain data stream in sliding window which can find clusters of arbitrary shapes. The statistical summary information of each grid is stored in linked queue structure by using sampling window mechanism. In order to guarantee the validity of clustering, the expired grids in the current window are removed regularly. Furthermore, a dynamic sporadic grids deletion mechanism is developed to delete most of outliers periodically which greatly improve the space and time efficiency. The experimental results on the synthetic and real data sets show that C_UStream has superior clustering quality and efficiency than other similar algorithms.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a grid-based clustering algorithm Clu-US which is competent to find clusters of non-convex shapes on uncertain data stream. Clu-US maps the uncertain data tuples to the grid space which could store and update the summary information of stream. The uncertainty of data is taken into account for calculating the probability center of a grid. Then, the distance between the probability centers of two adjacent grids is adopted for measuring whether they are \"close enough\" in grids merging process. Furthermore, a dynamic outlier deletion mechanism is developed to improve clustering performance. The experimental results show that Clu-US outperforms other algorithms in terms of clustering quality and speed.",

            "abstract": "Clustering real-time stream data is an important and challenging problem. Existing algorithms such as CluStream are based on the k-means algorithm. These clustering algorithms have difficulties finding clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling outliers. Further, they require the knowledge of k and user-specified time window. To address these issues, this article proposes D-Stream, a framework for clustering stream data using a density-based approach.\n Our algorithm uses an online component that maps each input data record into a grid and an offline component that computes the grid density and clusters the grids based on the density. The algorithm adopts a density decaying technique to capture the dynamic changes of a data stream and a attraction-based mechanism to accurately generate cluster boundaries.\n Exploiting the intricate relationships among the decay factor, attraction, data density, and cluster structure, our algorithm can efficiently and effectively generate and adjust the clusters in real time. Further, a theoretically sound technique is developed to detect and remove sporadic grids mapped by outliers in order to dramatically improve the space and time efficiency of the system. The technique makes high-speed data stream clustering feasible without degrading the clustering quality. The experimental results show that our algorithm has superior quality and efficiency, can find clusters of arbitrary shapes, and can accurately recognize the evolving behaviors of real-time data streams.",

To satisfy the realtime demand in classifying stream data, this method defines a new criterion for Fisher discriminate analysis.

It can overcome the problem of singular within-class scatter matrix in traditional FDA.

The algorithm can effectively cluster data streams which show similar behavior with some unknown time delays. The algorithm uses the autoregressive (AR) modeling technique to measure correlations between data streams. It exploits estimated frequencies spectra to extract the essential features of streams. Each stream is represented as the sum of spectral components and the correlation is measured component-wise. Each spectral component is described by four parameters, namely, amplitude, phase, damping rate and frequency. Thee-lag-correlation between two spectral components is calculated. The algorithm uses such information as similarity measures in clustering data streams. Based on a sliding window model, the algorithm can continuously report the most recent clustering results and adjust the number of clusters. Experiments on real and synthetic streams show that the proposed clustering method has a higher speed and clustering quality than other similar methods.",
