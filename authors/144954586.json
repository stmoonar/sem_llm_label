            "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is an important task to support safe and intelligent behaviours in autonomous systems. Many advanced approaches have been proposed over the years with improved spatial and temporal feature extraction. However, human behaviour is naturally multimodal and uncertain: given the past trajectory and surrounding environment information, an agent can have multiple plausible trajectories in the future. To tackle this problem, an essential task named multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) has recently been studied, which aims to generate a diverse, acceptable and explainable distribution of future predictions for each agent. In this paper, we present the first survey for MTP with our unique taxonomies and comprehensive analysis of frameworks, datasets and evaluation metrics. In addition, we discuss multiple future directions that can help researchers develop novel multimodal trajectory prediction systems.",

            "abstract": "The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is an important part of a hospital that provides care for critically ill patients with continuous monitoring and treatment. Various patient outcome prediction methods have been proposed to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making. Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the higher-order relationships, such as patient characteristics (e.g., diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions, are often ignored. This paper presents a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that allows the rep-resentation of non-pairwise relationships among diagnosis codes in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available elCU Collaborative Research Database indicates that our method achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on mortality risk prediction. Moreover, the results of several case studies demonstrated the robustness of the model decisions.",

We establish a system to monitor indoor human mobility with air quality and assess the interrelationship between these two types of time series data. More specifically, a sensor network was designed in indoor environments to observe air quality parameters continuously. Simultaneously, another sensing module detected participants\u2019 movements around the study areas. In this module, modern data analysis and machine learning techniques have been applied to reconstruct the trajectories of participants with relevant sensor information. Finally, a further study revealed the correlation between human indoor mobility patterns and indoor air quality parameters. Our experimental results demonstrate that human movements in different environments can significantly impact air quality during busy hours. With the results, we propose recommendations for future studies.",

This paper explores the construction of probabilistic spatial logics through the combination of established qualitative spatial calculi together with Markov logic networks (MLNs). Qualitative spatial calculi provide the basis for automated representation and reasoning with complex spatial scenes; MLNs provide a rigorous basis for handling uncertainty and driving probabilistic inference. Our approach focuses specifically on the combination of an uncertain knowledge base with a certain spatial reasoning rule-base. The experiments explore how uncertain knowledge propagates through certain qualitative spatial inferences, using the specific example of reasoning with cardinal directions. The results provide a template for probabilistic qualitative spatial reasoning more generally, with applications to a wide range of common scenarios for situational awareness and automated reasoning under uncertainty.",

With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Physiological signals can potentially be applied as objective measures to understand the behavior and engagement of users interacting with information access systems. However, the signals are highly sensitive, and many controls are required in laboratory user studies. To investigate the extent to which controlled or uncontrolled (i.e., confounding) variables such as task sequence or duration influence the observed signals, we conducted a pilot study where each participant completed four types of information-processing activities (READ, LISTEN, SPEAK, and WRITE). Meanwhile, we collected data on blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and pupil responses. We then used machine learning approaches as a mechanism to examine the influence of controlled and uncontrolled variables that commonly arise in user studies. Task duration was found to have a substantial effect on the model performance, suggesting it represents individual differences rather than giving insight into the target variables. This work contributes to our understanding of such variables in using physiological signals in information retrieval user studies.",

            "abstract": "Limited availability of labeled data for machine learning on multimodal time-series extensively hampers progress in the field. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach to learn data representations without relying on labels. However, existing SSL methods require expensive computations of negative pairs and are typically designed for single modalities, which limits their versatility. We introduce CroSSL (Cross-modal SSL), which puts forward two novel concepts: masking intermediate embeddings produced by modality-specific encoders, and their aggregation into a global embedding through a cross-modal aggregator CroSSL allows for handling missing modalities and end-to-end cross-modal earning without requiring prior data preprocessing for handling missing inputs or negative-pair sampling for contrastive learning. We evaluate our method on a wide range of data, including motion sensors such as accelerometers or gyroscopes and biosignals (heart rate, electroencephalograms, electromyograms, electrooculograms, and electrodermal). Overall, CroSSL outperforms previous SSL and supervised benchmarks using minimal labeled data, and also sheds light on how latent masking can improve cross-modal learning.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality from electronic health records (EHRs) has received considerable attention. Such predictions will provide early warning of a patient's health condition to healthcare professionals so that timely interventions can be taken. This prediction task is challenging since EHR data are intrinsically irregular, with not only many missing values but also varying time intervals between medical records. Existing approaches focus on exploiting the variable correlations in patient medical records to impute missing values and establishing time-decay mechanisms to deal with such irregularity. This paper presents a novel contrastive learning-based imputation-prediction network for predicting in-hospital mortality risks using EHR data. Our approach introduces graph analysis-based patient stratification modeling in the imputation process to group similar patients. This allows information of similar patients only to be used, in addition to personal contextual information, for missing value imputation. Moreover, our approach can integrate contrastive learning into the proposed network architecture to enhance patient representation learning and predictive performance on the classification task. Experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both imputation and prediction tasks.",

This research examines the impact of using a self-supervised representation learning model for time series classification tasks in which data is incrementally available. We proposed and evaluated a workflow in which a model learns to extract informative features using a corpus of unlabeled time series data and then conducts classification on labelled data using features extracted by the model. We analyzed the effect of varying the size, distribution, and source of the unlabeled data on the final classification performance across four public datasets, including various types of sensors in diverse applications.",
