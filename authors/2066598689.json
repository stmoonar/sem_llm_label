            "abstract": "Explainable AI is an indispensable goal for an AI-based society with trust, and deriving human-interpretable symbolic rules is one of the promising ways to verify whether the decision is appropriate. This paper explores a hybrid crowd-AI approach to develop white-box ML models associated with human-interpretable symbolic rules. The key idea of the proposed method is to discover human-interpretable latent features from trained neural networks by leveraging human abductive reasoning. The proposed method automatically generates crowdsourcing tasks that display subsets of images corresponding to each latent feature and ask crowd workers to provide the semantics of the features in natural language. The obtained semantics allow us to use the latent features as human-interpretable predicates that form symbolic rules to define target classes. We provide experimental results showing that the proposed approach can obtain interpretable symbolic rules and explanations.",

This paper addresses the difficulties of the optimal platform selection for qualification tasks on one single platform. We proposed a novel approach about assigning qualification tasks to workers iteratively on multiple platforms to maximize the total number of collected qualified workers on a limited budget. We applied Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms to create strategies for the platform selections to achieve this goal. The conducted experiments revealed that (1) the optimal platform is not always trivial, and (2) the strategies created by MAB algorithms can achieve high-quality assignments under different settings which also satisfied different requesters\u2019 needs.",

            "abstract": "A clinical study is often necessary for exploring important research questions; however, this approach is sometimes time and money consuming. Another extreme approach, which is to collect and aggregate opinions from crowds, provides a result drawn from the crowds\u2019 past experiences and knowledge. To explore a solution that takes advantage of both the rigid clinical approach and the crowds\u2019 opinion-based approach, we design a framework that exploits crowdsourcing as a part of the research process, whereby crowd workers serve as if they were a scientist conducting a \u201cpseudo\u201d prospective study. This study evaluates the feasibility of the proposed framework to generate hypotheses on a specified topic and verify them in the real world by employing many crowd workers. The framework comprises two phases of crowd-based workflow. In Phase 1\u2014the hypothesis generation and ranking phase\u2014our system asks workers two types of questions to collect a number of hypotheses and rank them. In Phase 2\u2014the hypothesis verification phase\u2014the system asks workers to verify the top-ranked hypotheses from Phase 1 by implementing one of them in real life. Through experiments, we explore the potential and limitations of the framework to generate and evaluate hypotheses about the factors that result in a good night\u2019s sleep. Our results on significant sleep quality improvement show the basic feasibility of our framework, suggesting that crowd-based research is compatible with experts\u2019 knowledge in a certain domain.",

            "abstract": "Self-correction for crowdsourced tasks is a two-stage setting that allows a crowd worker to review the task results of other workers; the worker is then given a chance to update their results according to the review.Self-correction was proposed as a complementary approach to statistical algorithms, in which workers independently perform the same task.It can provide higher-quality results with low additional costs. However, thus far, the effects have only been demonstrated in simulations, and empirical evaluations are required.In addition, as self-correction provides feedback to workers, an interesting question arises: whether perceptual learning is observed in self-correction tasks.This paper reports our experimental results on self-corrections with a real-world crowdsourcing service.We found that:(1) Self-correction is effective for making workers reconsider their judgments.(2) Self-correction is effective more if workers are shown the task results of higher-quality workers during the second stage.(3) A perceptual learning effect is observed in some cases. Self-correction can provide feedback that shows workers how to provide high-quality answers in future tasks.(4) A Perceptual learning effect is observed, particularly with workers who moderately change answers in the second stage. This suggests that we can measure the learning potential of workers.These findings imply that requesters/crowdsourcing services can construct a positive loop for improved task results by the self-correction approach.However, (5) no long-term effects of the self-correction task were transferred to other similar tasks in two different settings.",

            "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across the globe from the beginning of 2020 and people worldwide have been receiving news about the same from government offices, press conferences and various other media outlets. The COVID-19 Information Watcher Project started in 2020 to collect and organize reliable information sources worldwide. However, it is difficult to automatically identify reliable information sources in foreign countries for several reasons. First, what kind of information sources are reliable heavily depend on each county situation. In some countries people trust their government\u2019s official information but in other countries they do not. Secondly, such reliable information sources often provide information in their local languages. Reliable information sources are not necessarily top-ranked by search engines. Crowdsourcing is a promising way to deal with such a case. However, crowd-sourcing platforms do not cover crowds in all countries. In this study, we report some results of our attempt to collect local information regarding COVID-19 from several countries through multi-hop crowdsourcing, in which we allow crowd workers on a crowdsourcing platform to use other platforms in other countries. We show two case studies, Russia and Afghanistan. Our results show that the multi-hop crowdsourcing is a promising way to collect COVID-19 information from different countries.",

Recently, self-correction, which is a framework that allows workers to revise their answers after they see others\u2019 answers, was proven to be effective to improve their skills. However, the self-correction heavily limits the flexibility of crowdsourcing workflow because the requester requires some others to perform the same task before the worker can perform it. Conventional study implied that workers can improve their skills even if they see the inference results of trained ML models. Therefore, in this paper, we devised a workflow in which AI serves as co-learners so that we do not need pre-trained AI models and thus training data for them. The experimental results show that our self-correction framework with AI as a co-learner is as effective in improving skills as self-correction with a pre-trained AI.",

In this paper, we explore an approach to increasing the work opportunities for many workers, by finding task assignment based on the estimated skill level of workers and the difficulty level of tasks.

Inspired by the dual-process theory in psychology, this paper proposes a human-in-the-loop approach to develop System-2 AI that makes an inference logically and outputs interpretable explanation. Our proposed method first asks crowd workers to raise understandable features of objects of multiple classes and collect training data from the Internet to generate classifiers for the features. Logical decision rules with the set of generated classifiers can explain why each object is of a particular class. In our preliminary experiment, we applied our method to an image classification of Asian national flags and examined the effectiveness and issues of our method. In our future studies, we plan to combine the System-2 AI with System-1 AI (e.g., neural networks) to efficiently output decisions.",

However, many pictures are not associated with location information and it is not easy to connect the image content to locations on a map. There are two reasons for this difficulty. First, pictures are different in terms of directions and heights. Second, the situation of damaged areas in the picture may differ from before the natural disaster. Therefore, there is a mismatch between map fragments and the pictures taken after a disaster. This paper explores the potential of human computation to solve this problem. For this study, we asked people to draw a birds-eye view map of the place in a picture and compared the map with the correct map fragments to see the characteristics of such drawn maps.",

In such applications, we need to calculate the route that covers all graph nodes as efficiently as possible while satisfying the urgency requirements. This paper proposes a system to find routes in such a situations. In our system, information on the urgency (the deadline for visiting each node) is not necessarily fully known in advance and can be updated at any time, and we cannot totally optimize the route in advance. Therefore, we devised a greedy method tries to go to the nodes with high urgency while keeping all of the remaining nodes being directly connected to each other. Our preliminary experiments show that the proposed method is better in the performance than the simple greedy method that does not consider the factor; the proposed method was 29.42% better to the simple greedy method in terms of missed deadlines and 36.52% better in terms of the total flight time.",

We assume that the mouse and the eyes stop longer if the quality is lower due to the lack of knowledge, or confidence, etc. Because the mouse- and eye-stopping duration follows lognormal distribution, we estimate its parameters (mean and standard deviation) to evaluate the quality. Results of preliminary experiments with 10 participants show that the parameters of correct outputs are different from those of incorrect ones. As compared to the task duration, which is often used as a feature for assessment, we have found that the mouse-and the eyestopping duration is advantageous and complementary for the assessment.",

A typical example of hierarchical labeling microtask consists of a set of labeling tasks for partitions of a large image; starting from the whole image, the workers choose to give a label or divide it into smaller ones. This paper shows the result of an experiment to compare several strategies for active learning in the setting.

Attempts have been made to obtain a scheme where both functionality and protection can be achieved. However, features provided in existing searchable encryption schemes tend to be left behind the latest findings in the information retrieval (IR) area. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving similar document search system based on Simhash. Our scheme is open to the latest machine-learning based IR schemes, and performance has been tuned utilizing a VP-tree based index, which is optimized for security. Analysis and various tests on real-world datasets demonstrate the scheme's security and efficiency on real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Peer learning is a known effective method of education, which involves people teaching each other. Usually, peer learning requires dedicated facilitators, but it is not always possible to have them in some situations such as in classes with a large number of students and in crowdsourcing settings. This paper addresses the question whether there is a way through which people can teach each other without dedicated facilitators. A key issue is to allow people to identify their own incomprehension. We applied a microtask approach to the problem and verified that the developed workflow was effective. The result of our preliminary experiment suggests that the approach is effective for identifying students\u2019 incomprehension. We also show that the identified incomprehensible parts allow people to teach each other.",

            "abstract": "The most typical approach today to data processing which does not have proven algorithms is to first request humans to provide labels to a small set of data and then develop artificial intelligences (AIs) with the data to perform all the remaining tasks. This development is sometimes crowdsourced through platforms such as Kaggle. The approach, however, is not always effective; if the AI does not meet the quality requirement, we may have to give up the development and all the data items have to be done manually. In order to avoid this all-or-nothing situation, \u201cselective\u201d AI programs that perform tasks which they are confident to do will be effective. This study addresses the problem of designing an incentive structure for crowdsourcing the development of such selective AI programs. This paper shows the results of our real-world experiment with a stair-step incentive structure and the behavior of a worker who developed the AI agent under the incentive. This paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed incentive design.",

            "abstract": "People have become increasingly dependent on the Web. However, it is difficult for visually impaired individuals to understand the content, especially if the web page contains images. The images can be more accessible by adding alt text, but it is known that alt text added through the current automation techniques are not necessarily helpful. Crowdsourcing is a promising approach for it, but adding alt text to all the images on the Web requires a tremendous amount of effort. In addition, too many alt texts of images also increase the difficulty of reading. Therefore, it is crucial to select important images for understanding web pages. This paper presents the results of our preliminary experiments to identify important images for understanding web pages. We adopted a crowdsourcing approach with two microtask designs. The results of our study demonstrated that (1) there are several types of images that are difficult to automatically assess the importance; thus, human-in-the-loop can be a promising approach to identify important ones in the types of images; and (2) there are microtask designs that can result in the similar results but different to each other in terms of other criteria. The results suggested that the identification of important images for understanding web pages is an interesting problem to address.",

One of the essential challenges of the approach is how to keep people attracted because those who perform tasks at first gradually lose interest and do not access the equipment. This study uses a different approach to the worker recruitment problem. In our approach, we dive into people's personal spaces by projecting task images on the floor, thereby allowing the passersby to effortlessly access tasks while walking. The problem then changes from how to keep people engaged to how to manage data quality because many passersby unconsciously or intentionally walk through the task screen on the floor without doing the task, which produces unintended results. We explore a machine-learning approach to select only the intended results and manage the data quality. The system assesses the workers' intention from their behavior. We identify the features for classifiers based on our observations of the passersby. We then conduct extensive evaluations with real data. The results show that the features are effective in practice, and the classifiers improve the data quality.",

Rerunning the dataflow requires more time and incurs monetary costs for the additional work that would need to be completed by crowd workers.

However, at times, such results cannot be used as is (e.g., when the dataflow has been changed), and some additional tasks need to be completed in the old dataflow in order to make them reusable in the new dataflow. The benefit of reusing these results in the previous run may or may not be worth the cost of these additional tasks.

            "abstract": "\n \n Self-correction for crowdsourced tasks is a two-stage setting that allows a crowd worker to review the task results of other workers; the worker is then given a chance to update his/her results according to the review.Self-correction was proposed as an approach complementary to statistical algorithms in which workers independently perform the same task. It can provide higher-quality results with few additional costs. However, thus far, the effects have only been demonstrated in simulations, and empirical evaluations are needed. In addition, as self-correction gives feedback to workers, an interesting question arises: whether perceptual learning is observed in self-correction tasks. This paper reports our experimental results on self-corrections with a real-world crowdsourcing service.The empirical results show the following: (1) Self-correction is effective for making workers reconsider their judgments. (2) Self-correction is more effective if workers are shown task results produced by higher-quality workers during the second stage. (3) Perceptual learning effect is observed in some cases. Self-correction can give feedback that shows workers how to provide high-quality answers in future tasks.The findings imply that we can construct a positive loop to improve the quality of workers effectively.We also analyze in which cases perceptual learning can be observed with self-correction in crowdsourced microtasks.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Can people learn from machines behavior in microtask based crowdsourcing? Can we train the machines as our mentor even without domain expertise? In this paper, we investigate how the task results improve concerning quality during and after presenting machine prediction as a reference answer in self-correction. Four reference types were examined in the experiment; Correct, Random, Machine prediction trained by correct answers, and that trained by human answers. Learning effects were observed only in presenting machine prediction, although those accuracy rates were far from correct (100%). Moreover, there were no learning effects in \"Correct\" and \"Random\". This suggests the following hypothesis: Since machine learners make some \"models\" for the problem, it is easier for humans to interpret the outputs of machine learners than the results without via them; it is more difficult to interpret not only random answers but also the correct answers in a case where the perfect interpretation of the problem is difficult. Furthermore, some workers answered with higher accuracy rate than machines in the post-test. Therefore, this strategy can be expected to be useful for bootstrapping solutions in the situation where unknown problems occur without expertise or at a low cost.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate CrowdSheet, a spreadsheet interface for implementing complex crowdsourcing. Despite its appeal, adoption of the spreadsheet paradigm is associated with two nontrivial problems: (1) how to design the interface, which must be a natural extension of existing spreadsheets, while guaranteeing a reasonable expressive power, and (2) how to incorporate techniques for improving data quality without sacrificing the spreadsheet's easy-to-use feature. In this demo, we show three things. First, CrowdSheet allows non IT experts to easily implement crowdsourcing applications with complex workflows. Second, CrowdSheet adopts only new two spreadsheet functions to implement a fairly wide range of real-world applications. Third, its modular architecture gives CrowdSheet a declarative feature that lets users choose alternative plans for improving data quality, while keeping the CrowdSheet description simple.",

The verification results by domain experts suggest that the output is useful for improving task instructions.",

This study explores a different approach - we ask workers to prove facts. We devise a general framework for collecting and ranking evidence-based proofs. The experiments results show that the proposed framework works and how diverse the collected proofs are. Our results clearly indicate that the crowd-based approach to prove facts is promising.",

Most existing schemes consider both of task-centric measures (e.g., required abilities) and worker-centric measures (e.g., worker preference) at local (each task) assignment level, but consider only task-centric measures at the global (the whole workflow) assignment level, such as productivity and throughput. This paper proposes to introduce Inclusiveness and Activity Degree as the worker-centric measures at the global level. It is not trivial whether we can find assignment that are good in terms of all of the two task-centric measures (productivity and throughput) and the two worker-centric measures (Inclusiveness and Activity Degree) at the global level. This paper explains five assignments that are expected to increase some measures and shows Activity Degree Conscious Assignment can produce high Inclusiveness and Activity Degree and not significantly reduce the productivity and throughput assignment through a simulation.",

Therefore, different methods have been employed depending on the situation, such as Fermi estimation and complete enumeration. This paper introduces a method for crowd-based best-effort number estimation, which seamlessly integrates Fermi estimation and complete enumeration. The principle underlying of the method is defining a table called the Fermi-estimation table, which represents both task decomposition and Fermi estimation. This paper also shows our preliminary results and discusses some of the future prospects.",

This paper presents an overview of our approach, as well as the results of a preliminary experiment on the bidding tasks for sessions by authors. We found that authors do not necessarily bid for appropriate sessions, meaning we need a mechanism to properly modify the bidding results.",
