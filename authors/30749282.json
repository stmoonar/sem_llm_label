            "title": "Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories",
            "abstract": "The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "A moving body is a geometry that may translate and rotate over time. Computing the time-varying distance between moving bodies and surrounding static and moving objects is crucial to many application domains including safety at sea, logistics robots, and autonomous vehicles. Not only is it a relevant analytical operation in itself, but also it forms the basis of other operations, such as finding the nearest approach distance between two moving objects. Most moving objects databases represent moving objects using a point representation, and the computed temporal distance is thus inaccurate when working with large moving objects. This article presents an efficient algorithm to compute the temporal distance between a moving body and other static or moving geometries. We extend the idea of the V-Clip and Lin-Canney closest features algorithms of computational geometry to track the temporal evolution of the closest pair of features between two objects during their movement. We also present a working implementation of this algorithm in an open-source moving objects database and show, using a real-world example on AIS data, that this distance operator for moving bodies is only about 1.5 times as slow as the one for moving points while providing significant improvements in correctness and accuracy of the results.",

            "abstract": "Selectivity estimation refers to the ability of the SQL query optimizer to estimate the size of the results of a predicate in the query. It is the main calculation based on which the optimizer can select the least expensive plan to execute. While the problem has been known since the mid-1970s, we were surprised that there are no solutions in the literature for the selectivity estimation of inequality joins. By testing four common database systems: Oracle, SQL-Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, we found that the open-source systems PostgreSQL and MySQL lack this estimation. Oracle and SQL-Server make fairly accurate estimations, yet their algorithms are secret. This paper, thus, proposes an algorithm for inequality join selectivity estimation. The proposed algorithm was implemented in PostgreSQL and sent as a patch to be included in the next releases. We compared this implementation with the above DBMS for three different data distributions (uniform, normal, and Zipfian) and showed that our algorithm provides extremely accurate estimations (below 0.1% average error), outperforming the other systems by an order of magnitude.",

In this demo, we present MOVE (Moving Objects Visual Exploration), an open-source tool that integrates MobilityDB, a moving object database in PostgreSQL, and QGIS to visualize moving objects. MOVE is capable of querying and displaying moving object data through a simple interface and visualizing both static and animated spatial data in QGIS.

            "title": "Implementing Rigid Temporal Geometries in Moving Object Databases",
            "abstract": "Various applications process geospatial trajectories of moving objects, such as cars, ships and robots. There is thus a need for a common conceptual framework to model and manage these objects, as well as to enable data interoperability across tools. The International Organization for Standardization ISO\u00ae has responded to this need and created the standard ISO 19141\u2013 Schema for moving features. Among its types, it defines a schema for rigid temporal geometries, which represent the movement of spatial objects translating and rotating over time, while preserving a fixed shape. Despite the abundance of these objects in real-world, there exists no reference implementation of this type of data in a common system, which causes them to usually be represented as temporal points without taking into account their spatial extents and shapes. In this paper, we aim to provide an implementation of rigid temporal geometries into MobilityDB, an open-source moving object database, that extends PostgreSQL and PostGIS. We provide a data model for rigid temporal geometries and propose efficient algorithms for the operations defined in ISO 19141. A use case on real AIS ship trajectories is illustrated to validate the proposed implementation. A synthetic data generator for temporal geometries is also proposed. Finally, we review the standard from an implementation point of view and provide insights on possible improvements.",

            "title": "Dagger: A Data (not code) Debugger",
            "abstract": "With the democratization of data science libraries and frameworks, most data scientists manage and generate their data analytics pipelines using a collection of scripts (e.g., Python, R). This marks a shift from traditional applications that communicate back and forth with a DBMS that stores and manages the application data. While code debuggers have reached impressive maturity over the past decades, they fall short in assisting users to explore data-driven what-if scenarios (e.g., split the training set into two and build two ML models). Those scenarios, while doable programmati-cally, are a substantial burden for users to manage themselves. Dagger (Data Debugger) is an end-to-end data de-bugger that abstracts key data-centric primitives to enable users to quickly identify and mitigate data-related problems in a given pipeline. Dagger was motivated by a series of interviews we conducted with data scientists across several organizations. A preliminary version of Dagger has been incorporated into Data Civilizer 2.0 to help physicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital process complex pipelines.",
