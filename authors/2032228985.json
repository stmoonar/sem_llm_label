            "abstract": "Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained prominence for representation learning in graph processing tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Several Euclidean graph models have been adapted to work in the hyperbolic space and the variants have shown a significant increase in performance. However, research and development in graph modeling currently involve several tedious tasks with a scope of standardization including data processing, parameter configuration, optimization tricks, and unavailability of public codebases. With the proliferation of new tasks such as knowledge graph reasoning and generation, there is a need in the community for a unified framework that eases the development and analysis of both Euclidean and hyperbolic graph networks, especially for new researchers in the field. To this end, we present a novel framework, GraphZoo, that makes learning, designing and applying graph processing pipelines/models systematic through abstraction over the redundant components. The framework contains a versatile library that supports several hyperbolic manifolds and an easy-to-use modular framework to perform graph processing tasks which aids researchers in different components, namely, (i) reproduce evaluation pipelines of state-of-the-art approaches, (ii) design new hyperbolic or Euclidean graph networks and compare them against the state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, (iii) add custom datasets for evaluation, (iv) add new tasks and evaluation criteria.",

            "title": "Semi-supervised Soil Moisture Prediction through Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Recent improvement and availability of remote satellite and IoT data offers interesting and diverse applications of artificial intelligence in precision agriculture. Soil moisture is an important component of multiple agricultural and food supply chain practices. It measures the amount of water stored in various depth of soil. Existing data driven approaches for soil moisture prediction use conventional models which fail to capture the dynamic dependency of soil moisture values in near-by locations over time. In this work, we propose to convert the problem of soil moisture prediction as a semi-supervised learning on temporal graphs. We propose a dynamic graph neural network which can use the dependency of related locations over a region to predict soil moisture. However, unlike social or information networks, graph structure is not explicitly given for soil moisture prediction. Hence, we incorporate the problem of graph structure learning in the framework of dynamic GNN. Our algorithm, referred as DGLR, provides an end-to-end learning which can predict soil moisture over multiple locations in a region over time and also update the graph structure in between. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world soil moisture datasets compared to existing machine learning approaches.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important component of precision agriculture as it directly impacts the growth and quality of vegetation. Forecasting soil moisture is essential to schedule the irrigation and optimize the use of water. Physics based soil moisture models need rich features and heavy computation which is not scalable. In recent literature, conventional machine learning models have been applied for this problem. These models are fast and simple, but they often fail to capture the spatio-temporal correlation that soil moisture exhibits over a region. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network based solution that learns temporal graph structures and forecast soil moisture in an end-to-end framework. Our solution is able to handle the problem of missing ground truth soil moisture which is common in practice. We show the merit of our algorithm on real-world soil moisture data.",
