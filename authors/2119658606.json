            "abstract": "In order to further improve the convergence properties of generative adversarial networks, in this paper, we analyze how the stability can be affected by the so-called best-effort manner of the discriminator in the minimax game. We point out that this manner can cause the multistate problem and the optimization entangling problem. To alleviate these, we proposed an alternative least-effort loss to regularize the training behaviors of the discriminator. With this loss, the discriminator only updates when it is unable to distinguish distributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the least-effort loss, we introduce it into Wasserstein GAN. Experiments on Dirac delta distribution and image datasets demonstrate that the least-effort loss can effectively improve the convergence properties and generation quality of WGAN. Furthermore, the behaviors of the discriminator and generator during the training show that, with the least-effort loss, the state space of the discriminator shrinks, and the optimization of the discriminator and the generator disentangles in some way.",

            "abstract": "Cement has been widely used in civil engineering directly and plays a critical role in cement-based materials, e.g., concrete. As the microstructural evolution of cement hydration predominates the final physical properties, an accurate simulation of hydration is highly required to enable scientists to evaluate the performance and help design new cementitious materials. However, despite significant effort and progress, a satisfactory model to realistically and accurately simulate the evolution of three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure has not yet to be constructed, mainly because cement hydration is one of the most complex phenomena in material science. In this work, a novel near-realistic microstructural model is proposed to simulate the cement hydration system using deep learning and cellular automata. It is designed to break through the bottleneck of fidelity to real microstructural evolution. The dynamical system is constructed based on a 3-D cellular automaton, in which behavior is controlled by deep neural networks distilled from microstructural images. In addition, a dynamic stratified sampling method with variable capacity is proposed to ensure the representativeness of samples for reducing the computation cost of training. Experiments manifest that the simulated hydration is in accordance with the actual development in different aspects, such as near-realistic microstructure and approximate process. Furthermore, the constructed system also demonstrates promising generalization capability even under various conditions.",

            "title": "Face hallucination using multisource references and cross\u2010scale dual residual fusion mechanism",
            "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in enhancing the quality of low\u2010resolution (LR) facial images for various social life applications. Existing methods often use domain\u2010specific prior knowledge, which is effective in improving the face super\u2010resolution model's performance. However, it is challenging to obtain rich and accurate prior information from LR inputs in real\u2010world scenarios, which can limit the robustness and generalization ability of the developed face super\u2010resolution model. In this paper, a multisource reference\u2010based face super\u2010resolution Network, namely MSRNet, is proposed. Without considering the prior knowledge of faces, the network can reconstruct a LR face image with a magnitude factor of 8 under the guidance of multiple reference face images of different identities. By constructing an \u201cappearance\u2010alike\u201d reference data set Face_Ref, the designed MSRNet aims to fully exploit the local and spatially similar high frequency information between the distinct references and the current face. More specifically, to effectively combine the information from multiple references, a cross\u2010scale and cross\u2010space feature fusion mechanism is introduced for external and internal references, and then the enhanced local semantics are finally incorporated into the high\u2010resolution face reconstruction. The robustness of face image super\u2010resolution is increased compared to current correlation approaches, since it not only eliminates the need for face prior knowledge but also avoids performing alignment operations on reference faces with multiple expressions and different poses. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to produce results for face super\u2010resolution that are satisfying and dependable and outperforms the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods in terms of visual perceptual quality and quantity evaluation.",

In the method, a framework (CEM3DMG) is designed to synthesize 3D images by learning microstructural information from a 2D backscattered electron (BSE) image. Experimental results show that CEM3DMG can generate realistic 3D images of arbitrary size with a resolution of 0.47 $\\mu m$ per pixel. Visual observation confirms that the generated 3D images exhibit similar microstructural features to the 2D images, including pores and particles morphology. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals that these 3D microstructures closely match the real 2D microstructure in terms of gray level histogram, phase proportions, and pore size distribution.",

            "abstract": "The general Cauchy loss (GCL) criterion has been successfully proposed to improve the performance of the Cauchy loss (CL) criterion for linear adaptive filtering in the presence of complex non-Gaussian noise. However, the commonly used adaptive filtering algorithms based on the GCL criterion utilize the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method to update their weights with slow convergence rate and poor steady-state performance. To overcome these issues, a general Cauchy-loss conjugate gradient (GCCG) method is first developed by solving the proposed half-quadratic general Cauchy loss (HQGCL) with the conjugate gradient method. To further tackle complex nonlinear issues, novel multiple random Fourier features (MRFF) spaces are then constructed in finite-dimensional features spaces, which is proven effective for approximation of multi-kernel adaptive filter (MKAF), theoretically. The GCCG method is thus applied into the constructed MRFF spaces to generate novel multiple random Fourier features GCCG (MRFGCG) algorithms, curbing the linear growth structures of kernel adaptive filters (KAFs) and MKAFs. The proposed MRFGCG algorithms in fixed networks have lower computational complexity and higher filtering accuracy than sparsification KAFs in non-Gaussian environments. Monte Carlo simulations on the prediction of synthetic and real-world time-series and the identification of nonlinear system confirm the superiorities of the proposed MRFGCG algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are concerned with finding the best solutions for problems with missing analytical details. Most classical methods for such problems are based on strong and fixed a priori assumptions, such as Gaussianity. However, the complex real-world problems, especially when the global optimum is desired, could be very far from the a priori assumptions because of their diversities, causing unexpected obstacles. In this study, we propose a generative adversarial net-based broad-spectrum global optimizer (OPT-GAN) which estimates the distribution of optimum gradually, with strategies to balance exploration-exploitation trade-off. It has potential to better adapt to the regularity and structure of diversified landscapes than other methods with fixed prior, e.g., Gaussian assumption or separability. \nExperiments on diverse BBO benchmarks and high dimensional real world applications exhibit that OPT-GAN outperforms other traditional and neural net-based BBO algorithms.

            "title": "Learning Effective Discriminative Features with Differentiable Magnet Loss",
            "abstract": "Neural network optimization relies on the ability of the loss function to learn highly discriminative features. In recent years, Softmax loss has been widely used to train neural network models in various tasks. In order to further enhance the discriminative power of the learned features, Center loss is introduced as an auxiliary function to aid Softmax loss jointly reduce the intra-class variances. In this paper, we propose a novel loss called Differentiable Magnet loss (DML), which can optimize neural nets independently of Softmax loss without joint supervision. This loss offers a more definite convergence target for each class, which not only allows the sample to be close to the homogeneous (intra-class) center but also to stay away from all heterogeneous (inter-class) centers in the feature embedding space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DML in a variety of classification and clustering tasks. Specifically, the 2-D visualization of the learned embedding features by t-SNE effectively proves that our proposed new loss can learn better discriminative representations.",

            "title": "Black-Box Optimization via Generative Adversarial Nets",
            "abstract": "Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are concerned with \ufb01nding the best solutions for problems with missing analytical details. Most classical methods for such problems are based on strong and \ufb01xed a priori assumptions, such as Gaussianity. However, the complex real-world problems, especially when the global optimum is desired, could be very far from the a priori assumptions because of their diversities, bringing some unexpected obstacles to these methods. In this paper, we present a generative adversarial nets-based optimizer (OPT-GAN) to adapt to diverse black-box problems via estimating the distribution of optima. The method learns the extensive distribution of the optimal region dominated by selective and randomly moving candidates, balancing the exploration and exploitation. Experiments conducted on Black-box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) problems and several other benchmarks with diversi\ufb01ed distributions exhibit that, the OPT-GAN outperforms many traditional and neural net-based BBO algorithms.",
