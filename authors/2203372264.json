            "title": "Characterizing Secretion System Effector Proteins With Structure-Aware Graph Neural Networks and Pre-Trained Language Models",
            "abstract": "The Type III Secretion Systems (T3SSs) play a pivotal role in host-pathogen interactions by mediating the secretion of type III secretion system effectors (T3SEs) into host cells. These T3SEs mimic host cell protein functions, influencing interactions between Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and their hosts. Identifying T3SEs is essential in biomedical research for comprehending bacterial pathogenesis and its implications on human cells. This study presents EDIFIER, a novel multi-channel model designed for accurate T3SE prediction. It incorporates a graph structural channel, utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCN) to capture protein 3D structural features and a sequence channel based on the ProteinBERT pre-trained model to extract the sequence context features of T3SEs. Rigorous benchmarking tests, including ablation studies and comparative analysis, validate that EDIFIER outperforms current state-of-the-art tools in T3SE prediction. To enhance EDIFIER's accessibility to the broader scientific community, we developed a webserver that is publicly accessible at http://edifier.unimelb-biotools.cloud.edu.au/. We anticipate EDIFIER will contribute to the field by providing reliable T3SE predictions, thereby advancing our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics.",

            "title": "Contrastive Graph Similarity Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph similarity learning is a significant and fundamental issue in the theory and analysis of graphs, which has been applied in a variety of fields, including object tracking, recommender systems, similarity search, and so on. Recent methods for graph similarity learning that utilize deep learning typically share two deficiencies: (1) they leverage graph neural networks as backbones for learning graph representations but have not well captured the complex information inside data, and (2) they employ a cross-graph attention mechanism for graph similarity learning, which is computationally expensive. Taking these limitations into consideration, a method for graph similarity learning is devised in this study, namely, Contrastive Graph Similarity Network (CGSim). To enhance graph similarity learning, CGSim makes use of the complementary information of two input graphs and captures pairwise relations in a contrastive learning framework. By developing a dual contrastive learning module with a node-graph matching and a graph-graph matching mechanism, our method significantly reduces the quadratic time complexity for cross-graph interaction modeling to linear time complexity. Jointly learning in an end-to-end framework, the graph representation embedding module and the well-designed contrastive learning module can be beneficial to one another. A comprehensive series of experiments indicate that CGSim outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on six datasets and significantly reduces the computational cost, which demonstrates our CGSim model\u2019s superiority over other baselines.",

            "title": "Towards Self-Interpretable Graph-Level Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) aims to identify graphs that exhibit notable dissimilarity compared to the majority in a collection. However, current works primarily focus on evaluating graph-level abnormality while failing to provide meaningful explanations for the predictions, which largely limits their reliability and application scope. In this paper, we investigate a new challenging problem, explainable GLAD, where the learning objective is to predict the abnormality of each graph sample with corresponding explanations, i.e., the vital subgraph that leads to the predictions. To address this challenging problem, we propose a Self-Interpretable Graph aNomaly dETection model (SIGNET for short) that detects anomalous graphs as well as generates informative explanations simultaneously. Specifically, we first introduce the multi-view subgraph information bottleneck (MSIB) framework, serving as the design basis of our self-interpretable GLAD approach. This way SIGNET is able to not only measure the abnormality of each graph based on cross-view mutual information but also provide informative graph rationales by extracting bottleneck subgraphs from the input graph and its dual hypergraph in a self-supervised way. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate the anomaly detection capability and self-interpretability of SIGNET.",
