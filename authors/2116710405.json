            "title": "Rethinking Large Language Model Architectures for Sequential Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Recently, sequential recommendation has been adapted to the LLM paradigm to enjoy the power of LLMs. LLM-based methods usually formulate recommendation information into natural language and the model is trained to predict the next item in an auto-regressive manner. Despite their notable success, the substantial computational overhead of inference poses a significant obstacle to their real-world applicability. In this work, we endeavor to streamline existing LLM-based recommendation models and propose a simple yet highly effective model Lite-LLM4Rec. The primary goal of Lite-LLM4Rec is to achieve efficient inference for the sequential recommendation task. Lite-LLM4Rec circumvents the beam search decoding by using a straight item projection head for ranking scores generation. This design stems from our empirical observation that beam search decoding is ultimately unnecessary for sequential recommendations. Additionally, Lite-LLM4Rec introduces a hierarchical LLM structure tailored to efficiently handle the extensive contextual information associated with items, thereby reducing computational overhead while enjoying the capabilities of LLMs. Experiments on three publicly available datasets corroborate the effectiveness of Lite-LLM4Rec in both performance and inference efficiency (notably 46.8% performance improvement and 97.28% efficiency improvement on ML-1m) over existing LLM-based methods. Our implementations will be open sourced.",

            "title": "AutoMLP: Automated MLP for Sequential Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems aim to predict users\u2019 next interested item given their historical interactions. However, a long-standing issue is how to distinguish between users\u2019 long/short-term interests, which may be heterogeneous and contribute differently to the next recommendation. Existing approaches usually set pre-defined short-term interest length by exhaustive search or empirical experience, which is either highly inefficient or yields subpar results. The recent advanced transformer-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performances despite the aforementioned issue, but they have a quadratic computational complexity to the length of the input sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming for better modeling users\u2019 long/short-term interests from their historical interactions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm for preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization. Through extensive experiments, we show that AutoMLP has competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining linear computational complexity.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that coverts the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors and can enhance the recommendation performance. Applying embedding techniques captures complex entity relationships and has spurred substantial research. In this survey, we provide an overview of the recent literature on embedding techniques in recommender systems. This survey covers embedding methods like collaborative filtering, self-supervised learning, and graph-based techniques. Collaborative filtering generates embeddings capturing user-item preferences, excelling in sparse data. Self-supervised methods leverage contrastive or generative learning for various tasks. Graph-based techniques like node2vec exploit complex relationships in network-rich environments. Addressing the scalability challenges inherent to embedding methods, our survey delves into innovative directions within the field of recommendation systems. These directions aim to enhance performance and reduce computational complexity, paving the way for improved recommender systems. Among these innovative approaches, we will introduce Auto Machine Learning (AutoML), hash techniques, and quantization techniques in this survey. We discuss various architectures and techniques and highlight the challenges and future directions in these aspects. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving field and serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners working in the area of recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to offer potentially interesting products to users by capturing their historical sequence of interacted items. Although it has facilitated extensive physical scenarios, sequential recommendation for multi-modal sequences has long been neglected. Multi-modal data that depicts a user\u2019s historical interactions exists ubiquitously, such as product pictures, textual descriptions, and interacted item sequences, providing semantic information from multiple perspectives that comprehensively describe a user\u2019s preferences. However, existing sequential recommendation methods either fail to directly handle multi-modality or suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Layer Perceptron (MMMLP) for maintaining multi-modal sequences for sequential recommendation. MMMLP is a purely MLP-based architecture that consists of three modules - the Feature Mixer Layer, Fusion Mixer Layer, and Prediction Layer - and has an edge on both efficacy and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that MMMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity. We also conduct ablating analysis to verify the contribution of each component. Furthermore, compatible experiments are devised, and the results show that the multi-modal representation learned by our proposed model generally benefits other recommendation models, emphasizing our model\u2019s ability to handle multi-modal information. We have made our code available online to ease reproducibility1.",

            "abstract": "As widely used in data-driven decision-making, recommender systems have been recognized for their capabilities to provide users with personalized services in many user-oriented online services, such as E-commerce (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, etc.) and Social Media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Recent works have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to promote or demote a set of target items. Instead of generating users with fake profiles from scratch, in this article, we introduce a novel strategy to obtain \u201cfake\u201d user profiles via copying cross-domain user profiles, where a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking framework (CopyAttack+) is developed to effectively and efficiently select cross-domain user profiles from the source domain to attack the target system. Moreover, we propose to train a local surrogate system for mimicking adversarial black-box attacks in the source domain, so as to provide transferable signals with the purpose of enhancing the attacking strategy in the target black-box recommender system. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework.",

            "abstract": "Real-world recommendation datasets have been shown to be subject to selection bias, which can challenge recommendation models to learn real preferences of users, so as to make accurate recommendations. Existing approaches to mitigate selection bias, such as data imputation and inverse propensity score, are sensitive to the quality of the additional imputation or propensity estimation models. To break these limitations, in this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework, i.e., Rating Distribution Calibration (RDC), to tackle selection bias without introducing additional models. In addition to the original training objective, we introduce a rating distribution calibration loss. It aims to correct the predicted rating distribution of biased users by taking advantage of that of their similar unbiased users. We empirically evaluate RDC on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset. The experimental results show that RDC outperforms the original model as well as the state-of-the-art debiasing approaches by a significant margin.",

            "abstract": "Self-attention models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommender systems by capturing the sequential dependencies among user-item interactions. However, they rely on positional embeddings to retain the sequential information, which may break the semantics of item embeddings. In addition, most existing works assume that such sequential dependencies exist solely in the item embeddings, but neglect their existence among the item features. In this work, we propose a novel sequential recommender system (MLP4Rec) based on the recent advances of MLP-based architectures, which is naturally sensitive to the order of items in a sequence. To be specific, we develop a tri-directional fusion scheme to coherently capture sequential, cross-channel and cross-feature correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MLP4Rec over various representative baselines upon two benchmark datasets. The simple architecture of MLP4Rec also leads to the linear computational complexity as well as much fewer model parameters than existing self-attention methods.",

            "title": "Knowledge-enhanced Black-box Attacks for Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to achieve malicious purposes, such as promote or demote a set of target items. Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.",

            "title": "MAE4Rec: Storage-saving Transformer for Sequential Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems (SRS) aim to infer the users' preferences from their interaction history and predict items that will be of interest to the users. The majority of SRS models typically incorporate all historical interactions for next-item recommendations. Despite their success, feeding all interactions into the model without filtering may lead to severe practical issues: (i) redundant interactions hinder the SRS model from capturing the users' intentions; (ii) the computational cost is huge, as the computational complexity is proportional to the length of the interaction sequence; (iii) more memory space is necessitated to store all interaction records from all users. To this end, we propose a novel storage-saving SRS framework, MAE4Rec, based on a unidirectional self-attentive mechanism and masked autoencoder. Specifically, in order to lower the storage consumption, MAE4Rec first masks and discards a large percentage of historical interactions, and then infers the next interacted item solely based on the latent representation of unmarked ones. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art SRS models with more than 40% compression of storage.",
