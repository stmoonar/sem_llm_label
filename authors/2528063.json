            "abstract": "The increasing reliance on digital information necessitates advancements in conversational search systems, particularly in terms of information transparency. While prior research in conversational information-seeking has concentrated on improving retrieval techniques, the challenge remains in generating responses useful from a user perspective. This study explores different methods of explaining the responses, hypothesizing that transparency about the source of the information, system confidence, and limitations can enhance users' ability to objectively assess the response. By exploring transparency across explanation type, quality, and presentation mode, this research aims to bridge the gap between system-generated responses and responses verifiable by the user. We design a user study to answer questions concerning the impact of (1) the quality of explanations enhancing the response on its usefulness and (2) ways of presenting explanations to users. The analysis of the collected data reveals lower user ratings for noisy explanations, although these scores seem insensitive to the quality of the response. Inconclusive results on the explanations presentation format suggest that it may not be a critical factor in this setting.",

            "abstract": "Instruments such as eye-tracking devices have contributed to understanding how users interact with screen-based search engines. However, user-system interactions in audio-only channels -- as is the case for Spoken Conversational Search (SCS) -- are harder to characterize, given the lack of instruments to effectively and precisely capture interactions. Furthermore, in this era of information overload, cognitive bias can significantly impact how we seek and consume information -- especially in the context of controversial topics or multiple viewpoints. This paper draws upon insights from multiple disciplines (including information seeking, psychology, cognitive science, and wearable sensors) to provoke novel conversations in the community. To this end, we discuss future opportunities and propose a framework including multimodal instruments and methods for experimental designs and settings. We demonstrate preliminary results as an example. We also outline the challenges and offer suggestions for adopting this multimodal approach, including ethical considerations, to assist future researchers and practitioners in exploring cognitive biases in SCS.",

            "abstract": "This study is the first attempt to explore the impact of clarification question modality on user preference in search engines. We introduce the multi-modal search clarification dataset, MIMICS-MM, containing clarification questions with associated expert-collected and model-generated images. We analyse user preferences over different clarification modes of text, image, and combination of both through crowdsourcing by taking into account image and text quality, clarity, and relevance. Our findings demonstrate that users generally prefer multi-modal clarification over uni-modal approaches. We explore the use of automated image generation techniques and compare the quality, relevance, and user preference of model-generated images with human-collected ones. The study reveals that text-to-image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion, can effectively generate multi-modal clarification questions. By investigating multi-modal clarification, this research establishes a foundation for future advancements in search systems.",

            "abstract": "Voice-based systems like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri, along with the growing popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot, serve diverse populations, including visually impaired and low-literacy communities. This reflects a shift in user expectations from traditional search to more interactive question-answering models. However, presenting information effectively in voice-only channels remains challenging due to their linear nature. This limitation can impact the presentation of complex queries involving controversial topics with multiple perspectives. Failing to present diverse viewpoints may perpetuate or introduce biases and affect user attitudes. Balancing information load and addressing biases is crucial in designing a fair and effective voice-based system. To address this, we (i) review how biases and user attitude changes have been studied in screen-based web search, (ii) address challenges in studying these changes in voice-based settings like SCS, (iii) outline research questions, and (iv) propose an experimental setup with variables, data, and instruments to explore biases in a voice-based setting like Spoken Conversational Search.",

            "abstract": "The effectiveness of clarification question models in engaging users within search systems is currently constrained, casting doubt on their overall usefulness. To improve the performance of these models, it is crucial to employ assessment approaches that encompass both real-time feedback from users (online evaluation) and the characteristics of clarification questions evaluated through human assessment (offline evaluation). However, the relationship between online and offline evaluations has been debated in information retrieval. This study aims to investigate how this discordance holds in search clarification. We use user engagement as ground truth and employ several offline labels to investigate to what extent the offline ranked lists of clarification resemble the ideal ranked lists based on online user engagement. Contrary to the current understanding that offline evaluations fall short of supporting online evaluations, we indicate that when identifying the most engaging clarification questions from the user\u2019s perspective, online and offline evaluations correspond with each other. We show that the query length does not influence the relationship between online and offline evaluations, and reducing uncertainty in online evaluation strengthens this relationship. We illustrate that an engaging clarification needs to excel from multiple perspectives, and SERP quality and characteristics of the clarification are equally important. We also investigate if human labels can enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models in identifying the most engaging clarification questions from the user\u2019s perspective by incorporating offline evaluations as input features. Our results indicate that Learning-to-Rank models do not perform better than individual offline labels. However, GPT, an LLM, emerges as the standout performer, surpassing all Learning-to-Rank models and offline labels.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we work, study, and conduct research. Ongoing stresses and uncertainties of the pandemic have impacted research activities and collaborations, especially for graduate researchers1 and Early Career Researchers (ECRs)2. It has also changed the way we connect with the broader research communities. For example, in the last year, conferences were either postponed or held online. Even though many conferences implemented social activities, connecting online with peers is hard. Thus, serendipity and forming new bonds or research connections at conferences have been more complex. Indeed, graduate researchers and ECRs have increased challenges connecting and establishing new research connections in online driven environments. This workshops aims to empower graduate and ECRs, make new research connections, and foster a sense of belonging. The First ECRs Roundtable on Information Access Research workshop at ACM CHIIR\u201922 looks into the future of research, collaborations, and self-development to ask the following. The workshop is hands-on and interactive\u2014with two key talks to kick-start discussion. Rather than a series of technical talks, we solicit position statements from attendees on opportunities, problems, and solutions on (post-)pandemic research on information access within the wider CHIIR community. Building on work presented at ACM CHIIR 2021 [10], this workshop empowers attendees to share their do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, review their practices for success, and refine which strategies work for them. The workshop provides a neutral platform for an open and honest discussion about the lessons learned from working in a pandemic. Outcomes include a technical report written by the attendees.",

            "abstract": "Conversational information seeking (CIS) is concerned with a sequence of interactions between one or more users and an information system. Interactions in CIS are primarily based on natural language dialogue, while they may include other types of interactions, such as click, touch, and body gestures. This monograph provides a thorough overview of CIS definitions, applications, interactions, interfaces, design, implementation, and evaluation. This monograph views CIS applications as including conversational search, conversational question answering, and conversational recommendation. Our aim is to provide an overview of past research related to CIS, introduce the current state-of-the-art in CIS, highlight the challenges still being faced in the community. and suggest future directions.",

            "abstract": "Voice user interfaces (VUIs) have made their way into people\u2019s daily lives, from voice assistants to smart speakers. Although VUIs typically just react to direct user commands, increasingly, they incorporate elements of proactive behaviors. In particular, proactive smart speakers have the potential for many applications, ranging from healthcare to entertainment; however, their usability in everyday life is subject to interaction errors. To systematically investigate the nature of errors, we designed a voice-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) application to run on proactive speakers. We captured 1,213 user interactions in a 3-week field deployment in 13 participants\u2019 homes. Through auxiliary audio recordings and logs, we identify substantial interaction errors and strategies that users apply to overcome those errors. We further analyze the interaction timings and provide insights into the time cost of errors. We find that, even for answering simple ESMs, interaction errors occur frequently and can hamper the usability of proactive speakers and user experience. Our work also identifies multiple facets of VUIs that can be improved in terms of the timing of speech.",
