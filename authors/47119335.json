            "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have made notable advancements in various disciplines using large-scale foundation models. However, foundation models in the transportation system have not received adequate attention. To address this gap, we propose the Generative Graph Transformer (GGT), a transportation foundation model (TFM) that leverages graph structure and dynamic graph generation algorithms. The primary objective of our TFM is to capture participant behavior and interaction in the transportation system, at various scales, and establish a large-scale neural network to comprehend the entire system. The GGT-based TFM can overcom challenges of structural complexity and model accuracy in conventional traffic models. This approach holds promise for addressing complex traffic issues by utilizing up-to-date real traffic data. To demonstrate the capabilities of GGT, a simulation experiment was conducted.",

            "abstract": "In the realm of software applications in the transportation industry, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have enjoyed widespread adoption due to their ease of use and various other benefits. With the ceaseless progress in computer performance and the rapid development of large-scale models, the possibility of programming using natural language in specified applications - referred to as Application-Specific Natural Language (ASNL) - has emerged. ASNL exhibits greater flexibility and freedom, which, in turn, leads to an increase in computational complexity for parsing and a decrease in processing performance. To tackle this issue, our paper advances a design for an intermediate representation (IR) that caters to ASNL and can uniformly process transportation data into graph data format, improving data processing performance. Experimental comparisons reveal that in standard data query operations, our proposed IR design can achieve a speed improvement of over forty times compared to direct usage of standard XML format data.",

The functionality and structure of TransWorldNG are introduced, which utilize a foundation model for transportation management and control. The results demonstrate that TransWorldNG can generate more realistic traffic patterns compared to traditional simulators. Additionally, TransWorldNG exhibits better scalability, as it shows linear growth in computation time as the scenario scale increases.

In this paper, we propose a novel model combining Graph Neural Networks and Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) that jointly forecasts multiple link events and their timestamps on communities over a CTDG. Moreover, to scale our model to large graphs, we factorize the jointly event prediction problem into three easier conditional probability modeling problems.To evaluate the effectiveness of our model and the rationale behind such a decomposition, we establish a set of benchmarks and evaluation metrics for this event forecasting task. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model in terms of both model accuracy and training efficiency.",

Predicting the number of weather-related failures in distribution systems can provide guiding information for operation and maintenance decisions, improving the risk management capability of utility companies. This article proposes a novel Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) based model to predict weather-related failures caused by wind, rain and lightning. Superior prediction performance of the BNN based model is verified by contrast experiments with other advanced prediction models under four different evaluation metrics. BNN based prediction model presents remarkable robustness, especially in the prediction of high failure levels. In addition, compared to most previous used prediction models without any prediction confidence feedback, BNN based prediction model has the capability of uncertainty estimation. The confidence interval of prediction results can be obtained, which provides sufficient information for guiding risk management of utility companies. An effective operation and maintenance guiding scheme based on the analysis of prediction uncertainty is proposed, which fully excavates the interpretability of the proposed model and enrich the application value of the model.",

            "abstract": "Accurate identification of the miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) helps to understand the etiology and mechanisms of various diseases. However, the experimental methods are costly and time-consuming. Thus, it is urgent to develop computational methods towards the prediction of MDAs. Based on the graph theory, the MDA prediction is regarded as a node classification task in the present study. To solve this task, we propose a novel method MDA-GCNFTG, which predicts MDAs based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) via graph sampling through the Feature and Topology Graph to improve the training efficiency and accuracy. This method models both the potential connections of feature space and the structural relationships of MDA data. The nodes of the graphs are represented by the disease semantic similarity, miRNA functional similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity. Moreover, we considered six tasks simultaneously on the MDA prediction problem at the first time, which ensure that under both balanced and unbalanced sample distribution, MDA-GCNFTG can predict not only new MDAs but also new diseases without known related miRNAs and new miRNAs without known related diseases. The results of 5-fold cross-validation show that the MDA-GCNFTG method has achieved satisfactory performance on all six tasks and is significantly superior to the classic machine learning methods and the state-of-the-art MDA prediction methods. Moreover, the effectiveness of GCNs via the graph sampling strategy and the feature and topology graph in MDA-GCNFTG has also been demonstrated. More importantly, case studies for two diseases and three miRNAs are conducted and achieved satisfactory performance.",

Here, we develop the TransMut framework composed of TransPHLA for pHLA binding prediction and AOMP for mutated peptide optimization, which can be generalized to any binding and mutation task of biomolecules. Firstly, TransPHLA is developed by using a Transformer-derived self-attention model to predict pHLA binding, which is significantly superior to 11 previous methods on pHLA binding prediction, neoantigen and human papilloma virus vaccine identification. For vaccine design, the AOMP program is then developed to automatically optimize mutated peptides to search for mutant peptides with higher affinity to the target HLA and with high homology to the source peptide. Among 3660 non-binding pHLAs, 3630 were successfully mutated. Of these, 94% were verified by the IEDB recommended method, and 88% have homology higher than 80% to the source peptide.",

            "abstract": "Event-based cameras are a new type of vision sensor that can encode spatial-temporal context in a pixel-level event stream. Its appealing properties offer great potential for applications requiring low processing latency and low power consumption. As an effective representation of events, the surface of active event (SAE) has become a favorable choice for corner detection and object classification, among others. These tasks apply normalizations as an essential preprocessing step to extract time-invariant features from SAEs. However, previous normalization methods have some drawbacks, including low efficiency, requiring parameter tuning, etc. These drawbacks largely limit their performances in practical tasks. In this work, we propose a highly efficient normalization method, i.e., chain normalization, to break the limits in the previous state-of-the-art. We leverage the inherent properties of SAE in designing. First, we propose a novel SAE implementation to utilize the characteristics of SAE. Compared with previous works, our method can efficiently capture the spatial and temporal relationships of events and enable robust normalization. Second, we further increase the efficiency by using a novel stacking strategy. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art with extensive experiments, showing high classification accuracy and a significant improvement in runtime performance. We also release the source codes for future distribution and improvement in the community.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, graph-structured data are increasingly used to model complex systems. Meanwhile, detecting anomalies from graph has become a vital research problem of pressing societal concerns. Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning task of identifying rare data that differ from the majority. As one of the dominant anomaly detection algorithms, One Class Support Vector Machine has been widely used to detect outliers. However, those traditional anomaly detection methods lost their effectiveness in graph data. Since traditional anomaly detection methods are stable, robust and easy to use, it is vitally important to generalize them to graph data. In this work, we propose One Class Graph Neural Network (OCGNN), a one-class classification framework for graph anomaly detection. OCGNN is designed to combine the powerful representation ability of Graph Neural Networks along with the classical one-class objective. Compared with other baselines, OCGNN achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments.",

            "abstract": "To capture higher-order structural features, most GNN-based algorithms learn node representations incorporating k-hop neighbors' information. Due to the high time complexity of querying k-hop neighbors, most graph algorithms cannot be deployed in a giant dense temporal network to execute millisecond-level inference. This problem dramatically limits the potential of applying graph algorithms in certain areas, especially financial fraud detection. Therefore, we propose Asynchronous Propagation Attention Network, an asynchronous continuous time dynamic graph algorithm for real-time temporal graph embedding. Traditional graph models usually execute two serial operations: first graph querying and then model inference. Different from previous graph algorithms, we decouple model inference and graph computation to alleviate the damage of the heavy graph query operation to the speed of model inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance while greatly improving the inference speed. The source code is published at a Github repository.",
