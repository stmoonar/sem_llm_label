            "title": "Prompt Tuning as User Inherent Profile Inference Machine",
            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant promise in recommender systems by empowering user profiles with their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, LLMs face challenges like unstable instruction compliance, modality gaps, and high inference latency, leading to textual noise and limiting their effectiveness in recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose UserIP-Tuning, which uses prompt-tuning to infer user profiles. It integrates the causal relationship between user profiles and behavior sequences into LLMs' prompts. And employs expectation maximization to infer the embedded latent profile, minimizing textual noise by fixing the prompt template. Furthermore, A profile quantization codebook bridges the modality gap by categorizing profile embeddings into collaborative IDs, which are pre-stored for online deployment. This improves time efficiency and reduces memory usage. Experiments on four public datasets show that UserIP-Tuning outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Additional tests and case studies confirm its effectiveness, robustness, and transferability.",
