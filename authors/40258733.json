            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Modern HPC workload managers and their careful tuning contribute to the high utilization of HPC clusters. However, due to inevitable uncertainty it is impossible to completely avoid node idleness. Although such idle slots are usually too short for any HPC job, they are too long to ignore them. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm promisingly fills this gap, and can be a good match, as typical FaaS functions last seconds, not hours. Here we show how to build a FaaS infrastructure on idle nodes in an HPC cluster in such a way that it does not affect the performance of the HPC jobs significantly. We dynamically adapt to a changing set of idle physical machines, by integrating open-source software Slurm and OpenWhisk. We designed and implemented a prototype solution that allowed us to cover up to 90% of the idle time slots on a 50k-core cluster that runs production workloads.",

            "abstract": "Serverless computing is a novel cloud computing paradigm where the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure, while users are only required to upload the code of the application. Function as a Service (FaaS) is a serverless computing model where short-lived methods are executed in the cloud. One of the promising use cases for FaaS is running scientific workflow applications, which represent a scientific process composed of related tasks. Due to the distinctive features of FaaS, which include rapid resource provisioning, indirect infrastructure management, and fine-grained billing model a need arises to create dedicated scheduling methods to effectively use the novel infrastructures as an environment for workflow applications. In this paper we propose two novel scheduling algorithms SMOHEFT and SML, which are designed to create a schedule for executing scientific workflows on serverless infrastructures concerning time and cost constraints. We evaluated proposed algorithms by performing experiments, where we planned the execution of three applications: Ellipsoids, Vina and Montage. SDBWS and SDBCS algorithms were used as a baseline. SML achieved the best results when executing Ellipsoids workflow, with a success rate above 80%, while other algorithms were below 60%. In the case of Vina, all the algorithms, except SDBWS, had a success rate above 87.5% and in the case of Montage, the success rate of all algorithms was similar, over 87.5%. The proposed algorithms' success rate is comparable or better than offered by other studied solutions.",

            "abstract": "The increasing popularity of the serverless computing approach has led to the emergence of new cloud infrastructures working in Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) model like AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Instances. New infrastructures facilitate an innovative approach to running cloud containers where developers are freed from managing underlying resources. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the capabilities of elastic containers and their usefulness for scientific computing in the scientific workflow paradigm using AWS Fargate and Google Cloud Run infrastructures. For the experimental evaluation of our approach, we extended the HyperFlow engine to support these CaaS platforms, together with adapting four scientific workflows composed of several dozen to hundreds of tasks organized into a dependency graph. Studied applications are used to create cost-performance benchmarks and flow execution plots, delay, elasticity, and scalability measurements. Results show that serverless containers can be successfully utilized for running scientific workflows. Moreover, the results allow for gaining insight into the specific advantages and limits of the studied platforms.",

In this paper, we present work done on evaluating three major FaaS providers (Amazon, Google, IBM) as a platform for running scientific workflows. The experiments were performed with a dedicated benchmarking framework, which consisted of instrumented workflow execution engine. The testing load was implemented as a large scale bag-of-tasks style workflow, where task count reached 5120 running in parallel. The studied parameters include raw performance, efficiency of infrastructure provisioning, overhead introduced by the API and network layers, as well as aspects related to run time accounting. Conclusions include insights into available performance, expressed as raw GFlops values and charts depicting relation of performance to function size. The infrastructure provisioning proved to be governed by parallelism and rate limits, which can be deducted from included charts. The overhead imposed by using a REST API proved to be a significant contribution to overall run time of individual tasks, and possibly the whole workflow. The paper ends with pointing out possible future work, which includes building performance models and designing a dedicated scheduling algorithms for running scientific workflows on FaaS.",

            "abstract": "We present an end-to-end solution for automation of scientific workflow deployment and execution on distributed computing infrastructures. The solution integrates de-facto standard and widely adopted tools, including Terraform and Kubernetes, with our HyperFlow workflow management system. In such a solution, infrastructure providers have abstracted away thanks to generic Kubernetes layer. However, we also support other computing infrastructures, both containerized such as Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, and non-containerized, e.g. Amazon Lambda, in a single unified approach. The resulting solution enables execution of hybrid workflows that utilize multiple computing infrastructures and significantly lowers the complexity related to management of repeatable infrastructures for the execution of scientific workflows and conducting scientific workflow research.",

            "abstract": "Serverless computing, also known as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) or Cloud Functions, is a new method of running distributed applications by executing functions on the infrastructure of cloud providers. Although it frees the developers from managing servers, there are still decisions to be made regarding selection of function configurations based on the desired performance and cost. The billing model of this approach considers time of execution, measured in 100ms units, as well as the size of the memory allocated per function. In this paper, we look into the problem of scheduling scientific workflows, which are applications consisting of multiple tasks connected into a dependency graph. We discuss challenges related to workflow scheduling and propose the Serverless Deadline-Budget Workflow Scheduling (SDBWS) algorithm adapted to serverless platforms. We present preliminary experiments with a small-scale Montage workflow run on the AWS Lambda infrastructure.",

PaaSage is a model-based cloud platform to provision resources, deploy the application and automatically scale them according to the application demands. One of the challenges is to design the interplay mechanism between the application-specific workflow scheduler in HyperFlow with the generic provisioning and autoscaling components of PaaSage in a generic way. Here we report on our current developments in integrating HyperFlow applications with PaaSage, outline the architecture of the proposed solution, present the CAMEL model of the application and the prototype status. The main conclusion is that thanks to the model-based approach proposed by PaaSage it is possible to modularize the workflow application and make its components easily deployable across multiple clouds.",
