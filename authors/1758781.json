            "abstract": "Interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is often crucial for their application in real world scenarios. We aim to provide such interpretations in terms of the semantic content and conceptual structure CNNs acquire from their training data. Recent advances in Explainable AI have shown that CNNs are capable of learning hierarchical relationships between semantic categories in the form of taxonomic classifications. However, accurate evaluation of this ability is an open challenge, of which two aspects are non-trivial: constructing symbolic representations of semantic content after training, and quantification of its adequacy with respect to the semantics of the application domain. Existing evaluation methods are typically restricted to standard CNN performance metrics and do not take into account the underlying decision-making process in terms of explicit semantic structure in the domain. In this paper we propose a taxonomy extraction method for supervised CNN classifiers to capture how symbolic class concepts and their hypernyms from a given domain are hierarchically organised in the model\u2019s subsymbolic representation. In addition, we propose a taxonomy ground truth comparison method to evaluate the \u201csemantic adequacy\u201d of the extracted hierarchy of class concepts. Our approach is tested using VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-152 and trained on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Results show the influence of the dataset quality and architecture depth on semantic adequacy, as suggested by recent literature [1]. We also observe that existing techniques for injecting external knowledge to the models during the training phase may lead to better taxonomies. This suggests that the hierarchical-aware models may have a semantic advantage over their respective original architectures. Finally, we provide a fine grained approach for analysing CNN interpretability in terms of its semantic content.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown significant performance in various computer vision tasks. However, having limited labelled data lead to a network overfitting problem, where network performance is bad on unseen data as compared to training data. Consequently, it limits performance improvement. To cope with this problem, various techniques have been proposed such as dropout, normalization and advanced data augmentation. Among these, data augmentation, which aims to enlarge the dataset size by including sample diversity, has been a hot topic in recent times. In this article, we focus on advanced data augmentation techniques. we provide a background of data augmentation, a novel and comprehensive taxonomy of reviewed data augmentation techniques, and the strengths and weaknesses (wherever possible) of each technique. We also provide comprehensive results of the data augmentation effect on three popular computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. For results reproducibility, we compiled available codes of all data augmentation techniques. Finally, we discuss the challenges and difficulties, and possible future direction for the research community. We believe, this survey provides several benefits i) readers will understand the data augmentation working mechanism to fix overfitting problems ii) results will save the searching time of the researcher for comparison purposes. iii) Codes of the mentioned data augmentation techniques are available at https://github.com/kmr2017/Advanced-Data-augmentation-codes iv) Future work will spark interest in research community.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in in-situ monitoring and process control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D-printing, allows the collection of large amounts of emission data during the build process of the parts being manufactured. This data can be used as input into 3D and 2D representations of the 3D-printed parts. However the analysis and use, as well as the characterization of this data still remains a manual process. The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptive human-in-the-loop approach using Machine Learning techniques that automatically inspect and annotate the emissions data generated during the AM process. More specifically, this paper will look at two scenarios: firstly, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically inspect and classify emission data collected by in-situ monitoring and secondly, applying Active Learning techniques to the developed classification model to construct a human-in-the-loop mechanism in order to accelerate the labeling process of the emission data. The CNN-based approach relies on transfer learning and fine-tuning, which makes the approach applicable to other industrial image patterns. The adaptive nature of the approach is enabled by uncertainty sampling strategy to automatic selection of samples to be presented to human experts for annotation.",

The objective is to enable robots to become trustworthy and versatile social robots capable of having human-friendly and human assistive interactions, utilised to better assist human users\u2019 needs by enabling the robot to sense, adapt, and respond appropriately to their requirements while taking into consideration their wider affective, motivational states, and behaviour. We propose an innovative approach to the difficult research challenge of endowing robots with social intelligence capabilities for human assistive interactions, going beyond the conventional robotic sense-think-act loop. We propose an architecture that addresses a wide range of social cooperation skills and features required for real human\u2013robot social interaction, which includes language and vision analysis, dynamic emotional analysis (long-term affect and mood), semantic mapping to improve the robot\u2019s knowledge of the local context, situational knowledge representation, and emotion-aware decision-making. Fundamental to this architecture is a normative ethical and social framework adapted to the specific challenges of robots engaging with caregivers and care-receivers.",

            "abstract": "In recent years we have seen significant advances in the technology used to both publish and consume Linked Data. However, in order to support the next generation of ebusiness applications on top of interlinked machine readable data suitable forms of access control need to be put in place. Although a number of access control models and frameworks have been put forward, very little research has been conducted into the security implications associated with granting access to partial data or the correctness of the proposed access control mechanisms. Therefore the contributions of this paper are two fold: we propose a query rewriting algorithm which can be used to partially restrict access to SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates; and we demonstrate how a set of criteria, which was originally used to verify that an access control policy holds over different database states, can be adapted to verify the correctness of access control via query rewriting.",

            "abstract": "Stream reasoning is an emerging research area focused on providing continuous reasoning solutions for data streams. \nThe exponential growth in the availability of streaming data on the Web has seriously hindered the applicability of state-of-the-art expressive reasoners, limiting their applicability to process streaming information in a scalable way. In this scenario, in \norder to reduce the amount of data to reason upon at each iteration, we can leverage advances in continuous query processing \nover Semantic Web streams. Following this principle, in previous work we have combined semantic query processing and nonmonotonic reasoning over data streams in the StreamRule system. In the approach, we specifically focused on the scalability of \na rule layer based on a fragment of Answer Set Programming (ASP). We recently expanded on this approach by designing an \nalgorithm to analyze input dependency so as to enable parallel execution and combine the results. In this paper, we expand on \nthis solution by providing i) a proof of correctness for the approach, ii) an extensive experimental evaluation for different levels \nof complexity of the input program, and iii) a clear characterization of all the algorithms involved in generating and splitting \nthe graph and identifying heuristics for node duplication, as well as partitioning the reasoning process via input splitting and \ncombining the results.",

In this paper we introduce our approach to this task, which comprises of a knowledge extraction algorithm, a knowledge injection algorithm and a common intermediate knowledge representation as an alternative to traditional neural transfer. As a result of this research, we envisage a knowledge-enhanced ANN, which will be able to learn, characterise and reuse knowledge extracted from the learning process, thus enabling more robust architecture-agnostic neural transfer, greater explainability and further integration of neural and symbolic approaches to learning.",
