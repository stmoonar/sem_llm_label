            "abstract": "Accurately forecasting traffic flows is critically important to many real applications including public safety and intelligent transportation systems. The challenges of this problem include both the dynamic mobility patterns of the people and the complex spatial-temporal correlations of the urban traffic data. Meanwhile, most existing models ignore the diverse impacts of the various traffic observations (e.g. vehicle speed and road occupancy) on the traffic flow prediction, and different traffic observations can be considered as different channels of input features. We argue that the analysis in multiple-channel traffic observations might help to better address this problem. In this paper, we study the novel problem of multi-channel traffic flow prediction, and propose a deep \\underline{M}ulti-\\underline{V}iew \\underline{C}hannel-wise \\underline{S}patio-\\underline{T}emporal \\underline{Net}work (MVC-STNet) model to effectively address it. Specifically, we first construct the localized and globalized spatial graph where the multi-view fusion module is used to effectively extract the local and global spatial dependencies. Then LSTM is used to learn the temporal correlations. To effectively model the different impacts of various traffic observations on traffic flow prediction, a channel-wise graph convolutional network is also designed. Extensive experiments are conducted over the PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MVC-STNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world graph learning tasks require handling dynamic graphs where new nodes and edges emerge. Dynamic graph learning methods commonly suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, where knowledge learned for previous graphs is overwritten by updates for new graphs. To alleviate the problem, continual graph learning methods are proposed. However, existing continual graph learning methods aim to learn new patterns and maintain old ones with the same set of parameters of fixed size, and thus face a fundamental tradeoff between both goals. In this paper, we propose Parameter Isolation GNN (PI-GNN) for continual learning on dynamic graphs that circumvents the tradeoff via parameter isolation and expansion. Our motivation lies in that different parameters contribute to learning different graph patterns. Based on the idea, we expand model parameters to continually learn emerging graph patterns. Meanwhile, to effectively preserve knowledge for unaffected patterns, we find parameters that correspond to them via optimization and freeze them to prevent them from being rewritten. Experiments on eight real-world datasets corroborate the effectiveness of PI-GNN compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "title": "Traffic Accident Risk Prediction via Multi-View Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Networks",
            "abstract": "Abnormal traffic incidents such as traffic accidents have become a significant health and development threat with the rapid urbanization of many countries. Thus it is critically important to accurately forecast the traffic accident risks of different areas in a city, which has attracted increasing research interest in the research area of urban computing. The challenges of accurate traffic risk forecasting are three-fold. First, traffic accident data in some areas of a city is sparse, especially for a fine-grained prediction, which may cause the zero inflation problem during model training. Second, the spatio-temporal correlations of the traffic accidents occurring in different areas are rather complex and non-linear, which is difficult to capture by existing shallow models like regression. Third, the occurrence of traffic accidents can be significantly affected by various context features including weather, POI and road network features. It is non-trivial to capture the complex associations between the diverse context features and traffic accident risks for building an accurate prediction model. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-View Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Networks (MVMT-STN) model to forecast fine- and coarse-grained traffic accident risks of a city simultaneously. Specifically, to address the data sparsity issue in a fine-grained prediction, we adopt a multi-task learning framework to jointly forecast both fine- and coarse-grained traffic accident risks by considering their spatial associations. For each granularity prediction, we design the channel-wise CNN and multi-view GCN to capture the local geographic dependency and global semantic dependency, respectively. In order to obtain the diverse impacts of the context features on traffic accidents, we also introduce a fusion learning module that integrates the channel-wise and multi-view features learned from different types of the external factors. We conduct extensive experiments over two large real traffic accident datasets. The results show that MVMT-STN improves the performance of traffic accident risk prediction in both fine- and coarse-grained prediction by a large margin compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) is capable of incorporating auxiliary information from multiple domains to advance recommendation performance. Conventional CDR methods primarily rely on overlapping users, whereby knowledge is conveyed between the source and target identities belonging to the same natural person. However, such a heuristic assumption is not universally applicable due to an individual may exhibit distinct or even conflicting preferences in different domains, leading to potential noises. In this paper, we view the anchor links between users of various domains as the learnable parameters to learn the task-relevant cross-domain correlations. A novel optimal transport based model ALCDR is further proposed to precisely infer the anchor links and deeply aggregate collaborative signals from the perspectives of intra-domain and inter-domain. Our proposal is extensively evaluated over real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have yielded fruitful results in learning multi-view graph data. However, it is challenging for existing GNNs to capture the potential correlation information (PCI) among the graph structure features of multiple views. It is also challenging to adaptively identify valuable neighbors for node feature fusion in different views. To this end, we propose a novel Reinforced Tensor Graph Neural Network (RTGNN) framework to more effectively perform multi-view graph representation learning through reinforcing inter- and intra-graph aggregation. Specifically, RTGNN first uses tensor decomposition to extract the graph structure features (GSFs) of each view in the common feature space. These GSFs contain the PCI of multiple views and alleviate fusion conflicts that may be caused by differences between view feature spaces in cross-view feature fusion. Since fusing the features of all neighbor nodes may harm the features of the center node, we filter the irrelevant neighbors to improve the performance of intra-graph aggregation in each view. Concretely, a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided scheme is developed to automatically calculate the optimal filtering threshold for each view, avoiding tedious manual updates and infeasible back propagation updates. Experimental results and analysis on five datasets show that RTGNN surpasses the best multi-view graph representation baselines and achieves the maximum 14.26% performance improvement in terms of F1.

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising solutions for collaborative filtering (CF) through the modeling of user-item interaction graphs. The nucleus of existing GNN-based recommender systems involves recursive message passing along user-item interaction edges to refine encoded embeddings. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, current GNN-based methods encounter challenges of limited receptive fields and the presence of noisy\"interest-irrelevant\"connections. In contrast, Transformer-based methods excel in aggregating information adaptively and globally. Nevertheless, their application to large-scale interaction graphs is hindered by inherent complexities and challenges in capturing intricate, entangled structural information. In this paper, we propose TransGNN, a novel model that integrates Transformer and GNN layers in an alternating fashion to mutually enhance their capabilities. Specifically, TransGNN leverages Transformer layers to broaden the receptive field and disentangle information aggregation from edges, which aggregates information from more relevant nodes, thereby enhancing the message passing of GNNs. Additionally, to capture graph structure information effectively, positional encoding is meticulously designed and integrated into GNN layers to encode such structural knowledge into node attributes, thus enhancing the Transformer's performance on graphs. Efficiency considerations are also alleviated by proposing the sampling of the most relevant nodes for the Transformer, along with two efficient sample update strategies to reduce complexity. Furthermore, theoretical analysis demonstrates that TransGNN offers increased expressiveness compared to GNNs, with only a marginal increase in linear complexity. Extensive experiments on five public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TransGNN.",

            "abstract": "Crowd flow prediction, which aims to predict the in/out flows of different areas of a city, plays a critically important role in many real-world applications including intelligent transportation systems and public safety. The challenges of this problem lie in both the dynamic mobility patterns of crowds and the complex spatial-temporal correlations. Meanwhile, crowd flow is highly correlated to and affected by the Origin-Destination (OD) locations of the flow trajectories, which is largely ignored by existing works. In this paper, we study the novel problem of predicting the crowd flow and flow OD simultaneously, and propose a Multi-task Bayes-enhanced Adversarial Spatial Temporal Network entitled MBA-STNet to effectively address it. MBA-STNet adopts a shared-private framework which contains private spatial-temporal encoders, a shared spatial-temporal encoder, and decoders to learn the task-specific features and shared features. To effectively extract discriminative shared features, an adversarial loss on shared feature extraction is incorporated to reduce information redundancy. A Bayesian heterogeneous Spatio-temporal Attention Network is designed to learn the complex spatio-temporal correlations and alleviate the problem of data uncertainty. We also design an attentive temporal queue to capture the complex temporal dependency automatically without the help of domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations are conducted over the bike and taxicab trip datasets in New York. The results demonstrate that the proposed MBA-STNet is superior to state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Fine-Grained Urban Flow Inference With Incomplete Data",
            "abstract": "Fine-grained urban flow inference, which aims to infer the fine-grained urban flows of a city given the coarse-grained urban flow observations, is critically important to various smart city related applications such as urban planning and public safety. Previous works assume that the urban flow monitoring sensors are evenly distributed in space for data collection and thus the observed urban flows are complete. However, in real-world scenarios, sensors are usually unevenly deployed in space. For example, the traffic cameras are mostly deployed at the crossroads and central areas of a city, but less likely to be deployed in suburb. The data scarcity issue poses great challenges to existing methods for accurately inferring the fine-grained urban flows, because they require all urban flow observations to be available. In this paper, we make the first attempt to infer fine-grained urban flows based on the incomplete coarse-grained urban flow observations, and propose a Multi-Task urban flow Completion and Super-Resolution network (MT-CSR for short) to simultaneously complete the coarse-grained urban flows and infer the fine-grained flows. Specifically, MT-CSR consists of the data completion network (CMPNet for short) and data super-resolution network (SRNet for short). CmpNet is composed of a local spatial information based data completion module LocCmp and an auxiliary information based data completion module AuxCmp to consider both the local geographical and global semantic correlations for urban flow data completion. SRNet is designed to capture the complex associations between fine- and coarse-grained urban flows and upsample the coarse-grained data by stacking the designed super-resolution blocks. To gain an accurate inference, two parts are jointly conducted under a multi-task learning framework, and trained in an end-to-end manner using a two-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments on four large real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "The nucleus of online sponsored search systems lies in measuring the relevance between the search intents of users and the advertising purposes of advertisers. Existing conventional doublet-based (query-keyword) relevance models solely rely on short queries and keywords to uncover such intents, which ignore the diverse and personalized preferences of participants (i.e., users and advertisers), resulting in undesirable advertising performance. In this paper, we investigate the novel problem of Personalized A dvertiser-aware Sponsored Search (PASS). Our motivation lies in incorporating the portraits of users and advertisers into relevance models to facilitate the modeling of intrinsic search intents and advertising purposes, leading to a quadruple-based (i.e., user-query-keyword-advertiser) task. Various types of historical behaviors are explored in the format of hypergraphs to provide abundant signals on identifying the preferences of participants. A novel heterogeneous textual hypergraph transformer is further proposed to deeply fuse the textual semantics and the high-order hypergraph topology. Our proposal is extensively evaluated over real industry datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority.",

Conventional relevance models solely rely on the textual data within the queries and ads, whose performance is hindered by the scarce semantic information in these short texts. Recently, user behavior graphs have been incorporated to provide complementary information beyond pure textual semantics.Despite the promising performance, behavior-enhanced models suffer from exhausting resource costs due to the extra computations introduced by explicit topological aggregations. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Grained Topological Pre-Training paradigm, MGTLM, to teach language models to understand multi-grained topological information in behavior graphs, which contributes to eliminating explicit graph aggregations and avoiding information loss. Extensive experimental results over online and offline settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.",
