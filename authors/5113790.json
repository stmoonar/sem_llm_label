            "abstract": "Understanding how high-level concepts are represented within artificial neural networks is a fundamental challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. While existing literature in explainable AI emphasizes the importance of labeling neurons with concepts to understand their functioning, they mostly focus on identifying what stimulus activates a neuron in most cases, this corresponds to the notion of recall in information retrieval. We argue that this is only the first-part of a two-part job, it is imperative to also investigate neuron responses to other stimuli, i.e., their precision. We call this the neuron labels error margin.",

            "title": "On the Value of Labeled Data and Symbolic Methods for Hidden Neuron Activation Analysis",
            "abstract": "A major challenge in Explainable AI is in correctly interpreting activations of hidden neurons: accurate interpretations would help answer the question of what a deep learning system internally detects as relevant in the input, demystifying the otherwise black-box nature of deep learning systems. The state of the art indicates that hidden node activations can, in some cases, be interpretable in a way that makes sense to humans, but systematic automated methods that would be able to hypothesize and verify interpretations of hidden neuron activations are underexplored. This is particularly the case for approaches that can both draw explanations from substantial background knowledge, and that are based on inherently explainable (symbolic) methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic post-hoc Explainable AI method demonstrating that it provides meaningful interpretations. Our approach is based on using a Wikipedia-derived concept hierarchy with approximately 2 million classes as background knowledge, and utilizes OWL-reasoning-based Concept Induction for explanation generation. Additionally, we explore and compare the capabilities of off-the-shelf pre-trained multimodal-based explainable methods. Our results indicate that our approach can automatically attach meaningful class expressions as explanations to individual neurons in the dense layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Evaluation through statistical analysis and degree of concept activation in the hidden layer show that our method provides a competitive edge in both quantitative and qualitative aspects compared to prior work.",

Its authoritative version is given as an XML schema based on an XML mindset which means that it has significant limitations for use in a knowledge graphs context. We have therefore developed the Modular MODS Ontology (MMODS-O) which incorporates all elements and attributes of the MODS XML schema. In designing the ontology, we adopt the recent Modular Ontology Design Methodology (MOMo) with the intention to strike a balance between modularity and quality ontology design on the one hand, and conservative backward compatibility with MODS on the other.",

Examples of an Agent performing a Role using different Names are rather ubiquitous, e.g., authors who write under different pseudonyms, or different legal names for citizens of more than one country. The proposed pattern is a modified merger of a standard Agent Role and a standard Name pattern stub.",

            "abstract": "Digital images, being on the verge of its utmost popularity encompasses plenty of applications and as such are generated at an unprecedented rate. These digital form of data are often found with redundant information. Applications that require a bulk amount of images to be processed, turn out to be high regarding computational complexity. Needless to say, it leads to inefficient storage utilization. In this paper, a hybrid approach is applied to compress a large-scale image data-set by combining two popular algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means. This paper works with a view to diminishing the redundant information by implementing dimensionality reduction followed by color quantization. The PCA is used to project the data onto a lower dimensional space with retaining as maximum variance as possible. The K-means algorithm is used to restrict the distinct number of colors to represent an image by means of clustering the data together. The results obtained from the proposed method is compared with the results obtained from implementing PCA and K-means clustering algorithms independently, where the proposed method provides with a better compression ratio.",

            "abstract": "Cricket is beyond the shadow of a doubt one of the most popular forms of sports in the southern region of Asia. This form of sports is widely played in more than 125 countries recognized by the International Cricket Council. With the flourishing of cricket, various aspects of the game are being automated with the advent of technology. Use of computer vision in assisting third umpire decision is indubitably the well-liked one. One of the most challenging issues that first initiates the discussion on its prosperity is the duration of the game. The on-field umpire has to authorize decisions almost after each delivery following which modifications are carried out in the scorecard which is a very tedious process. The traditional approaches that have been considered so far involve wearing a specialized hand glove, which collides with the beauty of the originality in the field. In this paper, an approach is proposed and a prototype is implemented to automate the umpires decision by interpreting his hand gesture. The region of interest is selected using a Haar-cascade-classifier and then the particular gesture is recognized using logistic regression. This process would eliminate the manual updating of scorecards and thereby reduce the game duration notably. In addition, it excludes the prerequisite of wearing special gloves involving sensors. The efficiency of the algorithm is then cross-checked with the training and test data. This proved to be a very simple but efficient algorithm for umpires gesture detection.",
