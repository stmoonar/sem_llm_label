            "title": "Call Limit-Based Composite Service Selection",
            "abstract": "APIs allow companies to export, via the Internet, their skills and know-how, or even to open up new markets and new media for sale. But to fully exploit the advantages of these services, customers, mainly developers, must be equipped with tools giving the possibility of being able to assemble different services together. Fortunately, the notion of service composition is quite advanced, and different tools exist to compose services. However, as APIs with similar functionality are expected to be provided by competing providers, the key challenge is to find the most relevant compositions. This issue has been addressed in the context of QoS-based composite service selection. The downside, in practice, customers choose services based on the number of call limits. In this paper, we propose an approach to select the most relevant compositions based on the notion of call limit. Specifically, we show how the call limits of the individual services can be aggregated to obtain the call limits of a given composition. Then, we introduce the notion of minimal budget skyline, which comprises the most interesting compositions that fit within the customer's budget. In addition, we develop two algorithms, based on effective pruning strategies, to efficiently compute the minimal budget skyline. Finally, we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Cloud cognitive computing has received a lot of attention lately especially for tackling real-world problems such as vision, natural language processing, fraud detection, sentiment analysis and speech recognition. This paradigm is based on cloud serverless computing and it provides machine learning based functions to end users. Part of the appeal in adopting this paradigm is its simplicity and the future promises a fast-growing serverless-native ecosystem in which service discovery and composition methods must be provided. However, serverless platforms still lack automated searching methods and the research community\u2019s attention regarding this issue has been limited. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for discovering and composing cognitive functions in serverless platforms in order to automate the searching process and semantically answer users\u2019 requirements. We also carried a set of experiments to verify the correctness and the feasibility of our approach and discuss the influence of cognitive services nature on the outcomes of the discovery and composition approach.",

Work here refers to all forms of paid and unpaid labor in both physical and virtual workplaces and that is enabled by AI systems. This covers crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, online labor marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Qapa, but also regular jobs in physical workplaces. Bringing humans back to the frontier of FoW will increase their trust in AI systems and shift their perception to use them as a source of self-improvement, ensure better work performance, and positively shape social and economic outcomes of a society and a nation. To enable that, physical and virtual workplaces will need to capture human traits, behavior, evolving needs, and provide jobs to all. Attitudes, values, opinions regarding the processes and policies will need to be assessed and considered in the design of FoW ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Collaboration graphs are relevant sources of information to understand behavioural tendencies of groups of individuals. The study of these graphs enables figuring out factors that may affect the efficiency and the sustainability of cooperative work. For example, such a collaboration involves researchers who develop relationships with their external counterparts to address scientific challenges. As relations and projects change over time, the evolution of social structures must be tackled. We propose a statistical approach considering different structural collaboration patterns and captures the dynamic of the relational structures over the years. Our approach combines spatial processes modelling and Exponential Random Graph Models used to analyse social processes. Since the normalising constant involved in classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches is intractable, the inference remains challenging. To overcome this issue, we propose a Bayesian tool that relies on the recent ABC Shadow algorithm. The method is illustrated on real data sets from an open archive of scholarly documents. Through a simple formalism, our approach highlights the interactions between the different types of social relations at stake in the collaboration network.",

            "abstract": "Group key management protocols are crucial in establishing secured communication channels for collaborative IoT-based groups. The Internet of Things (IoT) dimension includes additional challenges. In fact, resource constrained members within dynamic and heterogeneous groups are unable to run existing group key protocols. Furthermore, these protocols need to be scalable and fault tolerant to suit growing and sensitive groups. To face these issues, we enhance our previously proposed protocol called Decentralized Batch-based Group Key protocol (DBGK). Using polynomial computation to secure data exchanges, we considerably improve its scalability, fault tolerance and collusion freeness properties. This gain is achieved thanks to the ability to include additional unconstrained members (controllers) while inducing a very limited cost on the constrained members. Furthermore, we include an energy preserving blockchain-based mechanism to authenticate group members credentials in a distributed manner. To assess our new protocol called DiStributed Batch-based Group Key protocol (DsBGK), we performed a detailed theoretical security analysis to evaluate its behaviour against well studied attacks in the literature. Furthermore, we validated this analysis using a formal validation tool. To evaluate DsBGK performances , we performed extensive simulations. We proceeded by comparing DsBGK in term of energy cost, first, with DBGK, then with other analogous protocols from the literature. The results confirmed the security soundness of DsBGK, in addition to an improved energy efficiency compared to its peers.",

            "abstract": "In distributed collaborative systems, participants maintain a replicated copy of shared documents. They edit their own copy and then share their modifications without any coordination. Copies follow successions of divergence and convergence. Convergence is a liveness property of collaborative systems. Some malicious participants may find an advantage to make the collaboration fail. To that end, they can preclude convergence of the copies. To protect convergence of copies, participants can exploit an authenticated log of modifications. New participants have to retrieve the entire log in order to contribute. Unfortunately, the cost of joining a collaboration increases with the size of this log. Causal Stability allows to prune authenticated logs in a static collaborative group without any malicious participants. In this paper, we first tailor Causal Stability to dynamic groups in presence of malicious participants. We then propose a mechanism to verify the consistency of a pruned log and a mechanism to authenticate a snapshot from a pruned log.",

Documentation of information exchange issues in real crisis management is quite superficial, generally pointing to conclusions without any supporting data. Using documentation of the Deepwater Horizon Accident in 2010, we suggest three requirements for the design of computationally supported information exchange: 1) computational support to distribute distilled information, not low-level data, 2) a computationally accessible, current plan to provide context to guide the routing of information to interested parties and 3) a means to detect and elevate newly relevant, but formerly suppressed detail.",

            "abstract": "Real-time collaborative editing allows multiple users to edit shared documents at the same time from different places. Existing real-time collaborative editors rely on a central authority that stores user data which is a perceived privacy threat. In this paper, we present MultiUser Text Editor (MUTE), a peer-to-peer web-based real-time collaborative editor without central authority disadvantages. Users share their data with the collaborators they trust without having to store their data on a central place. MUTE features high scalability and supports offline and ad-hoc collaboration.",

            "abstract": "Even though the cloud computing paradigm has proven benefits, it faces a serious problem that can compromise its commercial success. It concerns the lack of efficient approach for using optimally the available resources. For this, several approaches have been proposed. However, they suffer from several shortcomings. Often only one objective is taken into account, expressing all operations in terms of cost. Furthermore, business processes should be insured with elasticity and multi-tenancy mechanism while adjusting the available resources to the dynamic load distribution. The proposed approach aims to optimize two conflicting objectives, namely the number of migrations of tenants and the cost incurred using a set of resources. It allows to take into account the multi-tenancy property and the Cloud computing elasticity, and is efficient as shown by an extensive experimentation based on real data from Bonita BPM customers.",
