            "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have been applied on many aspects of the query optimization process, such as cardinality estimation and query execution time prediction, but very few tackle multiple aspects of the optimizer at the same time or combine both the underlying data and a query workload. QPSeeker takes a step towards a neural database planner, encapsulating the information of the data and the given workload to learn the distributions of cardinalities, costs and execution times of the query plan space. At inference, when a query is submitted to the database, QPSeeker uses its learned cost model and traverses the query plan space using Monte Carlo Tree Search to provide an execution plan for the query",

            "abstract": "Welcome to the second ACM DATA ECONOMY WORKSHOP (DEC), co-located with ACM SIGCMOD 2023. Data-driven decision making through machine learning algorithms (ML) is transforming the way society and the economy work and is having a profound positive impact on our daily lives. With the exception of very large companies that have both the data and the capabilities to develop powerful ML-driven services, the vast majority of demonstrably possible ML services, from e-health to transportation to predictive maintenance, to name a few, still remain at the level of ideas or prototypes for the simple reason that data, the capabilities to manipulate it, and the business models to bring it to market rarely exist under one roof. Data must somehow meet the ML and business skills that can unleash its full power for society and the economy. This has given rise to an extremely dynamic sector around the Data Economy, involving Data Providers/Controllers, data Intermediaries, often-times in the form of Data Marketplaces or Personal Information Management Systems for end users to control and even monetize their personal data. Despite its enormous potential and observed initial growth, the Data Economy is still in its early stages and therefore faces a still uncertain future and a number of existential challenges. These challenges include a wide range of technical issues that affect multiple disciplines of computer science, including networks and distributed systems, security and privacy, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. The mission of the ACM DEC workshop will be to bring together all CS capabilities needed to support the Data Economy. We would like to thank the entire technical program committee for reviewing and selecting papers for the workshop. We hope you will find the papers interesting and stimulating.",

            "abstract": "Enabling users to query data in a relational database using natural language has long been considered the holy grail of the database community. Towards this direction, there has been an increasing research focus on Natural Language Data Interfaces that allow users to pose queries in natural language and translate these queries to the underlying database query language. Several approaches have emerged especially due to the recent advances in deep neural networks. Despite this blooming, not only these systems are very complicated and difficult to understand, but they have yet to deliver their promise of enabling users to use natural language to access data easily. Hence, they have failed to see widespread adoption. A question naturally arises: is natural language access to data going to be the elusive holy grail of databases? We hope not. With the aim of fostering research on these open issues, in this position paper, we discuss (currently unmet) requirements for effective natural language data exploration and highlight promising research directions. Finally, we describe how to rethink the text-to-SQL problem and how this should be realized as an integral capability of a DBMS for the realization of a system that fully supports natural language queries over data.",

Our technique is applicable to both single dimensional and multidimensional datasets, is independent of token type, allows for a fine control of the introduced distortion, and can be used in a variety of use cases that involve buying and selling data in contemporary data marketplaces.",

            "abstract": "Natural Language to SQL systems (NL-to-SQL) have recently shown improved accuracy (exceeding 80%) for natural language to SQL query translation due to the emergence of transformer-based language models, and the popularity of the Spider benchmark. However, Spider mainly contains simple databases with few tables, columns, and entries, which do not reflect a realistic setting. Moreover, complex real-world databases with domain-specific content have little to no training data available in the form of NL/SQL-pairs leading to poor performance of existing NL-to-SQL systems.\n \n In this paper, we introduce\n ScienceBenchmark\n , a new complex NL-to-SQL benchmark for three real-world, highly domain-specific databases. For this new benchmark, SQL experts and domain experts created high-quality NL/SQL-pairs for each domain. To garner more data, we extended the small amount of human-generated data with synthetic data generated using GPT-3. We show that our benchmark is highly challenging, as the top performing systems on Spider achieve a very low performance on our benchmark. Thus, the challenge is many-fold: creating NL-to-SQL systems for highly complex domains with a small amount of hand-made training data augmented with synthetic data. To our knowledge,\n ScienceBenchmark\n is the first NL-to-SQL benchmark designed with complex real-world scientific databases, containing challenging training and test data carefully validated by domain experts.\n",

We introduce QueryER, a framework that seamlessly integrates Entity Resolution into Query Processing. QueryER executes analysis-aware deduplication by weaving ER operators into the query plan. The experimental evaluation of our approach exhibits that it adapts to the workload and scales on both real and synthetic datasets.",

            "abstract": "Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are core to fostering innovative thinking. Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",
