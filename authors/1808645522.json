            "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) stands as a pivotal technology addressing issues of data sparsity and cold start by transferring general knowledge from the source to the target domain. However, existing CDR models suffer limitations in adaptability across various scenarios due to their inherent complexity. To tackle this challenge, recent advancements introduce universal CDR models that leverage shared embeddings to capture general knowledge across domains and transfer it through \"Multi-task Learning'' or \"Pre-train, Fine-tune'' paradigms. However, these models often overlook the broader structural topology that spans domains and fail to align training objectives, potentially leading to negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose a motif-based prompt learning framework, MOP, which introducesmotif-based shared embeddings to encapsulate generalized domain knowledge, catering to both intra-domain and inter-domain CDR tasks. Specifically, we devise three typical motifs: butterfly, triangle, and random walk, and encode them through a Motif-based Encoder to obtain motif-based shared embeddings. Moreover, we train MOP under the \"Pre-training & Prompt Tuning'' paradigm. By unifying pre-training and recommendation tasks as a common motif-based similarity learning task and integrating adaptable prompt parameters to guide the model in downstream recommendation tasks, MOP excels in transferring domain knowledge effectively. Experimental results on four distinct CDR tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MOP than the state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "The availability of online services is vital as its strong relevance to revenue and user experience. To ensure online services\u2019 availability, quickly localizing the root causes of system failures is crucial. Given the high resource consumption of traces, call metric data are widely used by existing approaches to construct call graphs in practice. However, ambiguous correspondences between upstream and downstream calls may exist and result in exploring unexpected edges in the constructed call graph. Conducting root cause localization on this graph may lead to misjudgments of real root causes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate such ambiguity, which is overlooked in the existing literature. Inspired by the law of large numbers and the Markov properties of network traffic, we propose a regression-based method (named AmSitor) to address this problem effectively. Based on AmSitor, we propose an ambiguity-aware root cause localization approach based on Call Metric Data named CMDiagnostor, containing metric anomaly detection, ambiguity-free call graph construction, root cause exploration, and candidate root cause ranking modules. The comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on real-world datasets show that our CMDiagnostor can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches by 14% on the top-5 hit rate. Moreover, AmSitor can also be applied to existing baseline approaches separately to improve their performances one step further.

            "abstract": "The cold-start issue is a fundamental challenge in Recommender Systems. The recent self-supervised learning (SSL) on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model, PT-GNN, pre-trains the GNN model to reconstruct the cold-start embeddings and has shown great potential for cold-start recommendation. However, due to the over-smoothing problem, PT-GNN can only capture up to 3-order relation, which cannot provide much useful auxiliary information to depict the target cold-start user or item. Besides, the embedding reconstruction task only considers the intra-correlations within the subgraph of users and items, while ignoring the inter-correlations across different subgraphs. To solve the above challenges, we propose a multi-strategy-based pre-training method for cold-start recommendation (MPT), which extends PT-GNN from the perspective of model architecture and pretext tasks to improve the cold-start recommendation performance.1 Specifically, in terms of the model architecture, in addition to the short-range dependencies of users and items captured by the GNN encoder, we introduce a Transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies. In terms of the pretext task, in addition to considering the intra-correlations of users and items by the embedding reconstruction task, we add an embedding contrastive learning task to capture inter-correlations of users and items. We train the GNN and Transformer encoders on these pretext tasks under the meta-learning setting to simulate the real cold-start scenario, making the model able to be easily and rapidly adapted to new cold-start users and items. Experiments on three public recommendation datasets show the superiority of the proposed MPT model against the vanilla GNN models, the pre-training GNN model on user/item embedding inference, and the recommendation task.",

            "abstract": "As an important branch in Recommender System, occasional group recommendation has received more and more attention. In this scenario, each occasional group (cold\u2010start group) has no or few historical interacted items. As each occasional group has extremely sparse interactions with items, traditional group recommendation methods can not learn high\u2010quality group representations. The recent proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which incorporate the high\u2010order neighbors of the target occasional group, can alleviate the above problem in some extent. However, these GNNs still can not explicitly strengthen the embedding quality of the high\u2010order neighbors with few interactions. Motivated by the self\u2010supervised learning technique, which is able to find the correlations within the data itself, we propose a self\u2010supervised graph learning framework, which takes the user/item/group embedding reconstruction as the pretext task to enhance the embeddings of the cold\u2010start users/items/groups. To explicitly enhance the high\u2010order cold\u2010start neighbors' embedding quality, we further introduce an embedding enhancer, which leverages the self\u2010attention mechanism to improve the embedding quality for them.

Despite the recent advances on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) incorporate the high-order collaborative signal to alleviate the problem, the embeddings of the cold-start users and items aren't explicitly optimized, and the cold-start neighbors are not dealt with during the graph convolution in GNNs. This paper proposes to pre-train a GNN model before applying it for recommendation. Unlike the goal of recommendation, the pre-training GNN simulates the cold-start scenarios from the users/items with sufficient interactions and takes the embedding reconstruction as the pretext task, such that it can directly improve the embedding quality and can be easily adapted to the new cold-start users/items. To further reduce the impact from the cold-start neighbors, we incorporate a self-attention-based meta aggregator to enhance the aggregation ability of each graph convolution step, and an adaptive neighbor sampler to select the effective neighbors according to the feedbacks from the pre-training GNN model.

Using massive power-flow image samples, a convolutional neural network that aims to identify the system state is trained. A feature-map restriction technique is used to restructure the network. To enhance the robustness of the network, the random noise of branch flow is considered in the sample generation process.
