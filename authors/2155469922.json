However, perception, computing and communication are usually decoupled in today\u2019s vehicle-road coordination applications, which significantly adds delay and cost to the system. In this paper, we propose and implement a platform that integrates perception, computing and communication to provide timely roadside feature maps to vehicles for vision fusion. A neural processing unit (NPU) for computing and a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) wireless baseband IP for communication are both implemented on FPGA. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed platform using CoBEVT algorithm on the camera track of the OPV2V perception dataset. The experimental result show that our platform can expand the view of vehicles as well as improve information freshness in terms of end-to-end delay.",

            "abstract": "The driver acceleration/deceleration (A/D) profiles on surface streets have broad applications in transportation. With a large, high-resolution naturalistic driving data set, this article explores the normal driver A/D profiles in high-speed (\u226535 mi/h) environments by checking vehicle trajectories passing through isolated, rural high-speed, all-way-stop-controlled intersections. It is found that although drivers obviously decelerate in most trips when approaching stop signs, they only fully stop in 10.5% of trips, leading to safety concerns. It is noteworthy that accelerations generally take more time and distance than decelerations. On average, it takes 20.7 s and 1,059.7 ft for a deceleration maneuver and 25.2 s and 1,267.5 ft for an acceleration maneuver. The maximum deceleration rates in most trips are found to still comply with the existing design criteria. With the increase of travel speed, A/D distances keep increasing, whereas A/D durations increase first but then keep consistent around 22.5 s/26.5 s beyond 50 mi/h. Nonlinear relationships are found to exist between speed and travel distance in A/D and can be captured with the random effects loglog models. The estimated models give new insights for developing autonomous vehicles running like human drivers rather than machine robots on surface streets.",

            "abstract": "In a wireless network that conveys status updates from sources (i.e., sensors) to destinations, one of the key issues studied by existing literature is how to design an optimal source sampling strategy on account of the communication constraints which are often modeled as queues. In this paper, an alternative perspective is presented\u2014a novel status-aware communication scheme, namely parallel communications, is proposed which allows sensors to be communication-agnostic. Specifically, the proposed scheme can determine, based on an online prediction functionality, whether a status packet is worth transmitting considering both the network condition and status prediction, such that sensors can generate status packets without communication constraints. We evaluate the proposed scheme on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) test platform, which is integrated with a collaborative autonomous driving simulator, i.e., Simulation-of-Urban-Mobility (SUMO), to produce realistic vehicle control models and road conditions. The results show that with online status predictions, the channel occupancy is significantly reduced, while guaranteeing low status recovery error. Then the framework is applied to two scenarios: a multi-density platooning scenario, and a flight formation control scenario. Simulation results show that the scheme achieves better performance on the network level, in terms of keeping the minimum safe distance in both vehicle platooning and flight control.",
