            "title": "Community Deception in Attributed Networks",
            "abstract": "Community detection algorithms that analyze networks to identify communities of nodes are an essential part of the network analysis toolkit used daily by different analysts (e.g., data scientists and law enforcement). However, there is not enough awareness that members of a community $\\mathscr {C}$ (either revealed or not) inside a network $G$ could act strategically to evade such tools either for legitimate (e.g., activist groups in authoritarian regimes) or malicious (e.g., terrorists) purpose. Community deception offers this possibility. By identifying a certain number of $\\mathscr {C}$ \u2019s member connections to be rewired, community deception algorithms can successfully hide a community that wants to stay below the radar of detection techniques. However, the state-of-the-art deception approaches have focused on networks without attributes, although real-world networks (e.g., Facebook) include attributes (e.g., age and sex) that play a central role in detecting more accurate communities. This article faces three novel challenges introduced when designing deception techniques for networks with attributes. The first concerns how to model and encode attributes most flexibly. The second is about framing attribute-aware community deception as an optimization problem. Finally, the challenge of solving the optimization problem by leveraging network topology and attributes also arises. We leverage a simple way to model network attributes as edge weights, a novel optimization function called community diffusion, and Diffuser a greedy algorithm to optimize diffusion, to solve the above challenges. We evaluated Diffuser against several community detection algorithms and compared it with state-of-the-art deception approaches on various real-world networks. From the evaluation, we can draw two main observations. First, adopting attribute-oblivious deception techniques leads to unsatisfactory results. Second, community diffusion as an optimization function specific to attributed networks is preferred to community safeness, the state-of-the-art deception optimization function, even when recasting the latter as an attribute-aware function.",

            "abstract": "Process Mining is a family of techniques that exploit data collected from process execution to analyze and improve process efficiency, quality, and security. Over the years, many modeling languages have been proposed for process model specification, with different expressiveness, features, and computational properties.\n\nWe propose a new logic-based declarative formalism, called Constraint Formulae, to compose process specifications, expressed in heterogeneous process modeling languages, without altering their original semantics. We formalize common process mining tasks for Constraint Formulae, study their computational properties, and provide an implementation in Answer Set Programming.",

Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) have emerged as a reference tool to represent dynamic, structured and machine-interpretable knowledge that evolves over time. However, characterizing the evolution of TKGs in a meaningful and human-understandable way remains a significant challenge. In this short paper, we argue that Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), with its expressive temporal constructs, is a promising approach for capturing a wide range of temporal behaviors and high-level evolutionary patterns occurring in TKGs.",

However, its practical usage is still rather limited, as LTLf cannot deal with any quantitative aspect, such as with the costs of realizing some desired behaviour. The paper fills the gap by proposing a weighting framework for LTLf encoding such quantitative aspects in the traces over which it is evaluated. The complexity of reasoning problems on weighted traces is analyzed and compared to that of standard LTLf, by considering arbitrary formulas as well as classes of formulas defined in terms of relevant syntactic restrictions. Moreover, a reasoner for LTL on weighted finite traces is presented, and its performances are assessed on benchmark data.",

They encode the legally relevant events needed to satisfy the terms of an agreement and are usually defined by using procedural languages, even if some recent proposals investigated the possibility of using logic formalisms. However, existing logic-based initiatives are rather limited since they only enable the formal checking of properties of a single smart contract, totally neglecting its possible interactions with other smart contracts running on the same blockchain. This paper proposes a framework, called SCRea, that works on a set of smart contracts specified as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. SCRea enables to reason about smart contracts considered individually or by considering them as running cooperatively or competitively on the same blockchain.",

Graph embedding techniques allow to learn high-quality low-dimensional graph representations useful in various tasks, from node classification to clustering. Knowledge graphs are particular types of graphs characterized by several distinct types of nodes and edges. Existing knowledge graph embedding approaches have only focused on learning embeddings of nodes and predicates. However, the basic piece of information stored in knowledge graphs are triples and thus, an interesting problem is that of learning embeddings of triples as a whole. In this paper we report on Triple2Vec , a new technique to directly compute triple embeddings in knowledge graphs. Triple2Vec leverages the idea of line graph and extends it to the context of knowledge graphs. Embeddings are then generated by adopting the SkipGram model, where sentences are replaced with walks on a wighted version of the line graph.",

However, all existing approaches do not take into account the fact that network's edges can be weighted to take into account node similarity or relation strength. The goal of this paper is to present SECRETORUM, a novel community deception approach for community deception in weighted networks.",

Existing approaches have only focused on learning feature vectors for the nodes and predicates in a knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, none of them has tackled the problem of directly learning triple embeddings. The approaches that are closer to this task have focused on homogeneous graphs involving only one type of edge and obtain edge embeddings by applying some operation (e.g., average) on the embeddings of the endpoint nodes. The goal of this paper is to introduce Triple2Vec, a new technique to directly embed knowledge graph triples. We leverage the idea of line graph of a graph and extend it to the context of knowledge graphs. We introduce an edge weighting mechanism for the line graph based on semantic proximity. Embeddings are finally generated by adopting the SkipGram model, where sentences are replaced with graph walks. We evaluate our approach on different real-world knowledge graphs and compared it with related work. We also show an application of triple embeddings in the context of user-item recommendations.",
