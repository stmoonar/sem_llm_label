            "abstract": "The internet is often thought of as a democratizer, enabling equality in aspects such as pay, as well as a tool introducing novel communication and monetization opportunities. In this study we examine athletes on Cameo, a website that enables bi-directional fan-celebrity interactions, questioning whether the well-documented gender pay gaps in sports persist in this digital setting. Traditional studies into gender pay gaps in sports are mostly in a centralized setting where an organization decides the pay for the players, while Cameo facilitates grass-roots fan engagement where fans pay for video messages from their preferred athletes. The results showed that even on such a platform gender pay gaps persist, both in terms of cost-per-message, and in the number of requests, proxied by number of ratings. For instance, we find that female athletes have a median pay of 30$ per-video, while the same statistic is 40$ for men. The results also contribute to the study of parasocial relationships and personalized fan engagements over a distance. Something that has become more relevant during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where in-person fan engagement has often been limited.",

            "abstract": "Abstract In the present research we provide preliminary evidence of the convergent and divergent validity, test-retest reliability, and the utility of a single-item measure of media immersion. Convergent validity of the measure was demonstrated through positive correlations between the single-item measure and previously published measures of immersion with respect to one\u2019s favorite movie (Study 1) and the last video game respondents played (Study 2). Divergent validity was demonstrated through nonsignificant relationships between the single-item measure and a measure of socially desirable responding (Studies 2 and 3) and right-wing authoritarianism (Study 3). The measure was also found to have adequate test-retest reliability (Study 4). Finally, the utility of the measure was demonstrated through its ability to discriminate differences between fan ratings of fan and non-fan related media (Study 5). Taken together, the results provide strong preliminary support for the validity, reliability, and utility of this single-item measure of immersion. Implications for media research, limitations of the studies, and future directions for the application of the scale are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The four studies constructed and examined the validity of a text-based dictionary for assessing the values related to global citizenship. In Study 1, an initial list of words related to global citizens was obtained by conducting an analysis of participant definitions of the construct. In Study 2, the list obtained in Study 1 was further explored through a reaction time based categorization task. Words most quickly and reliably associated with global citizens were combined with synonyms to comprise the final global citizen dictionary. In Study 3, a greater number of global citizen related words were used to describe a global citizen (vs. entrepreneur). In Study 4, the use of global citizen related words when describing one's core values was shown to predict antecedents, identification, and outcomes of global citizenship. Together, the results provide initial validation of a linguistic measure of values related to global citizenship.",
