            "abstract": "Research Objects (ROs) have been proposed as a packaging mechanism to aggregate research outputs of scientific investigations and capture their context and metadata in a machine-readable manner. However, creating ROs (and collecting the respective metadata of their constituent resources) is still a time-consuming task. In this demo we present ya2ro, a tool designed to ease the creation of Research Objects following the RO-Crate specification. Given an input file with external resources available on the Web (datasets, software, publications and people), ya2ro will retrieve their metadata descriptions (if available), creating an aggregated RO-Crate available both in human-readable manner (HTML) and machine-readable manner (JSON-LD).",
