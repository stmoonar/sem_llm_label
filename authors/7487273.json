            "abstract": "Emergent patterns of collective attention towards scientists and their research may function as a proxy for scientific impact which traditionally is assessed via committees that award prizes to scientists. Therefore it is crucial to understand the relationships between scientific impact and online demand and supply for information about scientists and their work. In this paper, we compare the temporal pattern of information supply (article creations) and information demand (article views) on Wikipedia for two groups of scientists: scientists who received one of the most prestigious awards in their field and influential scientists from the same field who did not receive an award. Our research highlights that awards function as external shocks which increase supply and demand for information about scientists, but hardly affect information supply and demand for their research topics. Further, we find interesting differences in the temporal ordering of information supply between the two groups: (i) award-winners have a higher probability that interest in them precedes interest in their work; (ii) for award winners interest in articles about them and their work is temporally more clustered than for non-awarded scientists.",

            "title": "Wikiwhere: An interactive tool for studying the geographical provenance of Wikipedia references",
            "abstract": "Wikipedia articles about the same topic in different language editions are built around different sources of information. For example, one can find very different news articles linked as references in the English Wikipedia article titled \"Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\" than in its German counterpart (determined via Wikipedia's language links). Some of this difference can of course be attributed to the different language proficiencies of readers and editors in separate language editions, yet, although including English-language news sources seems to be no issue in the German edition, English references that are listed do not overlap highly with the ones in the article's English version. Such patterns could be an indicator of bias towards certain national contexts when referencing facts and statements in Wikipedia. However, determining for each reference which national context it can be traced back to, and comparing the link distributions to each other is infeasible for casual readers or scientists with non-technical backgrounds. Wikiwhere answers the question where Web references stem from by analyzing and visualizing the geographic location of external reference links that are included in a given Wikipedia article. Instead of relying solely on the IP location of a given URL our machine learning models consider several features.",
