            "title": "Hierarchical Query Classification in E-commerce Search",
            "abstract": "E-commerce platforms typically store and structure product information and search data in a hierarchy. Efficiently categorizing user search queries into a similar hierarchical structure is paramount in enhancing user experience on e-commerce platforms as well as news curation and academic research. The significance of this task is amplified when dealing with sensitive query categorization or critical information dissemination, where inaccuracies can lead to considerable negative impacts. The inherent complexity of hierarchical query classification is compounded by two primary challenges: (1) the pronounced class imbalance that skews towards dominant categories, and (2) the inherent brevity and ambiguity of search queries that hinder accurate classification. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that leverages hierarchical information through (i) enhanced representation learning that utilizes the contrastive loss to discern fine-grained instance relationships within the hierarchy, called \"instance hierarchy'', and (ii) a nuanced hierarchical classification loss that attends to the intrinsic label taxonomy, named \"label hierarchy''. Additionally, based on our observation that certain unlabeled queries share typographical similarities with labeled queries, we propose a neighborhood-aware sampling technique to intelligently select these unlabeled queries to boost the classification performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the proprietary Amazon dataset, and comparable to SOTA on the public datasets of Web of Science and RCV1-V2. These results underscore the efficacy of our proposed solution, and pave the path toward the next generation of hierarchy-aware query classification systems.",

            "title": "COSMO: A Large-Scale E-commerce Common Sense Knowledge Generation and Serving System at Amazon",
            "abstract": "Applications of large-scale knowledge graphs in the e-commerce platforms can improve shopping experience for their customers. While existing e-commerce knowledge graphs (KGs) integrate a large volume of concepts or product attributes, they fail to discover user intentions, leaving the gap with how people think, behave, and interact with the surrounding world. In this work, we present COSMO, a scalable system to mine user-centric commonsense knowledge from massive behaviors and construct industry-scale knowledge graphs to empower diverse online services. In particular, we describe a pipeline for collecting high-quality seed knowledge assertions that are distilled from large language models (LLMs) and further refined by critic classifiers trained over human-in-the-loop annotated data.Since those generations may not always align with human preferences and contain noises, we then describe how we adopt instruction tuning to finetune an efficient language model~(COSMO-LM) for faithful e-commerce commonsense knowledge generation at scale. COSMO-LM effectively expands our knowledge graph to 18 major categories at Amazon, producing millions of high-quality knowledge with only 30k annotated instructions. Finally COSMO has been deployed in Amazon search applications such as search navigation. Both offline and online A/B experiments demonstrate our proposed system achieves significant improvement. Furthermore, these experiments highlight the immense potential of commonsense knowledge extracted from instruction-finetuned large language models.",

            "abstract": "Online shopping platforms, such as Amazon, offer services to billions of people worldwide. Unlike web search or other search engines, product search engines have their unique characteristics, primarily featuring short queries which are mostly a combination of product attributes and structured product search space. The uniqueness of product search underscores the crucial importance of the query understanding component. However, there are limited studies focusing on exploring this impact within real-world product search engines. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive study and sharing our year-long journey investigating how the query understanding service impacts Amazon Product Search. Firstly, we explore how query understanding-based ranking features influence the ranking process. Next, we delve into how the query understanding system contributes to understanding the performance of a ranking model. Building on the insights gained from our study on the evaluation of the query understanding-based ranking model, we propose a query understanding-based multi-task learning framework for ranking. We present our studies and investigations using the real-world system on Amazon Search.",

            "abstract": "Query Parsing aims to extract product attributes, such as color, brand, and product type, from search queries. These attributes play a crucial role in search engines for tasks such as matching, ranking, and recommendation. There are two types of attributes: explicit attributes that are mentioned explicitly in the search query, and implicit attributes that are mentioned implicitly. Existing works on query parsing do not differentiate between explicit query parsing and implicit query parsing, which limits their performance in product search engines. In this work, we demonstrate the critical importance of implicit attributes in real-world product search engines. We then present our solution for implicit query parsing at Amazon Search, which is a unified framework combining recent advancements in knowledge graph technologies and customer behavior analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal through offline experiments on Amazon search log data. We also show how to deploy and use the framework on Amazon search to improve customers' shopping experiences.",

            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "Query understanding models extract attributes from search queries, like color, product type, brand, etc. Search engines rely on these attributes for ranking, advertising, and recommendation, etc. However, product search queries are usually short, three or four words on average. This information shortage limits the search engine\u2019s power to provide high-quality services. In this talk, we would like to share our year-long journey in solving the information shortage problem and introduce an end-to-end system for attribute recommendation at Amazon Search. We showcase how the system works and how the system contributes to the long-term user experience through offline and online experiments at Amazon Search. We hope this talk can inspire more follow-up works in understanding and improving attribute recommendations in product search.",
