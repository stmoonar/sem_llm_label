            "abstract": "Abstract The rapid development of technology allows people to obtain a large amount of data, which contains important information and various noises. How to obtain useful knowledge from data is the most important thing at this stage of machine learning (ML). The problem of unbalanced classification is currently an important topic in the field of data mining and ML. At present, this problem has attracted more and more attention and is a relatively new challenge for academia and industry. The problem of unbalanced classification involves classifying data when there is insufficient data or severe category distribution deviations. Due to the inherent complexity of unbalanced data sets, more new algorithms and tools are needed to effectively convert a large amount of raw data into useful information and knowledge. Unbalanced data set is a special case of classification problem, in which the distribution between classes is uneven, and it is difficult to classify data accurately. This article mainly introduces the research on the processing method of computer algorithms based on the processing method of unbalanced data sets based on ML, aiming to provide some ideas and directions for the processing of computer algorithms based on unbalanced data sets based on ML. This article proposes a research strategy for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML, including data preprocessing, decision tree data classification algorithm, and C4.5 algorithm, which are used to conduct research experiments on processing methods for unbalanced data sets based on ML. The experimental results in this article show that the accuracy rate of the decision tree C4.5 algorithm based on ML is 94.80%, which can be better used for processing unbalanced data sets based on ML.",

            "abstract": "With the continuous development of modern information technology, my country has gradually entered the era of big data. The salient features of the big data era are rich data resources, convenient data processing and information exchange, and smoother learning and communication between people. The impact of big data on education is also very significant. This paper studies the online education big data platform based on data mining and data collection technology, uses data mining technology and data collection technology to design the online education big data platform, and tests the designed platform. The test results show that this paper improves the algorithm the accuracy of clustering analysis is good, and the number of errors is controlled within 5, and then the query time of the platform is tested. The time for the platform from data query to acceptance is within 30 minutes, which meets the requirements of platform design.",

            "abstract": "A new multi-paths routing algorithm has been proposed in this paper, which can solve the problem of congestion caused by overloads of links and provide a better environment compared with the traditional networking technologies. This methodology will call the routing mechanism when the links appear overloads, and it can adopt alternative path or multi-paths to complete data transmission to reduce congestion. Finally, the experiment results show that the algorithm can improve the throughput, decrease the packet loss ratio comparing to single path system, and achieve a new balance.",
