            "abstract": "Recommendation explanations help to improve their acceptance by end users. The form of explanation of interest here is presenting an existing review of the recommended item. The challenge is in selecting a suitable review, which is customarily addressed by assessing the relative importance of each review to the recommendation objective. Our focus is on improving review-level explanation by leveraging additional information in the form of questions and answers (QA). The proposed framework employs QA in an attention mechanism that aligns reviews to various QAs of an item and assesses their contribution jointly to the recommendation objective. The benefits are two-fold. For one, QA aids in selecting more useful reviews. For another, QA itself could accompany a well-aligned review in an expanded form of explanation. Experiments showcase the efficacies of our method as compared to baselines in identifying useful reviews and QAs, while maintaining parity in recommendation performance.",

            "abstract": "To aid users in choice-making, explainable recommendation models seek to provide not only accurate recommendations but also accompanying explanations that help to make sense of those recommendations. Most of the previous approaches rely on evaluative explanations, assessing the quality of an individual item along some aspects of interest to the user. In this work, we are interested in comparative explanations, the less studied problem of assessing a recommended item in comparison to another reference item. In particular, we propose to anchor reference items on the previously adopted items in a user's history. Not only do we aim at providing comparative explanations involving such items, but we also formulate comparative constraints involving aspect-level comparisons between the target item and the reference items. The framework allows us to incorporate these constraints and integrate them with recommendation objectives involving both types of subjective and objective aspect-level quality assumptions. Experiments on public datasets of several product categories showcase the efficacies of our methodology as compared to baselines at attaining better recommendation accuracies and intuitive explanations.",

            "abstract": "Explanations help users make sense of recommendations, increasing the likelihood of adoption. Existing approaches to explainable recommendations tend to rely on rigidly standardized templates, only allowing fill-in-the-blank aspect-level sentiments. For more flexible, literate, and varied explanations that cover various aspects of interest, we propose to synthesize an explanation by selecting snippets from reviews to optimize representativeness and coherence. To fit the target user's aspect preferences, we contextualize the opinions based on a compatible explainable recommendation model. Experiments on datasets of varying product categories showcase the efficacies of our method as compared to baselines based on templates, review summarization, selection, and text generation.",

Due to the large number of reviews of products, selecting representative reviews from one product alone is already a challenging problem. In this work, we further aim to conduct review selection for multiple products simultaneously for comparative purposes. We formulate objective functions that synchronize the review selection and design efficient algorithms to optimize for the objective functions. To narrow down the potentially long list of comparison items into a shorter list of more similar items, we construct a graph representing items\u2019 similarity and design efficient algorithms to find the heaviest \ud835\udc58 -subgraph including the target item. The results are validated on real world datasets on various product categories",
