            "title": "Rumor Detection with Hierarchical Representation on Bipartite Adhoc Event Trees",
            "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has caused tremendous effects on information propagation, raising extreme challenges in detecting rumors. Existing rumor detection methods typically exploit the reposting propagation of a rumor candidate for detection by regarding all reposts to a rumor candidate as a temporal sequence and learning semantics representations of the repost sequence. However, extracting informative support from the topological structure of propagation and the influence of reposting authors for debunking rumors is crucial, which generally has not been well addressed by existing methods. In this article, we organize a claim post in circulation as an ad hoc event tree, extract event elements, and convert it into bipartite ad hoc event trees in terms of both posts and authors, i.e., author tree and post tree. Accordingly, we propose a novel rumor detection model with hierarchical representation on the bipartite ad hoc event trees called BAET. Specifically, we introduce word embedding and feature encoder for the author and post tree, respectively, and design a root-aware attention module to perform node representation. Then we adopt the tree-like RNN model to capture the structural correlations and propose a tree-aware attention module to learn tree representation for the author tree and post tree, respectively. Extensive experimental results on two public Twitter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BAET in exploring and exploiting the rumor propagation structure and the superior detection performance of BAET over state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

            "title": "Rumor Detection with Field of Linear and Non-Linear Propagation",
            "abstract": "The propagation of rumors is a complex and varied phenomenon. In the process of rumor dissemination, in addition to rumor claims, there will be abundant social context information surrounding the rumor. Therefore, it is vital to learn the characteristics of rumors in terms of both the linear temporal sequence and the non-linear diffusion structure simultaneously. However, in some existing research, time-dependent and diffusion-related information has not been fully utilized. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel model Rumor Detection with Field of Linear and Non-Linear Propagation (RDLNP) to automatically detect rumors from the above two fields by taking advantage of claim content, social context and temporal information. First, the Rumor Hybrid Feature Learning (RHFL) we designed can extract the correlations between the claims and temporal information, differentiate the hybrid features of specific posts, and generate unified representations for rumors. Second, we proposed Non-Linear Structure Learning (NLSL) and Linear Sequence Learning (LSL) to integrate contextual features along the path of the diffusion structure and temporal engagement variation of responses respectively. Finally, Shared Feature Learning (SFL) models the representation reinforcement and learns the mutual influence between NLSL and LSL, and then highlights their valuable features. Experiments conduct on two public and widely used datasets, i.e. PHEME and RumorEval, demonstrate both the effectiveness and the outstanding performance of the proposed approach.",
