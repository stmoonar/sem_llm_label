            "abstract": "We present a first measurement study on the adoption and actual privacy of two popular decentralized CoinJoin implementations, Wasabi and Samourai, in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. By applying highly accurate (\u00bf 99%) algorithms we can effectively detect 30,251 Wasabi and 223,597 Samourai transactions within the block range 530,500 to 725,348 (2018-07-05 to 2022-02-28). We also found a steady adoption of these services with a total value of mixed coins of ca. 4.74 B USD and average monthly mixing amounts of ca. 172.93 M USD) for Wasabi and ca. 41.72 M USD for Samourai. Furthermore, we could trace ca. 322 M USD directly received by cryptoasset exchanges and ca. 1.16 B USD indirectly received via two hops. Our analysis further shows that the traceability of addresses during the pre-mixing and post-mixing narrows down the anonymity set provided by these coin mixing services. It also shows that the selection of addresses for the CoinJoin transaction can harm anonymity. Overall, this is the first paper to provide a comprehensive picture of the adoption and privacy of distributed CoinJoin transactions. Understanding this picture is particularly interesting in the light of ongoing regulatory efforts that will, on the one hand, affect compliance measures implemented in cryptocurrency exchanges and, on the other hand, the privacy of end-users.",

            "abstract": "Experiencing a steadily growing interest in Austrian Literature, we planned to initiate an Open Distance Learning (ODL) course. For that reason, it was desired to build a framework that allows to record the data required for publication in a highly generic form, which is difficult in the case of lecture data and multimedia information. Nevertheless the aim was to separate data from presentation, for not loosing information and gaining flexibility for future use of the data in arbitrary other (scientific) projects. Moreover as the internet and multimedia technology is evolving with an enormous speed, our approach allows easy adoption of data to future internet or multimedia technology. Data is entered into a database using a GUI for easy access. In the next steps, the database data is transformed into XML. Using XML and DOM/SAX interfaces a flexible generation of different presentation formats like HTML and PDF is automatically possible, as well as the reuse in other context. In the future probably direct use of XML (new browser generation) could be possible using XSL or DSSSL.",
