            "abstract": "The potential social harms that large language models pose, such as generating offensive content and reinforcing biases, are steeply rising. Existing works focus on coping with this concern while interacting with ill-intentioned users, such as those who explicitly make hate speech or elicit harmful responses. However, discussions on sensitive issues can become toxic even if the users are well-intentioned. For safer models in such scenarios, we present the Sensitive Questions and Acceptable Response (SQuARe) dataset, a large-scale Korean dataset of 49k sensitive questions with 42k acceptable and 46k non-acceptable responses. The dataset was constructed leveraging HyperCLOVA in a human-in-the-loop manner based on real news headlines. Experiments show that acceptable response generation significantly improves for HyperCLOVA and GPT-3, demonstrating the efficacy of this dataset.",

            "abstract": "Wikipedia plays a crucial role in the integrity of the Web. This work analyzes the reliability of this global encyclopedia through the lens of its references. We operationalize the notion of reference quality by defining reference need (RN), i.e., the percentage of sentences missing a citation, and reference risk (RR), i.e., the proportion of non-authoritative references. We release Citation Detective, a tool for automatically calculating the RN score, and discover that the RN score has dropped by 20 percent point in the last decade, with more than half of verifiable statements now accompanying references. The RR score has remained below 1% over the years as a result of the efforts of the community to eliminate unreliable references. We propose pairing novice and experienced editors on the same Wikipedia article as a strategy to enhance reference quality. Our quasi-experiment indicates that such a co-editing experience can result in a lasting advantage in identifying unreliable sources in future edits. As Wikipedia is frequently used as the ground truth for numerous Web applications, our findings and suggestions on its reliability can have a far-reaching impact. We discuss the possibility of other Web services adopting Wiki-style user collaboration to eliminate unreliable content.",

            "abstract": "Earth system models (ESM) are computer models that quantitatively simulate the Earth\u2019s climate system. These models are the basis of modern research on climate change and its effects on our planet. Advances in computational technologies and simulation methodologies have enabled ESM to produce simulation outputs at a finer level of detail, which is important for policy planning and research at the regional level. As ESM is a complex incorporation of different physical domains and environmental variables, computational costs for conducting simulations at a finer resolution are prohibitively expensive. In practice, the simulation at the coarser level is mapped onto the regional level by the process of \u2018\u2018downscaling\u2019\u2019. In this presents a self-supervised deep-learning solution for climate downscaling that does not require high-resolution ground truth data during the model training process. We introduce a self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) super-resolution model that trains on a single data instance at a time and can adapt to its underlying data patterns at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently improves the climate downscaling performance over the widely used baselines by a large margin.",

Empirical research examining laypeople\u2019s opinions has been largely restricted to the moral domain and has only inspected a limited set of negative outcomes. This study collects lay perceptions of legal responsibility for a wide range of machine-caused harms. We investigated how much people (N = 572) expect users and developers of machines to pay as legal damages in 37 diverse scenarios from the book \u201cHow Humans Judge Machines\u201d by Hidalgo et al. [37]. Our results suggest that people\u2019s expectations of legal damages for machine-caused harms are influenced by several factors, including perceived moral wrongness and the presence of victims. The scenarios exhibited substantial variation in how they were perceived and thus in the amount of legal damages they called for. People viewed both users and developers as legally responsible and expected the latter to pay higher damages. We discuss our findings in the context of future regulations of machines.",

This study examines over 5 million Wikipedia articles to assess the reliability of references in multiple language editions. We quantify the cross-lingual patterns of the perennial sources list, a collection of reliability labels for web domains identified and collaboratively agreed upon by Wikipedia editors. We discover that some sources (or web domains) deemed untrustworthy in one language (i.e., English) continue to appear in articles in other languages. This trend is especially evident with sources tailored for smaller communities. Furthermore, non-authoritative sources found in the English version of a page tend to persist in other language versions of that page. We finally present a case study on the Chinese, Russian, and Swedish Wikipedias to demonstrate a discrepancy in reference reliability across cultures. Our finding highlights future challenges in coordinating global knowledge on source reliability.",

Building upon research suggesting that people blame AI systems, we investigated how several factors influence people\u2019s reactive attitudes towards machines, designers, and users. The results of three studies (N = 1,153) indicate differences in how blame is attributed to these actors. Whether AI systems were explainable did not impact blame directed at them, their developers, and their users. Considerations about fairness and harmfulness increased blame towards designers and users but had little to no effect on judgments of AI systems. Instead, what determined people\u2019s reactive attitudes towards machines was whether people thought blaming them would be a suitable response to algorithmic harm. We discuss implications, such as how future decisions about including AI systems in the social and moral spheres will shape laypeople\u2019s reactions to AI-caused harm.",

This work presents a self-supervised model, called DualFair, that can debias sensitive attributes like gender and race from learned representations. Unlike existing models that target a single type of fairness, our model jointly optimizes for two fairness criteria\u2014group fairness and counterfactual fairness\u2014and hence makes fairer predictions at both the group and individual levels. Our model uses contrastive loss to generate embeddings that are indistinguishable for each protected group, while forcing the embeddings of counterfactual pairs to be similar. It then uses a self-knowledge distillation method to maintain the quality of representation for the downstream tasks. Extensive analysis over multiple datasets confirms the model\u2019s validity and further shows the synergy of jointly addressing two fairness criteria, suggesting the model\u2019s potential value in fair intelligent Web applications.",

While offline activities can provide a better picture of the geographical association of cultural traits than online activities, gathering such data on a large scale has been challenging. Here, we use multi-decade longitudinal records of cultural events from Meetup.com, the largest event-based social networking service, to examine the landscape of offline cultural events. We analyze the temporal and categorical event dynamics driven by cultural diversity using over 2 million event logs collected over 17 years in 90 countries. Our results show that the national economic status explains 44.6 percent of the variance in total event count, while cultural characteristics such as individualism and long-term orientation explain 32.8 percent of the variance in topic categories. Furthermore, our analysis using hierarchical clustering reveals cultural proximity between the topics of socio-cultural activities (e.g., politics, leisure, health, technology). We expect that this work provides a landscape of social and cultural activities across the world, which allows us to better understand their dynamical patterns as well as their associations with cultural characteristics.",

            "title": "Multi-Stage Machine Learning Model for Hierarchical Tie Valence Prediction",
            "abstract": "Individuals interacting in organizational settings involving varying levels of formal hierarchy naturally form a complex network of social ties having different tie valences (e.g., positive and negative connections). Social ties critically affect employees\u2019 satisfaction, behaviors, cognition, and outcomes\u2014yet identifying them solely through survey data is challenging because of the large size of some organizations or the often hidden nature of these ties and their valences. We present a novel deep learning model encompassing NLP and graph neural network techniques that identifies positive and negative ties in a hierarchical network. The proposed model uses human resource attributes as node information and web-logged work conversation data as link information. Our findings suggest that the presence of conversation data improves the tie valence classification by 8.91% compared to employing user attributes alone. This gain came from accurately distinguishing positive ties, particularly for male, non-minority, and older employee groups. We also show a substantial difference in conversation patterns for positive and negative ties with positive ties being associated with more messages exchanged on weekends, and lower use of words related to anger and sadness. These findings have broad implications for facilitating collaboration and managing conflict within organizational and other social networks.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores how machine learning can help classify aid activities by sector using the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS). The CRS is a key source of data for monitoring and evaluating aid flows in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG17 which calls for global partnership and data sharing. To address the challenges of current labor-intensive practices of assigning the code and the related human inefficiencies, we propose a machine learning solution that uses ELECTRA to suggest relevant five-digit purpose codes in CRS for aid activities, achieving an accuracy of 0.9575 for the top-3 recommendations. We also conduct qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with SDG experts who assess the model results and provide feedback. We discuss the policy, practical, and methodological implications of our work and highlight the potential of AI applications to improve routine tasks in the public sector and foster partnerships for achieving the SDGs.",
