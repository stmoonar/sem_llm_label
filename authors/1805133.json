            "abstract": "Food safety is undergoing through tremendous challenges over the last years, with food scandals and contamination issues putting constant pressure to global markets, while consumers demands for high quality of products are increasing. This raises the need for increasing stakeholders' knowledge of the food production process and adopting data sharing practices in the product and supply chain management. Data sharing platforms can undertake the role of creating high value from data while facilitating secure and mutually beneficial multi-partner data sharing. Our proposed system aims to deliver an industrial data platform that will facilitate the exchange and connection of data between different food safety actors, who are interested in sharing information critical to certification, while boosting the way that food certification takes place in Europe.",

            "abstract": "One of the significant challenges for the future is to guarantee safe food for all inhabitants of the planet. During the last 15 years, very important fraud issues like the '2013 horse meat scandal' and the '2008 Chinese milk scandal' have greatly affected the food industry and public health. One of the alternatives for this issue consists of increasing production, but to accomplish this, it is necessary that innovative options be applied to enhance the safety of the food supply chain. For this reason, it is quite important to have the right infrastructure in order to manage data of the food safety sector and provide useful analytics to Food Safety Experts. In this paper, we describe Agroknow's Big Data Platform architecture and examine its scalability for data management and experimentation.",

Existing products and services are developed for a particular domain, can be used only in combination with already integrated datasets or their language coverage is limited. In this paper, we present an innovative solution FREME - an open framework of e-Services for multilingual and semantic enrichment of digital content. The framework integrates six interoperable e-Services. We describe the core features of each e-Service and illustrate their usage in the context of four business cases: i) authoring and publishing; ii) translation and localisation; iii) cross-lingual access to data; and iv) personalised Web content recommendations. Business cases drive the design and development of the framework.",

            "abstract": "Carotid atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease and its clinical diagnosis depends on the evaluation of heterogeneous clinical data, such as imaging exams, biochemical tests and the patient's clinical history. The lack of interoperability between Health Information Systems (HIS) does not allow the physicians to acquire all the necessary data for the diagnostic process. In this paper, a semantically-aided architecture is proposed for a web-based monitoring system for carotid atherosclerosis that is able to gather and unify heterogeneous data with the use of an ontology and to create a common interface for data access enhancing the interoperability of HIS. The architecture is based on an application ontology of carotid atherosclerosis that is used to (a) integrate heterogeneous data sources on the basis of semantic representation and ontological reasoning and (b) access the critical information using SPARQL query rewriting and ontology-based data access services. The architecture was tested over a carotid atherosclerosis dataset consisting of the imaging exams and the clinical profile of 233 patients, using a set of complex queries, constructed by the physicians. The proposed architecture was evaluated with respect to the complexity of the queries that the physicians could make and the retrieval speed. The proposed architecture gave promising results in terms of interoperability, data integration of heterogeneous sources with an ontological way and expanded capabilities of query and retrieval in HIS.",

Due to the dynamic and changing parameters of the various application contexts, careful testing and parameterization has to be carried out before an algorithm is finally deployed in a real setting. This paper investigates how a previously proposed tool for simulated testing of collaborative filtering algorithms, called the Collaborative Filtering Simulator CollaFiS, can be expanded to an e-science environment for researchers so that it runs over a digital research infrastructure. More specifically, a survey of design options for neighborhood-based collaborative filtering systems is carried out in order to illustrate the variety of requirements that need to be met. Then, a number of usage scenarios that could be supported by an e-science environment for collaborative filtering research are presented. Three example dataset cases are used to illustrate how the new version of CollaFiS can support research and experimentation on collaborative filtering algorithms using different data and various parameter options. Overall, this paper showcases how e-science environments and infrastructures may facilitate the research activities of people working on recommender systems.",

The same algorithms have shown to be performing in totally different ways when a new or evolved data set is considered, thus leading to a need for continuous monitoring of how they operate in a realistic setting. In this paper we investigate such a real life implementation of a multi-criteria recommender system and try to identify the needed adjustments that need to take place in order for it to better match the requirements of its operational environment. More specifically, we examine the case of a multi-attribute collaborative filtering algorithm that has been supporting the recommendation service within a Web portal for organic and sustainable education. Our study particularly explores the experimental performance of the already implemented algorithm, as well as an alternative one, using data from the intended application, a simulated expansion of it, and from similar portals. The results of this study indicate the importance of the frequent experimental investigation of a recommender system's various design options, and the need for the exploration of adaptive implementations in real life recommender systems.",

It is expected that being able to put together different datasets from various applications will make it possible to support learning analytics of a much larger scale and across different contexts. We examine how this can be achieved from a practical perspective by carrying out a study that focuses on three real datasets. More specifically, we combine social data that has been collected from the users of three learning portals and reflect on how they should be handled. We start by studying the data types and formats that these portals use to represent and store social and usage data. Then we develop crosswalks between the different schemas, so that merged versions of the source datasets may be created. The results of this bottom-up, hands-on investigation reveal several interesting issues that need to be overcome before aggregated sets of social and usage data can be actually used to support learning analytics research or services.",

            "abstract": "A large number of curated digital collections containing learning resources of a various kind has emerged in the last year. These include referatories containing descriptions for resources in the Web (as MERLOT), aggregated collections (as Organic.Edunet), concrete initiatives as Khan Academy, repositories hosting and versioning modular content (as Connexions) and meta-aggregators (as Globe and Learning Registry). Also, OpenCourseware and other OER initiatives have contributed to making this ecosystem of resources richer. Very interesting insights can be extracted when studying the usage and social data that are produced within the learning collections, repositories and federations. At the same time, concerns for the quality and sustainability of these collections have been raised, which has lead to research on quality measurement and metrics. The Workshop attempts to bring studies and demonstrations for any kind of analysis done on learning resource collections, from an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider digital collections not as merely IT deployments but as social systems with contributors, owners, evaluators and users forming patterns of interactions on top of portals or through search systems embedded in other learning technology components. This is in coherence of considering these social systems under a Web Science approach (http://webscience.org/).",

            "title": "Using Multilingual Analytics to Explore the Usage of a Learning Portal in Developing Countries",
            "abstract": "Learning analytics is a domain constantly evolving throughout the last years, due to the acknowledgement of its importance. Learning analytics may be applied in a variety of different cases but their role in understanding the multilingual requirements of users of learning portals is of an outstanding significance. As the adaptation of existing portals in multilingual environments is a cost and time-consuming aspect of the development of a portal, the outcomes of learning analytics may provide the requirements on which further multilingual services of a portal will be built, ensuring their efficiency. This paper aims to identify and interpret the behavior of users from developing countries in a multilingual learning portal using the log files of the portal by applying the methodology defined in a previous work by Stoitsis et al. (2012). The paper also aims to identify the aspects which should be further studied by future related works, by focusing on specific regions and countries, which exhibit special interest for further adaptation of the portal to additional multilingual environments.",
