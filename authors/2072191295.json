            "title": "ExaWorks Software Development Kit: A Robust and Scalable Collection of Interoperable Workflow Technologies",
            "abstract": "Scientific discovery increasingly requires executing heterogeneous scientific workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. Heterogeneous workflows contain different types of tasks (e.g., simulation, analysis, and learning) that need to be mapped, scheduled, and launched on different computing. That requires a software stack that enables users to code their workflows and automate resource management and workflow execution. Currently, there are many workflow technologies with diverse levels of robustness and capabilities, and users face difficult choices of software that can effectively and efficiently support their use cases on HPC machines, especially when considering the latest exascale platforms. We contributed to addressing this issue by developing the ExaWorks Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK is a curated collection of workflow technologies engineered following current best practices and specifically designed to work on HPC platforms. We present our experience with (1) curating those technologies, (2) integrating them to provide users with new capabilities, (3) developing a continuous integration platform to test the SDK on DOE HPC platforms, (4) designing a dashboard to publish the results of those tests, and (5) devising an innovative documentation platform to help users to use those technologies. Our experience details the requirements and the best practices needed to curate workflow technologies, and it also serves as a blueprint for the capabilities and services that DOE will have to offer to support a variety of scientific heterogeneous workflows on the newly available exascale HPC platforms.",

            "abstract": "Workflows are critical for scientific discovery. However, the sophistication, heterogeneity, and scale of workflows make building, testing, and optimizing them increasingly challenging. Furthermore, their complexity and heterogeneity make performance reproducibility hard. In this paper, we propose workflow mini-apps as a tool to address the challenges in building and testing workflows while controlling the fidelity of representing real-world workflows. Workflow mini-apps are deployed and run on various HPC systems and architectures without workflow-specific constraints. We offer insight into their design and implementation, providing an analysis of their performance and reproducibility. Workflow mini-apps thus advance the science of workflows by providing simple, portable, and managed (fidelity) representations of otherwise complex and difficult-to-control real workflows.",

            "abstract": "Managing and preparing complex data for deep learning, a prevalent approach in large-scale data science can be challenging. Data transfer for model training also presents difficulties, impacting scientific fields like genomics, climate modeling, and astronomy. A large-scale solution like Google Pathways with a distributed execution environment for deep learning models exists but is proprietary. Integrating existing open-source, scalable runtime tools and data frameworks on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms is crucial to address these challenges. Our objective is to establish a smooth and unified method of combining data engineering and deep learning frameworks with diverse execution capabilities that can be deployed on various high-performance computing platforms, including cloud and supercomputers. We aim to support heterogeneous systems with accelerators, where Cylon and other data engineering and deep learning frameworks can utilize heterogeneous execution. To achieve this, we propose Radical-Cylon, a heterogeneous runtime system with a parallel and distributed data framework to execute Cylon as a task of Radical Pilot. We thoroughly explain Radical-Cylon's design and development and the execution process of Cylon tasks using Radical Pilot. This approach enables the use of heterogeneous MPI-communicators across multiple nodes. Radical-Cylon achieves better performance than Bare-Metal Cylon with minimal and constant overhead. Radical-Cylon achieves (4~15)% faster execution time than batch execution while performing similar join and sort operations with 35 million and 3.5 billion rows with the same resources. The approach aims to excel in both scientific and engineering research HPC systems while demonstrating robust performance on cloud infrastructures. This dual capability fosters collaboration and innovation within the open-source scientific research community.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Scientific computing communities increasingly run their experiments using complex data- and compute-intensive workflows that utilize distributed and heterogeneous architectures targeting numerical simulations and machine learning, often executed on the Department of Energy Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs). We argue that a principled, systematic approach to implementing FAIR principles at scale, including fine-grained metadata extraction and organization, can help with the numerous challenges to performance reproducibility posed by such workflows. We extract workflow patterns, propose a set of tools to manage the entire life cycle of performance metadata, and aggregate them in an HPC-ready framework for reproducibility (RECUP). We describe the challenges in making these tools interoperable, preliminary work, and lessons learned from this experiment.",

            "abstract": "The importance of ensemble computing is well established. However, executing ensembles at scale introduces interesting performance fluctuations that have not been well investigated. In this paper, we trace our experience uncovering performance fluctuations of ensemble applications (primarily constituting a workflow of GROMACS tasks), and unsuccessful attempts, so far, at trying to discern the underlying cause(s) of performance fluctuations. Is the failure to discern the causative or contributing factors a failure of capability? Or imagination? Do the fluctuations have their genesis in some inscrutable aspect of the system or software? Does it warrant a fundamental reassessment and rethinking of how we assume and conceptualize performance reproducibility? Answers to these questions are not straightforward, nor are they immediate or obvious. We conclude with a discussion about the performance of ensemble applications and ruminate over the implications for how we define and measure application performance.",
