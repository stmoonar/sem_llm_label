            "abstract": "Semantic retrieval, which retrieves semantically matched items given a textual query, has been an essential component to enhance system effectiveness in e-commerce search. In this paper, we study the multimodal retrieval problem, where the visual information (e.g, image) of item is leveraged as supplementary of textual information to enrich item representation and further improve retrieval performance. Though learning from cross-modality data has been studied extensively in tasks such as visual question answering or media summarization, multimodal retrieval remains a non-trivial and unsolved problem especially in the asymmetric scenario where the query is unimodal while the item is multimodal. In this paper, we propose a novel model named SMAR, which stands for Semantic-enhanced Modality-Asymmetric Retrieval, to tackle the problem of modality fusion and alignment in this kind of asymmetric scenario. Extensive experimental results on an industrial dataset show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models significantly in retrieval accuracy. We have open sourced our industrial dataset for the sake of reproducibility and future research works.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained great prevalence in tackling various analytical tasks on graph-structured data (i.e., networks). Typical GNNs and their variants adopt a message-passing principle that obtains network representations by the attribute propagates along network topology, which however ignores the rich textual semantics (e.g., local word-sequence) that exist in numerous real-world networks. Existing methods for text-rich networks integrate textual semantics by mainly using internal information such as topics or phrases/words, which often suffer from an inability to comprehensively mine the textual semantics, limiting the reciprocal guidance between network structure and textual semantics. To address these problems, we present a novel text-rich GNN with external knowledge (TeKo), in order to make full use of both structural and textual information within text-rich networks. Specifically, we first present a flexible heterogeneous semantic network that integrates high-quality entities as well as interactions among documents and entities. We then introduce two types of external knowledge, that is, structured triplets and unstructured entity descriptions, to gain a deeper insight into textual semantics. Furthermore, we devise a reciprocal convolutional mechanism for the constructed heterogeneous semantic network, enabling network structure and textual semantics to collaboratively enhance each other and learn high-level network representations. Extensive experiments illustrate that TeKo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of text-rich networks as well as a large-scale e-commerce searching dataset.",

            "abstract": "Product images are essential for providing desirable user experience in an e-commerce platform. For a platform with billions of products, it is extremely time-costly and labor-expensive to manually pick and organize qualified images. Furthermore, there are the numerous and complicated image rules that a product image needs to comply in order to be generated/selected. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a new learning framework in order to achieve Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence (AGPIS) in e-commerce. To this end, we propose a Multi-modality Unified Image-sequence Classifier (MUIsC), which is able to simultaneously detect all categories of rule violations through learning. MUIsC leverages textual review feedback as the additional training target and utilizes product textual description to provide extra semantic information. %Without using prior knowledge or manually-crafted task, a single MUIsC model is able to learn the holistic knowledge of image reviewing and detect all categories of rule violations simultaneously. Based on offline evaluations, we show that the proposed MUIsC significantly outperforms various baselines. Besides MUIsC, we also integrate some other important modules in the proposed framework, such as primary image selection, non-compliant content detection, and image deduplication. With all these modules, our framework works effectively and efficiently in JD.com recommendation platform. By Dec 2021, our AGPIS framework has generated high-standard images for about 1.5 million products and achieves 13.6% in reject rate.

            "abstract": "We propose a novel domain-specific generative pre-training (DSGPT) method for text generation and apply it to the product title and review summarization problems on E-commerce mobile display. First, we adopt a decoder-only transformer architecture, which fits well for fine-tuning tasks by combining input and output all together. Second, we demonstrate utilizing only small amount of pre-training data in related domains is powerful. Pre-training a language model from a general corpus such as Wikipedia or the Common Crawl requires tremendous time and resource commitment, and can be wasteful if the downstream tasks are limited in variety. Our DSGPT is pre-trained on a limited dataset, the Chinese short text summarization dataset (LCSTS). Third, our model does not require product-related human-labeled data. For title summarization task, the state of art explicitly uses additional background knowledge in training and predicting stages. In contrast, our model implicitly captures this knowledge and achieves significant improvement over other methods, after fine-tuning on the public Taobao.com dataset. For review summarization task, we utilize JD.com in-house dataset, and observe similar improvement over standard machine translation methods which lack the flexibility of fine-tuning. Our proposed work can be simply extended to other domains for a wide range of text generation tasks.",

Most of the methods for fake review detection start with textual features and behavioral features. However, they are time-consuming and easily detected by fraudulent users. Although most of the existing neural network-based methods address the problems presented by the complex semantics of reviews, they do not account for the implicit patterns among users, reviews, and products; additionally, they do not consider the usefulness of information regarding fine-grained aspects in identifying fake reviews. In this paper, we propose an attention-based multilevel interactive neural network model with aspect constraints that mines the multilevel implicit expression mode of reviews and integrates four dimensions, namely, users, review texts, products and fine-grained aspects, into review representations. We model the relationships between users and products and use these relationships as a regularization term to redefine the model\u2019s objective function. The experimental results from three public datasets show that the model that we propose is superior to the state-of-the-art methods; thus showing the effectiveness and portability of our model.",

            "abstract": "Result relevance prediction is an essential task of e-commerce search engines to boost the utility of search engines and ensure smooth user experience. The last few years eyewitnessed a flurry of research on the use of Transformer-style models and deep text-match models to improve relevance. However, these two types of models ignored the inherent bipartite network structures that are ubiquitous in e-commerce search logs, making these models ineffective. We propose in this paper a novel Second-order Relevance, which is fundamentally different from the previous First-order Relevance, to improve result relevance prediction. We design, for the first time, an end-to-end First-and-Second-order Relevance prediction model for e-commerce item relevance. The model is augmented by the neighborhood structures of bipartite networks that are built using the information of user behavioral feedback, including clicks and purchases. To ensure that edges accurately encode relevance information, we introduce external knowledge generated from BERT to refine the network of user behaviors. This allows the new model to integrate information from neighboring items and queries, which are highly relevant to the focus query-item pair under consideration. Results of offline experiments showed that the new model significantly improved the prediction accuracy in terms of human relevance judgment. An ablation study showed that the First-and-Second-order model gained a 4.3% average gain over the First-order model. Results of an online A/B test revealed that the new model derived more commercial benefits compared to the base model.",

In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.",

In this work, we propose a two-stage ranking scheme, which first recalls wide range of candidate items through refined query/title keyword matching, and then classifies the recalled items using BERT-Large fine-tuned on human label data. We also implemented parallel prediction on multiple GPU hosts and a C++ tokenization custom op of Tensorflow. In this data challenge, our model won the 1st place in the supervised phase (based on overall F1 score) and 2nd place in the final phase (based on average per query F1 score).",

Traditional information retrieval methods focus on keyword matching and hand-crafted or counting-based numeric features, with limited understanding of item semantic relevance. We describe a highly-scalable feed-forward neural model to provide relevance score for (query, item) pairs, using only user query and item title as features, and both user click feedback as well as limited human ratings as labels. Several general enhancements were applied to further optimize eval/test metrics, including Siamese pairwise architecture, random batch negative co-training, and point-wise fine-tuning. We found significant improvement over GBDT baseline as well as several off-the-shelf deep-learning baselines on an independently constructed ratings dataset. The GBDT model relies on 10 times more features. We also present metrics for select subset combinations of techniques mentioned above.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a new HDP based online review rating regression model named Topic-Sentiment-Preference Regression Analysis (TSPRA). TSPRA combines topics (i.e. product aspects), word sentiment and user preference as regression factors, and is able to perform topic clustering, review rating prediction, sentiment analysis and what we invent as \"critical aspect\" analysis altogether in one framework. TSPRA extends sentiment approaches by integrating the key concept \"user preference\" in collaborative filtering (CF) models into consideration, while it is distinct from current CF models by decoupling \"user preference\" and \"sentiment\" as independent factors. Our experiments conducted on 22 Amazon datasets show overwhelming better performance in rating predication against a state-of-art model FLAME (2015) in terms of error, Pearson's Correlation and number of inverted pairs. For sentiment analysis, we compare the derived word sentiments against a public sentiment resource SenticNet3 and our sentiment estimations clearly make more sense in the context of online reviews. Last, as a result of the de-correlation of \"user preference\" from \"sentiment\", TSPRA is able to evaluate a new concept \"critical aspects\", defined as the product aspects seriously concerned by users but negatively commented in reviews. Improvement to such \"critical aspects\" could be most effective to enhance user experience.",
