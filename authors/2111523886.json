            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) provide a new way to build chatbots by accepting natural language prompts. Yet, it is unclear how to design prompts to power chatbots to carry on naturalistic conversations while pursuing a given goal such as collecting self-report data from users. We explore what design factors of prompts can help steer chatbots to talk naturally and collect data reliably. To this aim, we formulated four prompt designs with different structures and personas. Through an online study (N = 48) where participants conversed with chatbots driven by different designs of prompts, we assessed how prompt designs and conversation topics affected the conversation flows and users' perceptions of chatbots. Our chatbots covered 79% of the desired information slots during conversations, and the designs of prompts and topics significantly influenced the conversation flows and the data collection performance. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of building chatbots with LLMs.",

            "abstract": "Voice user interfaces (VUIs) have made their way into people\u2019s daily lives, from voice assistants to smart speakers. Although VUIs typically just react to direct user commands, increasingly, they incorporate elements of proactive behaviors. In particular, proactive smart speakers have the potential for many applications, ranging from healthcare to entertainment; however, their usability in everyday life is subject to interaction errors. To systematically investigate the nature of errors, we designed a voice-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) application to run on proactive speakers. We captured 1,213 user interactions in a 3-week field deployment in 13 participants\u2019 homes. Through auxiliary audio recordings and logs, we identify substantial interaction errors and strategies that users apply to overcome those errors. We further analyze the interaction timings and provide insights into the time cost of errors. We find that, even for answering simple ESMs, interaction errors occur frequently and can hamper the usability of proactive speakers and user experience. Our work also identifies multiple facets of VUIs that can be improved in terms of the timing of speech.",

They provide a natural user interface through conversations and hence have the potential to reach a wide population in their homes and on the go. Several developer tools and commercial as well as open-source frameworks allow for the deployment of both text-based chatbots and voice assistants. In this 90 min tutorial, participants will learn how to choose an appropriate platform, how to design and deploy their conversational agents, and how to transform traditional surveys through conversation agents.",

            "title": "Understanding User Perceptions of Proactive Smart Speakers",
            "abstract": "Voice assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home, increasingly find their way into consumer homes. Their functionality, however, is currently limited to being passive answer machines rather than proactively engaging users in conversations. Speakers' proactivity would open up a range of important application scenarios, including health services, such as checking in on patient states and triggering medication reminders. It remains unclear how passive speakers should implement proactivity. To better understand user perceptions, we ran a 3-week field study with 13 participants where we modified the off-the-shelf Google Home to become proactive. During the study, our speaker proactively triggered conversations that were essentially Experience Sampling probes allowing us to identify when to engage users. Applying machine-learning, we are able to predict user responsiveness with a 71.6% accuracy and find predictive features. We also identify self-reported factors, such as boredom and mood, that are significantly correlated with users' perceived availability. Our prototype and findings inform the design of proactive speakers that verbally engage users at opportune moments and contribute to the design of proactive application scenarios and voice-based experience sampling studies.",

            "abstract": "Smart speakers and conversational interfaces increasingly make it into consumer\u2019s homes. Listening to users\u2019 commands assigns them a rather passive role. Proactive speakers, on the other hand, have the potential to empower a broad range of applications such as context-aware health interventions and self-tracking systems. To achieve proactivity, however, requires the speaker to become context-aware and be able to detect opportune moments to initiate interactions. In this work, we present a proactive speaker prototype based on Google Home to investigate interaction contexts. We, additionally, built a voice-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) application to study contextual factors that are correlated to opportune moments for device-triggered interactions. Preliminary results from a three-week field study with 7 participants indicate the proposed prototype is a robust way to achieve proactivity and implement voice-based ESM. We present use cases for future research and applications for proactive smart speakers in the context of digital health.",
