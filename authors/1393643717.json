            "abstract": "In the last two decades, multiple information and communications technology evolutions have boosted the ability to collect and analyze vast numbers of data (on the order of zettabytes). Collectively, they have paved the way for the so-called data economy, revolutionizing most sectors of our society, including health care, transportation, and grids. At the core of this revolution, distributed data-intensive applications compose services operated by multiple parties in the cloud\u2013edge continuum; they process, manage, and exchange massive numbers of data at an unprecedented rate. However, data hold little value without adequate data protection. Traditional solutions, which aim to balance data quality and protection, are insufficient to address the peculiarities of the data economy, including trustworthy data sharing and management, composite service support, and multiparty data lifecycle. This article analyzes how trust management systems (TMSs) can regain the lead in supporting trustworthy data-intensive applications, discussing current challenges and proposing a road map for new-generation TMSs in the data economy.",

As the data landscape evolves, the imperative to navigate and maximize scientific opportunities has never been greater. Our vision paper outlines a strategic approach to unify and integrate diverse datasets, aiming to cultivate a collaborative space conducive to scientific discovery.The core of the design and construction of a data lake is the development of formal and semi-automatic tools, enabling the meticulous curation of quantitative and qualitative data from experiments. Our unique ''research-in-the-loop'' methodology ensures that scientists across various disciplines are integrally involved in the curation process, combining automated, mathematical, and manual tasks to address complex problems, from seismic detection to biodiversity studies. By fostering reproducibility and applicability of research, our approach enhances the integrity and impact of scientific experiments. This initiative is set to improve data management practices, strengthening the capacity of Life \\&Earth sciences to solve some of our time's most critical environmental and biological challenges.",

It has been implemented in the\n platform LACLICHEV (Latin American Climate Change Evolution platform).\n Exploring the history of climate change through digitalized newspapers\n published around two centuries ago introduces four challenges: (1) curating\n content for tracking entries describing meteorological events; (2) processing\n (digging into) colloquial language (and its geographic variations5) for\n extracting meteorological events; (3) analyzing newspapers to discover\n meteorological patterns possibly associated with climate change; (4)\n designing tools for exploring the extracted content. LACLICHEV provides tools\n for curating, exploring, and analyzing historical news paper articles, their\n description and location, and the vocabularies used for referring to\n meteorological events. This platform makes it possible to understand and\n identify possible patterns and models that can build an empirical and social\n view of the history of climate change in the Latin American region.",

The paper introduces a workflow for quanti-qualitative research processes that produces and consumes content versions through collaborative phases validated through consensus protocols performed by research teams. We argue that content versioning is a critical component that supports the research process's reproducibility, traceability, and rationale. We propose a curation framework that provides methods, protocols, and tools for supporting the RITL approach to managing the content produced by quanti-qualitative methods. The paper reports a validation experiment using a use case about the study on disseminating political statements in graffiti.",

            "abstract": "This vision paper underscores the technical challenges and difficulties of addressing urban computing from a Diversity and Inclusion (DEI) decolonial standpoint. Issues of DEI, which encompass factors such as gender, race, age, socio-economic status, physical abilities, and religion, necessitate a shift in how we conceptualise the design of scientific and engineering methodologies. The decolonial perspective can be employed to scrutinise the influence of dominant viewpoints on our understanding of progress, innovation, and their contribution to societal welfare. The hypothesis is that these perspectives can be integrated into the design processes that deal with solutions, knowledge, and information systems across all layers, from infrastructure to application and user interfaces. This paper exhibits research questions, challenges and possible strategies to design DEI aware urban computing solutions with a decolonial perspective.",
