            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from the industry and academic communities. While previous models have achieved remarkable successes, an important problem may still hinder their performances, that is, the sparsity of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. In specific, our framework contains a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate high-quality user behavior sequences, while the anchor model is trained based on the original and new generated samples, and leveraged to provide the final recommendation list. To implement the sampler model, we first design four types of heuristic methods based on either random or frequency-based strategies. And then, to improve the quality of the generated sequences, we propose two learning-based samplers by discovering the decision boundaries or increasing the sample informativeness. At last, we build an RL based model to automatically determine where to edit the history behaviors and how many items should be replaced. Considering that the sampler model can be imperfect, we, at last, analyze the influence of the noisy information contained in the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory, and design a simple but effective method to better serve the anchor model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

            "abstract": "In order to support the study of recent advances in recommender systems, this paper presents an extended recommendation library consisting of eight packages for up-to-date topics and architectures. First of all, from a data perspective, we consider three important topics related to data issues (ie sparsity, bias and distribution shift ), and develop five packages accordingly, including meta-learning, data augmentation, debiasing, fairness and cross-domain recommendation. Furthermore, from a model perspective, we develop two benchmarking packages for Transformer-based and graph neural network~(GNN)-based models, respectively. All the packages (consisting of 65 new models) are developed based on a popular recommendation framework RecBole, ensuring that both the implementation and interface are unified. For each package, we provide complete implementations from data loading, experimental setup, evaluation and algorithm implementation. This library provides a valuable resource to facilitate the up-to-date research in recommender systems. The project is released at the link: \\urlhttps://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole2.0.",

            "abstract": "As an essential operation of legal retrieval, legal case matching plays a central role in intelligent legal systems. This task has a high demand on the explainability of matching results because of its critical impacts on downstream applications --- the matched legal cases may provide supportive evidence for the judgments of target cases and thus influence the fairness and justice of legal decisions. Focusing on this challenging task, we propose a novel and explainable method, namely IOT-Match, with the help of computational optimal transport, which formulates the legal case matching problem as an inverse optimal transport (IOT) problem. Different from most existing methods, which merely focus on the sentence-level semantic similarity between legal cases, our IOT-Match learns to extract rationales from paired legal cases based on both semantics and legal characteristics of their sentences. The extracted rationales are further applied to generate faithful explanations and conduct matching. Moreover, the proposed IOT-Match is robust to the alignment label insufficiency issue commonly in practical legal case matching tasks, which is suitable for both supervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms. To demonstrate the superiority of our IOT-Match method and construct a benchmark of explainable legal case matching task, we not only extend the well-known Challenge of AI in Law (CAIL) dataset but also build a new Explainable Legal cAse Matching (ELAM) dataset, which contains lots of legal cases with detailed and explainable annotations. Experiments on these two datasets show that our IOT-Match outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently on matching prediction, rationale extraction, and explanation generation.",

Existing models are mostly based on the technique of inverse propensity score (IPS). However, in the recommendation domain, IPS can be hard to estimate given the sparse and noisy nature of the observed user-item exposure data. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we assume that the user preference can be dominated by a small amount of latent factors, and propose to cluster the users for computing more accurate IPS via increasing the exposure densities. Basically, such method is similar with the spirit of stratification models in applied statistics. However, unlike previous heuristic stratification strategy, we learn the cluster criterion by presenting the users with low ranking embeddings, which are future shared with the user representations in the recommender model. At last, we find that our model has strong connections with the previous two types of debiased recommender models. We conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Previous models mostly focus on designing different models to fit the observed data, which can be quite sparse in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel generative session-based recommendation framework. The main building block of our idea is to develop a generator to simulate user sequential behaviors, which are leveraged to train and improve the target sequential recommender model. In order to generate high quality samples, we consider two aspects: (1) the rationality as a sequence of user behaviors, and (2) the informativeness for training the target model. To satisfy these requirements, we design a doubly adversarial network. The first adversarial module aims to make the generated samples conform to the underlying patterns of the real user sequential preference (rationality requirement). The second adversarial module is targeted at widening the model experiences by generating samples which can induce larger model losses (informativeness requirement). In our model, the samples are generated based on a reinforcement learning strategy, where the reward is related with both of the above aspects. In order to stable the training process, we introduce a self-paced regularizer to learn the agent in an easy-to-hard manner. We conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

            "abstract": "AI creation, such as poem or lyrics generation, has attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities, with many promising models proposed in the past few years. Existing methods usually estimate the outputs based on single and independent visual or textual information. However, in reality, humans usually make creations according to their experiences, which may involve different modalities and be sequentially correlated. To model such human capabilities, in this paper, we define and solve a novel AI creation problem based on human experiences. More specifically, we study how to generate texts based on sequential multi-modal information. Compared with the previous works, this task is much more difficult because the designed model has to well understand and adapt the semantics among different modalities and effectively convert them into the output in a sequential manner. To alleviate these difficulties, we firstly design a multi-channel sequence-to-sequence architecture equipped with a multi-modal attention network. For more effective optimization, we then propose a curriculum negative sampling strategy tailored for the sequential inputs. To benchmark this problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we manually labeled a new multi-modal experience dataset. With this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing our model with a series of representative baselines, where we can demonstrate significant improvements in our model based on both automatic and human-centered metrics.

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation holds the promise of understanding user preference by capturing successive behavior correlations. Existing research focus on designing different models for better fitting the offline datasets. However, the observational data may have been contaminated by the exposure or selection biases, which renders the learned sequential models unreliable. In order to solve this fundamental problem, in this paper, we propose to reformulate the sequential recommendation task with the potential outcome framework, where we are able to clearly understand the data bias mechanism and correct it by re-weighting the training instances with the inverse propensity score (IPS). For more robustness modeling, a clipping strategy is applied to the IPS estimation to reduce the variance of the learning objective. To make our framework more practical, we design a parameterized model to remove the impact of the potential latent confounders. At last, we theoretically analyze the unbiasedness of the proposed framework under both vanilla and clipping IPS estimations.

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation basically aims to capture user evolving preference. Intuitively, a user interacts with an item usually because of some specific feature, and user evolving preference is essentially determined by a series of important features along the time line. However, existing sequential models usually represent each item by a unified embedding, which fails to distinguish item features, let along modeling the feature sequences. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel sequential recommender model by learning the key item feature sequences underlying user behaviors, which facilitates more focused model optimization and better recommendation performance. To achieve this goal, we firstly represent each item by explicit or latent features, and then build both soft and hard models to route optimal feature sequences. More specifically, in the soft model, we design a 2D attention mechanism, which simultaneously distinguishes the importances of the items in a sequence and the features for the same item. For the hard model, we regard the feature routing problem as a Markov decision process, and propose a reinforcement learning method to generate feature sequences, which can lead to the lowered negative log-likelihood. In the experiments, we compare our model with the state-of-the-art methods based on real-world datasets, where we can empirically demonstrate 8.2 and 16.1 improvements of our model on NDCG and MRR, respectively.",

            "title": "Dually Enhanced Propensity Score Estimation in Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems train their models based on a large amount of implicit user feedback data and may be subject to biases when users are systematically under/over-exposed to certain items. Unbiased learning based on inverse propensity scores (IPS), which estimate the probability of observing a user-item pair given the historical information, has been proposed to address the issue. In these methods, propensity score estimation is usually limited to the view of item, that is, treating the feedback data as sequences of items that interacted with the users. However, the feedback data can also be treated from the view of user, as the sequences of users that interact with the items. Moreover, the two views can jointly enhance the propensity score estimation. Inspired by the observation, we propose to estimate the propensity scores from the views of user and item, called Dually Enhanced Propensity Score Estimation (DEPS). Specifically, given a target user-item pair and the corresponding item and user interaction sequences, DEPS first constructs a time-aware causal graph to represent the user-item observational probability. According to the graph, two complementary propensity scores are estimated from the views of item and user, respectively, based on the same set of user feedback data. Finally, two transformers are designed to make use of the two propensity scores and make the final preference prediction. Theoretical analysis showed the unbiasedness and variance of DEPS. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks and a proprietary industrial dataset demonstrated that DEPS can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "The Elo rating system is widely adopted to evaluate the skills of (chess) game and sports players. Recently it has been also integrated into machine learning algorithms in evaluating the performance of computerised AI agents. However, an accurate estimation of the Elo rating (for the top players) often requires many rounds of competitions, which can be expensive to carry out. In this paper, to minimize the number of comparisons and to improve the sample efficiency of the Elo evaluation (for top players), we propose an efficient online match scheduling algorithm. Specifically, we identify and match the top players through a dueling bandits framework and tailor the bandit algorithm to the gradient-based update of Elo. We show that it reduces the per-step memory and time complexity to constant, compared to the traditional likelihood maximization approaches requiring O(t) time. Our algorithm has a regret guarantee that is sublinear in the number of competition rounds and has been extended to the multidimensional Elo ratings for handling intransitive games. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior convergence speed and time efficiency on a variety of gaming tasks.",
