            "abstract": "Dialogue generation is an important NLP task fraught with many challenges. The challenges become more daunting for low-resource African languages. To enable the creation of dialogue agents for African languages, we contribute the first high-quality dialogue datasets for 6 African languages: Swahili, Wolof, Hausa, Nigerian Pidgin English, Kinyarwanda & Yor\u00f9b\u00e1. There are a total of 9,000 turns, each language having 1,500 turns, which we translate from a portion of the English multi-domain MultiWOZ dataset. Subsequently, we benchmark by investigating & analyzing the effectiveness of modelling through transfer learning by utilziing state-of-the-art (SoTA) deep monolingual models: DialoGPT and BlenderBot. We compare the models with a simple seq2seq baseline using perplexity. Besides this, we conduct human evaluation of single-turn conversations by using majority votes and measure inter-annotator agreement (IAA). We find that the hypothesis that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that generalize across languages holds. We observe human-like conversations, to different degrees, in 5 out of the 6 languages. The language with the most transferable properties is the Nigerian Pidgin English, with a human-likeness score of 78.1%, of which 34.4% are unanimous. We freely provide the datasets and host the model checkpoints/demos on the HuggingFace hub for public access.",

            "abstract": "This research aims to explore various methods for assessing user feedback in mixed-initiative conversational search (CS ) systems. While CS systems enjoy profuse advancements across multiple aspects, recent research fails to successfully incorporate feedback from the users. One of the main reasons for that is the lack of system-user conversational interaction data. To this end, we propose a user simulator-based framework for multi-turn interactions with a variety of mixed-initiative CS systems. Specifically, we develop a user simulator, dubbed ConvSim, that, once initialized with an information need description, is capable of providing feedback to system's responses, as well as answering potential clarifying questions. Our experiments on a wide variety of state-of-the-art passage retrieval and neural re-ranking models show that effective utilization of user feedback can lead to 16% retrieval performance increase in terms of nDCG@3. Moreover, we observe consistent improvements as the number of feedback rounds increases (35% relative improvement in terms of nDCG@3 after three rounds). This points to a research gap in the development of specific feedback processing modules and opens a potential for significant advancements in CS. To support further research in the topic, we release over 30 000 transcripts of system-simulator interactions based on well-established CS datasets.",

We target essay-style information needs of social science researchers, i.e. \"How has the UK's Open Banking Regulation benefited Challenger Banks\". CODEC includes 42 topics developed by researchers and a new focused web corpus with semantic annotations including entity links. This resource includes expert judgments on 17,509 documents and entities (416.9 per topic) from diverse automatic and interactive manual runs. The manual runs include 387 query reformulations, providing data for query performance prediction and automatic rewriting evaluation. CODEC includes analysis of state-of-the-art systems, including dense retrieval and neural re-ranking. The results show the topics are challenging with headroom for document and entity ranking improvement. Query expansion with entity information shows significant gains on document ranking, demonstrating the resource's value for evaluating and improving entity-oriented search. We also show that the manual query reformulations significantly improve document ranking and entity ranking performance. Overall, CODEC provides challenging research topics to support the development and evaluation of entity-centric search methods.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the possibility of cross-lingual transfer from a state-of-the-art (SoTA) deep monolingual model (Di-aloGPT) to 6 African languages and compare with 2 baselines (BlenderBot 90M, another SoTA, and a simple Seq2Seq). The languages are Swahili, Wolof, Hausa, Nigerian Pidgin English, Kinyarwanda & Yor\u00f9b\u00e1. Generation of dialogues is known to be a challenging task for many reasons. It becomes more challenging for African languages which are low-resource in terms of data. Therefore, we translate a small portion of the English multi-domain MultiWOZ dataset for each target language. Besides intrinsic evaluation (i.e. perplexity), we conduct human evaluation of single-turn conversations by using majority votes and measure inter-annotator agreement (IAA). The results show that the hypothesis that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that generalise across languages holds. We observe human-like conversations in 5 out of the 6 languages. It, however, applies to different degrees in different languages, which is expected. The language with the most transferable properties is the Nigerian Pidgin English, with a human-likeness score of 78.1%, of which 34.4% are unanimous.

            "abstract": "Conversational information seeking (CIS) involves interaction sequences between one or more users and an information system. Interactions in CIS are primarily based on natural language dialogue, while they may include other types of interactions, such as click, touch, and body gestures. CIS recently attracted significant attention and advancements continue to be made. This tutorial follows the content of the recent Conversational Information Seeking book authored by several of the tutorial presenters. The tutorial aims to be an introduction to CIS for newcomers to CIS in addition to the recent advanced topics and state-of-the-art approaches for students and researchers with moderate knowledge of the topic. A significant part of the tutorial is dedicated to hands-on experiences based on toolkits developed by the presenters for conversational passage retrieval and multi-modal task-oriented dialogues. The outcomes of this tutorial include theoretical and practical knowledge, including a forum to meet researchers interested in CIS.",

            "abstract": "We present GRILLBot, an open-source multi-modal task-oriented voice assistant to help users perform complex tasks, focusing on the domains of cooking and home improvement. GRILLBot curates and leverages web information extraction to build coverage over a broad range of tasks for which a user can receive guidance. To represent each task, we propose TaskGraphs as a dynamic graph unifying steps, requirements, and curated domain knowledge enabling contextual question answering, and detailed explanations. Multi-modal elements play a key role in GRILLBot both helping the user navigate through the task and enriching the experience with helpful videos and images that are automatically linked throughout the task. We leverage a contextual neural semantic parser to enable flexible navigation when interacting with the system by jointly encoding stateful information with the conversation history. GRILLBot enables dynamic and adaptable task planning and assistance for complex tasks by combining elements of task representations that incorporate text and structure, combined with neural models for search, question answering, and dialogue state management. GRILLBot competed in the Alexa prize TaskBot Challenge as one of the finalists.",

What do we need to do to get there? Furthermore, who stands to benefit? The workshop was hands-on and interactive. Rather than a series of technical talks, we solicited position statements on opportunities, problems, and solutions in conversational search in all modalities (written, spoken, or multimodal). This paper -co-authored by the organisers and participants of the workshop- summarises the submitted statements and the discussions we had during the two sessions of the workshop.

Our submission consists of summaries generated by (i) an abstractive model based on fine-tuning T5 on the Spotify Podcasts Dataset, (ii) an ensemble model where the first 15 sentences from the podcast transcript are extracted and passed as input to a fine-tuned T5 model, and (iii) another ensemble model where we use a SpanBERT and K-Means pipeline to extract the 15 most important sentences from the podcast transcript and pass them as input to a fine-tuned T5 model. Official results demonstrate that out of 179 evaluated summaries, our best performing model (ii) generated 42 good-quality summaries - on par with the average across all other submissions. This provides evidence that focusing on the first part of the podcast episode is a strong baseline for podcast summarization.",
