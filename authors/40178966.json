            "abstract": "ABSTRACT With the aim of guaranteeing the interests and health of tourists, this study comprehensively evaluates the suitability of the environment in different cities in China for tourism by considering the impacts of climate, vegetation and environmental factors on health. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), total precipitation (PREC), Vegetation Leaf Area Index (LAI), concentration of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5), and the downward UV radiation at the surface (UVB) are used as indices. In addition, the Delphi\u2013AHP\u2013TOPSIS algorithm is introduced and is used for the comprehensive evaluation of the environmental suitability of 684 cities in China for tourism in 2019. It is found that Chinese cities vary greatly in terms of the suitability of their environments for tourism. Among the factors that affect the environmental suitability, the LAI is important, with an increase in the LAI generally being advantageous. In contrast, an increase in the PM2.5 concentration is a key factor that limits the environmental suitability of an area. Thus, urban landscaping and control of the atmospheric quality are essential and effective ways of improving the suitability of the environment of cities in China for tourists.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an optophone which aims to make the sight-disabled people have the same reading view as normal people. The complete set of equipment includes a Raspberry Pi, a camera and an Android App. We connected the CSI camera to the raspberry PI interface to complete the image acquisition of physical paper reading materials and connected the playback device to the Raspberry Pi audio interface to provide users with reading services. The Android app communicates with the Raspberry Pi to control the Raspberry Pi\u2019s actions, including recognizing images to generate text, selecting the appropriate reading file, and choosing to play or pause of file reading. Unlike such devices developed in the past, the service is made easier by the fact that visually impaired people can operate this optophone directly from their phones. The technical overview of each subsystem of the optophone is presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Efficient and flexible information matching over wireless networks has become increasingly important and challenging with the popularity of smart devices and the growth of social-network-based applications. Some existing approaches designed for wired networks are not applicable to wireless networks, due to their overwhelming control overheads. In this paper, we propose a reliable and scalable binary range vector summary tree (BRVST) infrastructure for flexible information expression support, effective content matching and timely information dissemination over the dynamic wireless network. A novel attribute range vector structure has been introduced for efficient and accurate content representation and a summary tree structure to facilitate information aggregation. For robust and scalable operations over dynamic wireless network, the proposed overlay system exploits a virtual hierarchical geographic management framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that BRVST has a significantly faster event matching speed, while incurs very low storage and traffic overhead, as compared with peer schemes tested.",

            "abstract": "Space-frequency coding is an attractive approach to exploit the space and frequency diversity provided by an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based frequency-selective multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. Due to the prohibitive complexity of acquiring knowledge of the fading coefficients, noncoherent space- frequency coding (NSFC) which dose not need the knowledge of channel is proposed and the design criteria is presented. However, the existing NSFCs adopt the scheme that one block occupies all the subcarriers of the OFDM system, and this large code size increases the coding and decoding complexity exponentially. In this paper, we address a new view of the transmission of space-frequency codes which transforms the transmission in frequency selective channels into flat fading channels. Then, a sub-block noncoherent space-frequency coding is proposed which divides the space-frequency plane into small sub-blocks and each one constitutes a space-frequency codeword. This reduces the code size and the coding-decoding complexity. By a modified signal model, an asymptotic analysis of the pairwise error probability (PEP) is derived and thus the design criteria for full diversity-achieving code is explicitly defined. We also propose a code construct that achieves the promised order of diversity and demonstrate our conclusion by computer simulation.",

            "abstract": "Differential unitary space-frequency modulation reduces the complexity of multiple-input multiple-output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems significantly. But the conventional single symbol differential detection (SSDD) results in a high error floor over a severe multipath spreading channel. To overcome this limitation, a multiple symbol differential stack algorithm is proposed by embedding a recursion of maximum-likelihood metric in the stack algorithm. The proposed algorithm is suitable for arbitrary nondiagonal unitary space-frequency constellations and enhances the flexibility to multipath spread compared with SSDD.",

            "abstract": "In a multiple-antenna broadband system, differential space- frequency modulation (DSFM) MIMO-OFDM in conjunction with noncoherent detection, which avoids channel state information (CSI) estimation, is attractive for time- and frequency- selective channels for its reduced complexity. However, a long power-delay profile (PDP), which we encounter frequently in broadband systems, will deteriorate the performance rapidly. In this paper, a noncoherent sequence detection of DSFM MIMO-OFDM is proposed, which exploits the correlation among subcarriers and utilizes the past several symbols to detect the current one and it can be used to alleviate the performance degradation introduced by long PDPs. We also present an analytical approximation of the symbol-error rate (SER) for DSFM, which enables quick and accurate performance evaluations. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of our approach and it is more flexible than the fixed window multiple-symbols detection under variable numbers of subcarriers.",
