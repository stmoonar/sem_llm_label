            "title": "Towards Multi-Subsession Conversational Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) could acquire dynamic user preferences towards desired items through multi-round interactive dialogue. Previous CRS mainly focuses on the single conversation (subsession) that user quits after a successful recommendation, neglecting the common scenario where user has multiple conversations (multi-subsession) over a short period. Therefore, we propose a novel conversational recommendation scenario named Multi-Subsession Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MSMCR), where user would still resort to CRS after several subsessions and might preserve vague interests, and system would proactively ask attributes to activate user interests in the current subsession. To fill the gap in this new CRS scenario, we devise a novel framework called Multi-Subsession Conversational Recommender with Activation Attributes (MSCAA). Specifically, we first develop a context-aware recommendation module, comprehensively modeling user interests from historical interactions, previous subsessions, and feedback in the current subsession. Furthermore, an attribute selection policy module is proposed to learn a flexible strategy for asking appropriate attributes to elicit user interests. Finally, we design a conversation policy module to manage the above two modules to decide actions between asking and recommending. Extensive experiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of our MSCAA framework for the MSMCR setting.",

            "title": "Multi-Interest Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation System with Fuzzy Feedback based User Simulator",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

            "abstract": "In many classical e-commerce platforms, personalized recommendation has been proven to be of great business value, which can improve user satisfaction and increase the revenue of platforms. In this paper, we present a new recommendation problem, Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR), where users\u2019 instant interest can be explicitly induced with a trigger item and follow-up related target items are recommended accordingly. TIR has become ubiquitous and popular in e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we figure out that although existing recommendation models are effective in traditional recommendation scenarios by mining users\u2019 interests based on their massive historical behaviors, they are struggling in discovering users\u2019 instant interests in the TIR scenario due to the discrepancy between these scenarios, resulting in inferior performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel recommendation method named Deep Interest Highlight Network (DIHN) for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction in TIR scenarios. It has three main components including 1) User Intent Network (UIN), which responds to generate a precise probability score to predict user\u2019s intent on the trigger item; 2) Fusion Embedding Module (FEM), which adaptively fuses trigger item and target item embeddings based on the prediction from UIN; and (3) Hybrid Interest Extracting Module (HIEM), which can effectively highlight users\u2019 instant interest from their behaviors based on the result of FEM. Extensive offline and online evaluations on a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate the superiority of DIHN over state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available 1.",

            "abstract": "Bundle Recommendation (BR) aims at recommending bundled items on online content or e-commerce platform, such as song lists on a music platform or book lists on a reading website. Several graph based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on BR task. But their performance is still sub-optimal, since the data sparsity problem tends to be more severe in real bundle recommendation scenarios, which limits graph-based models from more sufficient learning. In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning paradigm called Counterfactual Learning for Bundle Recommendation (CLBR) to mitigate the impact of data sparsity problem and improve bundle recommendation. Our paradigm consists of two main parts: counterfactual data augmentation and counterfactual constraint. The main idea of our paradigm lies in answering the counterfactual questions:\"What would a user interact with if his/her interaction history changes?\"\"What would a user interact with if the bundle-item affiliation relations change?\"In counterfactual data augmentation, we design a heuristic sampler to generate counterfactual graph views for graph-based models, which has better noise controlling than the stochastic sampler. We further propose counterfactual loss to constrain model learning for mitigating the effects of residual noise in augmented data and achieving more sufficient model optimization. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates the rationality of our design. Extensive experiments of BR models applied with our paradigm on two real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the paradigm.",

            "title": "SAR-Net: A Scenario-Aware Ranking Network for Personalized Fair Recommendation in Hundreds of Travel Scenarios",
            "abstract": "The travel marketing platform of Alibaba serves an indispensable role for hundreds of different travel scenarios from Fliggy, Taobao, Alipay apps, etc. To provide personalized recommendation service for users visiting different scenarios, there are two critical issues to be carefully addressed. First, since the traffic characteristics of different scenarios, e.g., individual data scale or representative topic, are significantly different, it is very challenging to train a unified model to serve all. Second, during the promotion period, the exposure of some specific items will be re-weighted due to manual intervention, resulting in biased logs, which will degrade the ranking model trained using these biased data. In this paper, we propose a novel Scenario-Aware Ranking Network (SAR-Net) to address these issues. SAR-Net harvests the abundant data from different scenarios by learning users' cross-scenario interests via two specific attention modules, which leverage the scenario features and item features to modulate the user behavior features, respectively. Then, taking the encoded features of previous module as input, a scenario-specific linear transformation layer is adopted to further extract scenario-specific features, followed by two groups of debias expert networks, i.e., scenario-specific experts and scenario-shared experts. They output intermediate results independently, which are further fused into the final result by a multi-scenario gating module. In addition, to mitigate the data fairness issue caused by manual intervention, we propose the concept of Fairness Coefficient (FC) to measures the importance of individual sample and use it to reweigh the prediction in the debias expert networks. Experiments on an offline dataset covering over 80 million users and 1.55 million travel items and an online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of our SAR-Net and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. SAR-Net has also been deployed in the online travel marketing platform of Alibaba and is serving hundreds of travel scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a challenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works rely on item transition patterns, and neglect user historical sessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized recommendation. And existing personalized session-based recommenders are limited to sessions of the current user, and ignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical sessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global Graph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all sessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the current and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions over all sessions from users, our global graph contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global co-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions comprehensively, we propose a graph augmented preference encoder to learn the session representation. Specifically, we design a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on heterogeneous global graph to learn long-term user preference and item representations with rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Personalized Session Encoder to combine the general user preference and temporal interest of the current session to generate the personalized session representation for recommendation. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the next interaction of a short-term sequence is a challenging task in session-based recommendation (SBR).Multi-behavior session recommendation considers session sequence with multiple interaction types, such as click and purchase, to capture more effective user intention representation sufficiently.Despite the superior performance of existing multi-behavior based methods for SBR, there are still several severe limitations:(i) Almost all existing works concentrate on single target type of next behavior and fail to model multiplex behavior sessions uniformly.(ii) Previous methods also ignore the semantic relations between various next behavior and historical behavior sequence, which are significant signals to obtain current latent intention for SBR.(iii) The global cross-session item-item graph established by some existing models may incorporate semantics and context level noise for multi-behavior session-based recommendation. To overcome the limitations (i) and (ii), we propose two novel tasks for SBR, which require the incorporation of both historical behaviors and next behaviors into unified multi-behavior recommendation modeling. To this end, we design a Multi-behavior Graph Contextual Aware Network (MGCNet) for multi-behavior session-based recommendation for the two proposed tasks. Specifically, we build a multi-behavior global item transition graph based on all sessions involving all interaction types. Based on the global graph, MGCNet attaches the global interest representation to final item representation based on local contextual intention to address the limitation (iii). In the end, we utilize the next behavior information explicitly to guide the learning of general interest and current intention for SBR. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show that MGCNet can outperform state-of-the-art models for multi-behavior session-based recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging task, which aims at recommending next items based on anonymous interaction sequences. Despite the superior performance of existing methods for SBR, there are still several limitations: (i) Almost all existing works concentrate on single interest extraction and fail to disentangle multiple interests of user, which easily results in suboptimal representations for SBR. (ii) Furthermore, previous methods also ignore the multi-form temporal information, which is significant signal to obtain current intention for SBR. To address the limitations mentioned above, we propose a novel method, called \\emph{Temporal aware Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network} (TMI-GNN) to disentangle multi-interest and yield refined intention representations with the injection of two level temporal information. Specifically, by appending multiple interest nodes, we construct a multi-interest graph for current session, and adopt the GNNs to model the item-item relation to capture adjacent item transitions, item-interest relation to disentangle the multi-interests, and interest-item relation to refine the item representation. Meanwhile, we incorporate item-level time interval signals to guide the item information propagation, and interest-level time distribution information to assist the scattering of interest information. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TMI-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods consistently.",

            "title": "Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Social Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Social recommendation based on social network has achieved great success in improving the performance of the recommendation system. Since social network (user-user relations) and user-item interactions are both naturally represented as graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have thus been widely applied for social recommendation. Despite the superior performance of existing GNNs-based methods, there are still several severe limitations: (i) Few existing GNNs-based methods have considered a single heterogeneous global graph which takes into account user-user relations, user-item interactions, and item-item similarities simultaneously. That may lead to a lack of complex semantic information and rich topological information when encoding users and items based on GNN. (ii) Furthermore, previous methods tend to overlook the reliability of the original user-user relations which may be noisy and incomplete. (iii) More importantly, the item-item connections established by a few existing methods merely using initial rating attributes or extra attributes (such as category) of items, may be inaccurate or sub-optimal with respect to social recommendation. In order to address these issues, we propose an end-to-end heterogeneous global graph learning framework, namely Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GL-HGNN) for social recommendation. GL-HGNN aims to learn a heterogeneous global graph that makes full use of user-user relations, user-item interactions and item-item similarities in a unified perspective. To this end, we design a Graph Learner (GL) method to learn and optimize user-user and item-item connections separately. Moreover, we employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to capture the high-order complex semantic relations from our learned heterogeneous global graph. To scale up the computation of graph learning, we further present the Anchor-based Graph Learner (AGL) to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",
