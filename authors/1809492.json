            "abstract": "This article addresses the dynamic task allocation problem with limited communication and velocity. The main challenge lie in the selection of $k$ fittest winner participants and the participant contention that one winner participant may be selected by multiple targets simultaneously. Existing methods take the distance between the targets and participants as the evaluation index to select winners, which may lead to futile selection since the winner participant locating at the opposite direction of the target cannot intercept the target with limited velocity. By carefully considering both the distance between the targets and participants and the motion direction of the targets, an improved evaluation index for each target is proposed and employed such that the futile selection can be avoided in the executing process of the algorithm. Moreover, an extra evaluation index for each winner participant is presented to select one winner target to overcome the participant contention. Based on these, the control protocols are developed for targets interception, and their stability is proven by the Lyapunov theory under some suitable conditions. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms.",

            "abstract": "User-generated textual contents on the Internet are often noisy, erroneous, and not in correct grammar. In fact, some online users choose to express their opinions online through carefully perturbed texts, especially in controversial topics (e.g., politics, vaccine mandate) or abusive contexts (e.g., cyberbullying, hate-speech). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no framework that explores these online \"human-written\" perturbations (as opposed to algorithm-generated perturbations). Therefore, we introduce an interactive system called CrypText. CrypText is a data-intensive application that provides the users with a database and several tools to extract and interact with human-written perturbations. Specifically, CrypText helps look up, perturb, and normalize (i.e., de-perturb) texts. CrypText also provides an interactive interface to monitor and analyze text perturbations online.

            "abstract": "In this work, we describe our efforts in addressing two typical challenges involved in the popular text classification methods when they are applied to text moderation: the representation of multibyte characters and word obfuscations. Specifically, a multihot byte-level scheme is developed to significantly reduce the dimension of one-hot character-level encoding caused by the multiplicity of instance-scarce non-ASCII characters. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective weighting approach for fusing n-gram features to empower the classical logistic regression. Surprisingly, it outperforms well-tuned representative neural networks greatly. As a continual effort toward text moderation, we endeavor to analyze the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), which works well in context understanding but performs poorly on intentional word obfuscations. To resolve this crux, we then develop an enhanced variant and remedy this drawback by integrating byte and character decomposition. It advances the SOTA performance on the largest abusive language datasets as demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments. Our work offers a feasible and effective framework to tackle word obfuscations.",

            "abstract": "Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for low-resource languages is an attractive research issue in academia and industry nowadays. Mongolian is the official language of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and a representative low-resource language spoken by over 10 million people worldwide. However, there is a relative lack of open-source datasets for Mongolian TTS. Therefore, we make public an open-source multi-speaker Mongolian TTS dataset, named MnTTS2, for the benefit of related researchers. In this work, we prepare the transcription from various topics and invite three professional Mongolian announcers to form a three-speaker TTS dataset, in which each announcer records 10 hours of speeches in Mongolian, resulting 30 hours in total. Furthermore, we build the baseline system based on the state-of-the-art FastSpeech2 model and HiFi-GAN vocoder. The experimental results suggest that the constructed MnTTS2 dataset is sufficient to build robust multi-speaker TTS models for real-world applications. The MnTTS2 dataset, training recipe, and pretrained models are released at: \\url{https://github.com/ssmlkl/MnTTS2}",

            "abstract": "We proposes a novel algorithm, ANTHRO, that inductively extracts over 600K human-written text perturbations in the wild and leverages them for realistic adversarial attack. Unlike existing character-based attacks which often deductively hypothesize a set of manipulation strategies, our work is grounded on actual observations from real-world texts. We find that adversarial texts generated by ANTHRO achieve the best trade-off between (1) attack success rate, (2) semantic preservation of the original text, and (3) stealthiness\u2013i.e. indistinguishable from human writings hence harder to be flagged as suspicious. Specifically, our attacks accomplished around 83% and 91% attack success rates on BERT and RoBERTa, respectively. Moreover, it outperformed the TextBugger baseline with an increase of 50% and 40% in terms of semantic preservation and stealthiness when evaluated by both layperson and professional human workers. ANTHRO can further enhance a BERT classifier\u2019s performance in understanding different variations of human-written toxic texts via adversarial training when compared to the Perspective API.",

            "abstract": "While a multitude of studies have been conducted on graph drawing, many existing methods only focus on optimizing a single aesthetic aspect of graph layouts, which can lead to sub-optimal results. There are a few existing methods that have attempted to develop a flexible solution for optimizing different aesthetic aspects measured by different aesthetic criteria. Furthermore, thanks to the significant advance in deep learning techniques, several deep learning-based layout methods were proposed recently. These methods have demonstrated the advantages of deep learning approaches for graph drawing. However, none of these existing methods can be directly applied to optimizing non-differentiable criteria without special accommodation. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning framework for graph drawing, called SmartGD, which can optimize different quantitative aesthetic goals, regardless of their differentiability. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartGD, we conducted experiments on minimizing stress, minimizing edge crossing, maximizing crossing angle, maximizing shape-based metrics, and a combination of multiple aesthetics. Compared with several popular graph drawing algorithms, the experimental results show that SmartGD achieves good performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

            "abstract": "Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have timing constraints that must be met by the cyber components (software and the network) to ensure safety. It is a tedious job to check if a CPS meets its timing requirement especially when it is distributed and the software and/or the underlying computing platforms are complex. Furthermore, the system design is brittle since a timing failure can still happen (e.g., network failure, soft error bit flip). In this article, we propose a new design methodology called Plan B where timing constraints of the CPS are monitored at runtime, and a proper backup routine is executed when a timing failure happens to ensure safety. We provide a model on how to express the desired timing behavior using a set of timing constructs in a C/C++ code and how to efficiently monitor them at the runtime. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on three case studies: (1) the full software stack for autonomous driving (Apollo), (2) a multi-agent system with 1/10th-scale model robots, and (3) a quadrotor for search and rescue application. We show that the system remains safe and stable even when intentional faults are injected to cause a timing failure. We also demonstrate that the system can achieve graceful degradation when a less extreme timing failure happens.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a high-quality open-source text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis dataset for Mongolian, a low-resource language spoken by over 10 million people worldwide. The dataset, named MnTTS, consists of about 8 hours of transcribed audio recordings spoken by a 22-year-old professional female Mongolian announcer. It is the first publicly available dataset developed to promote Mongolian TTS applications in both academia and industry. In this paper, we share our experience by describing the dataset development procedures and faced challenges. To demonstrate the reliability of our dataset, we built a powerful non-autoregressive baseline system based on FastSpeech2 model and HiFi-GAN vocoder, and evaluated it using the subjective mean opinion score (MOS) and real time factor (RTF) metrics. Evaluation results show that the powerful baseline system trained on our dataset achieves MOS above 4 and RTF about 3.30\u00d710\u22121, which makes it applicable for practical use. The dataset, training recipe, and pretrained TTS models are freely available11https://github.com/walker-hyf/MnTTS.",

            "abstract": "Impedance matching networks using discrete components are generally connected on the PCB through microstrip transmission lines. Affected by the impedance discontinuity and distribution parameters of the transmission line, the impedance matching network simply designed according to the input and output impedance of the device cannot accurately match the port impedance to the target impedance. Therefore, this paper introduces a method for designing and optimizing impedance matching circuits using ADS and SIwave. The microstrip line at the input and output of RF device is modeled by SIwave, and the S parameter is extracted. Then the ADS software is used to connect the S-parameter model of the device, the S-parameter model of the microstrip line, and the actual parameter model of the inductor and capacitor to carry out impedance matching design. The simulation results show that the method can optimize the return loss of the port to meet the design requirements.",
