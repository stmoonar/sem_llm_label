            "title": "Item-side Fairness of Large Language Model-based Recommendation System",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems for Web content distribution intricately connect to the information access and exposure opportunities for vulnerable populations. The emergence of Large Language Models-based Recommendation System (LRS) may introduce additional societal challenges to recommendation systems due to the inherent biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). From the perspective of item-side fairness, there remains a lack of comprehensive investigation into the item-side fairness of LRS given the unique characteristics of LRS compared to conventional recommendation systems. To bridge this gap, this study examines the property of LRS with respect to item-side fairness and reveals the influencing factors of both historical users' interactions and inherent semantic biases of LLMs, shedding light on the need to extend conventional item-side fairness methods for LRS. Towards this goal, we develop a concise and effective framework called IFairLRS to enhance the item-side fairness of an LRS. IFairLRS covers the main stages of building an LRS with specifically adapted strategies to calibrate the recommendations of LRS. We utilize IFairLRS to fine-tune LLaMA, a representative LLM, on MovieLens and Steam datasets, and observe significant item-side fairness improvements.

            "title": "LightMIRM: Light Meta-learned Invariant Risk Minimization for Trustworthy Loan Default Prediction",
            "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly applied to loan default prediction to reduce the labor cost of financial institutions and the waiting time of lenders. We find that existing loan default prediction models remain lack minimax fairness, i.e., encountering significant performance drops on underrepresented subpopulations. The main cause of this trustworthy issue is pursuing Empirical Risk Minimization over the whole population, which will overlook the underrepresented subpopulations. To tackle this issue, we split the training data into subpopulations (a.k.a. environments) and conduct Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) to learn the optimal prediction model across environments. A technical challenge is the computation cost of directly using existing IRM methods suitable for loan default prediction, such as meta-IRM, which quadratically increases as the number of environments. To reduce the complexity in training, we propose a light meta-IRM method which reduces time complexity to be linear through environment sampling and loss replaying strategies. We apply the light meta-IRM to train a representative loan default prediction model and conduct both online and offline evaluations on a large auto loan platform. Extensive experiment results validate the advantage of the proposed light meta-IRM w.r.t. the overall accuracy, minimax fairness, and training cost.",
