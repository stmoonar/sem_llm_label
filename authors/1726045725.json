            "abstract": "Database interaction is often characterized as a non-trivial and time-consuming process due to user\u2019s inexperience with the data or the query language. Therefore, there is a need for the databases to be able to \"talk back\" in order to assist the users during data exploration and eventually lead them to the desired results. In this paper, we tackle the problem of SQL-to-NL by extending the graph-based model of Logos [3]. Our novel extensions include improvements in terms of the system\u2019s translation capabilities and the fluency of the generated explanations. Finally, we report several challenges, highlighted by experiments on different user cases, i.e, astronomy and policy making.",

            "abstract": "Text-to-SQL systems allow users to explore relational databases by posing free-form queries, alleviating the need for using structured languages, such as SQL. Although numerous systems have been developed so far, existing system evaluations lack in rigour. In this work, we build a text-to-SQL benchmark that covers different classes of queries, and we evaluate the effectiveness of several systems in the field. To evaluate system efficiency, we measure execution time and resource consumption for the different query classes. Our comprehensive evaluation aims at filling in a big gap in understanding the capabilities and boundaries of existing systems and it reveals several open challenges.",

            "abstract": "A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.",
