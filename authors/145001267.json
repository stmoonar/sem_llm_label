            "abstract": "We motivate and introduce CHARD: Clinical Health-Aware Reasoning across Dimensions, to investigate the capability of text generation models to act as implicit clinical knowledge bases and generate free-flow textual explanations about various health-related conditions across several dimensions. We collect and present an associated dataset, CHARDat, consisting of explanations about 52 health conditions across three clinical dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments using BART and T5 along with data augmentation, and perform automatic, human, and qualitative analyses. We show that while our models can perform decently, CHARD is very challenging with strong potential for further exploration.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale sequence-to-sequence models have shown to be adept at both multiple-choice and open-domain commonsense reasoning tasks. However, the current systems do not provide the ability to control the various attributes of the reasoning chain. To enable better controllability, we propose to study the commonsense reasoning as a template filling task (TemplateCSR) -- where the language models fills reasoning templates with the given constraints as control factors. As an approach to TemplateCSR, we (i) propose a dataset of commonsense reasoning template-expansion pairs and (ii) introduce POTTER, a pretrained sequence-to-sequence model using prompts to perform commonsense reasoning across concepts. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines both in generation metrics and factuality metrics. We also present a detailed error analysis on our approach's ability to reliably perform commonsense reasoning.",

In this paper, we develop an algorithm to improve object recognition by integrating human-generated contextual information with vision algorithms. Specifically, we examine how interactive systems such as robots can utilize two types of context information--verbal descriptions of an environment and human-labeled datasets. We propose a re-ranking schema, MultiRank, for object recognition that can efficiently combine such information with the computer vision results. In our experiments, we achieve up to 9.4% and 16.6% accuracy improvements using the oracle and the detected bounding boxes, respectively, over the vision-only recognizers. We conclude that our algorithm has the ability to make a significant impact on object recognition in robotics and beyond.\n \n",

            "abstract": "The recent explosion of publicly available biomedical information gave drug discovery researchers unprecedented access to a wide variety of online repositories, but the sheer volume of the available data diminishes its utility. This is compounded by the fact that these repositories suffer from a silo effect: data from one cannot be easily linked to data in another. This is true for both publicly available sources and internal sources such as project reports. The ability to explore all aspects of biological data and to link data across sources is beneficial, as it allows researchers to discover new knowledge and to identify new collaboration opportunities by exploiting links. This paper presents an approach to solving this problem and an application that allows researchers to browse and analyze disparate bio-medical repositories as one semantically integrated knowledge space.",

            "abstract": "Spoken language interfaces are being incorporated into various devices such as smart phones and TVs. However, dialogue systems may fail to respond correctly when users' request functionality is not supported by currently installed apps. This paper proposes a feature-enriched matrix factorization (MF) approach to model open domain intents, which allows a system to dynamically add unexplored domains according to users' requests. First we leverage the structured knowledge from Wikipedia and Freebase to automatically acquire domain-related semantics to enrich features of input utterances, and then MF is applied to model automatically acquired knowledge, published app textual descriptions and users' spoken requests in a joint fashion; this generates latent feature vectors for utterances and user intents without need of prior annotations. Experiments show that the proposed MF models incorporated with rich features significantly improve intent prediction, achieving about 34% of mean average precision (MAP) for both ASR and manual transcripts.",

            "abstract": "Robotic commands in natural language usually contain lots of spatial descriptions which are semantically similar but syntactically different. Mapping such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.",
