            "title": "YOLO-Based Semantic Communication With Generative AI-Aided Resource Allocation for Digital Twins Construction",
            "abstract": "Digital Twins play a crucial role in bridging the physical and virtual worlds. Given the dynamic and evolving characteristics of the physical world, a huge volume of data transmission and exchange is necessary to attain synchronized updates in the virtual world. In this article, we propose a semantic communication framework based on you only look once (YOLO) to construct a virtual apple orchard with the aim of mitigating the costs associated with data transmission. Specifically, we first employ the YOLOv7-X object detector to extract semantic information from captured images of edge devices, thereby reducing the volume of transmitted data and saving transmission costs. Afterwards, we quantify the importance of each semantic information by the confidence generated through the object detector. Based on this, we propose two resource allocation schemes, i.e., the confidence-based scheme and the acrlong AI-generated scheme, aimed at enhancing the transmission quality of important semantic information. The proposed diffusion model generates an optimal allocation scheme that outperforms both the average allocation scheme and the confidence-based allocation scheme. Moreover, to obtain semantic information more effectively, we enhance the detection capability of the YOLOv7-X object detector by introducing new efficient layer aggregation network-horNet (ELAN-H) and SimAM attention modules, while reducing the model parameters and computational complexity, making it easier to run on edge devices with limited performance. The numerical results indicate that our proposed semantic communication framework and resource allocation schemes significantly reduce transmission costs while enhancing the transmission quality of important information in communication services.",

            "title": "Prophet: Prompting Large Language Models with Complementary Answer Heuristics for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering",
            "abstract": "Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires external knowledge beyond the image to answer the question. Early studies retrieve required knowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs), which often introduces irrelevant information to the question, hence restricting the performance of their models. Recent works have resorted to using a powerful large language model (LLM) as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire the necessary knowledge for answering. Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, we argue that they have not fully activated the capacity of the blind LLM as the provided textual input is insufficient to depict the required visual information to answer the question. In this paper, we present Prophet -- a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework designed to prompt LLM with answer heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, we first train a vanilla VQA model on a specific knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. After that, we extract two types of complementary answer heuristics from the VQA model: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. Finally, the two types of answer heuristics are jointly encoded into a formatted prompt to facilitate the LLM's understanding of both the image and question, thus generating a more accurate answer. By incorporating the state-of-the-art LLM GPT-3, Prophet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on four challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we instantiate Prophet with the combinations of different VQA models (i.e., both discriminative and generative ones) and different LLMs (i.e., both commercial and open-source ones).",

            "abstract": "Media convergence has emerged as a new type of media industry. It is the in\u2010depth combination of the traditional media and the social media in multiple aspects, such as content generation, program production, and information flow. From another perspective, it can be viewed as a fundamental promotion of the traditional media industry by fully embracing the new media industry. For a typical media convergence scenario, subscribers can play the role of program producer, and various content can be therefore generated and collected in the cloud platform, which makes' the efficient and secure management of the massive multimedia data more challenging. Therefore, there are many opening issues in designing intelligent information processing techniques for high\u2010quality media convergence service. For example, how to make the live TV show more secure when there are a large number of people uploading videos and photos as the user interaction. In this special issue, we have received 15 submissions from a variety of regions. The submissions widely cover the topics that are closely related to the special issue, such as block chain techniques, media recommendation systems, and multimedia content analysis. For each submission, we have assigned at least two professional reviewers. After a strict reviewing process, we have decided to accept eleven research papers, which can be divided into the following two groups.",
