            "title": "A Comparative Study on Urban Micro-Cell Channel Measurements at 4.9 and 28 GHz",
            "abstract": "With the development of the 5G communication system, research on propagation characteristics of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) band has aroused significant attention. In particular, it is imperative to understand the similarities between the instantaneous channel characteristics of mm-wave band and sub-6 GHz band, which can be leveraged to facilitate beamforming and user scheduling. Towards this end, this paper presents a channel measurement campaign at both 4.9 GHz and 28 GHz in an urban micro-cell scenario using a virtual antenna array and conducts a detailed comparative study on the channel statistics. The measurement includes line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation environments. Parameter extraction and analysis including power delay profiles (PDPs), path loss (PL), root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS), and azimuth of arrival (AOA) shows that the 28 GHz channel has similar statistics compared to 4.9 GHz, while the 28 GHz band exhibits much fewer multipath components (MPCs). These results show that it is possible to leverage low-band channel estimations to facilitate the high-band, or vice versa.",

            "abstract": "Due to the advantages of beamforming technology in multi-antenna wireless communication systems, it has been widely studied and applied. However, its effectiveness in high-mobility scenarios may significantly deteriorate due to severe channel aging. In this paper, we propose an improved L\u00e9vy induced stochastic differential equation network (LDE-Net) based on the Euler-Maruyama method for channel prediction. The proposed scheme captures the stochastic and rapid changes of wireless channels, by dividing the neural network into fine-grained stages while maintaining a moderate model size by parameter sharing among stages. In order to verify its performance in practice, we conduct channel measurements in Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios on our campus, respectively. In both scenarios, LDE-Net performs better than the conventional and widely-used autoregressive model, long short term memory, and recurrent reural network schemes. In the LoS scenario, its throughput is 19.615% on average higher than all other schemes at various speeds, and 10.64% for NLoS.",

            "title": "Can Channel Knowledge Map Help to Predict Instantaneous MIMO Channel State Information?",
            "abstract": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial for optimizing system performance in wireless communications. One of the current research directions is to extract the CSI from the channel knowledge map (CKM) based on users' location. While such an approach is promising for large-scale CSI acquisition, e.g., pathloss, it is still questionable whether CKM can help to predict instantaneous CSI which is very sensitive to positioning error and scattering environment changes. To answer this question, this paper proposes a channel prediction scheme that combines the CKM with historical user CSI to improve the beamforming performance in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, it utilizes the complex amplitude information of multi-path components (MPCs) and employs a low-complexity method to predict the future MIMO CSI. Through experiments based on real-world channel data, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art ones that use the CKM alone or autoregressive schemes without CKM. In the non-line-of-sight scenarios, when the positioning error exceeds 0.525 m, small-scale CSI in CKM provides little gain. In line-of-sight environments, the threshold for the usability of small-scale CSI in terms of positioning error is approximately 0.725 m or slightly higher. When the positioning error is less than 0.225 m, the CKM is beneficial to predict instantaneous CSI in both scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Beamforming for multi-antenna wireless communication systems has been widely studied and applied in practice. However, its performance in high mobility scenarios deteriorates dramatically due to severe channel aging. This issue stimulates the research of channel prediction in high mobility scenarios. This paper studies the general high-mobility Doppler domain wireless channel characterization and reveals that: 1) the Doppler frequency of the cluster corresponding to the near scatterers varies approximately linearly over short periods; 2) the linear-fitting characteristics of autoregressive model leads to poor channel prediction performance; 3) the parameter estimation algorithms of the chirp model which encompasses the characteristics are particularly complex. Given the shortcomings of existing works, this paper adopts the short-time Fourier transform to pre-estimate the parameter range and leverages the polynomial Fourier transform to obtain the initial values of the parameters. The downhill simplex algorithm is used to search for the fine-grained values of the parameters. In addition, the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is utilized to reconstruct the sparse signal. Evaluation results under the COST2100 channel model and a channel measurement campaign indicate that the proposed scheme can enhance the channel prediction accuracy or reduce the computing overhead compared to the existing matrix completion and polynomial iteration method.",

            "abstract": "Utilizing high-frequency bands and massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology has become a major trend in wireless communications. One of the fundamental challenge is to understand the propagation characteristics of such channels. In this paper, we present a channel sounding methodology at 14 GHz with massive MIMO. The measurements are recorded at more than 50 locations including Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios. A $16\\times 4$ Uniform Panel Array (UPA) and a quadruple of 4 $\\times 4$ UPAs forming a square are both used for measuring the channel statistics. Then the small scale characteristics of an outdoor campus scenario are analyzed, including Root-Mean-Square (RMS) delay spread, cluster analysis and angle estimation. The results of RMS delay spread and angle spread measured by different antenna arrays show distinctive results in NLoS case. Specifically, the RMS delay spread and angle spread values are measured larger by the quadruple antenna arrays, wherein the RMS delay spread values are 12 ns and 15 ns respectively, and the angle spread values are 8.613\u00b0 and 169.0601\u00b0, respectively. It is reasonable that the multipath information is richer when the quadruple array is receiving signals from all directions.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, with the development of wireless communication systems, high-frequency bands are utilized together with low-frequency bands to provide better system throughput. However, systems based on high-frequency bands suffer from coverage problems significantly. In this paper, we consider utilizing the sounding signals from two frequency bands to improve the channel estimation accuracy of both bands, and therefore enhance the coverage. An algorithm based on Distributed Compressed Sensing (DCS) is proposed, combining with Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP) technology. We verify the algorithm performance by simulations and real-world channel measurements, which show that the proposed method can improve the channel estimation accuracy of two frequency bands with the same pilot cost, compared with the system wherein the channels are estimated independently for each band.",

            "abstract": "Channel measurement is the most direct and accurate method to analyze the characteristics of wireless channel. In this paper, four channel measurements with different transmitter antenna (Tx) heights of 2 m, 3 m, 5.5 m and 8 m were conducted in an urban micro-cell (UMi) scenario at 3.7 GHz. The measurements include line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. The transmitter of the measuring system consisting of a vector signal transceiver (VST), a high speed switch, a power amplifier (PA) and a planar antenna array (PLA). While the receiver is composed of a VST, a high speed switch, a low noise amplifier (LNA) and a uniform circular antenna array (UCA). Statistical results and comparative analysis are presented, including power delay profiles (PDPs), pathloss (PL), root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS), elevation/azimuth of arrival (EOA/AOA) and corresponding elevation/azimuth RMS spread of arrival (ESA/ASA). The alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model and close-in (CI) free space reference distance model are adopted. We use multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to estimate the EOA /AOA of the channel and analyzed the variation of relevant EAS/ASA. It can be seen from the results that the pathloss exponent decreases with the increasing of the Rx heights. The delay spread, on the contrary, increases as the antenna heights increase. The ASA decreases with the antenna goes higher and ESA has an opposite trend.",
