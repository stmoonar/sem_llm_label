            "abstract": "This study presents the earlier steps in the detection of pirate soccer streams using computer vision. The goal is to provide broadcasters, advertisers, and sports organizations with a powerful tool to protect their intellectual property and revenue. The focus of this study is the Portuguese market, therefore the majority of work relates to the country\u2019s major soccer competitions and TV broadcasters. The study employs a DenseNet201 frame classifier and YOLOv5 object detector models trained with transfer learning using a dataset of manually annotated images extracted from publicly available sources. The study demonstrates that shot classification and broadcaster logo detection are highly effective in identifying visual elements in pirate streams, allowing the detection of unauthorized use of copyrighted content. The results show that the proposed method can be powerful solution for the growing problem of pirate soccer streams, achieving high accuracy in real-time applications, enabling broadcasters to take immediate action to protect their content and revenue.",

            "abstract": "The fifth-generation (5G) of broadband cellular networks is giving rise to new paradigms of distributed computing, such as Edge Computing and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). The possibility of hosting Machine Learning (ML) applications close to the end-users presents advantages, such as better privacy (e.g., sensitive data is not shared to other systems), the reduction of communication latency, improvement of application performance, and more efficient energy consumption. However, the Edge Computing and MEC paradigms also pose challenges to ML. For instance, the data can be distributed among distinct edges and might not be shared (e.g., due to privacy issues). Also, the ML models might be trained on edge devices with limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose a Federated ML architecture to train ML models on the 5G Edge, using decentralized data and light ML training algorithms. Our architecture includes edge nodes to train models with local data and a centralized node to aggregate the resulting models. As a case study, we address an International Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF) task, assuming a real-world dataset collected from a leading provider of analytics solutions for the Telecom industry. We evaluate our architecture during two iterations of a Federated ML procedure and then we compare it with a centralized baseline ML model that is currently adopted by the software company. Overall, the experimental results show that the proposed Federated ML approach outperforms the baseline ML model, thus supporting its potential usage to detect IRSF on the 5G mobile network edge.",

This paper aims to contribute to the identification of potentially relevant nodes in fraud networks. Whilst traditional methods for fraud detection rely on identifying abnormal patterns, this paper proposes STARBRIDGE: a new linear and scalable, ranked out, parameter free method to identify fraudulent nodes and rings based on Bridging, Influence and Control metrics. This is applied to the telecommunications domain where fraudulent nodes form a star-bridge-star pattern. Over 75% of nodes involved in fraud denote control, bridging centrality and doubled the influence scores, when compared to non-fraudulent nodes in the same role, stars and bridges being chief positions.",

We present the architecture and design decisions of TgraphSpot. Thanks to our careful feature-extraction algorithms, it scales linearly, taking 2.5 hours on a stock laptop, to process 29 million phone calls. More importantly, when applied on a real dataset of millions of phone calls, it discovered suspicious nodes; experts confirmed that those nodes are fraudsters that had been undetected so far.",
