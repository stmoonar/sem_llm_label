            "title": "Improving Fine-Grained Image Classification With Multimodal Information",
            "abstract": "Fine-grained image datasets have small inter-class differences and large intra-class differences, which is a difficulty of the fine-grained image classification. Traditional fine-grained image classification methods only focus on the visual features of images. However, this limitation can be eliminated when these methods are improved with multimodal information. This paper proposes an improved fine-grained image classification method with multimodal information that includes multimodal data preprocessing, multimodal feature extraction, multi-temporal feature fusion and decision correction. The preprocessing method proposed solves the problems of scattered distribution, difficult processing and uneven contribution to prediction of multimodal data through normalization, packing phrases and weighted concatenating methods. When extracting multimodal features, the SAMLP (Self-Attention MLP) module proposed combines self-attention with MLP to capture the internal correlation of multimodal information. The multi-temporal feature fusion proposed is divided into early feature fusion and late feature fusion. The former refers to adding multimodal information markers to the original image, and the latter refers to designing a multi-cascade dynamic MLP structure to fuse visual features and multimodal features. In view of the limitation of feature fusion, a decision strategy is proposed to revise the prediction results of fused features according to the prediction results of multimodal features. Ablation experiment on INAT18-1K and INAT21-1K datasets shows that our method is effective in improving classification with multimodal information. Experiments on the INAT2021_mini large dataset show that the comprehensive method in this article has higher accuracy and negligible efficiency loss compared with the state-of-the-art method.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, multi-kernel learning (MKL) methods have been widely used in performing nonlinear data subspace clustering tasks, benefiting from the fact that they do not require the selection and tuning of predefined kernels. However, the effect of raw noise on the data structure in the feature space has been neglected in most MKL studies so far. In this paper, we propose a robust subspace clustering method called purity kernel tensor low-rank learning (KTLL), which effectively isolates noise transfer from the original data space to the high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, we construct the kernel pool obtained by MKL as a primitive third-order kernel tensor, separate the corrupted information in the feature space, and use the separated pure kernel tensor to learn the optimal affinity matrix. The tensor learning of the kernel pool can effectively mine the higher-order correlations among different kernel matrices, thus improving the clustering performance of KTLL.We have conducted extensive experiments to compare KTLL with state-of-the-art MKL and deep subspace clustering algorithms, and our results demonstrate the superiority of KTLL.",

Traditionally off-topic essay detection is based on text features represented as spatial vectors, however, this approach only addresses the structure of essay statements and requires the use of manual features. This paper proposed to use the Sentence-BERT model to detect off-topic essays, the method first obtains a large amount of high-quality data to build a corpus of off-topic essays, and two Siamese twin pre-trained models are used to embed sentences in the essay topic, and the body of the essay, generate semantically rich sentence vectors and then use cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between the topic and the body of the essay after averaging the pooled sentence vectors, and select the optimal threshold to determine off-topic essays through continuous training. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy, recall, and F1 values by 9.5%, 11.2%, and 10.4% respectively over the C-BGRU (Convolutional-Bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit) based Siamese twin network and also has an excellent performance in topics with different degrees of divergence.",

To improve the semantic understanding of the assessment model and improve the generalizability of the article quality assessment system at the same time, an improved cross-topic article features quality assessment method based on CTS (Cross-prompt Trait Scorer) is proposed. In the shared low-level layer part, a new depth-separable convolution with residual structure is used to extract more semantic feature information; in the feature enhancement part, multi-headed attention is added to strengthen the effective features and improve the learning ability of lexicality; finally, a Log-Cosh loss function is used to make the model more robust to outliers and improve the model's QWK (Quadratic Weighted Kappa) evaluation metric of the model. The improved method experimented on the ASAP (Automated Student Assessment Prize) dataset, and the average QWK score reached 0.571 under different topics and 0.566 under different features.

To address these problems, a multi-kernel subspace learning method based on weight truncated Schatten-p norm for image segmentation is designed in this paper. First, the original natural image pre-processing operation, which is conducting adaptive morphological reconstruction watershed transformation on the image, then the original pixels are aggregated to form a superpixel image, of which the obtained superpixel block would retain more comprehensive local information; Secondly, perform feature extraction for each superpixel block, and stack the obtained feature vectors into the desired feature matrix; Then, it is input into the weighted truncated Schatten-p low-rank multi-kernel subspace learning model to obtain a similarity matrix with cluster structure on the diagonal; Finally, the similarity matrix is used as the adjacency matrix in the spectral clustering model, and the final feature data clustering and image segmentation results are obtained by the optimization solution. The final experimental results demonstrate that contrasts to existing clustering models, the proposed method accomplishes the best clustering property on two public datasets; Compared with seven segmentation algorithms on the BSDS500 dataset, and achieved the best segmentation effect on two evaluation metrics.",

            "abstract": "Projecting the original data into a low-dimensional target space for feature extraction is a common method. Recently, presentation-based approaches have been widely concerned and many feature extraction algorithms based on this have been proposed. However, in the process of acquiring real data, the pollution of complex noise cannot always be avoided, which will greatly increase the difficulty of feature extraction and even lead to failed feature extraction results. Thus, a robust image feature extraction model based on Orthogonal Low-Rank Projection Learning (OLRPL) is proposed, in which the introduction of orthogonal matrix can encourage the preservation of the main components of the sample. Particularly, the row sparsity constraint introduced on the projection matrix can encourage the features to be more compact, discriminative and interpretable. In particular, the Weighted Truncated Schatten p-norm (WTSN) is proposed to better solve the optimization problem of low-rank constraints. At the same time, the correntropy is applied in OLRPL to suppress the complex noise in the data and thus improve the robustness of the model. Finally, we specially design a robust classification loss function so that our model can be fitted the supervised scene effectively. Experiments on five general databases have proved that OLRPL has better effectiveness and robustness than existing advanced methods.",

Many pregnancies have an increased risk for complications for a variety of reasons. Fortunately, early prenatal care and regular examination can help women have healthy pregnancies and deliver with fewer complications. However, current research shows that many expectant mothers do not have a clear understanding of the pregnancy process due to the complexity of medical information and inadequate attention from caregivers. Therefore, in this work, we collected data on expectant mothers\u2019 requirements and investigated the various medical treatments during pregnancy and the correlations between possible symptoms and newborn diseases. Based on the above knowledge, we then developed a visual analytic system named PregnancyLine, which presents a pregnancy care plan and information on the medical examinations at each pregnancy stage using a series of vivid visual metaphors. This system is designed to improve communication between pregnant women and doctors and help doctors identify patients with abnormalities and abnormal events. The results of the evaluation and case studies indicate that our system is effective in helping pregnant women understand pregnancy risk and the importance of examinations and that it is very useful in the detection and understanding of abnormalities.",

Our model has three innovations: (1) The introduction of correntropy in the multiple kernel weighting strategy helps to learn the optimal consensus kernel. (2) In order to maintain the low-rank structure of input data, we impose a nuclear norm constraint on the optimal consensus kernel matrix. (3) Considering the block diagonal property of the affinity matrix, MKLRSC applies block diagonal constraint to the coefficient matrix. Compared with several state-of-the-art multiple kernel subspace clustering methods, experiments on three datasets confirm that MKLRSC achieves more competitive clustering results.",

            "title": "Robust Low-Rank Kernel Subspace Clustering based on the Schatten p-norm and Correntropy",
            "abstract": "Subspace clustering plays an important role in the tasks such as data processing and pattern recognition. Since the high-dimensional data may contain complex noise, as well as non-linear structure, learning low-dimensional subspace structures is a challenging task. However, the existing methods to deal with both problems relax the original problem convexly. The results of solving by these methods deviate from the solution of the original problem. In this paper, to overcome this deficiency, we propose a robust low-rank kernel subspace clustering model, which coalesces the non-convex Schatten <italic>p</italic>-norm (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0 < p \\leq 1$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo><</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>\u2264</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zhang-ieq1-2922637.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) regularizer with \u201ckernel trick\u201d and correntropy. Our \u201ckernel trick\u201d extends linear subspace clustering to non-linear counterparts, the Schatten <italic>p</italic>-norm regularizer can approximate the rank of the data in feature space effectively, and the correntropy is a robust measure to large corruptions. Furthermore, an efficient iterative algorithm (HQ-ADMM) is designed to solve the formulated problem, which coalesces the half-quadratic technique and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. This algorithm can ensure the closed form solutions at each iteration, which improves the computation speed of the algorithm. Extensive experiments on face/object clustering and motion segmentation clearly attest the ascendancy of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods.",
