            "abstract": "Given the growing popularity of graphs, data models like Property Graph and corresponding query languages like Cypher, have become popular in industry and research. However, real-time graph data analysis and management are increasingly important for today's businesses. Still, graph query languages lack the features to handle streaming graph data and their continuous query evaluation. % This demonstration showcases Seraph, a Cypher-based language supporting native continuous querying features. Seraph is formally defined, declarative, and backwards compatible with Cypher. This demonstration gives a comprehensive overview of the language with three use cases and a carefully design Web UI, allowing the execution of continuous queries on the property graphs stream.",

            "abstract": "The high expressiveness and elasticity of graphs has led to the design of a wealth of graph models and query languages, used by practitioners to model real-world processes. The property graph model and corresponding query languages, such as the widely used Cypher, have become popular in both industry and research. However, real-time data analysis and management is becoming increasingly important for today\u2019s businesses, but graph query languages lack the features to handle streaming graph data and their continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, a Cypher-based language supporting native streaming features within industry-ready property graph query languages. We formally define the Seraph semantics by combining stream processing with property graphs and time-varying relations while treating time as a first-class citizen of the underlying semantics, thus laying a formal foundation necessary for future implementations. We further propose its syntax and showcase the usage of Seraph for emerging graph-based continuous queries of real-world industrial use cases.",

Efficiently supporting these use cases yields a number of unique requirements, including the need for a concise query language and graph-aware query optimization techniques.

LDBC also conducts research on graph schemas and graph query languages. This paper introduces the LDBC organization and its work over the last decade.",

            "abstract": "The scientific community has been studying graph data models for decades. Their high expressiveness and elasticity led the scientific community to design a variety of graph data models and graph query languages, and the practitioners to use them to model real-world cases and extract useful information. Recently, property graphs and, in particular, Cypher 9 (the first open version of the well-known Neo4j Inc.'s language) are gaining popularity. Practitioners find Cypher useful and applicable in many scenarios. However, we are living in a streaming world where data continuously flows. A growing number of Cypher's users show interest in continuously querying graph data to act in a timely fashion. Indeed, Cypher lacks the features for dealing with streams of (graph) data and continuous query evaluation. In this work, we propose Seraph, an extension of Cypher, as a first attempt to introduce streaming features in the context of property graph query languages. Specifically, we define Seraph semantics, we propose a first version of Seraph syntax, and we discuss the potential impacts from a user perspective.",

            "abstract": "We report on a community effort between industry and academia to shape the future of property graph constraints. The standardization for a property graph query language is currently underway through the ISO Graph Query Language (GQL) project. Our position is that this project should pay close attention to schemas and constraints, and should focus next on key constraints. The main purposes of keys are enforcing data integrity and allowing the referencing and identifying of objects. Motivated by use cases from our industry partners, we argue that key constraints should be able to have different modes, which are combinations of basic restriction that require the key to be exclusive, mandatory, and singleton. Moreover, keys should be applicable to nodes, edges, and properties since these all can represent valid real-life entities. Our result is PG-Keys, a flexible and powerful framework for defining key constraints, which fulfills the above goals. PG-Keys is a design by the Linked Data Benchmark Council's Property Graph Schema Working Group, consisting of members from industry, academia, and ISO GQL standards group, intending to bring the best of all worlds to property graph practitioners. PG-Keys aims to guide the evolution of the standardization efforts towards making systems more useful, powerful, and expressive.",

            "abstract": "As graph databases become widespread, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have approved a project to create GQL, a standard property graph query language. This complements the SQL/PGQ project, which specifies how to define graph views over a SQL tabular schema, and to run read-only queries against them. Both projects have been assigned to the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC32 working group for Database Languages, WG3, which continues to maintain and enhance SQL as a whole. This common responsibility helps enforce a policy that the identical core of both PGQ and GQL is a graph pattern matching sub-language, here termed GPML. The WG3 design process is also analyzed by an academic working group, part of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC), whose task is to produce a formal semantics of these graph data languages, which complements their standard specifications. This paper, written by members of WG3 and LDBC, presents the key elements of the GPML of SQL/PGQ and GQL in advance of the publication of these new standards.",
