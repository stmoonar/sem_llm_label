It explores how data management and analysis can be made more effective when taking into account the people who design and build these processes as well as those who are impacted by their results. Following the past two years, we plan to continue to focus on this year's workshop on early-stage research that is promising and exciting, which includes pairing each accepted paper with a mentor. The theme for this edition of the workshop is HILDA and Large Language Models. However, the workshop is not limited to this theme and other topics are also of interest. In this summary, we describe the workshop, its main focus areas, our review and mentorship plan as well as the keynote and panel sessions.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new method to measure the task-specific accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RAG). Evaluation is performed by scoring the RAG on an automatically-generated synthetic exam composed of multiple choice questions based on the corpus of documents associated with the task. Our method is an automated, cost-efficient, interpretable, and robust strategy to select the optimal components for a RAG system. We leverage Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the quality of an exam and its informativeness on task-specific accuracy. IRT also provides a natural way to iteratively improve the exam by eliminating the exam questions that are not sufficiently informative about a model's ability. We demonstrate our approach on four new open-ended Question-Answering tasks based on Arxiv abstracts, StackExchange questions, AWS DevOps troubleshooting guides, and SEC filings. In addition, our experiments reveal more general insights into factors impacting RAG performance like size, retrieval mechanism, prompting and fine-tuning. Most notably, our findings show that choosing the right retrieval algorithms often leads to bigger performance gains than simply using a larger language model.",

            "abstract": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative started as the Diversity/Inclusion initiative in 2020 [4]. The current report summarizes our activities in 2022. Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides guidance to users to help them refine their needs and find items of interest in large volumes of structured data. In this paper, we develop GUIDES, a framework for guided Text-based Item Exploration (TIE). TIE raises new challenges: (i) the need to abstract and query textual data and (ii) the need to combine queries on both structured and unstructured content. GUIDES represents text dimensions such as sentiment and topics, and introduces new text-based operators that are seamlessly integrated with traditional EDA operators. To train TIE policies, it relies on a multi-reward function that captures different textual dimensions, and extends the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) architecture with multi-objective optimization. Our experiments on Amazon and IMDb, two real-world datasets, demonstrate the necessity of capturing fine-grained text dimensions, the superiority of using both text-based and attribute-based operators over attribute-based operators only, and the need for multi-objective optimization.",

            "abstract": "Is recommendation the new search? Recommender systems have shortened the search for information in everyday activities such as following the news, media, and shopping. In this paper, we address the challenges of capturing the situational needs of the user and linking them to the available datasets with the concept of Mindsets. Mindsets are categories such as \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d and \u201cSurprise me\u201d designed to lead the users to explicitly state their intent, control the recommended content, save time, get inspired, and gain shortcuts for a satisficing exploration of POI recommendations. In our methodology, we first compiled Mindsets with a card sorting workshop and a formative evaluation. Using the insights gathered from potential end users, we then quantified Mindsets by linking them to POI utility measures using approximated lexicographic multi-objective optimisation. Finally, we ran a summative evaluation of Mindsets and derived guidelines for designing novel categories for recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a geospatial data management framework called IRIDEF which captures and analyzes user's exploratory feedback for an enriched guidance mechanism in the context of interactive analysis. We discuss that exploratory feedback can be a proxy for decision-making feedback when the latter is scarce or unavailable. IRIDEF identifies regions of interest (ROIs) via exploratory feedback and highlights a few interesting and out-of-sight POIs in each ROI. These highlights enable the user to shape up his/her future interactions with the system. We detail the components of our proposed framework in the form of a data analysis pipeline and present the aspects of efficiency and effectiveness for each component. We also discuss evaluation plans and future directions for IRIDEF.",

            "abstract": "User data can be acquired from various domains and is characterized by a combination of demographics such as age and occupation, and user actions such as rating a movie or recording one's blood pressure. User data is appealing to analysts in their role as data scientists who seek to conduct large-scale population studies, and gain insights on various population segments. It is also appealing to users in their role as information consumers who use the social Web for routine tasks such as finding a book club or choosing a physical activity. User data analytics usually relies on identifying group-level behaviors such as \u201cAsian women who publish regularly in databases\u201d. Group analytics addresses peculiarities of user data such as noise and sparsity to enable insights. In this survey, we discuss different approaches for each component of user group analytics, i.e., discovery, exploration, and visualization. We focus on related work which arises from combining those components. We also discuss challenges and future directions of having an all-in-one system, where all those components are combined. This survey has been presented in the form of two tutorials [1] , [2].",

            "abstract": "Finding a set of users of interest serves several applications in behavioral analytics. Often times, identifying users requires to explore the data and gradually choose potential targets. This is a special case of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), an iterative and tedious process. In this paper, we formalize and solve the problem of guided exploration of user groups whose purpose is to find target users. We model exploration as an iterative decision-making process, where an agent is shown a set of groups, chooses users from those groups, and selects the best action to move to the next step. To solve our problem, we apply reinforcement learning to discover an efficient exploration strategy from a simulated agent experience, and propose to use the learned strategy to recommend an exploration policy that can be applied to the same task for any dataset. Our framework accepts a wide class of exploration actions and does not need to gather exploration logs. Our experiments show that the agent naturally captures manual exploration by human analysts, and succeeds to learn an interpretable and transferable exploration policy.",
