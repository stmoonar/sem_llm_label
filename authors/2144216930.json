The core issue in MTS forecasting is how to effectively model complex spatial-temporal patterns.

SCNN works with a pre-defined generative process of MTS, which arithmetically characterizes the latent structure of the spatial-temporal patterns.

Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that SCNN can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets. Additionally, we examine SCNN with different configurations and perform in-depth analyses of the properties of SCNN.",

            "abstract": "Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid dynamical system with their specific dynamics normally unknown. The hybrid nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external impacts, which can be summarized as high-frequency and low-frequency from the temporal view, or global and local if we take the spatial view. These impacts also determine the forthcoming development of MTS making them paramount to capture in a time series forecasting task. However, conventional methods face intrinsic difficulties in disentangling the components yielded by each kind of impact from the raw data. To this end, we propose two kinds of normalization modules -- temporal and spatial normalization -- which separately refine the high-frequency component and the local component underlying the raw data. Moreover, both modules can be readily integrated into canonical deep learning architectures such as Wavenet and Transformer. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted to illustrate that, with additional normalization modules, the performance of the canonical architectures can be enhanced by a large margin in the application of MTS and achieves state-of-the-art results compared with existing MTS models.",

            "abstract": "We study the problem of weakly supervised text classification, which aims to classify text documents into a set of pre-defined categories with category surface names only and without any annotated training document provided. Most existing classifiers leverage textual information in each document. However, in many domains, documents are accompanied by various types of metadata (e.g., authors, venue, and year of a research paper). These metadata and their combinations may serve as strong category indicators in addition to textual contents. In this paper, we explore the potential of using metadata to help weakly supervised text classification. To be specific, we model the relationships between documents and metadata via a heterogeneous information network. To effectively capture higher-order structures in the network, we use motifs to describe metadata combinations. We propose a novel framework, named MotifClass , which (1) selects category-indicative motif instances, (2) retrieves and generates pseudo-labeled training samples based on category names and indicative motif instances, and (3) trains a text classifier using the pseudo training data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MotifClass to existing weakly supervised text classification approaches. Further analysis shows the benefit of considering higher-order metadata information in our framework.",

            "abstract": "Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes, such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction procedure.",

            "abstract": "Transportation demand forecasting is a topic of large practical value. However, the model that fits the demand of one transportation by only considering the historical data of its own could be vulnerable since random fluctuations could easily impact the modeling. On the other hand, common factors like time and region attribute, drive the evolution demand of different transportation, leading to a co-evolving intrinsic property between different kinds of transportation. In this work, we focus on exploring the co-evolution between different modes of transport, e.g., taxi demand and shared-bike demand. Two significant challenges impede the discovery of the co-evolving pattern: (1) diversity of the co-evolving correlation, which varies from region to region and time to time. (2) Multi-modal data fusion. Taxi demand and shared-bike demand are time-series data, which have different representations with the external factors. Moreover, the distribution of taxi demand and bike demand are not identical. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method, known as co-evolving spatial temporal neural network (CEST). CEST learns a multi-view demand representation for each mode of transport, extracts the co-evolving pattern, then predicts the demand for the target transportation based on multi-scale representation, which includes fine-scale demand information and coarse-scale pattern information. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superiority of our model over the state-of-art models.",

            "abstract": "COVID-19 has caused lasting damage to almost every domain in public health, society, and economy. To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on the aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory. In other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population mobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic trend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and satisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the ubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this problem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and after some breaking events take place. To take advantage of the social media data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic suRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i) information extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based on the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series prediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the confirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to discover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions. Extensive experiments show that our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 7.3% and 7.4% in confirmed case/fatality prediction, respectively.",
