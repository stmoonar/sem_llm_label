            "title": "SCINOBO: a novel system classifying scholarly communication in a dynamically constructed hierarchical Field-of-Science taxonomy",
            "abstract": "Classifying scientific publications according to Field-of-Science taxonomies is of crucial importance, powering a wealth of relevant applications including Search Engines, Tools for Scientific Literature, Recommendation Systems, and Science Monitoring. Furthermore, it allows funders, publishers, scholars, companies, and other stakeholders to organize scientific literature more effectively, calculate impact indicators along Science Impact pathways and identify emerging topics that can also facilitate Science, Technology, and Innovation policy-making. As a result, existing classification schemes for scientific publications underpin a large area of research evaluation with several classification schemes currently in use. However, many existing schemes are domain-specific, comprised of few levels of granularity, and require continuous manual work, making it hard to follow the rapidly evolving landscape of science as new research topics emerge. Based on our previous work of scinobo, which incorporates metadata and graph-based publication bibliometric information to assign Field-of-Science fields to scientific publications, we propose a novel hybrid approach by further employing Neural Topic Modeling and Community Detection techniques to dynamically construct a Field-of-Science taxonomy used as the backbone in automatic publication-level Field-of-Science classifiers. Our proposed Field-of-Science taxonomy is based on the OECD fields of research and development (FORD) classification, developed in the framework of the Frascati Manual containing knowledge domains in broad (first level(L1), one-digit) and narrower (second level(L2), two-digit) levels. We create a 3-level hierarchical taxonomy by manually linking Field-of-Science fields of the sciencemetrix Journal classification to the OECD/FORD level-2 fields. To facilitate a more fine-grained analysis, we extend the aforementioned Field-of-Science taxonomy to level-4 and level-5 fields by employing a pipeline of AI techniques. We evaluate the coherence and the coverage of the Field-of-Science fields for the two additional levels based on synthesis scientific publications in two case studies, in the knowledge domains of Energy and Artificial Intelligence. Our results showcase that the proposed automatically generated Field-of-Science taxonomy captures the dynamics of the two research areas encompassing the underlying structure and the emerging scientific developments.",

The communities behind these graphs strive to gather, clean, and integrate scholarly metadata from various sources to produce clean and easy-to-process knowledge graphs. In this context, a very important task of the respective cleaning and integration workflows is deduplication. In this paper, we briefly describe and evaluate the accuracy of the deduplication algorithm used for the OpenAIRE Research Graph. Our experiments show that the algorithm has an adequate performance producing a small number of false positives and an even smaller number of false negatives.",

As a result, evaluators often end up relying heavily on a selection of performance indicators like the h-index. However, over-reliance on such indicators may result in reinforcing dubious research practices, while overlooking important aspects of a researcher\u2019s career, such as their exact role in the production of particular research works or their contribution to other important types of academic or research activities (e.g., production of datasets, peer reviewing). In response, a number of initiatives that attempt to provide guidelines towards fairer research assessment frameworks have been established. In this work, we present BIP! Scholar, a Web-based service that offers researchers the opportunity to set up profiles that summarise their research careers taking into consideration well-established guidelines for fair research assessment, facilitating the work of evaluators who want to be more compliant with the respective practices.

We develop our methodology by targeting Health-related EC projects from 2007 to 2019 to produce solutions that meet the needs of stakeholders (mainly policy-makers and research funders). Various D4I text analytics workflows process datasets and their metadata, extract valuable insights and estimate intermediate results and metrics, culminating in a set of robust indicators that the users can interact with through our dashboard, the D4I Monitor (available at monitor.data4impact.eu). Therefore, our approach, which can be generalized to different contexts, is multidimensional (technology, tools, indicators, dashboard) and the resulting system can provide an innovative solution for public administrators in their policy-making needs related to RDI funding allocation.",
