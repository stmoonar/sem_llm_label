            "title": "Machine Learning Platform for Extreme Scale Computing on Compressed IoT Data",
            "abstract": "With the lowering costs of sensors, high-volume and high-velocity data are increasingly being generated and analyzed, especially in IoT domains like energy and smart homes. Consequently, applications that require accurate short-term forecasts and predictions are also steadily increasing. In this paper, we provide an overview of a novel end-to-end platform that provides efficient ingestion, compression, transfer, query processing, and machine learning-based analytics for high-frequency and high-volume time series from IoT. The performance of the platform is evaluated using real-world dataset from RES installations. The results show the importance of high-frequency analytics and the surprisingly positive impact of error bounded lossy compression on machine learning in the form of AutoML. For example, when detecting yaw misalignments in wind turbines, an improvement of 9% in accuracy was observed for AutoML models on lossy compressed data compared to the current industry standard of 10-minute aggregated data. Thus, these small-scale experiments show the potential of the platform, and larger pilots are planned.",

VisualFacts combines in-situ visualization with real-time entity resolution capabilities to address scenarios where users wish to visual explore and efficiently perform analytic operations directly on raw data files, which are aggregated from multiple overlapping data sources. VisualFacts is based on an adaptive index for efficiently scaling up to big volumes; it combines a grid with a tree and a blocking-based structure for efficiently processing spatial, categorical and overlapping data, respectively. It is progressively created based on the user interaction, adapting to the areas and details of the user exploration. This paper provides the architecture of the platform and presents a demonstration of its main features.",

LinkZoo addresses the modern needs of information-intensive collaboration environments to publish, manage, and share heterogeneous resources within user-driven contexts. Users create and manage diverse types of resources into common spaces such as files, web documents, people, datasets, and calendar events. They can interlink them, annotate them, and share them with other users, thus enabling collaborative editing, as well as enrich them with links to externally linked data resources. Resources are inherently modeled and published as resource description framework (RDF) and can be explicitly interlinked and dereferenced by external applications. LinkZoo supports creation of dynamic communities that enable web-based collaboration through resource sharing and annotating, exposing objects on the linked data Cloud under controlled vocabularies and permissions. The authors demonstrate the applicability of the tool on a popular collaboration use case scenario for sharing and organizing research resources.",
