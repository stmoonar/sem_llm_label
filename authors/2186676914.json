            "title": "Saliency-Aware Interpolative Augmentation for Multimodal Financial Prediction",
            "abstract": "Predicting price variations of financial instruments for risk modeling and stock trading is challenging due to the stochastic nature of the stock market. While recent advancements in the Financial AI realm have expanded the scope of data and methods they use, such as textual and audio cues from financial earnings calls, limitations exist. Most datasets are small, and show domain distribution shifts due to the nature of their source, suggesting the exploration for data augmentation for robust augmentation strategies such as Mixup. To tackle such challenges in the financial domain, we propose SH-Mix: Saliency-guided Hierarchical Mixup augmentation technique for multimodal financial prediction tasks. SH-Mix combines multi-level embedding mixup strategies based on the contribution of each modality and context subsequences. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on financial earnings and conference call datasets consisting of text and speech, we show that SH-Mix outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-7%. Additionally, we show that SH-Mix is generalizable across different modalities and models.",

            "title": "Learning Through Interpolative Augmentation of Dynamic Curvature Spaces",
            "abstract": "Mixup is an efficient data augmentation technique, which improves generalization by interpolating random examples. While numerous approaches have been developed for Mixup in the Euclidean and in the hyperbolic space, they do not fully use the intrinsic properties of the examples, i.e., they manually set the geometry (Euclidean or hyperbolic) based on the overall dataset, which may be sub-optimal since each example may require a different geometry. We propose DynaMix, a framework that automatically selects an example-specific geometry and performs Mixup between the different geometries to improve training dynamics and generalization. Through extensive experiments in image and text modalities we show that DynaMix outperforms state-of-the-art methods over six downstream applications. We find that DynaMix is more useful in low-resource and semi-supervised settings likely because it displays a probabilistic view of the geometry.",
