            "abstract": "Despite location being increasingly used in decision-making systems employed in many sensitive domains such as mortgages and insurance, astonishingly little attention has been paid to unfairness that may seep in due to the correlation of location with characteristics considered protected under anti-discrimination law, such as race or national origin. This position paper argues for the urgent need to consider fairness with respect to location, termed \\textit{spatial fairness}, by outlining the harms that continue to be perpetuated due to location's correlation with protected characteristics. This interdisciplinary work connects knowledge from fields such as public policy, economic development, and geography to highlight how fair-AI research currently falls short of correcting for spatial biases, and does not consider challenges unique to spatial data. Furthermore, we identify limitations of the handful of spatial fairness work proposed so far, and finally, detail guidelines for future research so subsequent work may avoid such issues and help correct spatial biases.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Smart grids are a valuable data source to study consumer behavior and guide energy policy decisions. In particular, time-series of power consumption over geographical areas are essential in deciding the optimal placement of expensive resources (e.g., transformers, storage elements) and their activation schedules. However, publication of such data raises significant privacy issues, as it may reveal sensitive details about personal habits and lifestyles. Differential privacy (DP) is well-suited for sanitization of individual data, but current DP techniques for time series lead to significant loss in utility, due to the existence of temporal correlation between data readings. We introduce {\\em STPT (Spatio-Temporal Private Timeseries)}, a novel method for DP-compliant publication of electricity consumption data that analyzes spatio-temporal attributes and captures both micro and macro patterns by leveraging RNNs. Additionally, it employs a partitioning method for releasing electricity consumption time series based on identified patterns. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, on both real-world and synthetic datasets, that STPT significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, providing a well-balanced trade-off between data utility and user privacy.",

            "abstract": "Encoding geospatial data is crucial for enabling machine learning (ML) models to perform tasks that require spatial reasoning, such as identifying the topological relationships between two different geospatial objects. However, existing encoding methods are limited as they are typically customized to handle only specific types of spatial data, which impedes their applicability across different downstream tasks where multiple data types coexist. To address this, we introduce Poly2Vec, an encoding framework that unifies the modeling of different geospatial objects, including 2D points, polylines, and polygons, irrespective of the downstream task. We leverage the power of the 2D Fourier transform to encode useful spatial properties, such as shape and location, from geospatial objects into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then inputted into neural network models for spatial reasoning tasks.This unified approach eliminates the need to develop and train separate models for each distinct spatial type. We evaluate Poly2Vec on both synthetic and real datasets of mixed geometry types and verify its consistent performance across several downstream spatial reasoning tasks.",

            "abstract": "The query processing optimization is done using an efficient clustering method for the purpose of fast retrieval of the queries. The main desire of a user is to query regarding the point of interest such as nearby restaurants, cafes, etc., The Location Based Service (LBS) enables the user to access their information about their POI (Point Of Interest). Users send their present location as query and they want to get their output as the nearest POI. Due to absence of technical concerns to support query processing on wider scales, they present the data storage and querying to the cloud service provider. The user will present their query to the data owner and, the data owner will present the data storage and querying of the client, to the cloud service provider. The security for this query processing technique is provided by the mutable order preserving encoding (mOPE) and cryptographic security process (AES and DES). Here, they previously used cloaking region and PIR (Private Information Retrieval). Now we propose Voronoi Diagram along with a new clustering method known as Self Updating Clustering Method. By using this clustering method, we can get the nearest neighbor query in a fast and efficient manner.",
