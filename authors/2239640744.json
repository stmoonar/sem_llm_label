            "abstract": "Complex social event summarization is a problem which has been important for real-world applications, including crisis management, rumor control and government policy tracking. However, in many critical situations, social events are complex and context-sensitive, which demands the online summarization of social events in an integrated manner. Motivated by this, we propose an online complex social event summarization approach, namely SOMA, which summarizes the complex social events over multiple attributes including media content and contexts simultaneously. The evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the existing solutions for event summarizaiton in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

In such cases, empirical studies with prototyping exercises are well suited to analyze/understand the system. ETL (Extraction- Transformation-Loading) is the software responsible for extracting data, cleaning, transforming and loading the data into a data warehouse. ETL is a large software system. The performance of the decision support system depends on the data warehouse that it uses. ETL tools play a major role in building the data warehouse; these tools need to have good performance in order to improve the performance of the whole system. An experimental study is conducted to analyze the performance of the ETL tool. Two ETL tools are considered; one with integrated security and another without integrated security. The time for data extraction in different environments is recorded. Further, regression analysis is done on the experimental data and observed the behavior of the tools and developed the empirical models. Both tools have shown the same behavior in performance for different extraction data sizes.",

The proposed EDP is envisioned to be a core tool for all students and learning agencies, providing support for many types of views and content/instructional resources to allow effective data-driven decision-making for students, teacher and the public, based on recent standards. It supports many features such as accessibility of data and content anywhere, scalability, extensibility of functionality, and extensibility of the technology architecture to support integration with the Shared Learning Infrastructure (SLI). The Data Dashboard is highly scalable and extensible architecture that will grow, if necessary, to meet the needs of students, and educators",

While these problems initially appear abstract, the paper has had wide influence on algorithms, database and network research.",
