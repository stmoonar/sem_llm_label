            "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the target controllability of multiplex networks with weighted interlayer edges representing the cost for control, which is faced in many real world applications but remains unsolved. The main objective is to locate a minimum number of nodes with external control sources to ensure the controllability of a target subset of the nodes, concurrently guaranteeing the cost for controlling the subset reaches the minimum. To solve this problem, we first convert it into a path cover problem, and then model it as a minimum cost maximum flow problem, which can be solved efficiently using algorithms in graph theory. This method is termed as \u201cMinimum Cost Maximum Flow based Target Path-cover\u201d (MCMFTP). By using MCMFTP, we have studied the effect of the proportion of target nodes, the number of layers, and the distribution of weights on the controllability of multiplex networks. Simulation results indicate that our approach is an effective tool to study how the multi-layer nature of networks affects target controllability in multiplex networks and would provide theoretical and empirical insights into real applications.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in malicious website detection and phishing mitigation, the security ecosystem has paid little attention to Fraudulent e-Commerce Websites (FCWs), such as fraudulent shopping websites, fake charities, and cryptocurrency scam websites. Even worse, there are no active large-scale mitigation systems or publicly available datasets for FCWs.In this paper, we first propose an efficient and automated approach to gather FCWs through crowdsourcing. We identify eight different types of non-phishing FCWs and derive key defining characteristics. Then, we find that anti-phishing mitigation systems, such as Google Safe Browsing, have a detection rate of just 0.46% on our dataset. We create a classifier, BEYOND PHISH, to identify FCWs using manually defined features based on our analysis. Validating BEYOND PHISH on never-before-seen (untrained and untested data) through a user study indicates that our system has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate of 98.34% and 1.34%, respectively. Lastly, we collaborated with a major Internet security company, Palo Alto Networks, as well as a major financial services provider, to evaluate our classifier on manually labeled real-world data. The model achieves a false positive rate of 2.46% and a 94.88% detection rate, showing potential for real-world defense against FCWs.",

            "abstract": "In this article, we consider the cooperative output regulation of singular multiagent systems under jointly connected switching topologies. The original problem is transformed into a stabilization problem by model transformation with the proposed distributed controller. Different from most existing controllers, a new graph-based switching compensator and its corresponding communication protocol are synthesized into the controller. The communication network does not remain connected at any time. And a triggered mechanism is designed to ensure that the communication between each pair of agents does not need to take place continuously. In the triggered mechanism, a novel design pattern is adopted to avoid Zeno behavior. The method in this article can reduce the computation and communication, and obtain a better tracking effect at the same time compared to previous results. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the controller and the triggered mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a multi-task attribute leaning problem. Research into person attributes recognition has focused on approaches to describe a person in terms of their appearance. Combination of some attributes is helpful to strengthen each other's learning such as upper clothing style and upper clothing length, while others are not, such as hair style and upper clothing length. Thus, how to effectively combine different task is the key challenges in PAR. To effectively utilizing the relationship between attributes and further improve the effects of PAR, we propose a novel Multi-Task Collaborative Attention Network (MTCAN), which consists of three modules. Specifically, we first design a Feature Division Module (FDM) to focus on reliable and flexible attribute-related regions. Based on the precise attribute-related locations, we further construct a Spatial and Channel Collaborative Attention Module (SCCAM) to facilitate the beneficial features and weaken mutually suppressed features. Thirdly, a newly weights fusion strategy named adaptive-soups is proposed to mine the optimal model which is universal for deep learning models in all fields. Experiments on two pedestrian attribute recognition datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance against other state-of-the-art methods.",

The use of HP signals is required by the backpropagation learning algorithm since the gradient descent learning rule relies on the chain product of partial derivatives. However, it is both challenging and biologically implausible to implement such an HP algorithm in noisy and analog memristor\u2010based hardware systems. Herein, it is demonstrated that the requirement for HP signals handling is not necessary and more efficient deep learning can be achieved when using a binary stochastic learning algorithm. The new algorithm proposed in this work modifies elementary neural network operations, which improves energy efficiency by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional memristor\u2010based hardware and three orders of magnitude compared to complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor\u2010based hardware. It also provides better accuracy in pattern recognition tasks than the HP learning algorithm benchmarks.",

Most existing 3-D imaging methods for TomoSAR consider the layovers for different channels are the same. However, in the low-altitude airborne cases, the variation of layovers between channels becomes unneglectable. In this letter, we studied the channel migration (CM) phenomenon of sparse TomoSAR under low-altitude scenarios. We derived the model of the differential range from a particular target to different antennas, which is nearly a linear function along the array dimension. Therefore, we applied Keystone transform (KT) on the array axis to correct this CM, and then the traditional compressed sensing-based 3-D imaging methods for TomoSAR can be applied to get the final 3-D reconstruction results. The approach was tested with simulation data and also the real data of the MV3DSAR system, which is a mini drone-borne TomoSAR system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a more accurate solution to the low-altitude sparse TomoSAR reconstruction problem.",

            "abstract": "End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have gained popularity given their simplified architecture and promising results. However, text-only domain adaptation remains a big challenge for E2E systems. Text-to-speech (TTS) based approaches fine-tune ASR models by synthesized speech with an auxiliary TTS model, thus increase deployment costs. Language model (LM) fusion based approaches can achieve good performance but are sensitive to interpolation parameters. In order to factorize out the language component in the AED model, we propose the factorized attention-based encoder-decoder (Factorized AED) model whose decoder takes as input the posterior probabilities of a jointly trained LM. Moreover, in the context of domain adaptation, the domain specific LM serves as a plug-and-play component for a well-trained factorized AED model. In-domain experiments on LibriSpeech and out-of-domain experiments adapting from LibriSpeech to a variety of domains in GigaSpeech are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Results show 20% / 24% relative word error rate (WER) reduction for LibriSpeech test sets and 8 \u223c34% relative WER reduction for 8 GigaSpeech target domains test sets compared to the AED baseline.",

            "abstract": "Smart Grid is an indispensable part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and has the potential to revolutionise the electricity energy industry. Smart meters, as an important component of Smart Grid, are responsible for the exchange of information between end consumers and service providers. Smart meters and service providers need to use authentication key exchange protocols (AKE) to establish a secure session for secure information transmission. However, The current state-of-the-art lightweight solutions do not support identity anonymity and mostly have high communication costs. This paper proposes a lightweight and secure mutual authentication scheme, which is particularly designed for devices with limited computing capability to provide identity anonymity such as smart meters, based on the Shangyong Mima 2 (SM2) AKE protocol stipulated by the State Cryptography Administration of China. We conducted formal analysis of the security of the proposed scheme and proved its security. In addition, the computational overhead of the protocol was evaluated through performance analysis. Compared with related lightweight protocols, our scheme can reduce up to 30%-40% computational overhead. The results verified that the proposed scheme is indeed suitable for secure communication involving devices with constrained computing capability.",

            "title": "BFRNet: Bidimensional Feature Representation Network for Remote Sensing Images Classification",
            "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer, as mainstream classification methods, have made good progress in improving the classification performance of remote sensing (RS) images. Furthermore, the CNN-transformer hybrid architecture has shown a greater potential for enabling models to obtain local information and global dependency relationships. In general, numerous researches improve self-attention block of vision transformer (ViT) in the spatial dimension. Nevertheless, spatial self-attention mostly achieves a single spatial feature extraction, which cannot meet the requirement of accurate recognition of high-resolution RS images. In this work, a method for representing spatial and channel dimensions of RS images is proposed, which not only extracts global\u2013local spatial features but also pays special attention to incorporate channel information. Specifically, bidimensional local window self-attention (BLWS) and pyramid pool self-attention are conducted to extract local\u2013global features. Subsequently, a linear attention module will fuse local\u2013global information in the channel dimension when computing multihead self-attention (MHSA). A bidimensional gating unit (BGU) is used to replace the traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) of the feedforward network (FFN). The above improvements result in a bidimensional feature representation (BFR) block, and BFR network (BFRNet) is designed based on BFR blocks. BFRNet consists of four stages, and each stage repeatedly stacks BFR blocks with different layers. Experiments show that the classification accuracy of BFRNet is significantly better than the existing methods of CNN, ViTs, and CNN-transformer networks. On dataset RSSCN7, BFRNet achieves a classification accuracy of 98.75% with only 1.9G floating point operations (FLOPs), which is 8.21% higher than ViT, 3.21% higher than Resnet50, and 2.68% higher than CoAtNet, respectively.",

            "title": "Towards Spatio-temporal Sea Surface Temperature Forecasting via Dynamic Personalized Graph Network",
            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) is uniquely important to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere since its dynamics are a major force in shaping local and global climate and profoundly affect our ecosystems. Accurate forecasting of SST brings significant economic and social implications, for example, better preparation for extreme weather such as severe droughts or tropical cyclones months ahead. However, such a task faces unique challenges due to the intrinsic complexity and uncertainty of ocean systems. Recently, deep learning techniques, such as graphical neural networks (GNN), have been applied to address this task. While such techniques achieve certain levels of success, they often have significant limitations in exploring dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies between signals. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel graph convolution network architecture with static and dynamic learning layers for SST forecasting. Specifically, two adaptive adjacency matrices are firstly constructed to respectively model the stable long-term and short-term evolutionary patterns hidden in the multivariate SST signals. Then, a personalized convolution layer is designed to fuse these information. The developed network can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our experiments on real SST datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performances of the proposed approach on the forecasting task.",
