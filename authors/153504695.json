            "abstract": "Extracting entities and relations is an essential task of information extraction. Triplets extracted from a sentence might overlap with each other. Previous methods either did not address the overlapping issues or solved overlapping issues partially. To tackle triplet overlapping problems completely, firstly we extract candidate subjects with a standard span mechanism. Then we present a labeled span mechanism to extract the objects and relations simultaneously, we use the labeled span mechanism to generate labeled spans whose start and end positions indicate the objects, and whose labels correspond to relations of subject and objects. Besides, we design an entity attention mechanism to enhance the information fusion between subject and sentence during extracting objects and relations. We test our method on two public datasets, our method achieves the best performances on these two datasets.",

            "abstract": "Natural Language Video Localization (NLVL) aims to locate a target moment from an untrimmed video that semantically corresponds to a text query. Existing approaches mainly solve the NLVL problem from the perspective of computer vision by formulating it as ranking, anchor, or regression tasks. These methods suffer from large performance degradation when localizing on long videos. In this work, we address the NLVL from a new perspective, i.e., span-based question answering (QA), by treating the input video as a text passage. We propose a video span localizing network (VSLNet), on top of the standard span-based QA framework (named VSLBase), to address NLVL. VSLNet tackles the differences between NLVL and span-based QA through a simple yet effective query-guided highlighting (QGH) strategy. QGH guides VSLNet to search for the matching video span within a highlighted region. To address the performance degradation on long videos, we further extend VSLNet to VSLNet-L by applying a multi-scale split-and-concatenation strategy. VSLNet-L first splits the untrimmed video into short clip segments; then, it predicts which clip segment contains the target moment and suppresses the importance of other segments. Finally, the clip segments are concatenated, with different confidences, to locate the target moment accurately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed VSLNet and VSLNet-L outperform the state-of-the-art methods; VSLNet-L addresses the issue of performance degradation on long videos. Our study suggests that the span-based QA framework is an effective strategy to solve the NLVL problem.",

            "abstract": "Relation Extraction (RE) is to predict the relation type of two entities that are mentioned in a piece of text, e.g., a sentence or a dialogue. When the given text is long, it is challenging to identify indicative words for the relation prediction. Recent advances on RE task are from BERT-based sequence modeling and graph-based modeling of relationships among the tokens in the sequence. In this paper, we propose to construct a latent multi-view graph to capture various possible relationships among tokens. We then refine this graph to select important words for relation prediction. Finally, the representation of the refined graph and the BERT-based sequence representation are concatenated for relation extraction. Specifically, in our proposed GDPNet (Gaussian Dynamic Time Warping Pooling Net), we utilize Gaussian Graph Generator (GGG) to generate edges of the multi-view graph. The graph is then refined by Dynamic Time Warping Pooling (DTWPool). On DialogRE and TACRED, we show that GDPNet achieves the best performance on dialogue-level RE, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-arts on sentence-level RE.

To this end, data-independent ensemble methods like Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) attract increasing attention due to its easiness of implementation and parallelization. Specifically, traditional ECOCs and its general extension N-ary ECOC decompose the original multi-class classification problem into a series of independent simpler classification subproblems. Unfortunately, integrating ECOCs, especially N-ary ECOC with deep neural networks, termed as deep N-ary ECOC, is not straightforward and yet fully exploited in the literature, due to the high expense of training base learners. To facilitate the training of N-ary ECOC with deep learning base learners, we further propose three different variants of parameter sharing architectures for deep N-ary ECOC. To verify the generalization ability of deep N-ary ECOC, we conduct experiments by varying the backbone with different deep neural network architectures for both image and text classification tasks. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies on deep N-ary ECOC show its superior performance over other deep data-independent ensemble methods.",

Unfortunately, most existing MCQA datasets are small in size, which increases the difficulty of model learning and generalization. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-source meta transfer (MMT) for low-resource MCQA. In this framework, we first extend meta learning by incorporating multiple training sources to learn a generalized feature representation across domains. To bridge the distribution gap between training sources and the target, we further introduce the meta transfer that can be integrated into the multi-source meta training. More importantly, the proposed MMT is independent of backbone language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MMT over state-of-the-arts, and continuous improvements can be achieved on different backbone networks on both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation settings.",

Existing work tackles this problem by annotated evidence or distant supervision with rules which overly rely on human efforts. To address the challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach termed evidence filtering to model the relationships between the encoded contexts with respect to different options collectively, and to potentially highlight the evidence sentences and filter out unrelated sentences. In addition to the effective reduction of human efforts of our approach compared, through extensive experiments on OpenbookQA, we show that the proposed approach outperforms the models that use the same backbone and more training data; and our parameter analysis also demonstrates the interpretability of our approach.",

Specifically, to handle the label imbalance issue, we first incorporate label statistics in a novel conditional random field (CRF) loss. In addition, we design an additional loss to reduce the weights of overwhelming easy tokens for augmenting the CRF loss.
