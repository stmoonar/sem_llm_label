            "title": "Marking the Pace: A Blockchain-Enhanced Privacy-Traceable Strategy for Federated Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Federated recommender systems have been crucially enhanced through data sharing and continuous model updates, attributed to the pervasive connectivity and distributed computing capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Given the sensitivity of IoT data, transparent data processing in data sharing and model updates is paramount. However, existing methods fall short in tracing the flow of shared data and the evolution of model updates. Consequently, data sharing is vulnerable to exploitation by malicious entities, raising significant data privacy concerns, while excluding data sharing will result in suboptimal recommendations. To mitigate these concerns, we present LIBERATE, a privacy-traceable federated recommender system. We design a blockchain-based traceability mechanism, ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model updates. We further enhance privacy protection by incorporating local differential privacy in user\u2013server communication. Extensive evaluations with the real-world data set corroborate LIBERATE\u2019s capabilities in ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model update while maintaining efficiency and performance. Results underscore blockchain-based traceability mechanism as a promising solution for privacy preserving in federated recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic causes a massive disruption to social stability that threatens human life and the economy. An effective forecasting system is arguably important to provide an early signal of the risk of COVID-19 infection so that the authorities are ready to protect the people from the worst. However, making a good forecasting model for infection risks in different cities or regions is not an easy task, because it has a lot of influential factors that are difficult to be identified manually. To address the current limitations, we propose a deep graph learning model, called PANDORA, to predict the infection risks of COVID-19, by considering all essential factors and integrating them into a geographical network. The framework uses geographical position relationships and transportation frequency as higher order structural properties formulated by higher order network structures (i.e., network motifs). Moreover, four significant node attributes (i.e., multiple features of a particular area, including climate, medical condition, economy, and human mobility) are also considered. We propose three different aggregators to better aggregate node attributes and structural features, namely, Hadamard, Summation, and Connection. Experimental results over real data show that PANDORA outperforms the baseline methods with higher accuracy and faster convergence speed, no matter which aggregator is chosen.",

However, variants of graph neural architectures can lead to drastically different performance on different tasks. Model comparison calls for a unifying framework with interpretability and principled experimental procedures. Based on the theories from graph signal processing (GSP), we show that GCN\u2019s capability is fundamentally limited by the uncertainty principle, and wavelets provide a controllable trade-off between local and global information. We adapt wavelet denoising filters to the graph domain, unifying popular variants of GCN under a common interpretable mathematical framework. Furthermore, we propose WaveThresh and WaveShrink which are novel GCN models based on proven denoising filters from the signal processing literature. Empirically, we evaluate our models and other popular GCNs under a more principled procedure and analyze how trade-offs between local and global graph signals can lead to better performance in different datasets.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed great challenges to public health services, government agencies, and policymakers, raising huge social conflicts between public health and economic resilience. Policies such as reopening or closure of business activities are formulated based on scientific projections of infection risks obtained from infection dynamics models. Though most parameters in epidemic prediction service models can be set with domain knowledge of COVID-19, a key parameter, namely, human mobility, is often challenging to estimate due to complex spatio-temporal correlations and social contexts under escalating COVID-19 facilities. Moreover, how to integrate the various implicit features to accurately predict infectious cases is still an open issue. To address this challenge, we formulate the problem as a spatio-temporal network representation problem and propose STEP, a Spatio-Temporal Epidemic Prediction framework, to estimate pandemic infection risk of a city by integrating various real-world conditions (e.g., City Risk Index, climate, and medical conditions) into graph-structured data. We also employ a multi-head attention mechanism in representation learning to extract implicit features for a given city. Extensive experiments have been conducted upon the real-world dataset for 51 states (50 states and Washington, D.C.) of the USA. Experimental results show that STEP can yield more accurate pandemic infection risk estimation than baseline methods. Moreover, STEP outperforms other methods in both short-term and long-term prediction.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph representation. However, GNNs have remained black boxes, leading to the lack of explainability. As a consequence, the application of GNNs has been severely limited. Existing methods focus on generating an explanation with important nodes and edges but pay less attention to high-order structures (e.g., network motif), which are more intuitive and important for graph data. The explanations generated by the explainer will thus ignore the high-order information contained in multi-node neighbours, resulting in a decrease in the human comprehensibility of the explanation subgraph. In this paper, we propose a motif-aware GNNs explainer (MEGA), wherein a motif-aware subgraph generation module and a counterfactual optimization layer are employed. MEGA can provide high-quality counterfactual explanations for GNNs while focusing on high-order features of graph data. We justify the effectiveness of the proposed MEGA on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while keeping explanations at a smaller level.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant advances in graph contrastive learning (GCL), while most GCL models use graph neural networks as encoders based on supervised learning. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning model called GraphTL, which explores self-supervised teaching and learning of representations on graphs. One critical objective of GCL is to retain original graph information. For this purpose, we design an encoder based on the idea of unsupervised dimensionality reduction of locally linear embedding (LLE). Specifically, we map one iteration of the LLE to one layer of the network. To guide the encoder to better retain the original graph information, we propose an unbalanced contrastive model consisting of two views, which are the learning view and the teaching view, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the nodes that are identical in muti-views as positive node pairs, and design the node similarity scorer so that the model can select positive samples of a target node. Extensive experiments have been conducted over multiple datasets to evaluate the performance of GraphTL in comparison with baseline models. Results demonstrate that GraphTL can reduce distances between similar nodes while preserving network topological and feature information, yielding better performance in node classification.",

            "abstract": "Academic conferences have been proven to be significant in facilitating academic activities. To promote information retrieval specific to academic conferences, building complete, systematic, and professional conference knowledge graphs is a crucial task. However, many related systems mainly focus on general knowledge of overall academic information or concentrate services on specific domains. Aiming at filling this gap, this work demonstrates a novel conference knowledge graph, namely Web of Conferences. The system accommodates detailed conference profiles, conference ranking lists, intelligent conference queries, and personalized conference recommendations. Web of Conferences supports detailed conference information retrieval while providing the ranking of conferences based on the most recent data. Conference queries in the system can be implemented via precise search or fuzzy search. Then, according to users' query conditions, personalized conference recommendations are available. Web of Conferences is demonstrated with a user-friendly visualization interface and can be served as a useful information retrieval system for researchers.",

            "abstract": "Quantum theory has shown its superiority in enhancing machine learning. However, facilitating quantum theory to enhance graph learning is in its infancy. This survey investigates the current advances in quantum graph learning (QGL) from three perspectives, i.e., underlying theories, methods, and prospects. We first look at QGL and discuss the mutualism of quantum theory and graph learning, the specificity of graph-structured data, and the bottleneck of graph learning, respectively. A new taxonomy of QGL is presented, i.e., quantum computing on graphs, quantum graph representation, and quantum circuits for graph neural networks. Pitfall traps are then highlighted and explained. This survey aims to provide a brief but insightful introduction to this emerging field, along with a detailed discussion of frontiers and outlook yet to be investigated.",

            "abstract": "Graph Augmentation Learning (GAL) provides outstanding solutions for graph learning in handling incomplete data, noise data, etc. Numerous GAL methods have been proposed for graph-based applications such as social network analysis and traffic flow forecasting. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of these GAL methods are still unclear. As a consequence, how to choose optimal graph augmentation strategy for a certain application scenario is still in black box. There is a lack of systematic, comprehensive, and experimentally validated guideline of GAL for scholars. Therefore, in this survey, we in-depth review GAL techniques from macro (graph), meso (subgraph), and micro (node/edge) levels. We further detailedly illustrate how GAL enhance the data quality and the model performance. The aggregation mechanism of augmentation strategies and graph learning models are also discussed by different application scenarios, i.e., data-specific, model-specific, and hybrid scenarios. To better show the outperformance of GAL, we experimentally validate the effectiveness and adaptability of different GAL strategies in different downstream tasks. Finally, we share our insights on several open issues of GAL, including heterogeneity, spatio-temporal dynamics, scalability, and generalization.",
