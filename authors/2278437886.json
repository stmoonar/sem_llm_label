            "title": "Universal Time-Series Representation Learning: A Survey",
            "abstract": "Time-series data exists in every corner of real-world systems and services, ranging from satellites in the sky to wearable devices on human bodies. Learning representations by extracting and inferring valuable information from these time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of particular phenomena and enabling informed decisions. With the learned representations, we can perform numerous downstream analyses more effectively. Among several approaches, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in extracting hidden patterns and features from time-series data without manual feature engineering. This survey first presents a novel taxonomy based on three fundamental elements in designing state-of-the-art universal representation learning methods for time series. According to the proposed taxonomy, we comprehensively review existing studies and discuss their intuitions and insights into how these methods enhance the quality of learned representations. Finally, as a guideline for future studies, we summarize commonly used experimental setups and datasets and discuss several promising research directions.

            "title": "Breaking the Time-Frequency Granularity Discrepancy in Time-Series Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "In light of the remarkable advancements made in time-series anomaly detection(TSAD), recent emphasis has been placed on exploiting the frequency domain as well as the time domain to address the difficulties in precisely detecting pattern-wise anomalies. However, in terms of anomaly scores, the window granularity of the frequency domain is inherently distinct from the data-point granularity of the time domain. Owing to this discrepancy, the anomaly information in the frequency domain has not been utilized to its full potential for TSAD. In this paper, we propose a TSAD framework, Dual-TF, that simultaneously uses both the time and frequency domains while breaking the time-frequency granularity discrepancy. To this end, our framework employs nested-sliding windows, with the outer and inner windows responsible for the time and frequency domains, respectively, and aligns the anomaly scores of the two domains. As a result of the high resolution of the aligned scores, the boundaries of pattern-wise anomalies can be identified more precisely. In six benchmark datasets, our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.0--147%, as demonstrated by experimental results.",
