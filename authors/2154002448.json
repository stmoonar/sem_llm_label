            "title": "Learning Distinct Relationship in Package Recommendation With Graph Attention Networks",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems have been widely developed and extensively used in various websites and platforms to promote products or services to interested users. However, in quite a few sale scenarios, the platform has the necessity to display users a series of items, which is called package recommendation. There is very little research in this area. This article develops a novel and realistic package recommendation system named package graph attention network (PGAT) based on graph neural network. PGAT integrates users, items, and packages to build a unified heterogeneous graph and treat them as a whole. PGAT incorporates an attention mechanism in the first-order neighborhood aggregation operation, which can differentiate the weight of different neighbor nodes to the center node. By performing graph attention and graph convolution operations on the tripartite graph, PGAT can learn node embeddings more expressively and address the problem of data sparse to a large extent. Extensive experiment results on two real-world datasets validate the outstanding performance of PGAT, which is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines by 0.77%\u201310.12%.",

            "title": "Learning Dual Low-Rank Representation for Multi-Label Micro-Video Classification",
            "abstract": "Currently, with the rapid development of mobile Internet, micro-video has become a prevailing format of user-generated contents (UGCs) on various social media platforms. Several studies have been conducted towards to understanding high-level micro-video semantics, such as venue categorization, memorability, and popularity. However, these approaches supported tasks with only a single output, which exhibited limitations when attempting to use them to resolve tasks with multiple outputs, especially the multi-label micro-video classification. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a dual multi-modal low-rank decomposition (DMLRD) method for multi-label micro-video classification tasks. To learn more comprehensive micro-video representations, we first learn the low-rank-regularized modality-specific and modality-shared components by considering the consistency and the complementarity among modalities simultaneously. Meanwhile, the less descriptive power of each modality aroused by inherent properties can be solved to a certain extent. To obtain unseen label representations, we next construct a sparsity-regularized multi-matrix normal estimation term to jointly encode the latent relationship structures among labels and dimensions. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over the state-of-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Currently, micro-videos have attracted increasing attention due to their unique properties and great commercial value. Considering that micro-videos naturally incorporate multimodal information, a powerful representation method for distinct joint multimodal representations is essential for real applications. Inspired by the potential of attention neural network architectures over various tasks, we propose a multimodal aggregation network (MANET) with a serial self-attention mechanism to perform tasks of micro-video multi-label classification. Specifically, we first propose a parallel content-dependent graph neural networks (CDGNN) module, which explores category-related embeddings of micro-videos by disentangling category relations into modality-specific and modality-shared category dependency patterns. Then we introduce a serial self-attention (SSA) module to transmit the multimodal information in sequential order, in which an aggregation bottleneck is incorporated to better collect and condense the significant information. Experiments conducted on a large-scale multi-label micro-video dataset demonstrate that our proposed method has achieved competitive results compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "The Silk Road documentaries refer to documentaries related to the theme of the Silk Road. Its connotation, scope, and significance have a profound impact on the creation of Chinese documentaries, and become a major documentary genre with a unique style in the history of documentary creation in China. Although the production of documentary about \"Silk Road\" has achieved remarkable results in both quantity and quality, its development trend is seriously affected by the development iteration of research objects over time and national policies, resulting in the unknown future development of \"Silk Road\" documentary. Therefore, this paper first reviews and summarizes the theme background and historical development of the Silk Road documentary. Then, a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model with gate mechanism and memory unit is used to adaptively model its historical time series data. Finally, the long-term iterative forecasting method is used to gradually introduce the development trend of the number of \"Silk Road\" documentaries in the next few years. Under the circumstances that the national policy on the Silk Road in the next few years is unknown, this paper could better guide the future development trend of this type of documentary creation in the form of modeling, and provide reference for future scholars in this direction.",
