            "abstract": "This paper describes our participation in the TAC-KBP 2017 Cold Start++ Knowledge Base Population task. Our SAFT system is a loosely-coupled integration of individual components processing documents in English, Spanish and Chinese. The system extracts entities, slot relations, event nuggets and arguments, performs entity linking against Freebase and event coreference, and also integrates sentiment relations extracted by external collaborators at Columbia and Cornell. The various extractions get combined, linked, deconflicted and integrated into a consistent knowledge base (one per language) for query-based evaluation.",
