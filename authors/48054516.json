            "title": "Software Architecture Design of Animation Studies Platform Using Structure-Behavior Coalescence Method",
            "abstract": "Animation education in the new media era is moving toward the goal of cultivating high-end talents. The development of an architecture-oriented animation studies platform provides guarantee for the training of talents in terms of teaching quality. This research uses the Internet as the medium and mobile phones and computer clients as the main technology platforms, starting from the software architecture and constructing the system model of the animation studies platform according to the Structure-Behavior Coalescence (SBC) method. The core theme of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a modeling language with model consistency of systems structure and systems behavior. This paper developed Structure-Behavior Coalescence State Machine (SBC-SM) as the formal language for the MBSE animation studies platform design model singularity. The model consistency will be fully guaranteed in the MBSE animation studies platform design when the SBC state machine approach is adopted. It not only improves the efficiency of platform development but also reduces the difficulty and risk of platform development.",

            "abstract": "The architecture oriented smart tourism innovative service system, using Structure-Behavior Coalescence (SBC) architecure description language to design innovative service system, the design platform of smart tourism innovative service system can be described effectively. Through the SOLOMO model and SBC architecture description language make the combination of social and travel specs patterns to create a split mobile platform for smart tourism innovative service system, can offer travelers to get a fresh and up to date travel experience. The first part of this article briefly introduces the background of the architecture oriented innovative service systems design; the second part describes design specifications of the architecture oriented tourism innovative service system design; in the third part, the results of the study are discussed. Through architecture oriented smart tourism innovative service systems, travelers can link with their travel management experience to get the psychological dynamics tourist activities and provide more smart services for tourism.",
