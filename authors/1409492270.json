            "title": "Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Federated Global Twin Generator",
            "abstract": "Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) increasingly becomes important in the decentralized setting, where it enables multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model to perform well on a sequence of tasks without sharing their private data. In FCIL, conventional Federated Learning algorithms such as FedAVG often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, resulting in significant performance declines on earlier tasks. Recent works, based on generative models, produce synthetic images to help mitigate this issue across all classes, but these approaches' testing accuracy on previous classes is still much lower than recent classes, i.e., having better plasticity than stability. To overcome these issues, this paper presents Federated Global Twin Generator (FedGTG), an FCIL framework that exploits privacy-preserving generative-model training on the global side without accessing client data. Specifically, the server trains a data generator and a feature generator to create two types of information from all seen classes, and then it sends the synthetic data to the client side. The clients then use feature-direction-controlling losses to make the local models retain knowledge and learn new tasks well. We extensively analyze the robustness of FedGTG on natural images, as well as its ability to converge to flat local minima and achieve better-predicting confidence (calibration). Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tiny-ImageNet demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and forgetting measures of FedGTG compared to previous frameworks.",

CQELS 2.0 is a platform-agnostic federated execution framework towards semantic stream fusion. In this version, we introduce a novel neural-symbolic stream reasoning component that enables specifying deep neural network (DNN) based data fusion pipelines via logic rules with learnable probabilistic degrees as weights. As a platform-agnostic framework, CQELS 2.0 can be implemented for devices with different hardware architectures (from embedded devices to cloud infrastructures). Moreover, this version also includes an adaptive federator that allows CQELS instances on different nodes in a network to coordinate their resources to distribute processing pipelines by delegating partial workloads to their peers via subscribing continuous queries",

            "abstract": "Sensing devices are becoming the source of a large portion of the Web data. To facilitate the integration of sensed data with data from other sources, both sensor stream sources and data are being enriched with semantic descriptions, creating Linked Stream Data. Despite its enormous potential, little has been done to explore Linked Stream Data. One of the main characteristics of such data is its \u201clive\u201d nature, which prohibits existing Linked Data technologies to be applied directly. Moreover, there is currently a lack of tools to facilitate publishing Linked Stream Data and making it available to other applications. To address these issues we have developed the Linked Stream Middleware (LSM), a platform that brings together the live real world sensed data and the Semantic Web. A LSM deployment is available at http://lsm.deri.ie/. It provides many functionalities such as: i) wrappers for real time data collection and publishing; ii) a web interface for data annotation and visualisation; and iii) a SPARQL endpoint for querying unified Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In this paper we describe the system architecture behind LSM, provide details how Linked Stream Data is generated, and demonstrate the benefits of the platform by showcasing its interface.",
