            "abstract": "This paper describes the system and experimental results of an ensemble-based approach tomultilingual framing detection for the submission of the ACCEPT team to the SemEval-2023 Task 3 on Framing Detection (Subtask 2). The approach is based on an ensemble that combines three different methods: a classifier based on large language models, a classifier based on static word embeddings, and an approach that uses external commonsense knowledge graphs, in particular, ConceptNet. The results of the three classification heads are aggregated into an overall prediction for each frame class.Our best submission yielded a micro F1-score of 50.69% (rank 10) and a macro F1-score of 50.20% (rank 3) for English articles. Our experimental results show that static word embeddings and knowledge graphs are useful components for frame detection, while the ensemble of all three methods combines the strengths of our three proposed methods. Through system ablations, we show that the commonsenseguided knowledge graphs are the outperforming method for many languages.",

            "abstract": "Many NLP tasks exhibit human label variation, where different annotators give different labels to the same texts. This variation is known to depend, at least in part, on the sociodemographics of annotators. Recent research aims to model individual annotator behaviour rather than predicting aggregated labels, and we would expect that sociodemographic information is useful for these models. On the other hand, the ecological fallacy states that aggregate group behaviour, such as the behaviour of the average female annotator, does not necessarily explain individual behaviour. To account for sociodemographics in models of individual annotator behaviour, we introduce group-specific layers to multi-annotator models. In a series of experiments for toxic content detection, we find that explicitly accounting for sociodemographic attributes in this way does not significantly improve model performance. This result shows that individual annotation behaviour depends on much more than just sociodemographics.",

            "abstract": "Arguments often do not make explicit how a conclusion follows from its premises. To compensate for this lack, we enrich arguments with structured background knowledge to support knowledge-intense argumentation tasks. We present a new unsupervised method for constructing Contextualized Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CCKGs) that selects contextually relevant knowledge from large knowledge graphs (KGs) efficiently and at high quality. Our work goes beyond context-insensitive knowledge extraction heuristics by computing semantic similarity between KG triplets and textual arguments. Using these triplet similarities as weights, we extract contextualized knowledge paths that connect a conclusion to its premise, while maximizing similarity to the argument. We combine multiple paths into a CCKG that we optionally prune to reduce noise and raise precision. Intrinsic evaluation of the quality of our graphs shows that our method is effective for (re)constructing human explanation graphs. Manual evaluations in a large-scale knowledge selection setup verify high recall and precision of implicit CSK in the CCKGs. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CCKGs in a knowledge-insensitive argument quality rating task, outperforming strong baselines and rivaling a GPT-3 based system.",

            "abstract": "OTTR is a language for representing ontology modeling patterns, which enables to build ontologies or knowledge bases by instantiating templates. Thereby, particularities of the ontological representation language are hidden from the domain experts, and it enables ontology engineers to, to some extent, separate the processes of deciding about what information to model from deciding about how to model the information, e.g., which design patterns to use. Certain decisions can thus be postponed for the benefit of focusing on one of these processes. To date, only few works on ontology engineering where ontology templates are applied are described in the literature. In this paper, we outline our methodology and report findings from our ontology engineering activities in the domain of Material Science. In these activities, OTTR templates play a key role. Our ontology engineering process is bottom-up, as we begin modeling activities from existing data that is then, via templates, fed into a knowledge graph, and it is top-down, as we first focus on which data to model and postpone the decision of how to model the data. We find, among other things, that OTTR templates are especially useful as a means of communication with domain experts. Furthermore, we find that because OTTR templates encapsulate modeling decisions, the engineering process becomes flexible, meaning that design decisions can be changed at little cost.",

In contrast to other approaches, our system does not regard the PICO elements as flat objects or labels but as structured objects. We thus model the task as the one of filling a set of templates and slots; our two-step approach recognizes relevant slot candidates as a first step and assigns them to a corresponding template as second step, relying on a learned pairwise scoring function that models the compatibility of the different slot values. We evaluate the approach on a dataset of 211 manually annotated abstracts for type 2 Diabetes and Glaucoma, showing the positive impact of modelling intra-template entity compatibility. As main benefit, our approach yields a structured object for every RCT abstract that supports the aggregation and summarization of clinical trial results across published studies and can facilitate the task of creating a systematic review or meta-analysis.",

The research field of Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) has gained in importance, visibility and impact, with the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud gathering nowadays over 200 resources. With this increasing growth, new challenges have emerged concerning particular domain and task applications, quality dimensions, and linguistic features to take into account. This special issue aims to review and summarize the progress and status of LLD research in recent years, as well as to offer an understanding of the challenges ahead of the field for the years to come. The papers in this issue indicate that there are still aspects to address for a wider community adoption of LLD, as well as a lack of resources for specific tasks and (interdisciplinary) domains. Likewise, the integration of LLD resources into Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and the search for long-term infrastructure solutions to host LLD resources continue to be essential points to which to attend in the foreseeable future of the research line.",

The task focused on the prediction of the validity and novelty of a conclusion given a textual premise. Validity is defined as the degree to which the conclusion is justified with respect to the given premise. Novelty defines the degree to which the conclusion contains content that is new in relation to the premise. Six groups participated in the task, submitting overall 13 system runs for the subtask of binary classification and 2 system runs for the subtask of relative classification. The results reveal that the task is challenging, with best results obtained for Validity prediction in the range of 75% F1 score, for Novelty prediction of 70% F1 score and for correctly predicting both Validity and Novelty of 45% F1 score. In this paper we summarize the task definition and dataset. We give an overview of the results obtained by the participating systems, as well as insights to be gained from the diverse contributions.",

            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a learning paradigm that allows clients to profit from the data that is available across multiple clients to train a joint model. As FL allows to train such a joint model without explicitly sharing data, but only sharing model updates, it has attained popularity in healthcare settings where patient data is subject to strict privacy policies and needs to be locally stored at each hospital or healthcare provider. A particular challenge for FL settings is data imbalance across clients, as it has been found to be detrimental to model performance and impact the influence of each client on the learning process. Unfortunately, the healthcare domain is particularly prone to such imbalanced data due to regional differences in disease management, prescription behavior etc. In this paper, we introduce the two novel metrics Benefit and Contribution to quantify to which degree individual clients benefit from participation in FL and how they contribute to its success, respectively. Therefore, we measure Benefit and Contribution with respect to four types of imbalances present in data at each client side. Our results show that both client Benefit and Contribution are influenced by data imbalance in such a way that high imbalance in data quantity, label distribution and feature distribution reduces or nullifies clients\u2019 Benefit while increasing their Contribution. Thus, the most valuable clients within a cohort benefit the least from their participation, exposing a critical thread to the success of clinical FL cohorts by withdrawing participation.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs are relevant for many applications, but are inherently incomplete. Thus, Link Prediction methods have been proposed to infer new triples in order to complete a given Knowledge Graph. Many Link Prediction methods ignore literals, in spite of the fact that literals can express important information about entities not encoded in relations between entities. The existing methods that do incorporate literal information (e. g., LiteralE) introduce complex architectures by modifying the model or the loss-function. In our research paper, we propose a new approach that relies on graph transformations to transform a graph in such a way that existing Link Prediction methods can leverage the literal information. In particular, we define three transformations and evaluate them in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. In most cases, the additional triples generated by our transformations lead to a performance increase and even state-of-the-art performance can be reached when comparing against LiteralE. It turned out that even a reductionistic transformation is able to archive comparable results like current, more complex, state-of-the-art approaches which incorporate literals.",

As training data for this task is scarce and costly to obtain, we experimentally investigate the impact of data augmentation approaches for improving the accuracy of prediction compared to a baseline that relies on task-specific data only. We consider the generation of synthetic data as well as the integration of datasets from related argument tasks. We show that especially our synthetic data, combined with class-balancing and instance-specific learning rates, substantially improves classification results (+15.1 points in F_1-score). Using only training data retrieved from related datasets by automatically labeling them for validity and novelty, combined with synthetic data, outperforms the baseline by 11.5 points in F_1-score.",
