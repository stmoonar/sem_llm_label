            "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently enjoyed great success as an efficient self-supervised representation learning approach. However, the existing methods have focused on designing of contrastive modes and used data augmentation with a rigid and inefficient one-to-one sampling strategy. We adopted node neighborhoods to extend positive samplings and made avoided resorting to data augmentation to create different views. We also considered the homophily problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between the inter-class node pairs. The key novelty of our method hinged upon analyzing this GNNs problem and integrating the GCL sampling strategy with homophily discrimination, where we solved these two significant problems using one approach. We introduced a new parameterized neighbor sampling component to replace the conventional sub-optimal samplings. By keeping and updating the neighbor sets, both the positive sampling of GCL and the message passing of GNNs can be optimized. Moreover, we theoretically proved that the new method provided a lower bound of mutual information for unsupervised semantic learning, and it can also keep the lower bound with downstream tasks. In essence, our method is a new self-supervised approach, which we refer to as group discrimination, and it can make the downstream fine-tuning efficient. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the new method can significantly outperform the existing GCL methods because the former can solve the homophily problem in a self-supervised",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant success in graph representation learning and become the go-to approach for many graph-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness, the performance of GNNs is known to decline gradually as the number of layers increases. This attenuation is mainly caused by noise propagation, which refers to the useless or negative information propagated (directly or indirectly) from other nodes during the multi-layer graph convolution for node representation learning. This noise increases more severely as the layers of GNNs deepen, which is also a main reason of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a new convolution strategy for GNNs to address this problem via suppressing the noise propagation. Specifically, we first find that the feature propagation process of GNNs can be taken as a Markov chain. And then, based on the idea of Markov clustering, we introduce a new graph inflation layer (i.e., using a power function over the distribution) into GNNs to prevent noise propagating from local neighbourhoods to the whole graph with the increase of network layers. Our method is simple in design, which does not require any changes on the original basis and therefore can be easily extended. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world networks and have a stable improved performance as the network depth increases over existing GNNs.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, with the exponentially growth of information, more and more recommendation systems are used for commercial purpose. Among all kinds of recommendation systems, Collaborative Filtering-based Recommender is the most popular one. It is used in a wide range of music recommendation systems and its accuracy is pretty high. However, it is hard for this kind of recommender to find novel things. In this paper, we propose a graph-based novel framework of music recommendation which creates the preference directed graph and the positive correlation undirected graph. With the combination of two graphs, use entropy to get an accurate and novel list. Finally, we compare a traditional collaborative filter algorithm\u2013UBCF with our graph-based novel algorithm\u2013PPGB on the dataset provided by Douban Music. The result shows that PPGB has made great progress.",
