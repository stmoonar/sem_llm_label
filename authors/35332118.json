            "abstract": "In this work, we study diversity-aware clustering problems where the data points are associated with multiple attributes resulting in intersecting groups. A clustering solution need to ensure that a minimum number of cluster centers are chosen from each group while simultaneously minimizing the clustering objective, which can be either $k$-median, $k$-means or $k$-supplier. We present parameterized approximation algorithms with approximation ratios $1+ \\frac{2}{e}$, $1+\\frac{8}{e}$ and $3$ for diversity-aware $k$-median, diversity-aware $k$-means and diversity-aware $k$-supplier, respectively. The approximation ratios are tight assuming Gap-ETH and FPT $\\neq$ W[2]. For fair $k$-median and fair $k$-means with disjoint faicility groups, we present parameterized approximation algorithm with approximation ratios $1+\\frac{2}{e}$ and $1+\\frac{8}{e}$, respectively. For fair $k$-supplier with disjoint facility groups, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with factor $3$, improving the previous best known approximation ratio of factor $5$.",

            "title": "A Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm for Reconciliation k-Median",
            "abstract": "In the reconciliation k -median problem we ask to cluster a set of data points by picking k cluster centers so as to minimize the sum of distances of the data points to their cluster centers plus the sum of pairwise distances between the centers. The problem, which is a variant of classic k -median, aims to \ufb01nd a set of cluster centers that are not too far from each other, and it has applications, for example, when selecting a committee to de-liberate on a controversial topic. This problem was introduced recently (Ordozgoiti and Gionis, 2019), and it was shown that a local-search-based algorithm is always within a factor O ( k ) of an optimum solution and performs well in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a close connection of reconciliation k -median to a variant of the k - facility location problem , in which each potential cluster center has an individual opening cost and we aim at minimizing the sum of client-center distances and the opening costs. This connection enables us to provide a new algorithm for reconciliation k -median that yields a constant-factor approximation (independent of k ). We also provide a sparsi\ufb01cation scheme that reduces the number of potential cluster centers to O ( k ) in order to substantially speed up approximation algorithms. We empirically compare our new algorithms with the previous local-search approach, showing improved performance and stability. In addition, we show how our sparsi\ufb01cation approach helps to reduce computation time without signi\ufb01cantly",

            "title": "Fair Column Subset Selection",
            "abstract": "The problem of column subset selection asks for a subset of columns from an input matrix such that the matrix can be reconstructed as accurately as possible within the span of the selected columns. A natural extension is to consider a setting where the matrix rows are partitioned into two groups, and the goal is to choose a subset of columns that minimizes the maximum reconstruction error of both groups, relative to their respective best rank-k approximation. Extending the known results of column subset selection to this fair setting is not straightforward: in certain scenarios it is unavoidable to choose columns separately for each group, resulting in double the expected column count. We propose a deterministic leverage-score sampling strategy for the fair setting and show that sampling a column subset of minimum size becomes NP-hard in the presence of two groups. Despite these negative results, we give an approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within 1.5 times the optimal solution size. We also present practical heuristic algorithms based on rank-revealing QR factorization. Finally, we validate our methods through an extensive set of experiments using real-world data.",

            "abstract": "In problems involving matrix computations, the concept of leverage has found a large number of applications. In particular, leverage scores, which relate the columns of a matrix to the subspaces spanned by its leading singular vectors, are helpful in revealing column subsets to approximately factorize a matrix with quality guarantees. As such, they provide a solid foundation for a variety of machine-learning methods. In this paper we extend the definition of leverage scores to relate the columns of a matrix to arbitrary subsets of singular vectors. We establish a precise connection between column and singular-vector subsets, by relating the concepts of leverage scores and principal angles between subspaces. We employ this result to design approximation algorithms with provable guarantees for two well-known problems: generalized column subset selection and sparse canonical correlation analysis. We run numerical experiments to provide further insight on the proposed methods. The novel bounds we derive improve our understanding of fundamental concepts in matrix approximations. In addition, our insights may serve as building blocks for further contributions.",

We investigate the fixed-parameter tractability of these problems and show several negative hardness and inapproximability results, even when we afford exponential running time with respect to some parameters. Motivated by these results we identify natural parameters of the problem, and present fixed-parameter approximation algorithms with approximation ratios (1 + 2 over e + \u2208) and (1 + 8 over e + \u2208) for diversity-aware k-median and diversity-aware k-means respectively, and argue that these ratios are essentially tight assuming the gap-exponential time hypothesis. We also present a simple and more practical bicriteria approximation algorithm with better running time bounds. We finally propose efficient and practical heuristics. We evaluate the scalability and effectiveness of our methods in a wide variety of rigorously conducted experiments, on both real and synthetic data.",

            "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction techniques can be employed to produce robust, cost-effective predictive models, and to enhance interpretability in exploratory data analysis. However, the models produced by many of these methods are formulated in terms of abstract factors or are too high-dimensional to facilitate insight and fit within low computational budgets. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to interpretable dimensionality reduction. Given a data matrix, we study the following question: are there subsets of variables that can be primarily explained by a single factor? We formulate this challenge as the problem of finding submatrices close to rank one. Despite its potential, this topic has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature, and there exist virtually no algorithms for this purpose that are simultaneously effective, efficient and scalable. We formalize the task as two problems which we characterize in terms of computational complexity, and propose efficient, scalable algorithms with approximation guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate how our approach can produce insightful findings in data, and show our algorithms to be superior to strong baselines.",

            "abstract": "Signed networks transform the information encoded by conventional graphs by attaching either a positive or a negative sign to every edge. This subtle modification vastly enhances the modelling capabilities of graphs. For instance, in a social network, where edges might represent interactions between users, the sign may determine whether an exchange was friendly or hostile. However, the introduction of edge signs invalidates many established methods and results from the graph-mining toolbox, and thus, problem formulations and algorithmic techniques must be studied anew. In this tutorial we aim to provide an overview of the literature in mining signed networks. We will present the most important theoretical results since their inception to the present day, we will discuss some of the most common applications, and we will reflect on emerging applications and directions for future work.",

            "abstract": "Signed networks are graphs whose edges are labelled with either a positive or a negative sign, and can be used to capture nuances in interactions that are missed by their unsigned counterparts. The concept of balance in signed graph theory determines whether a network can be partitioned into two perfectly opposing subsets, and is therefore useful for modelling phenomena such as the existence of polarized communities in social networks. While determining whether a graph is balanced is easy, finding a large balanced subgraph is hard. The few heuristics available in the literature for this purpose are either ineffective or non-scalable. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for finding large balanced subgraphs in signed networks. The algorithm relies on signed spectral theory and a novel bound for perturbations of the graph Laplacian. In a wide variety of experiments on real-world data we show that our algorithm can find balanced subgraphs much larger than those detected by existing methods, and in addition, it is faster. We test its scalability on graphs of up to 34 million edges.",
