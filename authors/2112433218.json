            "title": "FAIR Research Object Assessment: A landscape analysis",
            "abstract": ". Research Objects (ROs) are becoming a popular means to capture the context and research artefacts associated with a research investigation in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. However, it is unclear how well ROs themselves adhere to the FAIR (find-able, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles. In this work, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the FAIR assessment of more than 2500 ROs across multiple disciplines. Our work integrates FAIROs, our existing RO evaluation service, in the ROHub platform. We discuss the challenges of calculating the FAIR assessment of aggregations of resources, and how we supplement the FAIROs tests with information from the RO-Crate descriptor file generated by ROHub.",

            "abstract": "PurposeCitizen Science \u2013 public participation in scientific projects \u2013 is becoming a global practice engaging volunteer participants, often non-scientists, with scientific research. Citizen Science is facing major challenges, such as quality and consistency, to reap open the full potential of its outputs and outcomes, including data, software and results. In this context, the principles put forth by Data Science and Open Science domains are essential for alleviating these challenges, which have been addressed at length in these domains. The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which Citizen Science initiatives capitalise on Data Science and Open Science principles.Design/methodology/approachThe authors analysed 48 Citizen Science projects related to pollution and its effects. They compared each project against a set of Data Science and Open Science indicators, exploring how each project defines, collects, analyses and exploits data to present results and contribute to knowledge.FindingsThe results indicate several shortcomings with respect to commonly accepted Data Science principles, including lack of a clear definition of research problems and limited description of data management and analysis processes, and Open Science principles, including lack of the necessary contextual information for reusing project outcomes.Originality/valueIn the light of this analysis, the authors provide a set of guidelines and recommendations for better adoption of Data Science and Open Science principles in Citizen Science projects, and introduce a software tool to support this adoption, with a focus on preparation of data management plans in Citizen Science projects.",

            "abstract": "FarolApp is a mobile web application that aims to increase the awareness of light pollution by generating illustrative maps for cities and by encouraging citizens and public administrations to provide street light information in an ubiquitous and interactive way using online street views. In addition to the maps, FarolApp builds on existing sources to generate and provide up-to-date data by crowdsourced user annotations. Generated data is available as dereferenceable Linked Data resources in several RDF formats and via a queryable SPARQL endpoint. We propose Live Linked Data, a new approach to publish data about city infrastructures trying to keep them synchronized leveraging the collaboration of citizens. The demo presented in this paper illustrates how FarolApp maintains continuously evolving Linked Data that reflect the current status of city street light infrastructures and use that data to generate light pollution maps.",
