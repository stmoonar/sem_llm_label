            "abstract": "Synchronization is a prominent phenomenon in coupled chaotic systems. The master stability function (MSF) is an approach that offers the prerequisites for the stability of complete synchronization, which is dependent on the coupling configuration. In this paper, some basic chaotic systems with the general form of the Sprott-A, Sprott-B, Sprott-D, Sprott-F, Sprott-G, Sprott-O, and Jerk systems are considered. For each system, their parametric form is designed, and constraints required to have similar MSFs in different coupling schemes are determined. Then, the parameters of the designed chaotic systems are found through an exhaustive computer search seeking chaotic solutions. The simplest cases found in this way are introduced, and similar synchronization patterns are confirmed numerically.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining the master stability function is a well-known approach to study the synchronization in networks of chaotic oscillators. This method considers a normalized coupling parameter which allows for a separation of network topology and local dynamics of the nodes. The present study aims to understand how the dynamics of oscillators affect the master stability function. In order to examine the effect of various characteristics of oscillators, a flexible oscillator with adjustable amplitude, Lyapunov exponent, and Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension is used. Not surprisingly, it is demonstrated that the amplitude of the oscillations has no substantial effect on the master stability function, i.e. the coupling strength needed for the complete synchronization is not changed. However, the flexible oscillators with larger maximal Lyapunov exponent synchronize with larger coupling strength. Interestingly, it is shown that there is no linear connection between the Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension and coupling strength needed for complete synchronization.",

            "abstract": "Equilibria are a class of attractors that host inherent stability in a dynamic system. Infinite number of equilibria and chaos sometimes coexist in a system with some connections. Hidden chaotic attractors exist independent of any equilibria rather than being excited by them. However, the equilibria can modify, distort, eliminate, or even instead coexist with the chaotic attractor depending on the distance between the equilibria and chaotic attractor. In this paper, chaotic systems with infinitely many equilibria are considered and explored. Extra surfaces of equilibria are introduced into the chaotic flows, showing that a chaotic system can maintain its basic dynamics if the newly added equilibria do not intersect the original attractor. The offset-boostable plane of equilibria rescales the frequency of the chaotic oscillation with an almost linearly modified largest Lyapunov exponent or conversely drives the system into periodic oscillation, even ending in a divergent state. Furthermore, additional infinite number of equilibria or even a solid space of equilibria are safely nested into the chaotic system without destroying the original dynamics, which provides an alternate permanent location for a dynamical system. A circuit simulation agrees with the numerical calculation.",

            "abstract": "Exploring and establishing artificial neural networks with electrophysiological characteristics and high computational efficiency is a popular topic that has been explored for many years in the fields of pattern recognition and computer vision. Inspired by the working mechanism of the primary visual cortex, pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) can exhibit the characteristics of synchronous oscillation, refractory period, and exponential decay. These characteristics empower the PCNN model to group pixels with similar spatiality and gray values and to process digital images without training. However, electrophysiological evidence shows that the neurons exhibit highly complex nonlinear dynamics when stimulated by external periodic signals. This chaos phenomenon, also known as the \u2018butterfly effect,\u201d cannot be explained by all PCNN models. In this work, we analyze the main obstacle preventing PCNN models from imitating a real primary visual cortex. We consider neuronal excitation as a stochastic process. We then propose a novel neural network of the primary visual cortex, called a continuous-coupled neural network (CCNN). Theoretical analysis indicates that the dynamic behavior of the CCNN is distinct from the PCNN. Numerical results show that the CCNN model exhibits periodic behavior under a DC stimulus, and exhibits chaotic behavior under an AC stimulus, which is consistent with the testing results of primary visual cortex neurons. Furthermore, the image and video processing mechanisms of the CCNN model are analyzed. For image processing tasks, this model encodes the pixel intensity as the frequency of output signals so that it can group pixels with similar gray values. This image processing method can reduce the local gray level difference of the image, and compensate for small local discontinuities in the image. For video processing tasks, the CCNN encodes changing pixels as non-periodic chaotic signals, and it encodes static pixels as periodic signals. It thus achieves the purpose of moving target object recognition by distinguishing the dynamic states corresponding to different neuron clusters in the video. Experimental results on image segmentation indicate that the CCNN model has better performance than the state-of-the-art of visual cortex neural network models.",

Inspired by neuronal conduction characteristics in the primary visual cortex of cats, pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) can exhibit synchronous oscillation behavior, which can process digital images without training. However, according to the study of single cells in the cat primary visual cortex, when a neuron is stimulated by an external periodic signal, the interspike-interval (ISI) distributions represent a multimodal distribution. This phenomenon cannot be explained by all PCNN models. By analyzing the working mechanism of the PCNN, we present a novel neuron model of the primary visual cortex consisting of a continuous-coupled neural network (CCNN). Our model inherited the threshold exponential decay and synchronous pulse oscillation property of the original PCNN model, and it can exhibit chaotic behavior consistent with the testing results of cat primary visual cortex neurons. Therefore, our CCNN model is closer to real visual neural networks. For image segmentation tasks, the algorithm based on CCNN model has better performance than the state-of-art of visual cortex neural network model.

Using mathematical modeling can make experimental tests easier to process and evaluate. It can also help to predict the disease progress and provide a better insight into the virus development. In this study, a new nonlinear differential equation model is introduced to investigate the interaction of the HIV virus with the body immune system. This is a physiological-based model capable of representing complex behaviors. The bifurcation analysis with a variation of activated healthy T cells is carried out. It is shown that the chaotic development of the virus is available for some ranges of activated healthy T cells. This may explain why the virus develops differently in different individuals or under different circumstances. The chaotic region contains some narrow periodic windows, in which the chaotic mode suddenly ends at some critical points, and the system starts a periodic behavior for a tiny range of active healthy T cells. This may indicate the possibility of controllable development of the HIV virus even when it is in the random-like phase of the disease. For more illustration, the system's state space is represented.",
