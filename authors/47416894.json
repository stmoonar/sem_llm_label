            "title": "PAPS: Progressive Attention-Based Pan-sharpening",
            "abstract": "Pan-sharpening aims to seek high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) images from paired multispectral images of low resolution (LRMS) and panchromatic (PAN) images, the key to which is how to maximally integrate spatial and spectral information from PAN and LRMS images. Following the principle of gradual advance, this paper designs a novel network that contains two main logical functions, i.e., detail enhancement and progressive fusion, to solve the problem. More specifically, the detail enhancement module attempts to produce enhanced MS results with the same spatial sizes as corresponding PAN images, which are of higher quality than directly up-sampling LRMS images. Having a better MS base (enhanced MS) and its PAN, we progressively extract information from the PAN and enhanced MS images, expecting to capture pivotal and complementary information of the two modalities for the purpose of constructing the desired HRMS. Extensive experiments together with ablation studies on widely-used datasets are provided to verify the efficacy of our design, and demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

            "abstract": "As human-machine voice interfaces provide easy access to increasingly intelligent machines, many state-of-theart automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are proposed. However, commercial ASR systems usually have poor performance on domain-specific speech especially under low-resource settings. The author works with pre-trained DeepSpeech2 and Wav2Vec2 acoustic models to develop benefit-specific ASR systems. The domainspecific data are collected using proposed semi-supervised learning annotation with little human intervention. The best performance comes from a fine-tuned Wav2Vec2-Large-LV60 acoustic model with an external KenLM, which surpasses the Google and AWS ASR systems on benefit-specific speech. The viability of using error prone ASR transcriptions as part of spoken language understanding (SLU) is also investigated. Results of a benefit-specific natural language understanding (NLU) task show that the domain-specific fine-tuned ASR system can outperform the commercial ASR systems even when its transcriptions have higher word error rate (WER), and the results between fine-tuned ASR and human transcriptions are similar",

            "title": "Bilinear Mixed-Effects Models for Affiliation Networks",
            "abstract": "An affiliation network is a particular type of two-mode social network that consists of a set of `actors' and a set of `events' where ties indicate an actor's participation in an event. Although networks describe a variety of consequential social structures, statistical methods for studying affiliation networks are less well developed than methods for studying one-mode, or actor-actor, networks. One way to analyze affiliation networks is to consider one-mode network matrices that are derived from an affiliation network, but this approach may lead to the loss of important structural features of the data. The most comprehensive approach is to study both actors and events simultaneously. In this paper, we extend the bilinear mixed-effects model, a type of latent space model developed for one-mode networks, to the affiliation network setting by considering the dependence patterns in the interactions between actors and events and describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference. We use our model to explore patterns in extracurricular activity membership of students in a racially-diverse high school in a Midwestern metropolitan area. Using techniques from spatial point pattern analysis, we show how our model can provide insight into patterns of racial segregation in the voluntary extracurricular activity participation profiles of adolescents.",
