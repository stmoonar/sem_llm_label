It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "Significance Gene fusions are tumor-specific genomic aberrations and are among the most powerful biomarkers and drug targets in translational cancer biology. The advent of RNA-sequencing technologies over the last decade has provided a unique opportunity for detecting novel fusions via deploying computational algorithms on public sequencing databases. However, precise fusion detection algorithms are still out of reach. We develop Data-Enriched Efficient PrEcise STatistical fusion detection (DEEPEST), a highly specific and efficient statistical pipeline specially designed for mining massive sequencing databases and apply it to all 33 tumor types and 10,500 samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We systematically profile the landscape of detected fusions via classic statistical models and identify several signatures of selection for fusions in tumors. The extent to which gene fusions function as drivers of cancer remains a critical open question. Current algorithms do not sufficiently identify false-positive fusions arising during library preparation, sequencing, and alignment. Here, we introduce Data-Enriched Efficient PrEcise STatistical fusion detection (DEEPEST), an algorithm that uses statistical modeling to minimize false-positives while increasing the sensitivity of fusion detection. In 9,946 tumor RNA-sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 33 tumor types, DEEPEST identifies 31,007 fusions, 30% more than identified by other methods, while calling 10-fold fewer false-positive fusions in nontransformed human tissues. We leverage the increased precision of DEEPEST to discover fundamental cancer biology. Namely, 888 candidate oncogenes are identified based on overrepresentation in DEEPEST calls, and 1,078 previously unreported fusions involving long intergenic noncoding RNAs, demonstrating a previously unappreciated prevalence and potential for function. DEEPEST also reveals a high enrichment for fusions involving oncogenes in cancers, including ovarian cancer, which has had minimal treatment advances in recent decades, finding that more than 50% of tumors harbor gene fusions predicted to be oncogenic. Specific protein domains are enriched in DEEPEST calls, indicating a global selection for fusion functionality: kinase domains are nearly 2-fold more enriched in DEEPEST calls than expected by chance, as are domains involved in (anaerobic) metabolism and DNA binding. The statistical algorithms, population-level analytic framework, and the biological conclusions of DEEPEST call for increased attention to gene fusions as drivers of cancer and for future research into using fusions for targeted therapy.",

            "abstract": "The advent of next generation sequencing has accelerated the generation of genomic data and created a need for methodologies to organize, share, and analyze large volumes of data. To date, petabytes of multi-dimensional information from thousands of patients have been collected. Access and analysis of this information becomes increasingly challenging as the amount of data grows. This difficulty is exemplified when we consider data generated by the efforts of The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) network, which encompasses more than 2.5 petabytes. Historically, downloading the complete TCGA repository can require several weeks with a highly optimized network connection and access to large institutional compute clusters to perform integrated analysis, which is out of reach for many researchers. The Cancer Cloud Pilot project seeks to directly address these challenges by co-localizing data with the computational resources to analyze it where researchers can access it securely and easily. The project was born out of the recognition that conducting biological research is increasingly computationally-intensive and new approaches are required to support effective data discovery, storage, computation, and collaboration. Funded by the National Cancer Institute, the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) enables researchers to leverage the power of cloud computing to gain actionable insights about cancer biology and human genetics from massive public datasets including TCGA and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia on the CGC. Our approach to create a cancer cloud platform includes collaborative tools, security permissions, data harmonization, and making the data easier to query through the use of metadata curation, resource description frameworks, and visual tools. Additionally, we implemented the Common Workflow Language, an emerging standard for describing computational workflows, to support computational reproducibility. To date, more than 1200 researchers have accessed and analyzed TCGA and analyzed more than 50000 samples on the CGC since its launch in February 2016. In addition to the motivation, inception, and development of the CGC, we will present a case study on the application of unsupervised learning methods to identify individual cell types within tumors using RNA Sequencing data from TCGA cohorts. We will demonstrate how these computationally-intensive methods are benefited by the cloud and how researchers can apply open pipelines to interrogate cancer subtypes and mixed cell populations from TCGA data on their own data.

            "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nUltra-high-throughput sequencing produces duplicate and near-duplicate reads, which can consume computational resources in downstream applications. A tool that collapses such reads should reduce storage and assembly complications and costs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe developed Fulcrum to collapse identical and near-identical Illumina and 454 reads (such as those from PCR clones) into single error-corrected sequences; it can process paired-end as well as single-end reads. Fulcrum is customizable and can be deployed on a single machine, a local network or a commercially available MapReduce cluster, and it has been optimized to maximize ease-of-use, cross-platform compatibility and future scalability. Sequence datasets have been collapsed by up to 71%, and the reduced number and improved quality of the resulting sequences allow assemblers to produce longer contigs while using less memory.",
