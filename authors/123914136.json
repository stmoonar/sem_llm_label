            "title": "Overtaking Path Planning for CAV Based on Improved Artificial Potential Field",
            "abstract": "Overtaking path planning is a key technology for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, existing path planning methods have limitations, such as safety and comfort. This study proposes a driving potential field model to improve the autonomy, safety, and comfort of CAVs during overtaking. The method builds an improved gravitational and repulsive potential field by considering the relative velocity and relative acceleration of the CAV and the leading vehicle. The influence distances of the forces are also specified to make the magnitude of the forces more specific. Road boundary potential fields are also established to regulate the driving area of the CAV. The overtaking path planning algorithm is tested by co-simulation of MATLAB/Simulink, CarSim, and PreScan based on four existing overtaking scenarios in the Chongqing Inner Ring Expressway. The results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the curvature of the overtaking path by 62.69%, 83.86%, 85.07%, and 91.18%, respectively, compared to the traditional artificial potential field method. The lateral acceleration is also significantly reduced by 36.33%, 62.97%, 45.77%, and 53.38%, respectively, in different overtaking scenarios. The lateral acceleration is less than 0.13 m/s2 in all cases. Overall, the proposed algorithm is effective in improving overtaking path planning in terms of safety, efficiency, and comfort.",

            "title": "CONDA: a CONtextual Dual-Annotated dataset for in-game toxicity understanding and detection",
            "abstract": "Traditional toxicity detection models have focused on the single utterance level without deeper understanding of context. We introduce CONDA, a new dataset for in-game toxic language detection enabling joint intent classification and slot filling analysis, which is the core task of Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances from 12K conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed Dota 2 matches. We propose a robust dual semantic-level toxicity framework, which handles utterance and token-level patterns, and rich contextual chatting history. Accompanying the dataset is a thorough in-game toxicity analysis, which provides comprehensive understanding of context at utterance, token, and dual levels. Inspired by NLU, we also apply its metrics to the toxicity detection tasks for assessing toxicity and game-specific aspects. We evaluate strong NLU models on CONDA, providing fine-grained results for different intent classes and slot classes. Furthermore, we examine the coverage of toxicity nature in our dataset by comparing it with other toxicity datasets.",

            "abstract": "LEO satellite networks have many advantages, such as global coverage and short latency, which play a crucial role in the future global communications. Under the tide of the Internet of Things, LEO satellite networks, as an effective means of connecting remote regions, will become indispensable pillars in the integrated system of the Internet of Things. In LEO satellite communication systems, routing have always been a big challenge due to the relative motion of satellites. The K shortest route algorithm is a typical one of the routing algorithms that emerged in recent years. By calculating K shortest path routes, an optional route set is formed, and then the best route is determined by the route selection strategy. For the massiveness and suddenness of the IoT terminals, the original K Shortest path algorithm cannot balance the load, resulting in partial link congestion affecting the overall system performance. In this paper, the route selection strategy of K Shortest path is improved by the routing strategy of the algorithm, and the rerouting process is added. Under the Iridium constellation, the packet loss rate, throughput and delay of the shortest path algorithm after the improvement are analyzed. The results show that the improved algorithm can effectively reduce the packet loss rate and improve the link utilization and throughput of the system.",
