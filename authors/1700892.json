            "abstract": "The exclusive properties of RAW data have shown great potential for low-light image enhancement. Nevertheless, the performance is bottlenecked by the inherent limitations of existing architectures in both single-stage and multi-stage methods. Mixed mapping across two different domains, noise-to-clean and RAW-to-sRGB, misleads the single-stage methods due to the domain ambiguity. The multi-stage methods propagate the information merely through the resulting image of each stage, neglecting the abundant features in the lossy image-level dataflow. In this paper, we probe a generalized solution to these bottlenecks and propose a Decouple aNd Feedback framework, abbreviated as DNF. To mitigate the domain ambiguity, domain-specific subtasks are decoupled, along with fully utilizing the unique properties in RAW and sRGB domains. The feature propagation across stages with a feedback mechanism avoids the information loss caused by image-level dataflow. The two key insights of our method resolve the inherent limitations of RAW data-based low-light image enhancement satisfactorily, empowering our method to outperform the previous state-of-the-art method by a large margin with only 19% parameters, achieving 0.97dB and 1.30dB PSNR improvements on the Sony and Fuji subsets of SID.",

            "abstract": "We consider contextual bandit problems with knapsacks [CBwK], a problem where at each round, a scalar reward is obtained and vector-valued costs are suffered. The learner aims to maximize the cumulative rewards while ensuring that the cumulative costs are lower than some predetermined cost constraints. We assume that contexts come from a continuous set, that costs can be signed, and that the expected reward and cost functions, while unknown, may be uniformly estimated -- a typical assumption in the literature. In this setting, total cost constraints had so far to be at least of order $T^{3/4}$, where $T$ is the number of rounds, and were even typically assumed to depend linearly on $T$. We are however motivated to use CBwK to impose a fairness constraint of equalized average costs between groups: the budget associated with the corresponding cost constraints should be as close as possible to the natural deviations, of order $\\sqrt{T}$. To that end, we introduce a dual strategy based on projected-gradient-descent updates, that is able to deal with total-cost constraints of the order of $\\sqrt{T}$ up to poly-logarithmic terms. This strategy is more direct and simpler than existing strategies in the literature. It relies on a careful, adaptive, tuning of the step size.",

            "abstract": "Non-Gaussian impulsive noise in marine environments strongly influences the detection of weak spectral lines. However, existing detection algorithms based on the Gaussian noise model are futile under non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Therefore, a deep-learning method called AINP+LR-DRNet is proposed for joint detection and the reconstruction of weak spectral lines. First, non-Gaussian impulsive noise suppression was performed by an impulsive noise preprocessor (AINP). Second, a special detection and reconstruction network (DRNet) was proposed. An end-to-end training application learns to detect and reconstruct weak spectral lines by adding into an adaptive weighted loss function based on dual classification. Finally, a spectral line-detection algorithm based on DRNet (LR-DRNet) was proposed to improve the detection performance. The simulation indicated that the proposed AINP+LR-DRNet can detect and reconstruct weak spectral line features under non-Gaussian impulsive noise, even for a mixed signal-to-noise ratio as low as \u221226 dB. The performance of the proposed method was validated using experimental data. The proposed AINP+LR-DRNet detects and reconstructs spectral lines under strong background noise and interference with better reliability than other algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Previous works have shown that increasing the window size for Transformer-based image super-resolution models (e.g., SwinIR) can significantly improve the model performance. Still, the computation overhead is also considerable when the window size gradually increases. In this paper, we present SRFormer, a simple but novel method that can enjoy the benefit of large window self-attention but introduces even less computational burden. The core of our SRFormer is the permuted self-attention (PSA), which strikes an appropriate balance between the channel and spatial information for self-attention. Without any bells and whistles, we show that our SRFormer achieves a 33.86dB PSNR score on the Urban100 dataset, which is 0.46dB higher than that of SwinIR but uses fewer parameters and computations. In addition, we also attempt to scale up the model by further enlarging the window size and channel numbers to explore the potential of Transformer-based models. Experiments show that our scaled model, named SRFormerV2, can further improve the results and achieves state-of-the-art. We hope our simple and effective approach could be useful for future research in super-resolution model design. The homepage is https://z-yupeng.github.io/SRFormer/.",

            "abstract": "Pioneering efforts well studied the deformation decomposition of single earthquake using a pair of ascending (ASC) and descending (DES) track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. However, deformation decomposition of sequent events is rarely discussed and hard to implement. That's because it's hard to ensure deformations related to each earthquake can be recorded by a pair of ASC and DES track data. Three sequent earthquakes (Mw>5.5) just hit Central Greece in March 2021, and this earthquake sequence provides us with a perfect case to study 2-D (east-west and up-down) deformation decomposition when the mentioned premise cannot be satisfied. In this context, we proposed a Multi-track and Multi-temporal 2-D (MTMT2-D) method. Its novelty and behind rationale are to decompose 2-D deformations of each event through fusing multitrack and multitemporal interferograms. Based on the decomposed deformations, we invert the slip distribution of three earthquakes respectively. We found that the decomposed deformations can better constrain the fault geometry than the single InSAR interferogram. Furthermore, our geodetic inversion results also suggest a domino-like triggering rupture process for this earthquake sequence. It indicates that our MTMT2-D method can potentially reveal more details about earthquake sequence.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau contains a large number of mountain glaciers with clean surfaces, where englacial debris is generally entrained by the ice flow and exposed at the glacier margins. The long-term observation on one of the typical clean surface glaciers (the Qiyi Glacier, northern Tibetan Plateau) suggests an early emergence of englacial debris on its transport pathway, with accelerated surface melting from the mid-2000s onwards. Given that the englacial debris layers of the tongue part of Qiyi Glacier are approximately parallel to the glacier surface, the continuing melting might be expected to result in the rapid expansion of exposed debris. Compared with the clean surface ice, debris cover at the same elevation reduced glacier mass loss by ~25.4% during a hydrological year (2020\u20132021), indicating that the early emergence of englacial debris can protect the glacier from climate warming with prolonged life expectance. As such, future glacial runoff will then reach its peak earlier and be followed by a gentler decreasing trend than model projections with constant clean surface ice. These findings imply that the emerging debris on clean surface glacier may mitigate the glacial-runoff risk, which has so far been neglected in projections of future water supplies.",

            "abstract": "Accurate polyp detection is essential for assisting clinical rectal cancer diagnoses. Colonoscopy videos contain richer information than still images, making them a valuable resource for deep learning methods. Great efforts have been made to conduct video polyp detection through multi-frame temporal/spatial aggregation. However, unlike common fixed-camera video, the camera-moving scene in colonoscopy videos can cause rapid video jitters, leading to unstable training for existing video detection models. Additionally, the concealed nature of some polyps and the complex background environment further hinder the performance of existing video detectors. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{YONA} (\\textbf{Y}ou \\textbf{O}nly \\textbf{N}eed one \\textbf{A}djacent Reference-frame) method, an efficient end-to-end training framework for video polyp detection. YONA fully exploits the information of one previous adjacent frame and conducts polyp detection on the current frame without multi-frame collaborations. Specifically, for the foreground, YONA adaptively aligns the current frame's channel activation patterns with its adjacent reference frames according to their foreground similarity. For the background, YONA conducts background dynamic alignment guided by inter-frame difference to eliminate the invalid features produced by drastic spatial jitters. Moreover, YONA applies cross-frame contrastive learning during training, leveraging the ground truth bounding box to improve the model's perception of polyp and background. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed YONA outperforms previous state-of-the-art competitors by a large margin in both accuracy and speed.",

            "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish. Remarkably, the dataset can help us enhance personalization and understanding of user preferences, which can benefit various existing tasks as well as enable new tasks. To test the potential of the dataset, we introduce three tasks in this work: (1) next-product recommendation, (2) next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and (3) next-product title generation. With the above tasks, we benchmark a range of algorithms on our proposed dataset, drawing new insights for further research and practice. In addition, based on the proposed dataset and tasks, we hosted a competition in the KDD CUP 2023 and have attracted thousands of users and submissions. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://kddcup23.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "Closed mining areas are an important potential resource, and rational use of them are critical to implementing sustainable development strategies. To guide the more reasonable development and utilization of the closed mining areas, we proposed a method of surface deformation monitoring and subsidence risk assessment of the closed mining areas with SBAS-InSAR technology. Based on the analysis of deformation, a risk assessment model integrating subsidence hazard and subsidence vulnerability was proposed. Subsidence hazard include accumulate deformation and the subsidence rate of the last year. The tunnels and the land use types are used to assess the subsidence vulnerability. This method can achieve deformation monitoring and risk assessment of the closed mining areas, and the proposed method is validated by taking the Nanzhuang mining areas as an example. The results showed that the main subsidence areas in the closed mining areas are located in the tunnel in the southwest and the gangue pile area in the northeast of the mining areas, while the deformation in the vegetation-rich forested area is low. The area of low, medium and high subsidence risk zones is 65.5%, 27.8% and 6.7% respectively.",

            "title": "Combining Reinforcement Learning and Barrier Functions for Adaptive Risk Management in Portfolio Optimization",
            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) based investment strategies have been widely adopted in portfolio management (PM) in recent years. Nevertheless, most RL-based approaches may often emphasize on pursuing returns while ignoring the risks of the underlying trading strategies that may potentially lead to great losses especially under high market volatility. Therefore, a risk-manageable PM investment framework integrating both RL and barrier functions (BF) is proposed to carefully balance the needs for high returns and acceptable risk exposure in PM applications. Up to our understanding, this work represents the first attempt to combine BF and RL for financial applications. While the involved RL approach may aggressively search for more profitable trading strategies, the BF-based risk controller will continuously monitor the market states to dynamically adjust the investment portfolio as a controllable measure for avoiding potential losses particularly in downtrend markets. Additionally, two adaptive mechanisms are provided to dynamically adjust the impact of risk controllers such that the proposed framework can be flexibly adapted to uptrend and downtrend markets. The empirical results of our proposed framework clearly reveal such advantages against most well-known RL-based approaches on real-world data sets. More importantly, our proposed framework shed lights on many possible directions for future investigation.",
