            "abstract": "Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) is a common radar imaging technique used to characterize and classify non-cooperative targets. Traditional classification approaches use geometric features extracted from the images of known targets to form a training dataset that is later used to classify an unknown target. While these approaches work reasonably well, deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated significant improvements over conventional processing schemes in many areas of radar. However, the application of ISAR image classification is difficult when there are only small training datasets available. In this article, we address the small dataset problem by utilizing transfer learning. Different approaches are considered that can take advantage of the ship aspect angle to improve the overall stability and improve the final classification result. The new classification results are then compared with a traditional classification approach and a simple three-layer convolutional neural network. In addition, to better understand how the neural networks are working, saliency maps are used to visualize the trained network.",

            "abstract": "Users\u2019 purchase behaviors are complex and dynamic, which are usually driven by various personal demands evolving with time. According to psychology and economic theories, user demands can be satisfied with a sequence of purchase behaviors, resulting in a basket of items. However, most of the existing works simply predict the next basket from a shallow perspective of (purchase) sequence data modeling without deep insight into the underlying factors which drive user purchase behaviors. In fact, filling a basket with multiple items is a process to incrementally satisfy a user's demand. Therefore, the key challenges to predict a user's next basket lie in (1) how to track the changes of the user's demand, and (2) how to satisfy her demand at a given moment. To this end, we propose an Evolving DEmand SAtisfaction (EvoDESA) model to model a user's demand evolution for next-basket prediction. In EvoDESA, a demand evolution module learns the dynamics of user demand over a sequence of basket-purchase behaviors. Then, a next-basket planning module effectively packs an optimal combination of items to best satisfy the user's current demand. Extensive experiments on three real-world transaction datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of EvoDESA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning models for medical images can help physicians diagnose and manage diseases. However, due to the fact that medical image annotation requires a great deal of manpower and expertise, as well as the fact that clinical departments perform image annotation based on task orientation, there is the problem of having fewer medical image annotation data with more unlabeled data and having many datasets that annotate only a single organ. In this paper, we present UniMOS, the first universal framework for achieving the utilization of fully and partially labeled images as well as unlabeled images. Specifically, we construct a Multi-Organ Segmentation (MOS) module over fully/partially labeled data as the basenet and designed a new target adaptive loss. Furthermore, we incorporate a semi-supervised training module that combines consistent regularization and pseudo-labeling techniques on unlabeled data, which significantly improves the segmentation of unlabeled data. Experiments show that the framework exhibits excellent performance in several medical image segmentation tasks compared to other advanced methods, and also significantly improves data utilization and reduces annotation cost.

            "abstract": "Automatic tumor or lesion segmentation is a crucial step in medical image analysis for computer-aided diagnosis. Although the existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance, many challenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This is because, although the human visual system can detect symmetries in 2-D images effectively, regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, overlooking further inherent symmetries existing in medical images, such as rotations and reflections. To solve this problem, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised on each orientation, which allows it to effectively address the gaps of learning symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks globally equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layer-wise symmetry constraints. Finally, based on our novel framework, extensive experiments conducted on real-world clinical data demonstrate that a group equivariant Res-UNet (called GER-UNet) outperforms its regular CNN-based counterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods in the tasks of hepatic tumor segmentation, COVID-19 lung infection segmentation, and retinal vessel detection. More importantly, the newly built GER-UNet also shows potential in reducing the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters, upgrading current segmentation CNNs, and delineating organs on other medical imaging modalities.",

The output of these systems are probabilistic rules that are easy to understand by humans, since the conditions for consequences lead to predictions that become transparent and interpretable.

            "abstract": "Node scheduling provides an effective way to prolong the network lifetime of Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks comprising of energy-constrained sensor nodes. Barrier scheduling is a special type of node scheduling scheme that targets IoT-based surveillance applications. An efficient barrier scheduling scheme must address the key Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of smart surveillance applications, such as coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency. Moreover, such a scheme must be capable of dynamically adapting its execution strategy in the event of node failures caused due to faults arising out of unexpected battery depletion. This article proposes a fault-tolerant barrier scheduling scheme that satisfies the key QoS requirements of surveillance applications in the event of such faults. The approach is based on a novel fully weighted dynamic graph model. This article suggests two novel heuristics to guarantee fault tolerance and recovery. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance and effectiveness of this scheme with other such approaches.",

However, the existing GPNM methods either need to perform a new GPNM procedure from scratch to deliver the node matching results based on the updated <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$G_P$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"sun-ieq5-3103914.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$G_D$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"sun-ieq6-3103914.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> or incrementally perform the GPNM procedure for each of the updates, leading to low efficiency. Although the elimination relations between updates and partitions of data graphs are considered in the state-of-the-art method, it still suffers from low efficiency as only the labels of nodes are considered in the partitions. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a new method to efficiently deliver the node matching results on the updated graphs. In this paper, we propose a new Partition-aware GPNM algorithm, called P-GPNM, where we propose two new partition methods, i.e., <italic>connection-based partition</italic> and <italic>density-based partition</italic>. In these two methods, P-GPNM considers the dense connections between partitions and the inner connections inside a single partition, respectively. The experimental results on five real-world social graphs demonstrate that our proposed P-GPNM is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art GPNM methods.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless technologies have led to an increased deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for a plethora of diverse surveillance applications such as health, military, and environmental. However, sensor nodes in WSNs usually suffer from short device lifetime due to severe energy constraints and therefore, cannot guarantee to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) needs of various applications. This is proving to be a major hindrance to the widespread adoption of WSNs for such applications. Therefore, to extend the lifetime of WSNs, it is critical to optimize the energy usage in sensor nodes that are often deployed in remote and hostile terrains. To this effect, several energy management schemes have been proposed recently. Node scheduling is one such strategy that can prolong the lifetime of WSNs and also helps to balance the workload among the sensor nodes. In this article, we discuss on the energy management techniques of WSN with a particular emphasis on node scheduling and propose an energy management life-cycle model and an energy conservation pyramid to extend the network lifetime of WSNs. We have provided a detailed classification and evaluation of various node scheduling schemes in terms of their ability to fulfill essential QoS requirements, namely coverage, connectivity, fault tolerance, and security. We considered essential design issues such as network type, deployment pattern, sensing model in the classification process. Furthermore, we have discussed the operational characteristics of schemes with their related merits and demerits. We have compared the efficacy of a few well known graph-based scheduling schemes with suitable performance analysis graph. Finally, we study challenges in designing and implementing node scheduling schemes from a QoS perspective and outline open research problems.",

            "abstract": "Barrier coverage scheduling is an energy conservation scheme in which a subset of sensor nodes with overlapped sensing area (also called barrier) is activated to meet the key Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as energy-efficiency, coverage, and connectivity. However, sudden and unexpected node failures in a barrier due to security attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) poses a challenge for maintaining the desired QoS levels. In this paper, we propose a secure barrier coverage scheduling scheme called <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$SEC^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, which prevents QoS degradation in the event of security breaches. This scheme uses a fully weighted attributed dynamic graph model in which a novel attribute-based weight balancing greedy strategy is used to construct barriers. A weighted averaging-based K-means Spectral, and Hierarchical (WKSH) cluster ensemble scheme is proposed to secure a barrier from malicious attacks. WKSH is a graph-based anomaly detection scheme based on weighted Euclidean distance computation and weighted average consensus. The experimental result shows that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$SEC^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> guarantees the required QoS at all times. Moreover, the proposed WKSH shows better accuracy in the classification and detection of attacks in the barrier.",
