            "abstract": "Federated Learning has emerged as a decentralized method for training machine learning models using distributed data sources. It ensures privacy by allowing clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping their data stored locally. However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with missing modalities in clients\u2019 datasets, where certain features or modalities are unavailable or incomplete, leading to heterogeneous data distribution. Previous studies have addressed this issue, but they fall short in addressing generalizability across diverse, unobserved individuals. This study introduces MIFL, a novel framework for handling modality-missing clients in Multimodal Federated Learning. MIFL utilizes a unique approach, optimizing a client\u2019s local model with existing modalities while incorporating absent modalities from clients. Aggregation of these models is performed through a graph-based attentive aggregation method, maintaining generalized characteristics by updating a global model averaged across clients. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MIFL across various client configurations with statistical heterogeneity, showcasing its potential for addressing the challenge of missing modalities in Federated Learning.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become an integral part of online services due to their ability to help users locate specific information in a sea of data. However, existing studies show that some recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks particularly those that involve learning schemes. A poisoning attack is where an adversary injects carefully crafted data into the process of training a model, with the goal of manipulating the system\u2019s final recommendations. Based on recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), such attacks have gained importance recently. At present, we do not have a full and clear picture of why adversaries mount such attacks, nor do we have comprehensive knowledge of the full capacity to which such attacks can undermine a model or the impacts that might have. While numerous countermeasures to poisoning attacks have been developed, they have not yet been systematically linked to the properties of the attacks. Consequently, assessing the respective risks and potential success of mitigation strategies is difficult, if not impossible. This survey aims to fill this gap by primarily focusing on poisoning attacks and their countermeasures. This is in contrast to prior surveys that mainly focus on attacks and their detection methods. Through an exhaustive literature review, we provide a novel taxonomy for poisoning attacks, formalise its dimensions, and accordingly organise 31 attacks described in the literature. Further, we review 43 countermeasures to detect and/or prevent poisoning attacks, evaluating their effectiveness against specific types of attacks. This comprehensive survey should serve as a point of reference for protecting recommender systems against poisoning attacks. The article concludes with a discussion on open issues in the field and impactful directions for future research. A rich repository of resources associated with poisoning attacks is available at https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-recsys-poisoning.",

            "abstract": "Modern automobiles are equipped with advanced computing capabilities, allowing them to become powerful computing units capable of processing a large amount of data and training machine learning models. However, machine learning algorithms typically require a large centralized dataset, raising concerns about users\u2019 privacy. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that tackles this problem, allowing intelligent vehicles to collaboratively train machine learning models locally without having to compromise their private data. Multiple works have concentrated on applying Federated Learning on Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks with a 3-tier architecture consisting of mobile clients, edge servers, and cloud servers, where the edge server aggregates its local set of clients, and the cloud server aggregates edge servers to learn a global model. This approach helps reduce the expensive communication costs to the far-away cloud server. However, this 3-tier paradigm faces several challenges, a notable one being clients\u2019 constant mobility, leading to regional edges having a fluctuating set of participating clients at each round, which we refer to as distribution drift. This phenomenon introduces instability to the local training process, leading to suboptimal accuracy and convergence. As a solution, we propose a local training process based on the knowledge distillation mechanism. Specifically, we employ the global model and an ensemble of historical regional models from the edge servers as sources of knowledge to guide the local training process, preventing the local models from drifting away from the global knowledge and preserving information from clients that left the region. Experimental results showed that the proposed method helps achieve better performance compared to other baselines.",

            "title": "Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Recommendation Systems",
            "abstract": "Recent advancements in recommender systems have focused on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage their auxiliary information. The core idea of KG-enhanced recommenders is to incorporate rich semantic information for more accurate recommendations. However, two main challenges persist: i) Neglecting complex higher-order interactions in the KG-based user-item network, potentially leading to sub-optimal recommendations, and ii) Dealing with the heterogeneous modalities of input sources, such as user-item bipartite graphs and KGs, which may introduce noise and inaccuracies. To address these issues, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced Heterogeneous Hypergraph Recommender System (KHGRec). KHGRec captures group-wise characteristics of both the interaction network and the KG, modeling complex connections in the KG. Using a collaborative knowledge heterogeneous hypergraph (CKHG), it employs two hypergraph encoders to model group-wise interdependencies and ensure explainability. Additionally, it fuses signals from the input graphs with cross-view self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our model's superiority over various state-of-the-art baselines, with an average 5.18\\% relative improvement. Additional tests on noise resilience, missing data, and cold-start problems demonstrate the robustness of our KHGRec framework. Our model and evaluation datasets are publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/viethungvu1998/KHGRec}.",

            "title": "Fast-FedUL: A Training-Free Federated Unlearning with Provable Skew Resilience",
            "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a compelling machine learning paradigm, prioritizing the protection of privacy for training data. The increasing demand to address issues such as ``the right to be forgotten'' and combat data poisoning attacks highlights the importance of techniques, known as \\textit{unlearning}, which facilitate the removal of specific training data from trained FL models. Despite numerous unlearning methods proposed for centralized learning, they often prove inapplicable to FL due to fundamental differences in the operation of the two learning paradigms. Consequently, unlearning in FL remains in its early stages, presenting several challenges. Many existing unlearning solutions in FL require a costly retraining process, which can be burdensome for clients. Moreover, these methods are primarily validated through experiments, lacking theoretical assurances. In this study, we introduce Fast-FedUL, a tailored unlearning method for FL, which eliminates the need for retraining entirely. Through meticulous analysis of the target client's influence on the global model in each round, we develop an algorithm to systematically remove the impact of the target client from the trained model. In addition to presenting empirical findings, we offer a theoretical analysis delineating the upper bound of our unlearned model and the exact retrained model (the one obtained through retraining using untargeted clients). Experimental results with backdoor attack scenarios indicate that Fast-FedUL effectively removes almost all traces of the target client, while retaining the knowledge of untargeted clients (obtaining a high accuracy of up to 98\\% on the main task). Significantly, Fast-FedUL attains the lowest time complexity, providing a speed that is 1000 times faster than retraining.

            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a method for training machine learning models using distributed data sources. It ensures privacy by allowing clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model while storing their data locally. However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with missing modalities in clients' datasets, where certain features or modalities are unavailable or incomplete, leading to heterogeneous data distribution. While previous studies have addressed the issue of complete-modality missing, they fail to tackle partial-modality missing on account of severe heterogeneity among clients at an instance level, where the pattern of missing data can vary significantly from one sample to another. To tackle this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework named FedMAC, designed to address multi-modality missing under conditions of partial-modality missing in FL. Additionally, to avoid trivial aggregation of multi-modal features, we introduce contrastive-based regularization to impose additional constraints on the latent representation space. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMAC across various client configurations with statistical heterogeneity, outperforming baseline methods by up to 26% in severe missing scenarios, highlighting its potential as a solution for the challenge of partially missing modalities in federated systems.",

            "title": "Network Alignment With Holistic Embeddings",
            "abstract": "Network alignment is the task of identifying topologically and semantically similar nodes across (two) different networks. It plays an important role in various applications ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatic network interactions. However, existing alignment models either cannot handle large-scale graphs or fail to leverage different types of network information or modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end alignment framework that can leverage different modalities to compare and align network nodes in an efficient way. In order to exploit the richness of the network context, our model constructs multiple embeddings for each node, each of which captures one modality or type of network information. We then design a late-fusion mechanism to combine the learned embeddings based on the importance of the underlying information. Our fusion mechanism allows our model to be adapted to various types of structure of the input network. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, while being robust against various noise factors.",

            "title": "Learning Holistic Interactions in LBSNs With High-Order, Dynamic, and Multi-Role Contexts",
            "abstract": "Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have emerged over the past few years. Their exponential network effects depend on the fact that each user can share her daily digital footprints with different communities, in different places, and at different times (for example in the form of check-in activities). Unlike other types of social networks, activities in an LBSN can potentially be performed by several users in a collaborative way. Existing studies of representation learning for LBSNs often consider them as regular graphs and ignore these high-order, dynamic, and multi-role contexts, since their holistic interactions are quite difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a model in which these holistic interactions can be learned and transferred into node embeddings derived from a hypergraph representation and a persona decomposition process. More specifically, the model learns from friendship edges, check-in hyperedges, and node personas at the same time, and devises multiple presentations for each user that reflects their multiple roles in a social context. The embedding learning process also exploits useful patterns such as user co-location and sequential effects through a carefully designed point-of-interest splitting step. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that our model outperforms alternative state-of-the-art embedding methods on friendship and location prediction tasks by an average margin of 45.7% and 29.46%, respectively. We also demonstrate the robustness of our model against adversarial conditions such as structural noise, attribute noise, and hyperparameter sensitivity.",
