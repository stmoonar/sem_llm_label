            "title": "Motif-Consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement for Graph-Level Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph-level anomaly detection is significant in diverse domains. To improve detection performance, counterfactual graphs have been exploited to benefit the generalization capacity by learning causal relations. Most existing studies directly introduce perturbations (e.g., flipping edges) to generate counterfactual graphs, which are prone to alter the semantics of generated examples and make them off the data manifold, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Motif-consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement (MotifCAR), for graph-level anomaly detection. The model combines the motif of one graph, the core subgraph containing the identification (category) information, and the contextual subgraph (non-motif) of another graph to produce a raw counterfactual graph. However, the produced raw graph might be distorted and cannot satisfy the important counterfactual properties: Realism, Validity, Proximity and Sparsity. Towards that, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based graph optimizer to refine the raw counterfactual graphs. It adopts the discriminator to guide the generator to generate graphs close to realistic data, i.e., meet the property Realism. Further, we design the motif consistency to force the motif of the generated graphs to be consistent with the realistic graphs, meeting the property Validity. Also, we devise the contextual loss and connection loss to control the contextual subgraph and the newly added links to meet the properties Proximity and Sparsity. As a result, the model can generate high-quality counterfactual graphs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of MotifCAR.",

Traditional heuristic and statistical approaches often fail to capture the intricate nuances of user intentions, leading to subpar performance. Recent deep-learning methods show attractive accuracy but struggle to generate faithful trajectories that match user intentions. In this work, we propose a DDPM-based incremental knowledge injection module to ensure the faithfulness of the generated trajectories.

            "abstract": "A critical aspect of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is to enhance the node representations by aggregating node neighborhood information. However, when detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53% on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.",

            "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Heterogeneous Representation Learning in POI Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Discovering interesting yet unvisited point-of-interests (POIs) is among the most practical applications but challenging problems in location-based social networks (LBSNs). Popular approaches face several issues, such as data sparsity and difficulties in modeling latent nonlinearity between users and POIs. Furthermore, the uncertainty in LBSNs poses additional obstacles to learning good representations of users\u2019 general and current interests. To effectively address these issues, we postulate that fusing multiple sources of information is paramount. Toward that, we propose a novel deep generative recommender system\u2014Wasserstein autoencoder for POI recommendation (WaPOIR). It unifies the information from users\u2019 personal preference, social influence, and geographical data, and captures users\u2019 general interests from historical check-ins, while modeling users\u2019 current interests from recently visited POIs. Unlike previous methods, WaPOIR learns the latent distribution of data in the Wasserstein space as a potential representation for each POI and each user in LBSNs. This enables simultaneous maintenance of social and POI interactions and modeling the uncertainty of their relationships. WaPOIR is a stochastic recommendation approach that allows Bayesian inference and approximation of variational posterior distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate that WaPOIR achieves better performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy.

            "abstract": "Shortest path (SP) computation is the fundamental operation in various networks such as urban networks, logistic networks, communication networks, social networks, etc. With the development of technology and societal expansions, those networks tend to be massive. This, in turn, causes deteriorated performance of SP computation, and graph partitioning is commonly leveraged to scale up the SP algorithms. However, the partitioned shortest path (PSP) index has never been systematically investigated and theoretically analyzed, and there is a lack of experimental comparison among different PSP indexes. Moreover, few studies have explored PSP index maintenance in dynamic networks. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically analyze the dynamic PSP index by proposing a universal scheme for it. Specifically, we first propose two novel partitioned shortest path strategies (No-boundary and Post-boundary strategies) to improve the performance of PSP indexes and design the corresponding index maintenance approaches to deal with dynamic scenarios. Then we categorize the partition methods from the perspective of partition structure to facilitate the selection of partition methods in the PSP index. Furthermore, we propose a universal scheme for designing the PSP index by coupling its three dimensions (i.e. PSP strategy, partition structure, and SP algorithm). Based on this scheme, we propose five new PSP indexes with prominent performance in either query or update efficiency. Lastly, extensive experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSP scheme, with valuable guidance provided on the PSP index design.",

            "abstract": "Typically, trajectories considered anomalous are the ones deviating from usual (e.g., traffic-dictated) driving patterns. However, this closed-set context fails to recognize the unknown anomalous trajectories, resulting in an insufficient self-motivated learning paradigm. In this study, we investigate the novel Anomalous Trajectory Recognition problem in an Open-world scenario (ATRO) and introduce a novel probabilistic Metric learning model, namely ATROM, to address it. Specifically, ATROM can detect the presence of unknown anomalous behavior in addition to identifying known behavior. It has a Mutual Interaction Distillation that uses contrastive metric learning to explore the interactive semantics regarding the diverse behavioral intents and a Probabilistic Trajectory Embedding that forces the trajectories with distinct behaviors to follow different Gaussian priors. More importantly, ATROM offers a probabilistic metric rule to discriminate between known and unknown behavioral patterns by taking advantage of the approximation of multiple priors. Experimental results on two large-scale trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of ATROM in addressing both known and unknown anomalous patterns.",

            "abstract": "The rising popularity of online social network services has attracted a lot of research focusing on mining various user patterns. Among them, accurate IP geolocation is essential for a plethora of location-aware applications. However, despite extensive research efforts and significant advances, the \"accurate and reliable'' desideratum is yet to be achieved at a higher quality level. This work presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based model, called TrustGeo, for trustworthy street-level IP geolocation. A distinct and important aspect of TrustGeo is the incorporation of sources of uncertainty in the learning process. The results of our extensive experimental evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework in significantly improving the accuracy and trustworthiness of street-level IP geolocation. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ICDM-UESTC/TrustGeo.",

            "title": "Inferring Real Mobility in Presence of Fake Check-ins Data",
            "abstract": "Understanding human mobility has become an important aspect of location-based services in tasks such as personalized recommendation and individual moving pattern recognition, enabled by the large volumes of data from geo-tagged social media (GTSM). Prior studies mainly focus on analyzing human historical footprints collected by GTSM and assuming the veracity of the data, which need not hold when some users are not willing to share their real footprints due to privacy concerns\u2014thereby affecting reliability/authenticity. In this study, we address the problem of Inferring Real Mobility (IRMo) of users, from their unreliable historical traces. Tackling IRMo is a non-trivial task due to the: (1) sparsity of check-in data; (2) suspicious counterfeit check-in behaviors; and (3) unobserved dependencies in human trajectories. To address these issues, we develop a novel Graph-enhanced Attention model called IRMoGA, which attempts to capture underlying mobility patterns and check-in correlations by exploiting the unreliable spatio-temporal data. Specifically, we incorporate the attention mechanism (rather than solely relying on traditional recursive models) to understand the regularity of human mobility, while employing a graph neural network to understand the mutual interactions from human historical check-ins and leveraging prior knowledge to alleviate the inferring bias. Our experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of IRMoGA over several state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., up to 39.16% improvement regarding the Recall score on Foursquare.",
