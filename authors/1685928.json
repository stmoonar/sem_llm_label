            "abstract": "Joint Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (JointNMF) is a hybrid method for mining information from datasets that contain both feature and connection information. We propose distributed-memory parallelizations of three algorithms for solving the JointNMF problem based on Alternating Nonnegative Least Squares, Projected Gradient Descent, and Projected Gauss-Newton. We extend well-known communication-avoiding algorithms using a single processor grid case to our coupled case on two processor grids. We demonstrate the scalability of the algorithms on up to 960 cores (40 nodes) with 60% parallel efficiency. The more sophisticated Alternating Nonnegative Least Squares (ANLS) and Gauss-Newton variants outperform the first-order gradient descent method in reducing the objective on large-scale problems. We perform a topic modelling task on a large corpus of academic papers that consists of over 37 million paper abstracts and nearly a billion citation relationships, demonstrating the utility and scalability of the methods.",

The system, designed to visualize different object types collectively and clearly display their semantic proximity, utilizes a co-embedding technique for knowledge fusion of multi-type data and projects the various types of objects onto a common lower-dimensional space. This produces a more informed representation and visualization that shows both in-type and across-type semantic proximity between objects. The system enables users\u2019 exploration of multi-type document data by providing embedding-based scatter plots to visualize semantic relations within and across object types. In addition, based on user relevance feedback of displayed objects, the system offers recommendations of relevant objects. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system and the underlying embedding method through comparison experiments with the proposed fusion-based approach.",

            "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop topic modeling allows users to explore and steer the process to produce better quality topics that align with their needs. When integrated into visual analytic systems, many existing automated topic modeling algorithms are given interactive parameters to allow users to tune or adjust them. However, this has limitations when the algorithms cannot be easily adapted to changes, and it is difficult to realize interactivity closely supported by underlying algorithms. Instead, we emphasize the concept of tight integration, which advocates for the need to co-develop interactive algorithms and interactive visual analytic systems in parallel to allow flexibility and scalability. In this article, we describe design goals for efficiently and effectively executing the concept of tight integration among computation, visualization, and interaction for hierarchical topic modeling of text data. We propose computational base operations for interactive tasks to achieve the design goals. To instantiate our concept, we present ArchiText, a prototype system for interactive hierarchical topic modeling, which offers fast, flexible, and algorithmically valid analysis via tight integration. Utilizing interactive hierarchical topic modeling, our technique lets users generate, explore, and flexibly steer hierarchical topics to discover more informed topics and their document memberships.",

            "abstract": "Existing tensor factorization methods assume that the input tensor follows some specific distribution (i.e. Poisson, Bernoulli, and Gaussian), and solve the factorization by minimizing some empirical loss functions defined based on the corresponding distribution. However, it suffers from several drawbacks: 1) In reality, the underlying distributions are complicated and unknown, making it infeasible to be approximated by a simple distribution. 2) The correlation across dimensions of the input tensor is not well utilized, leading to sub-optimal performance. Although heuristics were proposed to incorporate such correlation as side information under Gaussian distribution, they can not easily be generalized to other distributions. Thus, a more principled way of utilizing the correlation in tensor factorization models is still an open challenge. Without assuming any explicit distribution, we formulate the tensor factorization as an optimal transport problem with Wasserstein distance, which can handle non-negative inputs. \n \nWe introduce SWIFT, which minimizes the Wasserstein distance that measures the distance between the input tensor and that of the reconstruction. In particular, we define the N-th order tensor Wasserstein loss for the widely used tensor CP factorization and derive the optimization algorithm that minimizes it. By leveraging sparsity structure and different equivalent formulations for optimizing computational efficiency, SWIFT is as scalable as other well-known CP algorithms. Using the factor matrices as features, SWIFT achieves up to 9.65% and 11.31% relative improvement over baselines for downstream prediction tasks. Under the noisy conditions, SWIFT achieves up to 15% and 17% relative improvements over the best competitors for the prediction tasks.",

When incorporating edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW), a weight is associated with each vertex-hyperedge pair, yielding a weighted incidence matrix of the hypergraph. Such weightings have been utilized in term-document representations of text data sets. We explain how random walks with EDVW serve to construct different hypergraph Laplacian matrices, and then develop a suite of clustering methods that use these incidence matrices and Laplacians for hypergraph clustering. Using several data sets from real-life applications, we compare the performance of these clustering algorithms experimentally against a variety of existing hypergraph clustering methods. We show that the proposed methods produce high-quality clusters and conclude by highlighting avenues for future work.",

            "abstract": "Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an effective tool for clustering nonnegative data, either for computing a flat partitioning of a dataset or for determining a hierarchy of similarity. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm for hierarchical clustering that uses a divide-and-conquer approach based on rank-two NMF to split a data set into two cohesive parts. Not only does this approach uncover more structure in the data than a flat NMF clustering, but also rank-two NMF can be computed more quickly than for general ranks, providing comparable overall time to solution. Our data distribution and parallelization strategies are designed to maintain computational load balance throughout the data-dependent hierarchy of computation while limiting interprocess communication, allowing the algorithm to scale to large dense and sparse data sets. We demonstrate the scalability of our parallel algorithm in terms of data size (up to 800 GB) and number of processors (up to 80 nodes of the Summit supercomputer), applying the hierarchical clustering approach to hyperspectral imaging and image classification data. Our algorithm for Rank-2 NMF scales perfectly on up to 1000s of cores and the entire hierarchical clustering method achieves 5.9x speedup scaling from 10 to 80 nodes on the 800 GB dataset.",

Technologies which can measure another type of data of a single cell in addition to the gene-expression data provide a more comprehensive picture of a cell, and meanwhile pose challenges for data integration tasks. We consider the spatial location of cells, which is an important feature of cells, combined with the cells\u2019 gene-expression profiles, to determine the cell type identity. We aim to jointly classify cells based on their locations relative to other cells in the system as well as their gene expression profiles. We have developed scHybridNMF (single-cell Hybrid Nonnegative Matrix Factorization), which performs cell type identification by incorporating single cell gene expression data with cell location data. We combined two classical methods, nonnegative matrix factorization with a k-means clustering scheme, to respectively represent high-dimensional gene expression data and low-dimensional location data together. Our method incorporates a novel cell location term to the gene expression clustering. We show that scHybridNMF can make use of the location data to improve cell type clustering. In particular, we show that under multiple scenarios, including that when the number of genes profiled is low, and when the location data is noisy, scHybridNMF outperforms the standalone algorithms NMF and k-means, and an existing method HMRF which also uses cell location and gene-expression data for cell type identification.",

            "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a prominent technique for data dimensionality reduction that has been widely used for text mining, computer vision, pattern discovery, and bioinformatics. In this paper, a framework called ARkNLS (Alternating Rank-k Nonnegativity constrained Least Squares) is proposed for computing NMF. First, a recursive formula for the solution of the rank-k nonnegativity-constrained least squares (NLS) is established. This recursive formula can be used to derive the closed-form solution for the Rank-k NLS problem for any integer k $\\ge$ 1. As a result, each subproblem for an alternating rank-k nonnegative least squares framework can be obtained based on this closed form solution. Assuming that all matrices involved in rank-k NLS in the context of NMF computation are of full rank, two of the currently best NMF algorithms HALS (hierarchical alternating least squares) and ANLS-BPP (Alternating NLS based on Block Principal Pivoting) can be considered as special cases of ARkNLS with k = 1 and k = r for rank r NMF, respectively. This paper is then focused on the framework with k = 3, which leads to a new algorithm for NMF via the closed-form solution of the rank-3 NLS problem. Furthermore, a new strategy that efficiently overcomes the potential singularity problem in rank-3 NLS within the context of NMF computation is also presented. Extensive numerical comparisons using real and synthetic data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides state-of-the-art performance in terms of computational accuracy and cpu time.",

            "abstract": "Complex relationships among entities can be modeled very effectively using hypergraphs. Hypergraphs model real-world data by allowing a hyperedge to include two or more entities. Clustering of hypergraphs enables us to group the similar entities together. While most existing algorithms solely consider the connection structure of a hypergraph to solve the clustering problem, we can boost the clustering performance by considering various features associated with the entities as well as auxiliary relationships among the entities. Also, we can further improve the clustering performance if some of the labels are known and we incorporate them into a clustering model. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework for hypergraphs that is able to easily incorporate not only multiple relationships among the entities but also multiple attributes and content of the entities from diverse sources. Furthermore, by showing the close relationship between the hypergraph normalized cut and the weighted kernel K-Means, we also develop an efficient multilevel hypergraph clustering method which provides a good initialization with our semi-supervised multi-view clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting the ground-truth clusters and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",
