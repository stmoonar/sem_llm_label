            "title": "Joint Charging and Relocation Recommendation for E-Taxi Drivers via Multi-Agent Mean Field Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, most of the taxi drivers have become users of the relocation recommendation service offered by online ride-hailing platforms (e.g., Uber and Didi Chuxing), which could oftentimes lead drivers to places with profitable orders. At the same time, electric taxis (e-taxis) are increasingly adopted and gradually replacing gasoline taxis in today\u2019s public transportation systems due to their environmental-friendly nature. Though effective for traditional gasoline taxis, existing relocation recommendation schemes are rather suboptimal for e-taxi drivers\u2019 user experience. On one hand, the existing schemes take no account of taxis\u2019 refueling decisions, as the refueling durations of gasoline taxis are usually short enough to be ignored. However, the charging duration of the e-taxis spent at charging stations can be as long as hours. Obviously, an e-taxi\u2019s battery could be easily depleted by the continuous relocations suggested by existing schemes, and thus will have to be charged for a long time afterwards, making the e-taxi driver miss numerous order-serving opportunities. On the other hand, charging posts are typically sparsely and unevenly distributed across a city. With no consideration of charging opportunities, existing schemes could probably send an e-taxi to an area with no charging post around, even though its battery is running low. To optimize e-taxi drivers\u2019 user experience, in this paper, we design a joint charging and relocation recommendation system for e-taxi drivers (CARE). We take the perspective of e-taxi drivers and formulate their decision making as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem where each e-taxi driver aims to maximize his own cumulative rewards. More specifically, we propose a novel multi-agent mean field hierarchical reinforcement learning (MFHRL) framework. The hierarchical architecture of MFHRL helps the proposed CARE provide far-sighted charging and relocation recommendations for e-taxi drivers. Besides, we integrate each hierarchical level of MFHRL separately with the mean field approximation to incorporate e-taxis\u2019 mutual influences in decision making. We set up a simulator with one of the largest real-world e-taxi datasets in Shenzhen, China, which contains the GPS trajectory data and transaction data of 3848 e-taxis from June 1st to June 30th, 2017, coupled with 165 charging stations including 317 fast charging posts and 1421 slow charging posts. We adopt this simulator to generate 6 dynamic urban environments, which reflect the different real-world scenarios faced by e-taxi drivers. In all of these environments, we conduct extensive experiments to validate that the proposed MFHRL framework greatly outperforms all baselines by significantly increasing the rewards obtained by e-taxi drivers. Besides, we also show that the charging policy learned by MFHRL can effectively reduce the range anxiety of e-taxi drivers, which significantly boosts e-taxi drivers\u2019 quality of experience.",

            "title": "Data Poisoning Attack against Recommender System Using Incomplete and Perturbed Data",
            "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that recommender systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attack due to their openness nature. In data poisoning attack, the attacker typically recruits a group of controlled users to inject well-crafted user-item interaction data into the recommendation model's training set to modify the model parameters as desired. Thus, existing attack approaches usually require full access to the training data to infer items' characteristics and craft the fake interactions for controlled users. However, such attack approaches may not be feasible in practice due to the attacker's limited data collection capability and the restricted access to the training data, which sometimes are even perturbed by the privacy preserving mechanism of the service providers. Such design-reality gap may cause failure of attacks. In this paper, we fill the gap by proposing two novel adversarial attack approaches to handle the incompleteness and perturbations in user-item interaction data. First, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates a probabilistic generative model to find the users and items whose interaction data is sufficient and has not been significantly perturbed, and leverage these users and items' data to craft fake user-item interactions. Moreover, we reverse the learning process of recommendation models and develop a simple yet effective approach that can incorporate context-specific heuristic rules to handle data incompleteness and perturbations. Extensive experiments on two datasets against three representative recommendation models show that the proposed approaches can achieve better attack performance than existing approaches.",

            "abstract": "This article proposes unsupervised truth-finding algorithms that combine consideration of multi-modal content features with analysis of propagation patterns to evaluate the veracity of observations in social sensing applications. A key social sensing challenge is to develop effective algorithms for estimating both the reliability of sources and the veracity of their observations without prior knowledge. In contrast to prior solutions that use labeled examples to learn content features that are correlated with veracity, our approach is entirely unsupervised. Hence, given no prior training data, we jointly learn the importance of different content features together with the veracity of observations using propagation patterns as an indicator of perceived content reliability. A novel penalized expectation maximization (PEM) algorithm is proposed to improve the quality of estimation results for observations bolstered by multiple features. In addition, we develop a constrained expectation maximum likelihood with multiple features (CEM-MultiF) that introduces a novel constraint to boost the probability of correctness of some claims. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, called EM-Multi, CEM-Multi and PEM-MultiF, respectively, on real-world data sets collected from Twitter. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing fact-finding approaches, and offer tunable knobs for controlling robustness/performance trade-offs in the presence of malicious sources.",

            "abstract": "Spot-level parking availability information (the availability of each spot in a parking lot) is in great demand, as it can help reduce time and energy waste while searching for a parking spot. In this article, we propose a crowdsensing system called SpotE that can provide spot-level availability in a parking lot using drivers\u2019 smartphone sensors. SpotE only requires the sensor data from drivers\u2019 smartphones, which avoids the high cost of installing additional sensors and enables large-scale outdoor deployment. We propose a new model that can use the parking search trajectory and final destination (e.g., an exit of the parking lot) of a single driver in a parking lot to generate the probability profile that contains the probability of each spot being occupied in a parking lot. To deal with conflicting estimation results generated from different drivers, due to the variance in different drivers\u2019 parking behaviors, a novel aggregation approach SpotE-TD is proposed. The proposed aggregation method is based on truth discovery techniques and can handle the variety in Quality of Information of different vehicles. We evaluate our proposed method through a real-life deployment study. Results show that SpotE-TD can efficiently provide spot-level parking availability information with a 20% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "Recently, significant efforts are made to explore device-free human activity recognition techniques that utilize the information collected by existing indoor wireless infrastructures without the need for the monitored subject to carry a dedicated device. Most of the existing work, however, focuses their attention on the analysis of the signal received by a single device. In practice, there are usually multiple devices \"observing\" the same subject. Each of these devices can be regarded as an information source and provides us an unique \"view\" of the observed subject. Intuitively, if we can combine the complementary information carried by the multiple views, we will be able to improve the activity recognition accuracy. Towards this end, we propose DeepMV, a unified multi-view deep learning framework, to learn informative representations of heterogeneous device-free data. DeepMV can combine different views' information weighted by the quality of their data and extract commonness shared across different environments to improve the recognition performance. To evaluate the proposed DeepMV model, we set up a testbed using commercialized WiFi and acoustic devices. Experiment results show that DeepMV can effectively recognize activities and outperform the state-of-the-art human activity recognition methods.",

Integration of road grade information will widen the scope of digital map\u2019s applications, which is primarily used for navigation, by enabling driving safety and efficiency applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), eco-driving, etc. The huge scale and dynamic nature of road networks make sensing road grade a challenging task. Traditional methods oftentimes suffer from limited scalability and update frequency, as well as poor sensing accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a cost-effective and scalable road grade estimation framework using sensor data from smartphones. Based on our understanding of the error characteristics of smartphone sensors, we intelligently combine data from accelerometer, gyroscope and vehicle speed data from OBD-II/smartphone\u2019s GPS to estimate road grade. To improve accuracy and robustness of the system, the estimations of road grade from multiple sources/vehicles are crowd-sourced to compensate for the effects of varying quality of sensor data from different sources. Extensive experimental evaluation on a test route of 9km demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method, achieving 5\u00d7 improvement on road grade estimation accuracy over baselines, with 90% of errors below 0.3\u00b0.",

Specifically, in SNAP, every edge server hosts a copy of the global model, trains it with the local data, and periodically updates the local parameters based on the weighted sum of the parameters from its neighbors (i.e., peers) only (i.e., without pulling the parameters from all other edge servers). Different from most of the previous works on consensus optimization in which the weight matrix to update parameter values is predefined, we propose a scheme to optimize the weight matrix based on the network topology, and hence the convergence rate can be improved. Another key idea in SNAP is that only the parameters which have been changed significantly since the last iteration will be sent to the neighbors. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show that SNAP can achieve the same accuracy performance as the centralized training method. Compared to the state-of-the-art communication-aware distributed learning scheme TernGrad, SNAP incurs a significantly lower (99.6% lower) communication cost.",

            "abstract": "Integration of information on road transverse geometric features such as cross slope and superelevation in digital maps can widen the scope of its applications, which is primarily navigation, by enabling driving safety and efficiency applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The huge scale and dynamic nature of road networks make sensing such road geometric features a challenging task. Traditional methods oftentimes suffer from high cost, limited scalability and update frequency, as well as poor sensing accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a cost-effective and scalable road transverse slope estimation framework using sensor data from smartphones. Based on error characteristics of smartphone sensors, we intelligently combine data from accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS to estimate road transverse slope profile of a road segment. To improve accuracy and robustness of the system, the estimations of road transverse slope from multiple sources/vehicles are crowd-sourced to compensate for the effects of varying quality of sensor data from different sources. Extensive experimental evaluation on a test route of 9km demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method, achieving 350% improvement on road transverse slope estimation accuracy over existing methods, with 90% of errors below 0.5\u00b0.",

            "abstract": "With the wide bandwidths in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band that results in unprecedented accuracy, mmWave sensing has become vital for many applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In addition, mmWave sensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as camera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it is critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security and reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world settings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five real-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication scheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned spoofing attacks.",

            "abstract": "The goal of metric learning is to learn a good distance metric that can capture the relationships among instances, and its importance has long been recognized in many fields. An implicit assumption in the traditional settings of metric learning is that the associated labels of the instances are deterministic. However, in many real-world applications, the associated labels come naturally with probabilities instead of deterministic values, which makes it difficult for the existing metric-learning methods to work well in these applications. To address this challenge, in this article, we study how to effectively learn the distance metric from datasets that contain probabilistic information, and then propose several novel metric-learning mechanisms for two types of probabilistic labels, i.e., the instance-wise probabilistic label and the group-wise probabilistic label. Compared with the existing metric-learning methods, our proposed mechanisms are capable of learning distance metrics directly from the probabilistic labels with high accuracy. We also theoretically analyze the proposed mechanisms and conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to verify the desirable properties of these mechanisms.",
