            "abstract": "Understanding ncRNA-protein interaction is of critical importance to unveil ncRNAs' functions. Here, we propose an integrated package LION which comprises a new method for predicting ncRNA/lncRNA-protein interaction as well as a comprehensive strategy to meet the requirement of customisable prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms its competitors on multiple benchmark datasets. LION can also improve the performance of some widely used tools and build adaptable models for species- and tissue-specific prediction. We expect that LION will be a powerful and efficient tool for the prediction and analysis of ncRNA/lncRNA-protein interaction.

Feature or gene selection is still a challenging problem owing to its nondeterministic polynomial time complexity and thus most of the existing feature selection algorithms utilize heuristic rules. A multilayer recursive feature elimination method based on an embedded integer-coded genetic algorithm, MGRFE, is proposed here, which is aimed at selecting the gene combination with minimal size and maximal information. On the basis of 19 benchmark microarray datasets including multiclass and imbalanced datasets, MGRFE outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms with better cancer classification accuracy and a smaller selected gene number. MGRFE could be regarded as a promising feature selection method for high-dimensional datasets especially gene expression data. Moreover, the genes selected by MGRFE have close biological relevance to cancer phenotypes. The source code of our proposed algorithm and all the 19 datasets used in this paper are available at <uri>https://github.com/Pengeace/MGRFE-GaRFE</uri>.",

            "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple fundamental biological processes, such as post-transcriptional gene regulation, and are implicated in many complex human diseases. Mostly ncRNAs function by interacting with corresponding RNA-binding proteins. The research on ncRNA\u2013protein interaction is the key to understanding the function of ncRNA. However, the biological experiment techniques for identifying RNA\u2013protein interactions (RPIs) are currently still expensive and time-consuming. Due to the complex molecular mechanism of ncRNA\u2013protein interaction and the lack of conservation for ncRNA, especially for long ncRNA (lncRNA), the prediction of ncRNA\u2013protein interaction is still a challenge. Deep learning-based models have become the state-of-the-art in a range of biological sequence analysis problems due to their strong power of feature learning. In this study, we proposed a hierarchical deep learning framework RPITER to predict RNA\u2013protein interaction. For sequence coding, we improved the conjoint triad feature (CTF) coding method by complementing more primary sequence information and adding sequence structure information. For model design, RPITER employed two basic neural network architectures of convolution neural network (CNN) and stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Comprehensive experiments were performed on five benchmark datasets from PDB and NPInter databases to analyze and compare the performances of different sequence coding methods and prediction models. We found that CNN and SAE deep learning architectures have powerful fitting abilities for the k-mer features of RNA and protein sequence. The improved CTF coding method showed performance gain compared with the original CTF method. Moreover, our designed RPITER performed well in predicting RNA\u2013protein interaction (RPI) and could outperform most of the previous methods. On five widely used RPI datasets, RPI369, RPI488, RPI1807, RPI2241 and NPInter, RPITER obtained AUC of 0.821, 0.911, 0.990, 0.957 and 0.985, respectively. The proposed RPITER could be a complementary method for predicting RPI and constructing RPI network, which would help push forward the related biological research on ncRNAs and lncRNAs.",

            "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs with a length of more than 200 nucleotides are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have gained tremendous attention in recent decades. Many studies have confirmed that lncRNAs have important influence in post-transcriptional gene regulation; for example, lncRNAs affect the stability and translation of splicing factor proteins. The mutations and malfunctions of lncRNAs are closely related to human disorders. As lncRNAs interact with a variety of proteins, predicting the interaction between lncRNAs and proteins is a significant way to depth exploration functions and enrich annotations of lncRNAs. Experimental approaches for lncRNA\u2013protein interactions are expensive and time-consuming. Computational approaches to predict lncRNA\u2013protein interactions can be grouped into two broad categories. The first category is based on sequence, structural information and physicochemical property. The second category is based on network method through fusing heterogeneous data to construct lncRNA related heterogeneous network. The network-based methods can capture the implicit feature information in the topological structure of related biological heterogeneous networks containing lncRNAs, which is often ignored by sequence-based methods. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the materials, interaction score calculation algorithms, advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art algorithms of lncRNA\u2013protein interaction prediction based on network methods to assist researchers in selecting a suitable method for acquiring more dependable results.

            "title": "Robust Sparse Logistic Regression With the  $L_{q}$  ( $0 < \\text{q} < 1$ ) Regularization for Feature Selection Using Gene Expression Data",
            "abstract": "Microarray technology is a popular technique that has been extensively applied in cancer diagnosis. Many studies have used high-dimensional microarray data to identify informative features to classify the types of cancer, yet numerous irrelevant features that exist in microarray data may introduce the noise and decrease classification accuracy. Regularization techniques are common methods for feature selection, which can be used to reduce irrelevant features and avoid overfitting. In recent years, different regularization methods have been proposed. Theoretically, the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{L}_{\\mathrm {q}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0 < \\text {q} < 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) type penalty function with the lower value of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula> would acquire better sparse solutions. In addition, the loss function in most regression models is based on least-squares minimization. However, the least-square method is sensitive to noise and has poor robustness, especially when the error has a heavy-tailed distribution. It is well known that the least absolute deviation regression is the most common method for the robust regression, which can overcome the big noise problem. In general, there is a high level of noise in microarray data, which deter the development of microarray technology. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a robust logistic regression based on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{L}_{\\mathrm {q}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0 < \\text {q} < 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) regularization approach, which is a feasible and effective approach for feature selection in microarray classification. The <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{L}_{\\mathrm {q}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0 < \\text {q} < 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) regularization leads to a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to be solved. In this paper, we utilize a genetic algorithm based on the global search strategy to obtain an optimal solution.",
