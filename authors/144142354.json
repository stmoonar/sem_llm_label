            "abstract": "Generalised image outpainting is an important and active research topic in computer vision, which aims to extend appealing content all-side around a given image. Existing state-of-the-art outpainting methods often rely on discrete extrapolation to extend the feature map in the bottleneck. They thus suffer from content unsmoothness, especially in circumstances where the outlines of objects in the extrapolated regions are incoherent with the input sub-images. To mitigate this issue, we design a novel bottleneck with Neural ODEs to make continuous extrapolation in latent space, which could be a plug-in for many deep learning frameworks. Our ODE-based network continuously transforms the state and makes accurate predictions by learning the incremental relationship among latent points, leading to both smooth and structured feature representation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets both applied on transformer-based and CNN-based frameworks show that our methods could generate more realistic and coherent images against the state-of-the-art image outpainting approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/PengleiGao/Continuous-Image-Outpainting-with-Neural-ODE.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of distributed 6-DOF coordinated control for spacecraft formation is investigated. The dynamics of each spacecraft consisting of relative attitude and position motions are modeled into a unified Euler-Lagrange formulation. The formation consists of one virtual leader and $n$ spacecrafts, and the information switching among the formation members is described by a directed graph. A distributed coordination control protocol is proposed to guarantee the stability of the spacecraft formation in the presence of external disturbances, unmeasurable attitude angular and position velocities, and time-varying communication delays based on the backstepping technique using time-delayed information. Further, to decrease the communication frequency of the spacecraft formation flying system, an event-triggered distributed coordination strategy is also developed to solve the 6-DOF coordinated control problem for spacecraft formation. The stability analyses of the obtained control algorithms are conducted through the Lyapunov method. Finally, the effectiveness and the ability of massive reducing the frequency of communication times of the proposed control scheme are illustrated through numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "The determination of transcriptome profiles that mediate immune therapy in cancer remains a major clinical and biological challenge. Despite responses induced by immune-check points inhibitors (ICIs) in diverse tumor types and all the big breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, most patients with solid tumors do not respond to ICI therapies. It still remains a big challenge to predict the ICI treatment response. Here, we propose a framework with multiple prior knowledge networks guided for immune checkpoints inhibitors prediction-DeepOmix-ICI (or ICInet for short). ICInet can predict the immune therapy response by leveraging geometric deep learning and prior biological knowledge graphs of gene-gene interactions. Here, we demonstrate more than 600 ICI-treated patients with ICI response data and gene expression profile to apply on ICInet. ICInet was used for ICI therapy responses prediciton across different cancer types-melanoma, gastric cancer and bladder cancer, which includes 7 cohorts from different data sources. ICInet is able to robustly generalize into multiple cancer types. Moreover, the performance of ICInet in those cancer types can outperform other ICI biomarkers in the clinic. Our model [area under the curve (AUC\u2009=\u20090.85)] generally outperformed other measures, including tumor mutational burden (AUC\u2009=\u20090.62) and programmed cell death ligand-1 score (AUC\u2009=\u20090.74). Therefore, our study presents a prior-knowledge guided deep learning method to effectively select immunotherapy-response-associated biomarkers, thereby improving the prediction of immunotherapy response for precision oncology.",

            "abstract": "At present, a variety of global remote sensing surface downwelling longwave radiation (SDL) products are used for atmospheric science research; however, there are few studies on the quantitative evaluation of differences among different SDL products. In order to evaluate the differences among different SDL products quantitatively, we have selected three commonly used SDL products\u2014Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System-Synoptic Radiative Fluxes and Clouds (CERES-SYN), the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts-Surface Radiation Budget (ECMWF-SRB) and the Global Energy and Water Exchanges Project-Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB)\u2014to comprehensively study in this paper. The results show that there are significant differences among the three SDL products in some areas, such as in the Arctic, the Antarctic, the Sahara, the Tibet Plateau, and Greenland. The maximum absolute root mean square error (RMSEab) in these areas is greater than 20 Wm\u22122, the maximum relative root mean square error (RMSEre) is greater than 20%, the maximum and minimum absolute mean bias error (MBEab) are about 20 Wm\u22122 and \u221220 Wm\u22122, respectively, and the maximum and minimum relative mean bias error (MBEre) are about 10% and \u221210%, respectively. Among the three SDL products, the difference between the ECMWF-SRB and GEWEX-SRB is the most significant. In addition, this paper also analyzed the differences among different SDL products based on three aspects. Firstly, the differences among the three SDL products show that there is significant seasonality, and the differences among different months may vary greatly. However, the differences are not sensitive to years. Secondly, there are some differences in cloud-forcing radiative fluxes (CFRFs) of different SDL products, which is also an important factor affecting the difference between different SDL products. Finally, in the process of converting high temporal resolution SDL products into monthly SDL products, data processing also affects the difference between different SDL products.",

            "abstract": "Citation field learning is to segment a citation string into fields of interest such as author, title, and venue. Extracting such fields from citations is crucial for citation indexing, researcher profile analysis, etc. User-generated resources like academic homepages and Curriculum Vitae, provide rich citation field information. However, extracting fields from these resources is challenging due to inconsistent citation styles, incomplete sentence syntax, and insufficient training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, CIFAL (citation field learning by anchor learning), to boost the citation field learning performance. CIFAL leverages the anchor learning, which is model-agnostic for any Pre-trained Language Model, to help capture citation patterns from the data of different citation styles. The experiments demonstrate that CIFAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in citation field learning, achieving a 2.68% improvement in field-level F1-scores. Extensive analysis of the results further confirms the effectiveness of CIFAL quantitatively and qualitatively.",

            "abstract": "Several global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) broadcast overlapping frequencies to enhance interoperability, allowing tight integration with only one reference satellite for every system with the same frequency. The key to realizing tight integration is estimating and utilizing differential intersystem biases, which allows the integer characteristic of the differenced ambiguity of two satellites from different systems to be retrieved. In this study, a detailed algorithm flow of a tight integration kinematic uncalibrated phase delay (UPD)-based PPP ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) method, which includes multiple parts, is introduced. Subsequently, PPP-AR numerical experiments were conducted in a high-shade observation environment to determine the performance. In comparison with traditional methods, our results indicate that the average success fix rate improves from 83% to 100% after using the tight integration method in an environment where only three satellites are observed for each system. Moreover, for fewer than nine satellites, the tight integration method can still consistently maintain a fixed state. However, for comparison, the traditional loose integration method could no longer be implemented.",

            "abstract": "During industrial production activities, industrial products serve as critical resources whose performance is subject to various external factors and usage conditions. To ensure uninterrupted production processes and to guarantee the safety of the production personnel, a real-time analysis of the industrial product quality and subsequent decision making are essential. Conventional detection methods have inherent limitations in meeting the real-time demands of processing large volumes of data and achieving high response speeds. For instance, the regular inspection and maintenance of cars can be time-consuming and labor-intensive if performed manually. Furthermore, monitoring the damage situation of bearings in real time through a manual inspection may lead to delays and may hinder production efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents online machine-learning-based methods to address these two practical problems and simulates them on various datasets to meet the requirements of efficiency and speed. Prior to being fed into the network for training, the data undergo identity parsing to transform them into easily identifiable streaming data. The training process demonstrates that online machine learning ensures timely model updates as small batches of data are sent to the network. The test results indicate that the online learning method exhibits highly stable and effective performance, optimizing the training process.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the deployment of multiple movable antennas (MAs) at the base station (BS) for enhancing the multiuser communication performance. First, we model the multiuser channel in the uplink to characterize the wireless channel variation caused by MAs' movements at the BS. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple users for MA-aided uplink multiuser communications by jointly optimizing the MAs' positions, their receive combining at the BS, and the transmit power of users, under the constraints of finite moving region of MAs, minimum inter-MA distance, and maximum transmit power of each user. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, a two-loop iterative algorithm is proposed by leveraging the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Specifically, the outer-loop updates the positions of a set of particles, where each particle's position represents one realization of the antenna positioning vector (APV) of all MAs. The inner-loop implements the fitness evaluation for each particle in terms of the max-min achievable rate of multiple users with its corresponding APV, where the receive combining matrix of the BS and the transmit power of each user are optimized by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique. Simulation results show that the antenna position optimization for MAs-aided BSs can significantly improve the rate performance as compared to conventional BSs with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).",

            "abstract": "Region similarity learning plays an essential role in applications such as business site selection, region recommendation, and urban planning. Earlier studies mainly represent regions as bags of points of interest (POIs) for region similarity comparisons, which cannot fully exploit the spatial features of the regions. Recently, researchers propose to use deep neural networks to exploit spatial features such as POI geo-coordinates and categories, which have produced more accurate and robust region similarity learning results. However, many useful features such as the height and size of a POI, and the distance and relative importance between the POIs, are still overlooked in these methods. To take advantage of such features, we propose to represent regions as graphs, where nodes are POIs with rich features such as height, size, and hexagonal coordinates, while edges are the relationships between POIs formulated by their road network distances. To capture POIs\u2019 importance, we weigh them by their height and size. Since there is limited availability of ground-truth region similarity data, we propose a contrastive learning-based multi-relational graph neural network (C-MPGCN) for region similarity learning based on the graph representations. To generate data for model training, we propose a soft graph edit distance (SGED) based algorithm to generate triples of similar and dissimilar graphs of a given graph (representing a given region) based on the POI weights. Experimental results show that C-MPGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for region similarity learning consistently with an improvement of at least 8.6% and 9.4% in terms of MRR and HR@1, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Multi-types of user behavior data (e.g., clicking, adding to cart, and purchasing) are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios, which can help to learn users\u2019 multi-faceted preferences. However, it is challenging to explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas features\u201d and gradient conflict in multi-task learning when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d. In this paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d, we propose a Multi-Expert with Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for multi-task learning. Comprehensive experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CIGF.",
