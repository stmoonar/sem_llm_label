            "abstract": "ACM SIGMOD, VLDB and other database organizations have committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse community, as do many other scientific organizations. Recently, different measures have been taken to advance these goals, especially for underrepresented groups. One possible measure is double-blind reviewing, which aims to hide gender, ethnicity, and other properties of the authors. We report the preliminary results of a gender diversity analysis of publications of the database community across several peer-reviewed venues, and also compare women's authorship percentages in both single-blind and double-blind venues along the years. We also obtained a cross comparison of the obtained results in data management with other relevant areas in Computer Science.",

            "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications require large quantities of training and test data. This need creates critical challenges not only concerning the availability of such data, but also regarding its quality. For example, incomplete, erroneous or inappropriate training data can lead to unreliable models that produce ultimately poor decisions. Trustworthy AI applications require high-quality training and test data along many dimensions, such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity. We explore empirically the correlation between six of the traditional data quality dimensions and the performance of fifteen widely used ML algorithms covering the tasks of classification, regression, and clustering, with the goal of explaining ML results in terms of data quality. Our experiments distinguish three scenarios based on the AI pipeline steps that were fed with polluted data: polluted training data, test data, or both. We conclude the paper with an extensive discussion of our observations and recommendations, alongside open questions and future directions to be explored.",

            "abstract": "Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are core to fostering innovative thinking. Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",
