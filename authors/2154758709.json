            "title": "USNAP: fast unique dense region detection and its application to lung cancer",
            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Many real-world problems can be modeled as annotated graphs. Scalable graph algorithms that extract actionable information from such data are in demand since these graphs are large, varying in topology, and have diverse node/edge annotations. When these graphs change over time they create dynamic graphs, and open the possibility to find patterns across different time points. In this article, we introduce a scalable algorithm that finds unique dense regions across time points in dynamic graphs. Such algorithms have applications in many different areas, including the biological, financial, and social domains. Results There are three important contributions to this manuscript. First, we designed a scalable algorithm, USNAP, to effectively identify dense subgraphs that are unique to a time stamp given a dynamic graph. Importantly, USNAP provides a lower bound of the density measure in each step of the greedy algorithm. Second, insights and understanding obtained from validating USNAP on real data show its effectiveness. While USNAP is domain independent, we applied it to four non-small cell lung cancer gene expression datasets. Stages in non-small cell lung cancer were modeled as dynamic graphs, and input to USNAP. Pathway enrichment analyses and comprehensive interpretations from literature show that USNAP identified biologically relevant mechanisms for different stages of cancer progression. Third, USNAP is scalable, and has a time complexity of O(m+mc\u2009log\u2009nc+nc\u2009log\u2009nc), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in the dynamic graph; mc is the number of edges, and nc is the number of vertices in the collapsed graph. Availability and implementation The code of USNAP is available at https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/\u223cjuris/data/USNAP22.",

            "title": "MirDIP 5.2: tissue context annotation and novel microRNA curation",
            "abstract": "Abstract MirDIP is a well-established database that aggregates microRNA-gene human interactions from multiple databases to increase coverage, reduce bias, and improve usability by providing an integrated score proportional to the probability of the interaction occurring. In version 5.2, we removed eight outdated resources, added a new resource (miRNATIP), and ran five prediction algorithms for miRBase and mirGeneDB. In total, mirDIP 5.2 includes 46 364 047 predictions for 27 936 genes and 2734 microRNAs, making it the first database to provide interactions using data from mirGeneDB. Moreover, we curated and integrated 32 497 novel microRNAs from 14 publications to accelerate the use of these novel data. In this release, we also extend the content and functionality of mirDIP by associating contexts with microRNAs, genes, and microRNA\u2013gene interactions. We collected and processed microRNA and gene expression data from 20 resources and acquired information on 330 tissue and disease contexts for 2657 microRNAs, 27 576 genes and 123 651 910 gene\u2013microRNA\u2013tissue interactions. Finally, we improved the usability of mirDIP by enabling the user to search the database using precursor IDs, and we integrated miRAnno, a network-based tool for identifying pathways linked to specific microRNAs. We also provide a mirDIP API to facilitate access to its integrated predictions. Updated mirDIP is available at https://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP.",
