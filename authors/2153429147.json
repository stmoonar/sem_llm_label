            "title": "Embedding Based Retrieval in Friend Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Friend recommendation systems in online social and professional networks such as Snapchat helps users find friends and build connections, leading to better user engagement and retention. Traditional friend recommendation systems take advantage of the principle of locality and use graph traversal to retrieve friend candidates, e.g. Friends-of-Friends (FoF). While this approach has been adopted and shown efficacy in companies with large online networks such as Linkedin and Facebook, it suffers several challenges: (i) discrete graph traversal offers limited reach in cold-start settings, (ii) it is expensive and infeasible in realtime settings beyond 1 or 2 hop requests owing to latency constraints, and (iii) it cannot well-capture the complexity of graph topology or connection strengths, forcing one to resort to other mechanisms to rank and find top-K candidates. In this paper, we proposed a new Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) system for retrieving friend candidates, which complements the traditional FoF retrieval by retrieving candidates beyond 2-hop, and providing a natural way to rank FoF candidates. Through online A/B test, we observe statistically significant improvements in the number of friendships made with EBR as an additional retrieval source in both low- and high-density network markets. Our contributions in this work include deploying a novel retrieval system to a large-scale friend recommendation system at Snapchat, generating embeddings for billions of users using Graph Neural Networks, and building EBR infrastructure in production to support Snapchat scale.",

            "abstract": "As the state-of-the-art graph learning models, the message passing based neural networks (MPNNs) implicitly use the graph topology as the \"pathways\" to propagate node features. This implicit use of graph topology induces the MPNNs' over-reliance on (node) features and high inference latency, which hinders their large-scale applications in industrial contexts. To mitigate these weaknesses, we propose the Graph Explicit Neural Network (GENN) framework. GENN can be flexibly applied to various MPNNs and improves them by providing more efficient and accurate inference that is robust in feature-constrained settings. Specifically, we carefully incorporate recent developments in network embedding methods to efficiently prioritize the graph topology for inference. From this vantage, GENN explicitly encodes the topology as an important source of information to mitigate the reliance on node features. Moreover, by adopting knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, GENN takes an MPNN as the teacher to supervise the training for better effectiveness while avoiding the teacher's high inference latency. Empirical results show that our GENN infers dramatically faster than its MPNN teacher by 40x-78x. In terms of accuracy, GENN yields significant gains (more than 40%) for its MPNN teacher when the node features are limited based on our explicit encoding. Moreover, GENN outperforms the MPNN teacher even in feature-rich settings thanks to our KD design.",

            "abstract": "Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, are a kind of universal data structure for a lot of real-world data, including social networks, transportation networks, and chemical molecules. Many important applications on these data can be treated as computational tasks on graphs. Recently, machine learning techniques are widely developed and utilized to effectively tame graphs for discovering actionable patterns and harnessing them for advancing various graph-related computational tasks. Huge success has been achieved and numerous real-world applications have benefited from it. However, since in today's world, we are generating and gathering data in a much faster and more diverse way, real-world graphs are becoming increasingly large-scale and complex. More dedicated efforts are needed to propose more advanced machine learning techniques and properly deploy them for real-world applications in a scalable way. Thus, we organize The 3rd International Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs (MLoG), held in conjunction with the 16th ACM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), which provides a venue to gather academia researchers and industry researchers/practitioners to present the recent progress on machine learning on graphs.",

            "abstract": "The field of graph data mining, one of the most important AI research areas, has been revolutionized by graph neural networks (GNNs), which benefit from training on real-world graph data with millions to billions of nodes and links. Unfortunately, the training data and process of GNNs involving graphs beyond millions of nodes are extremely costly on a centralized server, if not impossible. Moreover, due to the increasing concerns about data privacy, emerging data from realistic applications are naturally fragmented, forming distributed private graphs of multiple ''data silos\", among which direct transferring of data is forbidden. The nascent field of federated learning (FL), which aims to enable individual clients to jointly train their models while keeping their local data decentralized and completely private, is a promising paradigm for large-scale distributed and private training of GNNs. \u00f8urs aims to bring together researchers from different backgrounds with a common interest in how to extend current FL algorithms to operate with graph data models such as GNNs. FL is an extremely hot topic of large commercial interest and has been intensively explored for machine learning with visual and textual data. The exploration from graph mining researchers and industrial practitioners is timely catching up just recently. There are many unexplored challenges and opportunities, which urges the establishment of an organized and open community to collaboratively advance the science behind it. The prospective participants of this workshop will include researchers and practitioners from both graph mining and federated learning communities, whose interests include, but are not limited to: graph analysis and mining, heterogeneous network modeling, complex data mining, large-scale machine learning, distributed systems, optimization, meta-learning, reinforcement learning, privacy, robustness, explainability, fairness, ethics, and trustworthiness.",
