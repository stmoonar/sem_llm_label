            "abstract": "Network algorithms play a critical role in various applications, such as recommendations, diffusion maximization, and web search. In this paper, we focus on the fairness of such algorithms and in particular of PageRank. PageRank fairness refers to a fair allocation of the PageRank weights among the nodes. We consider the effect of the network structure on PageRank fairness. Concretely, we provide analytical formulas for computing the effect of edge additions on fairness and for the conditions that an edge must satisfy so that its addition improves fairness. We also provide analytical formulas for evaluating the role of existing edges in fairness. We use our findings to propose efficient linear time link recommendation algorithms for maximizing fairness, and we evaluate them on real datasets. Our approach can be seen as an effort towards making the network itself fairer as opposed to making fairer the network algorithms, or their outputs.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Location-based social sites, such as Foursquare or Yelp, are gaining increasing popularity. These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary in the form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled and concise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting the topic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help users make informed decisions, and also help venue owners personalize users\u2019 experiences. However, topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult, due to their short and fragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies, which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level, and we propose novel probabilistic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair. Our best topic model integrates influences from both venue inherent properties and user preferences, considering at the same the sentiment orientation of the users. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model compared to simpler models and previous work; they also show that venue-inherent properties have higher influences on the topics of micro-reviews.\n \n",

            "title": "Template-Driven Team Formation",
            "abstract": "The team-formation problem on social networks asks for a team of individuals that collectively possess the skills to perform a task and have low communication cost, as measured by their distances in the social network. Most related work assumes a flat structure in the team, where team members are all indistinguishable. However, in practice, teams often have complex structures and deep hierarchies, and members with distinct roles in these structures. In this paper, we consider the Template-Driven Team Formation problem, where given a fixed template structure for the team, in the form of a graph, and a designated role for each node in the template, we ask for workers that can fill the roles in the template, while minimizing the communication cost along the template edges. Although the problem is in general NP-hard, there are variants of the problem that can be solved optimally using dynamic programming. For the general case, we provide approximation and heuristic polynomial-time algorithms. We experiment on real data and we demonstrate that our heuristic algorithms perform well in practice while being significantly more efficient. Our case studies highlight the quality of the teams produced by our algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness has attracted significant attention in the past years. In this paper, we consider fairness for link analysis and in particular for the celebrated Pagerank algorithm. Given that the nodes in a network belong to groups (for example, based on demographic or other characteristics), we provide a parity-based definition of fairness that imposes constraints on the proportion of Pagerank allocated to the members of each group. We propose two families of fair Pagerank algorithms: the first (Fairness-Sensitive Pagerank) modifies the jump vector of the Pagerank algorithm to enforce fairness; the second (Locally Fair Pagerank) imposes a fair behavior per node. We then define a stronger fairness requirement, termed universal personalized fairness, that asks that the derived personalized pageranks of all nodes are fair. We prove that the locally fair algorithms achieve also universal personalized fairness, and furthermore, we prove that this is the only family of algorithms with this property, establishing an equivalence between universal personalized fairness and local fairness. We also consider the problem of achieving fairness while minimizing the utility loss with respect to the original Pagerank algorithm. We present experiments with real and synthetic networks that examine the fairness of the original Pagerank and demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively the properties of our algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Temporal interaction networks capture the history of activities between entities along a timeline. At each interaction, some quantity of data (money, information, traffic) flows from one vertex of the network to another. Flow-based analysis can reveal important information, such as unusually large money transfers in a part of a financial transaction network. In this paper, we introduce the flow computation problem between two vertrices in an interaction network. We propose and study two models of flow computation, one based on a greedy flow transfer assumption and one that finds the maximum possible flow. We show that the greedy flow computation problem can be easily solved by a single scan of the interactions in time order. For the harder maximum flow problem, we propose precomputation and simplification approaches that can greatly reduce its complexity in practice. We also approach the problem of flow pattern enumeration in interaction networks and propose an effective path indexing technique. We evaluate our algorithms using real datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms.",
