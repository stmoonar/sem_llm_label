            "abstract": "This paper explores the concept formation and alignment within the realm of language models (LMs). We propose a mechanism for identifying concepts and their hierarchical organization within the semantic representations learned by various LMs, encompassing a spectrum from early models like Glove to the transformer-based language models like ALBERT and T5. Our approach leverages the inherent structure present in the semantic embeddings generated by these models to extract a taxonomy of concepts and their hierarchical relationships. This investigation sheds light on how LMs develop conceptual understanding and opens doors to further research to improve their ability to reason and leverage real-world knowledge. We further conducted experiments and observed the possibility of isolating these extracted conceptual representations from the reasoning modules of the transformer-based LMs. The observed concept formation along with the isolation of conceptual representations from the reasoning modules can enable targeted token engineering to open the door for potential applications in knowledge transfer, explainable AI, and the development of more modular and conceptually grounded language models.",

            "abstract": "Hyperbolic neural networks have recently gained signi\ufb01cant attention due to their promising results on several graph problems including node classi\ufb01cation and link prediction. The primary reason for this success is the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space in capturing the inherent hierarchy of graph datasets. However, they are limited in terms of generalization, scalability, and have inferior performance when it comes to non-hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we take a completely orthogonal perspective for modeling hyperbolic networks. We use Poincar\u00e9 disk to model the hyperbolic geometry and also treat it as if the disk itself is a tangent space at origin. This enables us to replace non-scalable M\u00f6bius gyrovector operations with an Euclidean approximation, and thus simplifying the entire hyperbolic model to a Euclidean model cascaded with a hyperbolic normalization function. Our approach does not adhere to M\u00f6bius math, yet it still works in the Riemannian manifold, hence we call it Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9 framework. We applied our non-linear hyperbolic normalization to the current state-of-the-art homogeneous and multi-relational graph networks and demonstrate signi\ufb01cant improvements in performance compared to both Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts. The primary impact of this work lies in its ability to capture hierarchical features in the Euclidean space, and thus, can replace hyperbolic networks without loss in performance metrics while simultaneously leveraging the power of Euclidean networks such as interpretability and ef\ufb01cient execution of various model components.",

            "abstract": "Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained prominence for representation learning in graph processing tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Several Euclidean graph models have been adapted to work in the hyperbolic space and the variants have shown a significant increase in performance. However, research and development in graph modeling currently involve several tedious tasks with a scope of standardization including data processing, parameter configuration, optimization tricks, and unavailability of public codebases. With the proliferation of new tasks such as knowledge graph reasoning and generation, there is a need in the community for a unified framework that eases the development and analysis of both Euclidean and hyperbolic graph networks, especially for new researchers in the field. To this end, we present a novel framework, GraphZoo, that makes learning, designing and applying graph processing pipelines/models systematic through abstraction over the redundant components. The framework contains a versatile library that supports several hyperbolic manifolds and an easy-to-use modular framework to perform graph processing tasks which aids researchers in different components, namely, (i) reproduce evaluation pipelines of state-of-the-art approaches, (ii) design new hyperbolic or Euclidean graph networks and compare them against the state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, (iii) add custom datasets for evaluation, (iv) add new tasks and evaluation criteria.",

The energy consumption, performance, and demanding security concerns are some of the most significant challenges in designing of such systems. With these challenges, the design process can be managed more easily if a flexible logic circuit with the ability of satisfying the above-mentioned concerns is taken into account. To achieve such a logic circuit, in this paper we have combined the sub-threshold operation and charge recovery techniques. Using our technique, lower power consumption, ability of operating at higher frequencies, and more security (to side channel attacks) than the existing logic circuits are achieved. This paper also presents an analytical proof about how sub-threshold charge recovery circuits can meet these characterizations. we have also confirmed our analytical discussions by examining our technique for full adder, and 8 \u00d7 8 carry-save multiplier in different frequencies, supply voltages, and CMOS technologies. Detailed SPICE simulations show significant improvements as compared to its existing counterparts in all simulated frequencies and supply voltages.",

            "abstract": "Charge recovery is a promising concept to design (cryptographic) VLSI circuits with low energy dissipation. However, unsatisfactory designs of proposed logic cells degrade its theoretical efficiency significantly both in its energy consumption and the resistance against differential power analysis attacks (DPA-attacks). Short circuit dissipation and non-adiabatic discharging of capacitance loads are the two major sources of this degradation which are addressed in this paper. In order to reduce these dissipation significantly, we manipulate threshold voltage of circuits transistors by body biasing. To evaluate the efficiency of our method we select a common charge recovery logic called 2N- 2N2P and examine it on 8-bit Brent-Kung adder as well as 4-bit, 8-bit and 16-bit 2N-2N2P carry look-ahead adders. Experimental results show at least 50% reduction in the energy consumption as compared to traditional 2N-2N2P. Moreover, using our technique reduces the dynamic power variation by a factor of 7.8 on the 2N- 2N2P inverter and therefore improves DPA-resistance of charge recovery circuits significantly.",

However, they have some other characteristics such as inherent pipelining mechanism, low data-dependent power consumption, and low electromagnetic radiations which are usually neglected by researchers. These properties can be useful in other application areas such as side channel attack resistant cryptographic hardware. This paper addresses these properties of charge recovery logics and examines a common one, called 2N-2N2P, as a side channel attack countermeasure by information theoretic evaluation metrics. The observed results show that the usage of this logic style leads to improve DPA-resistance as well as energy saving.

Therefore, employing a method to guide evolution in these spaces can facilitate achieving more reasonable results. It has been claimed that a two-step evolutionary scenario caused by benefit and cost of learning called Baldwin effect can guide evolution in the biology and artificial life. Therefore, we have been motivated to examine this effect on CGP. We observe using this scenario the success rate and evolution time of CGP improves dramatically especially when size of chromosomes increases.",
