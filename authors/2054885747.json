            "title": "Regional and Temporal Patterns of Partisan Polarization during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States and Canada",
            "abstract": "Public health measures were among the most polarizing topics debated online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the discussion surrounded specific events, such as when and which particular interventions came into practise. In this work, we develop and apply an approach to measure subnational and event-driven variation of partisan polarization and explore how these dynamics varied both across and within countries. We apply our measure to a dataset of over 50 million tweets posted during late 2020, a salient period of polarizing discourse in the early phase of the pandemic. In particular, we examine regional variations in both the United States and Canada, focusing on three specific health interventions: lockdowns, masks, and vaccines. We find that more politically conservative regions had higher levels of partisan polarization in both countries, especially in the US where a strong negative correlation exists between regional vaccination rates and degree of polarization in vaccine related discussions. We then analyze the timing, context, and profile of spikes in polarization, linking them to specific events discussed on social media across different regions in both countries. These typically last only a few days in duration, suggesting that online discussions reflect and could even drive changes in public opinion, which in the context of pandemic response impacts public health outcomes across different regions and over time.",

            "abstract": "Given a million escort advertisements, how can we spot near-duplicates? Such micro-clusters of ads are usually signals of human trafficking (HT). How can we summarize them to convince law enforcement to act? Spotting micro-clusters of near-duplicate documents is useful in multiple, additional settings, including spam-bot detection in Twitter ads, plagiarism, and more. We present InfoShield, which makes the following contributions: practical, being scalable and effective on real data; parameter-free and principled, requiring no user-defined parameters; interpretable, finding a document to be the cluster representative, highlighting all the common phrases, and automatically detecting \u201cslots\u201d (i.e., phrases that differ in every document); and generalizable, beating or matching domain-specific methods in Twitter bot detection and HT detection, respectively, as well as being language independent. Interpretability is particularly important for the anti-HT domain, where law enforcement must visually inspect ads. Our experiments on real data show that InfoShield correctly identifies Twitter bots with an F1 score over 90% and detects HT ads with 84% precision. Moreover, it is scalable, requiring about 8 hours for 4 million documents on a stock laptop. Our incremental version, DeltaShield, allows for fast, incremental updates, with minor loss of accuracy.",

Computational social scientists conducting topical studies employ large, self-collected or crowdsourced social media datasets such as tweet corpora. Comprehensive sets of relevant keywords are often necessary to sample or analyze these data sources. However, naively skimming through thousands of keywords can quickly become a daunting task. In this study, we present a web-based application to simplify the search for relevant topical hashtags in a tweet corpus. DisKeyword allows users to grasp high-level trends in their dataset, while iteratively labeling keywords recommended based on their links to prior labeled hashtags.

            "abstract": "In today\u2019s age of (mis)information, many people utilize various social media platforms in an attempt to shape public opinion on several important issues, including elections and the COVID-19 pandemic. These two topics have recently become intertwined given the importance of complying with public health measures related to COVID-19 and politicians\u2019 management of the pandemic. Motivated by this, we study the partisan polarization of COVID-19 discussions on social media. We propose and utilize a novel measure of partisan polarization to analyze more than 380 million posts from Twitter and Parler around the 2020 US presidential election. We find strong correlation between peaks in polarization and polarizing events, such as the January 6th Capitol Hill riot. We further classify each post into key COVID-19 issues of lockdown, masks, vaccines, as well as miscellaneous, to investigate both the volume and polarization on these topics and how they vary through time. Parler includes more negative discussions around lockdown and masks, as expected, but not much around vaccines. We also observe more balanced discussions on Twitter and a general disconnect between the discussions on Parler and Twitter.",

            "abstract": "Social media sites are becoming a key factor in politics. These platforms are easy to manipulate for the purpose of distorting information space to confuse and distract voters. It is of paramount importance for social media platforms, users engaged with online political discussions, as well as government agencies to understand the dynamics on social media, and identify malicious groups engaging in misinformation campaigns and thus polluting the general discourse around a topic of interest. Past works to identify such disruptive patterns are mostly focused on analyzing user-generated content such as tweets. In this study, we take a holistic approach and propose SGP to provide an informative birds eye view of all the activities in these social media sites around a broad topic and detect coordinated groups suspicious of engaging in misinformation campaigns. To show the effectiveness of SGP, we deploy it to provide a concise overview of polluting activity on Twitter around the upcoming 2019 Canadian Federal Elections, by analyzing over 60 thousand user accounts connected through 3.4 million connections and 1.3 million hashtags. Users in the polluting groups detected by SGP-flag are over 4x more likely to become suspended while majority of these highly suspicious users detected by SGP-flag escaped Twitter's suspending algorithm. Moreover, while few of the polluting hashtags detected are linked to misinformation campaigns, SGP-sig also flags others that have not been picked up on. More importantly, we also show that a large coordinated set of right-winged conservative groups based in the US are heavily engaged in Canadian politics.",
