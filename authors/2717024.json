In the context of SemEval-2023 competition, our team presents an exploration of a base transformer model\u2019s capabilities regarding the task, focused more specifically on five languages (English, Spanish, Swedish, German, Italian). We take DistilBERT and BERT as two examples of basic transformer models, using DistilBERT as a baseline and BERT as the platform to create an improved model. The dataset that we are using, MultiCoNER II, is a large multilingual dataset used for NER, that covers domains like: Wiki sentences, questions and search queries across 12 languages. This dataset contains 26M tokens and it is assembled from public resources. MultiCoNER II defines a NER tag-set with 6 classes and 67 tags.We have managed to get moderate results in the English track (we ranked 17th out of 34), while our results in the other tracks could be further improved in the future (overall third to last).",

Next, we give a general overview of existing vocabularies and models for different categories of LLD resource. After which we look at some of the latest developments in community standards and initiatives including descriptions of recent work on the OntoLex-Lemon model, a survey of recent initiatives in linguistic annotation and LLD, and a discussion of the LLD metadata vocabularies META-SHARE and lime. In the next part of the paper, we focus on the influence of projects on LLD models and vocabularies, starting with a general survey of relevant projects, before dedicating individual sections to a number of recent projects and their impact on LLD vocabularies and models. Finally, in the conclusion, we look ahead at some future challenges for LLD models and vocabularies. The appendix to the paper consists of a brief introduction to the OntoLex-Lemon model.",

Data annotation finds increasing use in speech recognition and synthesis with the goal to support learning processes. In this context, a variety of different annotation systems for application to Speech and Text Processing environments have been presented. Even if many designs for the data annotations workflow have emerged, the process of handling metadata, to manage complex user-defined annotations, is not covered enough. We propose a design of the format aimed to serve as an annotation standard for bimodal resources, which facilitates searching, editing and statistical analysis operations over it. The design and implementation of an infrastructure that houses the resources are also presented. The goal is widening the dissemination of bimodal corpora for research valorisation and use in applications. Also, this study reports on the main operations of the web Platform which hosts the corpus and the automatic conversion flows that brings the submitted files at the format accepted by the Platform.",

            "abstract": "\n\nAs a known key phrase extraction algorithm, TextRank is an analogue of PageRank algorithm,\nwhich relied heavily on the statistics of term frequency in the manner of co-occurrence analysis.\n\n\n\nThe frequency-based characteristic made it a neck-bottle for performance enhancement, and various improved\nTextRank algorithms were proposed in the recent years. Most of improvements incorporated semantic information into key\nphrase extraction algorithm and achieved improvement.\n\n\n\n In this research, taking both syntactic and semantic information into consideration, we integrated syntactic tree\nalgorithm and word embedding and put forward an algorithm of Word Embedding and Syntactic Information Algorithm\n(WESIA), which improved the accuracy of the TextRank algorithm.\n\n\n\nBy applying our method on a self-made test set and a public test set, the result implied that the proposed unsupervised key phrase extraction algorithm outperformed the other algorithms to some extent.\n",
