            "title": "Multi-View Clustering for Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization",
            "abstract": "Open information extraction (OIE) methods extract plenty of OIE triples  from unstructured text, which compose large open knowledge bases (OKBs). Noun phrases and relation phrases in such OKBs are not canonicalized, which leads to scattered and redundant facts. It is found that two views of knowledge (i.e., a fact view based on the fact triple and a context view based on the fact triple's source context) provide complementary information that is vital to the task of OKB canonicalization, which clusters synonymous noun phrases and relation phrases into the same group and assigns them unique identifiers. However, these two views of knowledge have so far been leveraged in isolation by existing works. In this paper, we propose CMVC, a novel unsupervised framework that leverages these two views of knowledge jointly for canonicalizing OKBs without the need of manually annotated labels. To achieve this goal, we pro- pose a multi-view CH K-Means clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce the clustering of view-specific embeddings learned from each view by considering their different clustering qualities. In order to further enhance the canonicalization performance, we propose a training data optimization strategy in terms of data quantity and data quality respectively in each particular view to refine the learned view-specific embeddings in an iterative manner. Additionally, we propose a Log-Jump algorithm to predict the optimal number of clusters in a data-driven way without requiring any labels. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple real-world OKB data sets against state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Toward Tweet Entity Linking With Heterogeneous Information Networks",
            "abstract": "Twitter, a microblogging platform, has developed into an increasingly invaluable information source, where millions of users post a great quantity of tweets with various topics per day. Heterogeneous information networks consisting of multi-type objects and relations are becoming more and more prevalent as an organization form of knowledge and information. The task of linking an entity mention in a tweet with its corresponding entity in a heterogeneous information network is of great importance, for the purpose of enriching heterogeneous information networks with the abundant and fresh knowledge embedded in tweets. However, the entity mention is ambiguous. Additionally, tweets are short and informal, making it difficult to mine enough information from a single tweet for entity linking. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised iterative clustering framework TELHIN to link multiple similar tweets with a heterogeneous information network jointly. Our framework takes three dimensions of tweet similarity into consideration: (1) content similarity, (2) temporal similarity, and (3) user similarity. The appropriate weights of different similarity dimensions for each entity mention are learned iteratively based on the metric learning algorithm by leveraging the pairwise constraints generated automatically. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in comparison with the baselines.",
