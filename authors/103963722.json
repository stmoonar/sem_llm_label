            "abstract": "Online rated datasets have become a source for large-scale population studies for analysts and a means for end-users to achieve routine tasks such as finding a book club. Existing systems however only provide limited insights into the opinions of different segments of the rater population. In this technical report, we assume that a segment, e.g., $\\langle${\\em 18-29 year old males in CA}$\\rangle$ has a rating distribution in the form of a histogram that aggregates its ratings for a set of items (e.g., {\\em movies starring Russel Crowe}) and we are interested in comparing its distribution with a given desired input distribution. We use the Earth Mover's Distance ({\\tt EMD}) to comparing rating distributions and we prove that finding segments whose rating distribution is close to input ones is NP-complete.",
