            "abstract": "The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.",

            "abstract": "Integrating large language models with knowledge graphs derived from domain-specific data represents an important advancement towards more powerful and factual reasoning. As these models grow more capable, it is crucial to enable them to perform multi-step inferences over real-world knowledge graphs while minimizing hallucination. While large language models excel at conversation and text generation, their ability to reason over domain-specialized graphs of interconnected entities remains limited. For example, can we query a model to identify the optimal contact in a professional network for a specific goal, based on relationships and attributes in a private database? The answer is no \u2013 such capabilities lie beyond current methods. However, this question underscores a critical technical gap that must be addressed. Many high-value applications in areas such as science, security, and e-commerce rely on proprietary knowledge graphs encoding unique structures, relationships, and logical constraints. We introduce a fine-tuning framework for developing Graph-aligned Language Models (GaLM) that transforms a knowledge graph into an alternate text representation with labeled question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that grounding the models in specific graph-based knowledge expands the models\u2019 capacity for structure-based reasoning. Our methodology leverages the large-language model's generative capabilities to create the dataset and proposes an efficient alternate to retrieval-augmented generation styled methods.",

            "abstract": "The Koopman operator theory provides an alternative to studying nonlinear networked dynamical systems (NDS) by mapping the state space to an abstract higher dimensional space where the system evolution is linear. The recent works show the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn state to object-centric embedding and achieve centralized block-wise computation of the Koopman operator (KO) under additional assumptions on the underlying node properties and constraints on the KO structure. However, the computational complexity of learning the Koopman operator increases for large NDS. Moreover, the computational complexity increases in a combinatorial fashion with the increase in number of nodes. The learning challenge is further ampli\ufb01ed for sparse networks by two factors: 1) sample sparsity for learning the Koopman operator in the non-linear space, and 2) the dissimilarity in the dynamics of individual nodes or from one subgraph to another. Our work aims to address these challenges by formulating the representation learning of NDS into a multi-agent paradigm and learning the Koopman operator in a distributive manner. Our theoretical results show that the proposed distributed computation of the geometric Koopman operator is bene\ufb01cial for sparse NDS, whereas for the fully connected systems this approach coincides with the centralized one. The empirical study on a rope system, a network of oscillators, and a power grid show comparable and superior performance along with computational bene\ufb01ts with the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Hyperbolic neural networks have recently gained signi\ufb01cant attention due to their promising results on several graph problems including node classi\ufb01cation and link prediction. The primary reason for this success is the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space in capturing the inherent hierarchy of graph datasets. However, they are limited in terms of generalization, scalability, and have inferior performance when it comes to non-hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we take a completely orthogonal perspective for modeling hyperbolic networks. We use Poincar\u00e9 disk to model the hyperbolic geometry and also treat it as if the disk itself is a tangent space at origin. This enables us to replace non-scalable M\u00f6bius gyrovector operations with an Euclidean approximation, and thus simplifying the entire hyperbolic model to a Euclidean model cascaded with a hyperbolic normalization function. Our approach does not adhere to M\u00f6bius math, yet it still works in the Riemannian manifold, hence we call it Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9 framework. We applied our non-linear hyperbolic normalization to the current state-of-the-art homogeneous and multi-relational graph networks and demonstrate signi\ufb01cant improvements in performance compared to both Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts. The primary impact of this work lies in its ability to capture hierarchical features in the Euclidean space, and thus, can replace hyperbolic networks without loss in performance metrics while simultaneously leveraging the power of Euclidean networks such as interpretability and ef\ufb01cient execution of various model components.",

            "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamic behavior of critical infrastructure networks, such as the power systems, is a challenging but important task. In particular, accurate and timely prediction of the (electro-mechanical) transient dynamic trajectories of the power grid is necessary for early detection of any instability and prevention of catastrophic failures. Existing approaches for prediction of dynamic trajectories either rely on the availability of accurate physical models of the system, use computationally expensive time-domain simulations, or are applicable only at local prediction problems (e.g., a single generator). In this paper, we report the application of two broad classes of data-driven learning models \u2013 along with their algorithmic implementation and performance evaluation \u2013 in predicting transient trajectories in power networks using only streaming measurements and the network topology as input. One class of models is based on the Koopman operator theory which allows for capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior via an infinite-dimensional linear operator. The other class of models is based on the graph convolutional neural networks which are adept at capturing the inherent spatio-temporal correlations within the power network. Transient dynamic datasets for training and testing the models are synthesized by simulating a wide variety of load change events in the IEEE 68-bus system, categorized by the load change magnitudes, as well as by the degree of connectivity and the distance to nearest generator nodes. The results confirm that the proposed predictive models can successfully predict the post-disturbance transient evolution of the system with a high level of accuracy.",

To handle more complex questions, we aim at creating knowledge base from clinical notes to link different patients and clinical notes, and performing knowledge base question answering (KBQA). Based on the expert annotations available in the n2c2 dataset, we first created the ClinicalKBQA dataset that includes around 9K QA pairs and covers questions about seven medical topics using more than 300 question templates. Then, we investigated an attention-based aspect reasoning (AAR) method for KBQA and analyzed the impact of different aspects of answers (e.g., entity, type, path, and context) for prediction. The AAR method achieves better performance due to the well-designed encoder and attention mechanism. From our experiments, we find that both aspects, type and path, enable the model to identify answers satisfying the general conditions and produce lower precision and higher recall. On the other hand, the aspects, entity and context, limit the answers by node-specific information and lead to higher precision and lower recall.",

            "abstract": "Koopman operator theory provides a model-free and purely data-driven technique for studying nonlinear dynamical systems. Since the Koopman operator is infinite-dimensional, researchers have developed several methods that provide a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator so that it can be applied for practical use cases. One common thing with most of the methods is that their solutions are obtained by solving a centralized minimization problem. In this work, we treat the dynamical system to be a multi-agent system and propose an algorithm to compute the finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator in a distributed manner using the knowledge of the topology of the underlying multi-agent system. The proposed distributed approach results in a sparse Koopman whose block structure mimics the Laplacian of the multi-agent system. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the proposed framework on the network of oscillators and the IEEE 68 bus system.",

            "abstract": "Malicious activities on measurements from sensors like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) can mislead the control center operator into taking wrong control actions resulting in disruption of operation, financial losses, and equipment damage. In particular, false data attacks initiated during power systems transients caused due to abrupt changes in load and generation can fool the conventional model-based detection methods relying on thresholds comparison to trigger an anomaly. In this paper, we propose a Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) based algorithm to detect and identify false data attacks in real-time. The Koopman modes (KMs) are capable of capturing the nonlinear modes of oscillation in the transient dynamics of the power networks and reveal the spatial embedding of both natural and anomalous modes of oscillations in the sensor measurements. The Koopman-based spatio-temporal nonlinear modal analysis is used to filter out the false data injected by an attacker. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated on the IEEE 68-bus test system using synthetic attack scenarios generated on GridSTAGE, a recently developed multivariate spatio-temporal data generation framework for simulation of adversarial scenarios in cyber-physical power systems.",
