            "title": "Improving Distinguishability of Class for Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and applications due to their excellent performance in graph representation learning. Most existing GNNs can only aggregate 1-hop neighbors in a GNN layer, so they usually stack multiple GNN layers to obtain more information from larger neighborhoods. However, many studies have shown that model performance experiences a significant degradation with the increase of GNN layers. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of distinguishability of class to indirectly evaluate the learned node representations, and verify the positive correlation between distinguishability of class and model performance. Then, we propose a Graph Neural Network guided by Distinguishability of class (Disc-GNN) to monitor the representation learning, so as to learn better node representations and improve model performance. Specifically, we first perform inter-layer filtering and initial compensation based on Local Distinguishability of Class (LDC) in each layer, so that the learned node representations have the ability to distinguish different classes. Furthermore, we add a regularization term based on Global Distinguishability of Class (GDC) to achieve global optimization of model performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have shown that the competitive performance of Disc-GNN to the state-of-the-art methods on node classification and node clustering tasks.",

            "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention because it can self-supervisedly extract low-dimensional representation of graph data. InfoNCE-based loss function is widely used in graph contrastive learning, which pulls the representations of positive pairs close to each other and pulls the representations of negative pairs away from each other. Recent works mainly focus on designing new augmentation methods or sampling strategies. However, we argue that the widely used InfoNCE-based methods may contain an implicit conflict which seriously confuses models when learning from negative pairs. This conflict is engendered by the encoder's message-passing mechanism and the InfoNCE loss function. As a result, the learned representations between negative samples cannot be far away from each other, compromising the model performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to report and analysis this conflict of GCL. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective method called Partial ignored Graph Contrastive Learning (PiGCL). Specifically, PiGCL first dynamically captures the conflicts during training by detecting the gradient of representation similarities. It then enables the loss function to ignore the conflict, allowing the encoder to adaptively learn the ignored information without self-supervised samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Community detection, aiming at partitioning a network into multiple substructures, is practically importance. Graph convolutional network (GCN), a new deep-learning technique, has recently been developed for community detection. Markov Random Fields (MRF) has been combined with GCN in the MRFasGCN method to improve accuracy. However, the existing GCN community-finding methods are semi-supervised, even though community finding is essentially an unsupervised learning problem. We developed a new GCN approach for unsupervised community detection under the framework of Autoencoder. We cast MRFasGCN as an encoder and then derived node community membership in the hidden layer of the encoder. We introduced a community-centric dual decoder to reconstruct network structures and node attributes separately in an unsupervised fashion, for faithful community detection in the input space. We designed a scheme of local enhancement to accommodate nodes to have more common neighbors and similar attributes with similar community memberships. Experimental results on real networks showed that our new method outperformed the best existing methods, showing the effectiveness of the novel decoding mechanism for generating links and attributes together over the commonly used methods for reconstructing links alone.",

            "abstract": "Facial expressions recognition and synthesis are important research fields to study how human beings reflect to environments in affective computing. With the rapid development of mathematical theory on multivariate statistics and multi-media technology especially image processing, facial expressions recognition researchers have achieved many useful results. Recently studies show that approaches to facial modeling and expressions recognition and synthesis analysis could be adapted to control security or even real-time health monitoring in the real world. Similarity, how to achieve facial expressions recognition and synthesis for independent-free mechanism is a central design in general. Based on the cognitive analysis of independent user's affective facial recognition researches we proposed an emotions composition model to dope out what are the user's new affective facial expressions. At this point, principal component, cluster and discriminate analysis were applied to show and verify independent user's affective expressions can be composited for synthesis by basic facial expressions such as happy, neutral and unhappy. Experiments were conducted to prove our models to be very significant.",
