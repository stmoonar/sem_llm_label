            "title": "ESPP: Efficient Sector-Based Charging Scheduling and Path Planning for WRSNs With Hexagonal Topology",
            "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that can potentially mitigate the energy provisioning problem for sensor networks. In order to efficiently replenish energy for these battery-powered devices, designing appropriate scheduling and charging path planning algorithms is essential and challenging. Whilst previous studies have tackled this challenge, the conjoint influences of network topology, charging path planning, and energy threshold distribution in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) are still in their infancy. We mitigate the aforementioned problem by proposing novel algorithmic solutions to efficient sector-based on-demand charging scheduling and path planning. Specifically, we first propose a hexagonal cluster-based deployment of nodes such that finding an NP-Complete Hamiltonian path is feasible. Second, each cluster is divided into multiple sectors and a charging path planning algorithm is implemented to yield a Hamiltonian path, aimed at improving the Mobile Charging Vehicle (MCV) efficiency and charging throughput. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the importance of nodes to be used for charging duration decision-making and prioritization. Fourth, a non-preemptive dynamic priority scheduling algorithm is proposed for charging tasks\u2019 assignments and scheduling. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted, revealing the significant advantages of our proposed algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, response time, dead nodes\u2019 density, and queuing processing.",

            "title": "Performance Analysis of CUPS-Enabled Space-Ground Cellular Networks",
            "abstract": "Control- and User-Plane Separation (CUPS) and Space Cellular Networks (SCNs) are promising solutions for delivering ubiquitous connectivity and high-traffic wireless services on a global scale. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of CUPS in the separation networks' coverage and data service functions has not been fully leveraged in enabling reliable connectivity. In this paper, we propose a CUPS-enabled Integrated Space-Ground Cellular Network (CUPS-ISGCN). Specifically, Control Base Stations (CBSs) are optimized by deploying them on the space layer to form the Control Plane (CP) and increase coverage for more users over a wide area. Meanwhile, Traffic Base Stations (TBSs) located on the ground layer form the User Plane (UP) and deliver high bit rates within the coverage area of the CP. To maximize CP coverage and improve UP efficiency, we introduce CUPS-enabled SCN into the CP and provide the analytical models to analyze the performance of the CUPS-ISGCN in terms of CP coverage and UP efficiency. By using stochastic geometry, we derive the general closed-form expressions for CP coverage. Then, we thoroughly study UP's performance as a function of the channel parameters between 2-planes, CP and UP. Based on the analysis results, it's proved that the proposed CUPS-ISGCN structure improved the CP coverage performance and UP efficiency.",
