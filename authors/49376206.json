            "title": "A Domain Specific Computing Architecture for Open 6G Baseband Signal Processing",
            "abstract": "The vision of decoupled software and hardware for wireless communications has prompted the application of Open-Radio-Access-Networks (O-RANs) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Such a structure is beneficial to operators for flexible and low-cost network deployment, and to terminals for continuously evolving wireless technologies. Conventionally, they rely on General-Purpose-Processors (GPPs) such as Intel\u2019s x86 processors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for digital baseband signal processing. However, concerns regarding energy efficiency, open software environment and programmability still hinder the development. This paper proposes a domain specific manycore architecture based on RISC-V instruction extension and a multi-level dataflow programming model for open-source baseband signal processing in 6G networks. The proposed architecture shows promising performance which is comparable to state-of-the-art FPGA implementations, and meanwhile flexibility in terms of software programmability.",

            "abstract": "Motivation for reform and development for teaching of college English is strengthened by the increasing popularity of computers and global network technology. This paper analyzes the relationship between computer network teaching and the improvement of students\u2019 autonomous learning ability, and the advantage of computer network teaching in actual teaching based on reviewing the theoretical basis and several learning models for autonomous learning done in the spirit of College English Curriculum Requirements issued in 2008. The promotion of a new teaching model for the improvement of students\u2019 autonomous learning ability has been verified by the research and survey on teaching model of college English under the environment of computer network in Xi-dian University.",

With the vigorous development of distance education in recent years,the huge potential of education market and fierce competition bring new opportunities and challenges.Information collection and feedback of learner are important subjects in this field. Several methods of data mining and knowledge discovery can settle this matter.This study presents a new procedure,joining quantitative value of RFM (Recency,Frequency and Monetary) model and naive Bayesian algorithm,to classify the learners and offer more support to make decision. Moreover,the experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and accurate.",
