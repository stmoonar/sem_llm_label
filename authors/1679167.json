            "title": "Evaluation of GPT and BERT-based models on identifying proteinprotein interactions in biomedical text",
            "abstract": "Detecting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding genetic mechanisms, disease pathogenesis, and drug design. However, with the fast-paced growth of biomedical literature, there is a growing need for automated and accurate extraction of PPIs to facilitate scientific knowledge discovery. Pre-trained language models, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have shown promising results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluated the performance of PPI identification of multiple GPT and BERT models using three manually curated gold-standard corpora: Learning Language in Logic (LLL) with 164 PPIs in 77 sentences, Human Protein Reference Database with 163 PPIs in 145 sentences, and Interaction Extraction Performance Assessment with 335 PPIs in 486 sentences. BERT-based models achieved the best overall performance, with BioBERT achieving the highest recall (91.95%) and F1-score (86.84%) and PubMedBERT achieving the highest precision (85.25%). Interestingly, despite not being explicitly trained for biomedical texts, GPT-4 achieved commendable performance, comparable to the top-performing BERT models. It achieved a precision of 88.37%, a recall of 85.14%, and an F1-score of 86.49% on the LLL dataset. These results suggest that GPT models can effectively detect PPIs from text data, offering promising avenues for application in biomedical literature mining. Further research could explore how these models might be fine-tuned for even more specialized tasks within the biomedical domain.",

            "title": "Foundational Development of an Occupation Ontology",
            "abstract": "The classification of occupations, key to policy development regarding the economy, education, research, organizational infrastructure, as well as health and safety analysis, has received considerable attention and development over the last half century. However, international and national standardized taxonomies, while very well executed, are dissimilar, dated and could benefit from a new organization employing ontological methods. This paper builds the case for the development of an Occupation Ontology, showing an approach that employs successful methods of the Open Biological and Biomedical (OBO) Foundry. The importance of occupations and their characterization is described, and four popular taxonomies available in English are presented and compared. We selected and transformed the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Standard Occupational Classification into a prototype OBO compliant ontology, designated OccO, to illustrate the presentation of occupational information as an ontology. OccO is then compared to the representation of occupations in the fastest growing semantic web knowledge base, Wikidata, where occupations are organized neither in compliance with any standard taxonomy nor with a consistent upper level ontological framework. We then present the benefits of developing an ontology-driven occupational framework. This development is at the alpha stage, with the hope that the concept of an occupation ontology will gain the support of research organizations who could cooperate to formulate and demonstrate the utility of a well-designed and widely used ontology for occupations.",

Our manual literature annotations have identified 150 cell-specific markers for 73 kidney cell types and 38 diabetic kidney disease (DKD)-related biomarkers. To systematically study these biomarkers, we first surveyed and ontologically defined the term biomarker and different types of biomarkers. The Kidney Tissue Atlas Ontology (KTAO) has been further used as a platform to model and represent these kidney biomarkers by including the biomarker gene name, cell type, disease, and axioms linking the biomarkers and other terms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed 9 shared enriched GO terms in both biomarker sets. A DL-query was performed to demonstrate the advantages of ontology-based modeling and analysis of kidney biomarkers.",

            "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found to be common among COVID-19 patients. In this study, we performed extensive literature mining and used the BioGRID COVID-19 interaction data to bridge the mechanistic and molecular link between COVID-19 and AKI. DAVID GO enrichment analysis of the BioGRID data allowed for further filtration of COVID-19 related interactors by their relevance to untoward kidney manifestations. Key physiological processes involved in this pathway include Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) activation, complement activation, and most importantly, systemic inflammation. Discovered interactors like CD147, CD209, CypA, and MASP2 were found to be heavily implicated in the mentioned processes. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) was used to represent our analyzed results, leading to further understanding of the COVID-19 associated AKI mechanisms. \u00a9 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",

Concurrently, these factors also dramatically increase the difficulty in developing NLP models in multi-site settings, which is necessary for algorithm robustness and generalizability. Here, we reported on our experience developing an NLP solution for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) signs and symptom extraction in an open NLP framework from a subset of sites participating in the National COVID Cohort (N3C). We then empirically highlight the benefits of multi-site data for both symbolic and statistical methods, as well as highlight the need for federated annotation and evaluation to resolve several pitfalls encountered in the course of these efforts.",

            "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the main comorbidity of COVID-19, and the pathogenesis remains unclear. This study first performed a gene set enrichment analysis of 6 AKI-related Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) studies and identified 3,876 AKI-associated genes. By incorporating COVID-19 related interactions from BioGRID, we further found 1,027 genes associated with both COVID-19 and AKI. Our Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these genes showed that viral and inflammation-related biological processes played important roles on COVID-19 related AKI. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pathways ranked second in the top 5 KEGG-enriched pathways, in which 66 enriched genes were all upregulated in the kidney tissue of the above 6 GEO studies. Ontology modeling is currently undergoing to systematically and logically represent the AKI pathogenesis process in COVID-19 patients. \u00a9 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",

            "abstract": "While we pay attention to the latest advances in clinical natural language processing (NLP), we can notice some resistance in the clinical and translational research community to adopt NLP models due to limited transparency, Interpretability and usability. Built upon our previous work, in this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework and evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The generated corpora derived out of the texts from multiple intuitions and gold standard annotation are tested on a single institution's rule set has the performances in F1 score of 0.876, 0.706 and 0.694, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe goal of this study is to develop a robust Time Event Ontology (TEO), which can formally represent and reason both structured and unstructured temporal information.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nUsing our previous Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology 1.0 and 2.0 as a starting point, we redesigned concept primitives (clinical events and temporal expressions) and enriched temporal relations. Specifically, 2 sets of temporal relations (Allen's interval algebra and a novel suite of basic time relations) were used to specify qualitative temporal order relations, and a Temporal Relation Statement was designed to formalize quantitative temporal relations. Moreover, a variety of data properties were defined to represent diversified temporal expressions in clinical narratives.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTEO has a rich set of classes and properties (object, data, and annotation). When evaluated with real electronic health record data from the Mayo Clinic, it could faithfully represent more than 95% of the temporal expressions. Its reasoning ability was further demonstrated on a sample drug adverse event report annotated with respect to TEO. The results showed that our Java-based TEO reasoner could answer a set of frequently asked time-related queries, demonstrating that TEO has a strong capability of reasoning complex temporal relations.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTEO can support flexible temporal relation representation and reasoning. Our next step will be to apply TEO to the natural language processing field to facilitate automated temporal information annotation, extraction, and timeline reasoning to better support time-based clinical decision-making.",
