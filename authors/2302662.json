            "abstract": "Abstract Quantitative assessment of single cell fluxome is critical for understanding the metabolic heterogeneity in diseases. Unfortunately, laboratory-based single cell fluxomics is currently impractical, and the current computational tools for flux estimation are not designed for single cell-level prediction. Given the well-established link between transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles, leveraging single cell transcriptomics data to predict single cell fluxome is not only feasible but also an urgent task. In this study, we present FLUXestimator, an online platform for predicting metabolic fluxome and variations using single cell or general transcriptomics data of large sample-size. The FLUXestimator webserver implements a recently developed unsupervised approach called single cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), which uses a new neural network architecture to estimate reaction rates from transcriptomics data. To the best of our knowledge, FLUXestimator is the first web-based tool dedicated to predicting cell-/sample-wise metabolic flux and metabolite variations using transcriptomics data of human, mouse and 15 other common experimental organisms. The FLUXestimator webserver is available at http://scFLUX.org/, and stand-alone tools for local use are available at https://github.com/changwn/scFEA. Our tool provides a new avenue for studying metabolic heterogeneity in diseases and has the potential to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

            "abstract": "The vision of decoupled software and hardware for wireless communications has prompted the application of Open-Radio-Access-Networks (O-RANs) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Such a structure is beneficial to operators for flexible and low-cost network deployment, and to terminals for continuously evolving wireless technologies. Conventionally, they rely on General-Purpose-Processors (GPPs) such as Intel\u2019s x86 processors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for digital baseband signal processing. However, concerns regarding energy efficiency, open software environment and programmability still hinder the development. This paper proposes a domain specific manycore architecture based on RISC-V instruction extension and a multi-level dataflow programming model for open-source baseband signal processing in 6G networks. The proposed architecture shows promising performance which is comparable to state-of-the-art FPGA implementations, and meanwhile flexibility in terms of software programmability.",

            "abstract": "Matrix low rank approximation is an effective method to reduce or eliminate the statistical redundancy of its components. Compared with the traditional global low rank methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD), local low rank approximation methods are more advantageous to uncover interpretable data structures when clear duality exists between the rows and columns of the matrix. Local low rank approximation is equivalent to low rank submatrix detection. Unfortunately,existing local low rank approximation methods can detect only submatrices of specific mean structure, which may miss a substantial amount of true and interesting patterns. In this work, we develop a novel matrix computational framework called RPSP (Random Probing based submatrix Propagation) that provides an effective solution for the general matrix local low rank representation problem. RPSP detects local low rank patterns that grow from small submatrices of low rank property, which are determined by a random projection approach. RPSP is supported by theories of random projection. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that RPSP outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, with the capacity to robustly and correctly identify the low rank matrices when the pattern has a similar mean as the background, background noise is heteroscedastic and multiple patterns present in the data. On real-world datasets, RPSP also demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying interpretable local low rank matrices.",

            "abstract": "Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) is a combinatorial problem arising from a wide range of applications including recommendation system, collaborative filtering, and dimensionality reduction. Currently, the noise model of existing BMF methods is often assumed to be homoscedastic; however, in real world data scenarios, the deviations of observed data from their true values are almost surely diverse due to stochastic noises, making each data point not equally suitable for fitting a model. In this case, it is not ideal to treat all data points as equally distributed. Motivated by such observations, we introduce a probabilistic BMF model that recognizes the object- and feature-wise bias distribution respectively, called bias aware BMF (BABF). To the best of our knowledge, BABF is the first approach for Boolean decomposition with consideration of the feature-wise and object-wise bias in binary data. We conducted experiments on datasets with different levels of background noise, bias level, and sizes of the signal patterns, to test the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios. We demonstrated that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art factorization methods in both accuracy and efficiency in recovering the original datasets, and the inferred bias level is highly significantly correlated with true existing bias in both simulated and real world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Metastatic cancer accounts for over 90% of all cancer deaths, and evaluations of metastasis potential are vital for minimizing the metastasis-associated mortality and achieving optimal clinical decision-making. Computational assessment of metastasis potential based on large-scale transcriptomic cancer data is challenging because metastasis events are not always clinically detectable. The under-diagnosis of metastasis events results in biased classification labels, and classification tools using biased labels may lead to inaccurate estimations of metastasis potential. This issue is further complicated by the unknown metastasis prevalence at the population level, the small number of confirmed metastasis cases, and the high dimensionality of the candidate molecular features. Our proposed algorithm, called Positive and unlabeled Learning from Unbalanced cases and Sparse structures (PLUS), is the first to use a positive and unlabeled learning framework to account for the under-detection of metastasis events in building a classifier. PLUS is specifically tailored for studying metastasis that deals with the unbalanced instance allocation as well as unknown metastasis prevalence, which are not considered by other methods. PLUS achieves superior performance on synthetic datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Application of PLUS to The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer gene expression data generated metastasis potential predictions that show good agreement with the clinical follow-up data, in addition to predictive genes that have been validated by independent single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.",

The development of graph neural network (GNN) has greatly advanced the analysis of ordinary graphs with pair-wise relations. However, these methods could not be easily extended to the case of hypergraph. In this paper, we generalize the challenges of GNN in representing higher-order data in principle, which are edge- and node-level ambiguities. To overcome the challenges, we present SNALS that utilizes bipartite graph neural network with structural features to collectively tackle the two ambiguity issues. SNALS captures the joint interactions of a hyperedge by its local environment, which is retrieved by collecting the spectrum information of their connections. As a result, SNALS achieves nearly 30% performance increase compared with most recent GNN-based models. In addition, we applied SNALS to predict genetic higher-order interactions on 3D genome organization data. SNALS showed consistently high prediction accuracy across different chromosomes, and generated novel findings on 4-way gene interaction, which is further validated by existing literature.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Spatial Robust Mixture Regression model to investigate the relationship between a response variable and a set of explanatory variables over the spatial domain, assuming that the relationships may exhibit complex spatially dynamic patterns that cannot be captured by constant regression coefficients. Our method integrates the robust finite mixture Gaussian regression model with spatial constraints, to simultaneously handle the spatial non-stationarity, local homogeneity, and outlier contaminations. Compared with existing spatial regression models, our proposed model assumes the existence a few distinct regression models that are estimated based on observations that exhibit similar response-predictor relationships. As such, the proposed model not only accounts for non-stationarity in the spatial trend, but also clusters observations into a few distinct and homogenous groups. This provides an advantage on interpretation with a few stationary sub-processes identified that capture the predominant relationships between response and predictor variables. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates robust procedures to handle contaminations from both regression outliers and spatial outliers. By doing so, we robustly segment the spatial domain into distinct local regions with similar regression coefficients, and sporadic locations that are purely outliers. Rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure has been designed to test the significance of such segmentation. Experimental results on many synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of our proposed method, compared with other robust finite mixture regression, spatial regression and spatial segmentation methods.",

            "abstract": "Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of thousands of cells with distinct phenotypic and physiological states in a complex tissue. Substantial efforts have been made to characterize single cells of distinct identities from scRNA-seq data, including various cell clustering techniques. While existing approaches can handle single cells in terms of different cell (sub)types at a high resolution, identification of the functional variability within the same cell type remains unsolved. In addition, there is a lack of robust method to handle the inter-subject variation that often brings severe confounding effects for the functional clustering of single cells. In this study, we developed a novel data denoising and cell clustering approach, namely CIBS, to provide biologically explainable functional classification for scRNA-seq data. CIBS is based on a systems biology model of transcriptional regulation that assumes a multi-modality distribution of the cells\u2019 activation status, and it utilizes a Boolean matrix factorization approach on the discretized expression status to robustly derive functional modules. CIBS is empowered by a novel fast Boolean Matrix Factorization method, namely PFAST, to increase the computational feasibility on large scale scRNA-seq data. Application of CIBS on two scRNA-seq datasets collected from cancer tumor micro-environment successfully identified subgroups of cancer cells with distinct expression patterns of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix marker genes, which was not revealed by the existing cell clustering analysis tools. The identified cell groups were significantly associated with the clinically confirmed lymph-node invasion and metastasis events across different patients.",
