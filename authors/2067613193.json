            "abstract": "Human travel and social contacts are deemed as the key force in driving the transmission of infectious diseases. Consequently, epidemic models should represent individuals\u2019 spatiotemporal contacts in detail to investigate the complex process of epidemic diffusion. Mathematical epidemic models usually assume a homogeneous human population and describe unstructured contacts. Most network-based epidemic models do not synthetically consider the temporal and spatial features of human structured contact behaviors. We here combined a social network with a bipartite network to build a multilayer agent network to model heterogeneous individuals\u2019 temporal and spatial structured contacts. We used the largest collective outbreak of H1N1 influenza at a Chinese university in 2009 as a case study. Experimental results indicate that our models can reproduce individuals\u2019 daily travel and social contact patterns, as well as the H1N1 influenza outbreak. We found that only quarantining dormitories to stop interbuilding transmission could not achieve a great effect in mitigating epidemic outbreaks at a university. The prohibition of students\u2019 visiting across dormitory rooms was indispensable to prevent intrabuilding transmission of infectious diseases. Furthermore, it would be better to quarantine admitted case patients\u2019 close contacts to control potentially latent individuals.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the application of a computational theory and related techniques for studying emergency management in social computing. We propose a novel software framework called KD-ACP. The framework provides a systematic and automatic platform for scientists to study the emergency management problems in three aspects: modelling the society in emergency scenario as the artificial society; investigating the emergency management problems by the repeat computational experiments; parallel execution between artificial society and the actual society managed by the decisions from computational experiments. The software framework is composed of a series of tools. These tools are categorized into three parts corresponding to \u201cA,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d and \u201cP,\u201d respectively. Using H1N1 epidemic in Beijing city as the case study, the modelling and data generating of Beijing city, experiments with settings of H1N1, and intervention measures and parallel execution by situation tool are implemented by KD-ACP. The results output by the software framework shows that the emergency response decisions can be tested to find a more optimal one through the computational experiments. In the end, the advantages of the KD-ACP and the future work are summarized in the conclusion.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale artificial societies with millions or billions of agents call for high-performance parallel simulation. Prevailing supercomputers with thousands of CPUs and GPUs make it possible to carry out such simulation. The key is to distribute large-scale agents to massive cores of CPUs and GPUs properly for parallel computing with efficient communication and synchronization. For simplicity and efficiency, a modified discrete event system specification (DEVS) is proposed for large-scale artificial society modeling and parallelism is exploited in agent models because similar agents usually share similar behaviors. Through phased synchronization, a two-tier parallel simulation engine is designed with support of MPI and OpenCL where GPU is used as coprocessor. One-sided communication is used for reflection of remote simulation objects and message passing between processes. A general kernel function prototype is elaborately designed and conditionally compiled for execution on both CPU and GPU. An artificial society for epidemic study is used to test the performance on a supercomputer with 1024 CPU cores and 1792 GPU cores. The speedup reaches 3512 for even 2 billion agents with GPU acceleration which is far over 701 when only CPUs are used. It turns out feasible for parallel simulation of large-scale artificial society with GPU as coprocessor.",

            "abstract": "Parallel simulations focus on conservative or optimistic algorithms to guarantee state consistency and causal order of messages between logical processes (LPs). It is usually hard for application domain users to develop complicated models for parallel simulations. For simplicity in large-scale artificial society, a modified DEVS component model is advocated in time-stepped parallel simulation with two-phase synchronization. A two-tier parallel simulation engine is designed on CPU/GPU mixed architecture with support of MPI and OpenCL. One-sided communication is selected for reflection of remote components and message passing between LPs. For cooperation between CPU and GPU, a size of 512 work items in each group is recommended. The parallel simulation engine is implemented in a micro kernel manner. An artificial society based on agent, container, grid and relation models are used to test the performance on an ordinary computer and a cluster with varied scales. The maximum speedup reaches 46 and 114 on the computer and the cluster respectively with about half a million agents.",
