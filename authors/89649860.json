            "title": "Knowledge-guided analysis of \"omics\" data using the KnowEnG cloud platform",
            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "We present an open source extensible web framework for the analysis of different farm practices and programs and easy dissemination of their results to the users. Currently, this framework is being applied to two use cases --- a web-based decision support system for cover crop management and a web-based farm program analysis tool to assist farmers, academics, and policymakers to understand programs and policies surrounding the Farm Bill. Through the first use case, we address the problem of bridging the gap between the scientific research that happens in labs and experimental plots and the day to day practices and decisions taken by the farmers in the fields. Specifically, this use case focuses on the practice of cover crops, their management, and the impact on reducing nutrient runoff into water bodies. Through the second use case, we address the problem of predicting the expected payment amounts and measured risk or probability of payment for different government insurance programs authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill, namely the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC). This helps the farmers compare these programs based on forecasted crop yields and prices. In this paper, we describe the overall architecture of the framework and its major components, the use cases that are currently benefiting from using this framework and share screenshots of the web applications developed using this framework for those use cases. We also share our plans for future work and conclusions about applying this framework to the two use cases.",
