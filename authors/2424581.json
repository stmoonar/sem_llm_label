            "abstract": "Biases in algorithmic systems have led to discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups, including the reinforcement of outdated gender stereotypes. While a substantial body of research addresses biases in algorithms and underlying data, in this work, we study if and how users themselves reflect these biases in their interactions with systems, which expectedly leads to the further manifestation of biases. More specifically, we investigate the replication of stereotypical gender representations by users in formulating online search queries. Following prototype theory, we define the disproportionate mention of the gender that does not conform to the prototypical representative of a searched domain (e.g., \u201cmale nurse\u201d) as an indication of bias. In a pilot study with 224 US participants and a main study with 400 UK participants, we find clear evidence of gender biases in formulating search queries. We also report the effects of an educative text on user behaviour and highlight the wish of users to learn about bias-mitigating strategies in their interactions with search engines.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The potential of occupational exoskeletons can only be realized if workers are willing to wear them on their bodies. As classical technology acceptance theories originate in research into information technology, they do not sufficiently cover the peculiarities of exoskeletons, and thus greater focus is needed on factors that specifically shape intentions to use them. Involving three companies from food retail and logistics, we conducted guided focus groups with 18 workers who perform material handling tasks in their daily work. Participants discussed the envisioned benefits, risks, and conditions related to the adoption of exoskeletons. Consistent with established technology acceptance models, performance-related and effort-related factors were found to be highly recognized. Participants also highlighted factors such as wellbeing, fairness, and the altered physical appearance of wearers, which was considered important in social contexts at work. Complementing established factors with new exoskeleton-specific determinants, our results are a valuable starting point for further exoskeleton user studies.",

            "title": "Crisis Ahead? Why Human-Robot Interaction User Studies May Have Replicability Problems and Directions for Improvement",
            "abstract": "There is a confidence crisis in many scientific disciplines, in particular disciplines researching human behavior, as many effects of original experiments have not been replicated successfully in large-scale replication studies. While human-robot interaction (HRI) is an interdisciplinary research field, the study of human behavior, cognition and emotion in HRI plays also a vital part. Are HRI user studies facing the same problems as other fields and if so, what can be done to overcome them? In this article, we first give a short overview of the replicability crisis in behavioral sciences and its causes. In a second step, we estimate the replicability of HRI user studies mainly 1) by structural comparison of HRI research processes and practices with those of other disciplines with replicability issues, 2) by systematically reviewing meta-analyses of HRI user studies to identify parameters that are known to affect replicability, and 3) by summarizing first replication studies in HRI as direct evidence. Our findings suggest that HRI user studies often exhibit the same problems that caused the replicability crisis in many behavioral sciences, such as small sample sizes, lack of theory, or missing information in reported data. In order to improve the stability of future HRI research, we propose some statistical, methodological and social reforms. This article aims to provide a basis for further discussion and a potential outline for improvements in the field.",

Yet the discourse of Explainable AI (XAI) has been predominantly focused on algorithm-centered approaches, suffering from gaps in meeting user needs and exacerbating issues of algorithmic opacity. To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. There is a need to chart the domain and shape the discourse of XAI with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of this workshop is to examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels. Encouraging holistic (historical, sociological, and technical) approaches, we put an emphasis on \u201coperationalizing\u201d, aiming to produce actionable frameworks, transferable evaluation methods, concrete design guidelines, and articulate a coordinated research agenda for XAI.",

            "abstract": "In human-robot collaborative interaction scenarios, nonverbal communication plays an important role. Both, signals sent by a human collaborator need to be identified and interpreted by the robotic system, and the signals sent by the robot need to be identified and interpreted by the human. In this paper, we focus on the latter. We implemented on an industrial robot in a VR environment nonverbal behavior signalling the user that it is now their turn to proceed with a pick-and-place task. The signals were presented in four different test conditions: no signal, robot arm gesture, light signal, combination of robot arm gesture and light signal. Test conditions were presented to the participants in two rounds. The qualitative analysis was conducted with focus on (i) potential signals in human behaviour indicating why some participants immediately took over from the robot whereas others needed more time to explore, (ii) human reactions after the nonverbal signal of the robot, and (iii) whether participants showed different behaviours in the different test conditions. We could not identify potential signals why some participants were immediately successful and others not. There was a bandwidth of behaviors after the robot stopped working, e.g. participants rearranged the objects, looked at the robot or the object, or gestured the robot to proceed. We found evidence that robot deictic gestures were helpful for the human to correctly interpret what to do next. Moreover, there was a strong tendency that humans interpreted the light signal projected on the robot's gripper as a request to give the object in focus to the robot. Whereas a robot's pointing gesture at the object was a strong trigger for the humans to look at the object.",

Exoskeletons, that is, physical assistance systems that are worn on the body, could help. The conditions under which workers would be willing to use this new wearable technology, however, remain largely unclear. In this exploratory field study, 58 supermarket employees tested one or more out of five passive exoskeletons during their regular work. Perceived wearing comfort, extent of strain relief, and task-technology fit (i.e., how well the exoskeleton fit their current task requirements) were found to correlate significantly with post-trial intention to use. Soft exoskeletons were rated as preferable to rigid ones. Trying one of the latter also resulted in lower intention to use, which was revealed to be fully mediated by a better task-technology fit being ascribed to soft exoskeletons. Practical relevance of the results, study limitations and future research directions are discussed.",

Given the growing popularity of speech interfaces, a coherent design of a robot's looks and its voice is becoming more important. Which robot voice fits which appearance, however, has hardly been investigated to date. This is where the present research comes in. A randomized lab experiment was conducted, in which 165 participants listened to one of five more or less humanlike robot voices and subsequently drew a sketch corresponding to their imagination of the robot. The sketches were analyzed regarding the presence of various body features. While some features appeared in almost all drawings regardless of the condition (e.g., head, eyes), other features were significantly more prevalent in voice conditions characterized by low human-likeness (wheels) or high human-likeness (e.g., nose). Our results give first hints on which embodiment users might expect from different robotic voices.",

            "abstract": "Social networking sites such as Facebook provide individuals with opportunities to express and gather information relevant to their self-concept. Previous theoretical work yielded contrasting assumptions about a potential link between individuals\u2019 Internet use and their self-concept clarity, that is, individuals\u2019 perception of a clear and internally consistent self-concept content. Focusing on social networking sites, our aim was to provide cross-sectional as well as longitudinal evidence regarding the relationship between individuals\u2019 feelings of connectedness to Facebook (Facebook intensity) and self-concept clarity. Two cross-sectional studies (N1 = 244; N2 = 166) and one longitudinal study (N3 = 101) are presented. Independent samples of adolescents, adults, and students from Austria participated. The statistical procedures included hierarchical regression analyses (Studies 1 and 2) and a cross-lagged panel analysis (Study 3). The studies provided consistent evidence of a negative relationship between Facebook intensity and self-concept clarity. Moreover, the longitudinal study showed that Facebook intensity predicted a decline in self-concept clarity over time whereas a reverse pathway was not supported. Future research should examine the content of the self-concept and should continue searching for specific Facebook activities that might explain the decline in self-concept clarity. Our results suggest that an intense attachment to Facebook contributes to an inconsistent and unclear self-concept.",

            "abstract": "First evidence suggests that introducing robots by means of a narrative story can lead to more positive interactions and evaluations [1]. It is unclear whether this positive framing of robots by narratives works equally for different robot design approaches and appearances. To address this open question we conducted 2\u00d76 between-subjects online experiment and varied the introduction (narrative vs. instruction manual) and appearance of the robot (6 different robot appearances). We replicated previous results on evaluation effects for different robot appearances. Results indicate that robots introduced by a narrative story were evaluated as being more likable, intelligent, autonomous, and humanlike. They were also perceived to be less mechanical and less uncanny. However, there were no interaction effects between narration and robot appearance suggesting that narration is beneficial for robots regardless of their appearance and hence is a strong mechanism to shape positive expectations before actually interacting with a robot.",
