            "abstract": "Food-safety inspection is regularly executed by the government for quality assessment. Evidence from recent research demonstrates that inspection accuracy and consistency are affected by inspection biases that result from an operational decision: inspector scheduling. More precisely, an inspector's stringency in an inspection is affected by the inspection results at the previous-inspected establishment (outcome effects) and when this inspection occurs within a workday (daily-schedule effects). To our best knowledge, the impact of these effects on scheduling decisions has not been studied in the scheduling literature. In this paper, we study a novel food inspector scheduling problem with these effects, where the inspector should scrutinise establishments with different locations. The problem is viewed as a single-machine scheduling problem with a complex objective function including (i) inspection accuracy, (ii) inspection consistency and (iii) workload of the inspector. To facilitate quantitative analyses of these effects, we model them by sequence-dependent functions and formulate a mixed integer linear programming model. To overcome the computational difficulty in large-scale problems, an efficient Tabu Search algorithm is developed. Experiment results on 135 randomly generated instances with up to 50 establishments and 10 workdays validate the efficiency of the solution method. Besides, managerial insights are drawn.",

            "abstract": "Lane reservation optimization is important in intelligent transportation systems. Most existing studies are carried out under deterministic road conditions by assuming constant road travel time. However, road conditions vary due to various factors, resulting in uncertain road travel time. This work addresses a new reliability-based lane reservation and route design problem by considering uncertain road travel time with its known mean and covariance matrix. It aims to decide which road segments in a network should implement reserved lanes and to design routes for special time-crucial transportation tasks. The objective is to maximize transportation service reliability (i.e., the probability of completing the special tasks on time). For this problem, a novel distributionally robust optimization model is first established. To solve it, this work proposes i) an adapted sample average approximation-based approach and ii) a two-stage hierarchical heuristic algorithm based on second-order cone programming. Experimental results on an illustrative example and a real-world case demonstrate that the latter is more effective and efficient than the former. In addition, we conduct a series of parameter sensitivity analysis experiments to reveal the factors affecting lane reservation and provide optimal solutions given different parameter settings.",

            "abstract": "Scheduling-Location (ScheLoc) problem considering machine location and job scheduling simultaneously is a relatively new and hot topic. The existing works assume that only one machine can be placed at a location, which may not be suitable for some practical applications. Besides, the customer credit risk which largely impacts the manufacturer's profit has not been addressed in the ScheLoc problem. Therefore, in this work, we study a new and general stochastic parallel machine ScheLoc problem with limited location capacity and customer credit risk. The problem consists of determining the machine-to-location assignment, job acceptance, job-to-machine assignment, and scheduling of accepted jobs on each machine. The objective is to maximize the worst-case probability of manufacturer's profit being greater than or equal to a given profit (referred to as the profit likelihood). For the problem, a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) programming model is proposed. Then, we develop two model-based approaches: (i) a sample average approximation (SAA) method; (ii) a model-based constructive heuristic. Numerical results of 300 instances adapted from the literature show the average profit likelihood proposed by the constructive heuristic is 9.43% higher than that provided by the SAA, while the average computation time of the constructive heuristic is only 4.24% of that needed by the SAA.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates a new lane reservation problem with task merging that consists of optimally determining which lanes in a transportation network have to be reserved and designing reserved lane-based routes in the network for time-crucial transport tasks. Part of the tasks whose destinations are geographically close is merged to reduce the number of vehicles and transport costs. Reserved lanes can reduce the travel time of task vehicles passing through them, while they will generate negative impact on normal traffic, such as traffic delay to the vehicles on adjacent non-reserved lanes. The objective is to minimize the total negative impact of all reserved lanes. For this problem, two new integer linear programming (ILP) models are first developed. The complexity of the problem is proved to be NP-hard. Since commercial solver (like CPLEX) is time-consuming for solving it when the problem size increases, a fast and effective improved differential evolution algorithm (IDEA) is developed based on explored problem properties. Extensive experimental results for a real-life case and benchmark instances of up to 500 nodes in the network and 30 transport tasks show the favorable performance of the IDEA, as compared to CPLEX, differential evolution algorithm and genetic algorithm. Management insights are also drawn to support practical decision-making.",

The risk of HAZMAT transportation has great uncertainty due to the time-varying conditions of its transportation location and environment. If an accident occurs, it will bring severe casualties and social losses, which makes risk management challenging. For this problem, considering the nonlinearity and complexity between risk factors, the Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) is applied to describe this relationship. In this work, we consider the intervention impact within a limited budget on risk factors in the CBN. In addition, due to the deep risk uncertainty and the data scarcity, interval probability is introduced. Then a new robust optimization approach that combines the do-calculus on CBN and a mathematical programming model is developed to minimize the worst-case HAZMAT road transportation risk. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted, and some insights are presented.",

In practice, end-of-life (EOL) products to be disassembled may be heterogeneous, and the actual processing time of each task may vary with its assigned worker. This work studies a stochastic multi-product DLBP with workforce assignment, to minimise the system cost. Due to historical data scarcity, we assume that only partial distributional information of uncertain task processing times is known. Exceeding the preset cycle time may lead to a disassembly performance reduction, thus we control the cycle time violation via conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraints, i.e. in a risk-averse fashion. For the problem, we first propose a novel formulation with distributionally robust CVaR constraints. Then some valid inequalities are proposed, leading to an improved model. Two solution approaches, i.e. an exact cutting-plane method and an approximation method, are further proposed and compared, via numerical experiments. Some managerial insights are also drawn.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem (ALWABP) is an important research topic originated from sheltered work centres for disabled, in which workforce is assumed to be heterogeneous due to their disabilities. Since the employment of disabled workers may sustain higher absenteeism rates due to their health, especially under COVID-19, employing temporary workers to fill labour shortage is a crucial issue. In addition, in practice, the movement of workers between stations on assemble lines can increase the flexibility of worker assignment. In this study, we investigate a new risk-averse ALWABP with uncertain disabled worker availability, limited temporary workers and moving workers. The objective is to minimise the risk-averse weighted sum of the cycle time and the number of employed temporary workers. For the problem, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated. The first stage assigns specific tasks (called fixed tasks) to stations, while the second stage assigns workers and remaining tasks (called flexible tasks) to stations. A genetic algorithm combining K-means clustering approach and variable neighbourhood search (GAKV) is designed. Experiment results show the superiority of the GAKV in terms of solution quality and computation time compared with sample average approximation (SAA). In addition, managerial insights are drawn.",

However, the uncertainty existing in job release times may largely impact the performance as well.

The problem consists of a two-stage decision-making process: (i) assigning jobs to machines on the first stage before the realisation of uncertain parameters (job release times and processing times) and (ii) scheduling jobs on the second stage given the job-to-machine assignment and the realisation of uncertain parameters. The objective is to minimise the total cost, including the setup cost on machines (induced by job-to-machine assignment) and the expected penalty cost of jobs' earliness and tardiness. A two-stage stochastic program is proposed, and the sample average approximation (SAA) method is applied.

            "abstract": "Air traffic flow management is one of the most important operations in terminal airports heavily relying on advanced intelligence transportation techniques. This work considers a two-stage runway scheduling problem given a set of flights with uncertain arrival times. The first-stage problem is to identify a sequence of aircraft weight classes (e.g., Heavy, Large and Small) that minimizes runway occupying time (i.e., makespan). Then the second-stage decision is dedicated to scheduling the flights as punctually as possible after their arrival times realized, which translates into determining a sequence of flights for each aircraft category such that the total deviation time imposed on the flights is minimized. Instead of an exactly known probability distribution, information on uncertain parameters is limited (i.e., ambiguous), such as means, mean absolute deviations and support set of random parameters derived from historical data. Under this information on the random parameters, an ambiguous mixed-integer stochastic optimization model is proposed. For such a problem, we approximately construct a worst-case discrete probability distribution with three possible realizations per random parameter, and adopt a hybrid sample average approximation algorithm in which genetic algorithms are used to replace commercial solvers. To illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm, extensive numerical experiments are carried out.",

            "abstract": "Due to gradual disappearance of global demographic dividend, the improvement of workforce efficiency becomes increasingly important. It has been commonly recognised that workforce motivation can largely stimulate the workers, especially in manufacturing systems. This paper investigates a worker scheduling problem under given work shifts with workforce motivation effects, where motivation effects are characterised by motivation coefficients of job processing times. We focus on the situation where motivation coefficients are uncertain due to various factors, and only the mean vector and covariance matrix are known. The objective is to maximise the service level, measured by the probability of ensuring no tardy jobs. We first propose a distributionally robust chance constrained formulation with a probabilistic objective function. Then an adapted sample average approximation (SAA) method and a heuristic, based on an approximated mixed integer second-order cone programming (MI-SOCP) model and the idea of problem decomposition, is developed. Numerical results show that the decomposition-based heuristic is more efficient. We also draw some managerial insights.",
