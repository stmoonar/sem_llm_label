            "title": "M3oE: Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of Experts Recommendation Framework",
            "abstract": "Multi-domain recommendation and multi-task recommendation have demonstrated their effectiveness in leveraging common information from different domains and objectives for comprehensive user modeling. Nonetheless, the practical recommendation usually faces multiple domains and tasks simultaneously, which cannot be well-addressed by current methods. To this end, we introduce M3oE, an adaptive Multi-domain Multi-task Mixture-of-Experts recommendation framework. M3oE integrates multi-domain information, maps knowledge across domains and tasks, and optimizes multiple objectives. We leverage three mixture-of-experts modules to learn common, domain-aspect, and task-aspect user preferences respectively to address the complex dependencies among multiple domains and tasks in a disentangled manner. Additionally, we design a two-level fusion mechanism for precise control over feature extraction and fusion across diverse domains and tasks. The framework's adaptability is further enhanced by applying AutoML technique, which allows dynamic structure optimization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, our M3oE is the first effort to solve multi-domain multi-task recommendation self-adaptively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets against diverse baselines demonstrate M3oE's superior performance. The implementation code is available to ensure reproducibility.",

            "title": "Rethinking Sensors Modeling: Hierarchical Information Enhanced Traffic Forecasting",
            "abstract": "With the acceleration of urbanization, traffic forecasting has become an essential role in smart city construction. In the context of spatio-temporal prediction, the key lies in how to model the dependencies of sensors. However, existing works basically only consider the micro relationships between sensors, where the sensors are treated equally, and their macroscopic dependencies are neglected. In this paper, we argue to rethink the sensor's dependency modeling from two hierarchies: regional and global perspectives. Particularly, we merge original sensors with high intra-region correlation as a region node to preserve the inter-region dependency. Then, we generate representative and common spatio-temporal patterns as global nodes to reflect a global dependency between sensors and provide auxiliary information for spatio-temporal dependency learning. In pursuit of the generality and reality of node representations, we incorporate a Meta GCN to calibrate the regional and global nodes in the physical data space. Furthermore, we devise the cross-hierarchy graph convolution to propagate information from different hierarchies. In a nutshell, we propose a Hierarchical Information Enhanced Spatio-Temporal prediction method, HIEST, to create and utilize the regional dependency and common spatio-temporal patterns. Extensive experiments have verified the leading performance of our HIEST against state-of-the-art baselines. We publicize the code to ease reproducibility1.",
