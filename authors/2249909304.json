            "abstract": "HILDA brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and results on human-data interaction. It explores how data management and analysis can be made more effective when taking into account the people who design and build these processes as well as those who are impacted by their results. Following the past two years, we plan to continue to focus on this year's workshop on early-stage research that is promising and exciting, which includes pairing each accepted paper with a mentor. The theme for this edition of the workshop is HILDA and Large Language Models. However, the workshop is not limited to this theme and other topics are also of interest. In this summary, we describe the workshop, its main focus areas, our review and mentorship plan as well as the keynote and panel sessions.",

            "abstract": "Scalability is an issue in visualization and visual analytics. The dataset sizes we can handle are lagging behind by several levels of magnitude compared to domains such as database, artificial intelligence, and simulation. The standard method for addressing scalability consists of adding more resources: more processors, more GPUs, more memory, and faster networks. Unfortunately, this method will not solve the visualization scalability problem alone. It does not solve the crucial issues of maintaining latency under critical limits to allow exploration and taming human attention during long-lasting computations. Progressive Data Analysis (PDA) emerged about a decade ago to address this scalability problem, showing promising but challenging solutions. I will show a few examples of applications. However, PDA is still lagging behind, mainly because of domain boundaries coming from academic research.",

            "abstract": "We explore the design space for the static visualization of datasets with quantitative attributes that vary over multiple orders of magnitude-we call these attributes Orders of Magnitude Values (OMVs)-and provide design guidelines and recommendations on effective visual encodings for OMVs. Current charts rely on linear or logarithmic scales to visualize values, leading to limitations in performing simple tasks for OMVs. In particular, linear scales prevent the reading of smaller magnitudes and their comparisons, while logarithmic scales are challenging for the general public to understand. Our design space leverages the approach of dividing OMVs into two different parts: mantissa and exponent, in a way similar to scientific notation. This separation allows for a visual encoding of both parts. For our exploration, we use four datasets, each with two attributes: an OMV, divided into mantissa and exponent, and a second attribute that is nominal, ordinal, time, or quantitative. We start from the original design space described by the Grammar of Graphics and systematically generate all possible visualizations for these datasets, employing different marks and visual channels. We refine this design space by enforcing integrity constraints from visualization and graphical perception literature. Through a qualitative assessment of all viable combinations, we discuss the most effective visualizations for OMVs, focusing on channel and task effectiveness. The article's main contributions are 1) the presentation of the design space of OMVs, 2) the generation of a large number of OMV visualizations, among which some are novel and effective, 3) the refined definition of a scale that we call E+M for OMVs, and 4) guidelines and recommendations for designing effective OMV visualizations. These efforts aim to enrich visualization systems to better support data with OMVs and guide future research.",

            "title": "A Survey on Progressive Visualization",
            "abstract": "Currently, growing data sources and long-running algorithms impede user attention and interaction with visual analytics applications. Progressive visualization (PV) and visual analytics (PVA) alleviate this problem by allowing immediate feedback and interaction with large datasets and complex computations, avoiding waiting for complete results by using partial results improving with time. Yet, creating a progressive visualization requires more effort than a regular visualization but also opens up new possibilities, such as steering the computations towards more relevant parts of the data, thus saving computational resources. However, there is currently no comprehensive overview of the design space for progressive visualization systems. We surveyed the related work of PV and derived a new taxonomy for progressive visualizations by systematically categorizing all PV publications that included visualizations with progressive features. Progressive visualizations can be categorized by well-known visualization taxonomies, but we also found that progressive visualizations can be distinguished by the way they manage their data processing, data domain, and visual update. Furthermore, we identified key properties such as uncertainty, steering, visual stability, and real-time processing that are significantly different with progressive applications. We also collected evaluation methodologies reported by the publications and conclude with statistical findings, research gaps, and open challenges.",

            "abstract": "We present a first investigation into hybrid-image visualization for data analysis in large-scale viewing environments. Hybrid-image visualizations blend two different visual representations into a single static view, such that each representation can be perceived at a different viewing distance. Our work is motivated by data analysis scenarios that incorporate one or more displays with sufficiently large size and resolution to be comfortably viewed by different people from various distances. Hybrid-image visualizations can be used, in particular, to enhance overview tasks from a distance and detail-in-context tasks when standing close to the display. By using a perception-based blending approach, hybrid-image visualizations make two full-screen visualizations accessible without tracking viewers in front of a display. We contribute a design space, discuss the perceptual rationale for our work, provide examples, and introduce a set of techniques and tools to aid the design of hybrid-image visualizations.",

            "abstract": "Today's large and high-resolution displays coupled with powerful graphics hardware offer the potential for highly realistic 3D virtual environments, but also cause increased target acquisition difficulty for users interacting with these environments. We present an adaptation of semantic pointing to object picking in 3D environments. Essentially, semantic picking shrinks empty space and expands potential targets on the screen by dynamically adjusting the ratio between movement in visual space and motor space for relative input devices such as the mouse. Our implementation operates in the image-space using a hierarchical representation of the standard stencil buffer to allow for real-time calculation of the closest targets for all positions on the screen. An informal user study indicates that subjects perform more accurate pointing with semantic 3D pointing than without.",

            "abstract": "Boosting of least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithms can classify large datasets on standard personal computers (PCs). We extend the LS-SVM proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle in several ways to efficiently classify large datasets. We developed a row-incremental version for datasets with billions of data points and up to 10,000 dimensions. By adding a Tikhonov regularization term and using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula, we developed a column-incremental LS-SVM to process datasets with a small number of data points but very high dimensionality. Finally, by applying boosting to these incremental LS-SVM algorithms, we developed classification algorithms for massive, very-high-dimensional datasets, and we also applied these ideas to build boosting of other efficient SVM algorithms proposed by Mangasarian, including Lagrange SVM (LSVM), proximal SVM (PSVM) and Newton SVM (NSVM). Numerical test results on UCI, RCV1- binary, Reuters-21578, Forest cover type and KDD cup 1999 datasets showed that our algorithms are often significantly faster and/or more accurate than state-of- the-art algorithms LibSVM, SVM-perf and CB-SVM.",
