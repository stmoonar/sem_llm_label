            "abstract": "Disentanglement is a highly desirable property of representation due to its similarity with human understanding and reasoning. However, the performance of current disentanglement approaches is still unreliable and largely depends on the hyperparameter selection. Inspired by fractional distillation in chemistry, we propose DEFT, a disen-tanglement framework, to raise the lower limit of disentanglement approaches based on variational autoencoder. It applies a multi-stage training strategy, including multi-group encoders with different learning rates and piecewise disentanglement pressure, to stage by stage distill entangled factors. Furthermore, we provide insight into identifying the hyperparameters according to the information thresholds. We evaluate DEFT on three variants of dSprite and SmallNORB, showing robust and high-level disentanglement scores.",

            "title": "A Novel Velocity Reinforced Mechanism on Improving Particle Swarm optimization for Ill-conditioned Problems",
            "abstract": "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) in recent years has been widely applied to solve various real world problems. However, for ill conditioned problems with largely different sensitivity to the objective function, classical PSO cannot search for optimal solution efficiently due to the best position-guided strategy that wastes lots of source searching undesirable areas. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel velocity reinforced mechanism (VR) for solving m-conditional problems. Two implementations of the mechanism, velocity reinforced particle swarm optimization and velocity reinforced search, are introduced in this paper. VR updates its velocity by learning and correcting best velocity directly, instead of using classical best position-guided updating rules. In this way, it increases the possibility that finds better directions for m-conditional problems. Experiments indicate that the novel approaches improve the final results and efficiency.",

            "title": "A Novel Graphic Bending Transformation on Benchmark",
            "abstract": "Classical benchmark problems utilize multiple transformation techniques to increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape\u2019s \"shape\", but rather than change the \"view point\". For instance, after rotated, ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.",

            "abstract": "With the arrival of the era of \u201cwe media\u201d, Community Question Answering(CQA) websites become a special \u201cwe media\u201d platforms gradually. In this type of platforms, it has evolved as an interesting problem of discover the most authoritative answer provider in different fields because the number of authoritative answer providers is a key influential factor in a successful CQA system. Recently, there are some methods mining the authoritative users who focus on the quality of the answers provided. However, the contents of answers vary a lot and will become complex if they include images or videos, which makes the works hardly can be applied in real-time applications. To address this issue, this proposal aims to mine the most authoritative answer providers, which has attracted considerable research attentions recently. In particular, we first construct a graph with every asker or answer provider being a vertex and their relationships being edges, and then propose a novel approach to compute an appropriate weight for each answer provider based on the PageRank algorithm widely used in social network search area for ranking the users preferred answers on the top. Finally, we will rank the top authoritative answer providers according to their weights to obtain the most influence ones. We still conduct extensive experiments to sufficiently evaluate the performance of our proposal.",
