            "abstract": "Chronic disease management and follow-up are vital for realizing sustained patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Recent advancements in wearable sensing technologies, particularly wrist-worn devices, offer promising solutions for longitudinal patient follow-up by shifting from subjective, intermittent self-reporting to objective, continuous monitoring. However, collecting and analyzing wearable data presents unique challenges, such as data entry errors, non-wear periods, missing wearable data, and wearable artifacts. We therefore present an in-depth exploration of data analysis challenges tied to wrist-worn wearables and ambulatory label acquisition, using two real-world datasets (i.e., mBrain21 and ETRI lifelog2020). We introduce novel practical countermeasures, including participant compliance visualizations, interaction-triggered questionnaires to assess personal bias, and an optimized wearable non-wear detection pipeline. Further, we propose a visual analytics approach to validate processing pipelines using scalable tools such as tsflex and Plotly-Resampler. Lastly, we investigate the impact of missing wearable data on\"window-of-interest\"analysis methodologies. Prioritizing transparency and reproducibility, we offer open access to our detailed code examples, facilitating adaptation in future wearable research. In conclusion, our contributions provide actionable approaches for wearable data collection and analysis in chronic disease management.",

            "title": "From Lab to Real World: Assessing the Effectiveness of Human Activity Recognition and Optimization through Personalization",
            "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) algorithms today are designed and evaluated on data collected in controlled settings, providing limited insights into their performance in real-world situations with noisy and missing sensor data and natural human activities. We present a real-world HAR open dataset compiled from a wristband equipped with a triaxial accelerometer. During data collection, participants had autonomy in their daily life activities, and the process remained unobserved and uncontrolled. A general convolutional neural network model was trained on this dataset, achieving a mean balanced accuracy (MBA) of 80%. Personalizing the general model through transfer learning can yield comparable and even superior results using fewer data, with the MBA improving to 85%. To emphasize the issue of insufficient real-world training data, we conducted training of the model using the public MHEALTH dataset, resulting in 100% MBA. However, upon evaluating the MHEALTH-trained model on our real-world dataset, the MBA drops to 62%. After personalizing the model with real-world data, an improvement of 17% in the MBA is achieved. This paper showcases the potential of transfer learning to make HAR models trained in different contexts (lab vs. real-world) and on different participants perform well for new individuals with limited real-world labeled data available.",

            "abstract": "Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data from heterogeneous sources with domain knowledge and context information in real-time is a challenging task in IoT healthcare data management applications that can be solved with semantics. Existing IoT platforms often have issues with preserving the privacy of patient data. Moreover, configuring and managing context-aware stream processing queries in semantic IoT platforms requires much manual, labor-intensive effort. Generic queries can deal with context changes but often lead to performance issues caused by the need for expressive real-time semantic reasoning. In addition, query window parameters are part of the manual configuration and cannot be made context-dependent. To tackle these problems, this paper presents DIVIDE, a component for a semantic IoT platform that adaptively derives and manages the queries of the platform\u2019s stream processing components in a context-aware and scalable manner, and that enables privacy by design. By performing semantic reasoning to derive the queries when context changes are observed, their real-time evaluation does require any reasoning. The results of an evaluation on a homecare monitoring use case demonstrate how activity detection queries derived with DIVIDE can be evaluated in on average less than 3.7 seconds and can therefore successfully run on low-end IoT devices.",

            "title": "Towards Knowledge-Driven Symptom Monitoring & Trigger Detection of Primary Headache Disorders",
            "abstract": "Headache disorders are experienced by many people around the world. In current clinical practice, the follow-up and diagnosis of headache disorder patients only happens intermittently, based on subjective data self-reported by the patient. The mBrain system tries to make this process more continuous, autonomous and objective by additionally collecting contextual and physiological data via a wearable, mobile app and machine learning algorithms. To support the monitoring of headache symptoms during attacks for headache classification and the detection of headache triggers, much knowledge and contextual data is available from heterogeneous sources, which can be consolidated with semantics. This paper presents a demonstrator of knowledge-driven services that perform these tasks using Semantic Web technologies. These services are deployed in a distributed cascading architecture that includes DIVIDE to derive and manage the RDF stream processing queries that perform the contextually relevant filtering in an intelligent and efficient way.",
