            "abstract": "Due to the continuing colossal socio-economic losses caused by traffic accidents, it is of prime importance to precisely forecast the traffic accident risk to reduce future accidents. In this paper, we use dangerous driving statistics from driving log data and multi-graph learning to enhance predictive performance. We first conduct geographical and temporal correlation analyses to quantify the relationship between dangerous driving and actual accidents. Then, to learn various dependencies between districts besides the traditional adjacency matrix, we simultaneously model both static and dynamic graphs representing the spatio-temporal contextual relationships with heterogeneous environmental data, including the dangerous driving behavior. A graph is generated for each type of the relationships. Ultimately, we propose an end-to-end framework, called MG-TAR, to effectively learn the association of multiple graphs for accident risk prediction by adopting multi-view graph neural networks with a multi-attention module. Thorough experiments on ten real-world datasets show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, MG-TAR reduces the error of predicting the accident risk by up to 23% and improves the accuracy of predicting the most dangerous areas by up to 27%.",

            "abstract": "Labels are typically sparse in real-world time series due to the high annotation cost. Recently, consistency regularization techniques have been used to generate artificial labels from unlabeled augmented instances. To fully exploit the sequential characteristic of time series in consistency regularization, we propose a novel method of data augmentation called context-attached augmentation , which adds preceding and succeeding instances to a target instance to form its augmented instance. Unlike the existing augmentation techniques that modify a target instance by directly perturbing its attributes, the context-attached augmentation generates instances augmented with varying contexts while maintaining the target instance. Based on our augmentation method, we propose a context consistency regularization framework, which first adds different contexts to a target instance sampled from a given time series and then shares unitary reliability-based cross-window labels across the augmented instances to maintain consistency. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art consistency regularization frameworks through comprehensive experiments on real-world time-series datasets.",

            "abstract": "Online anomaly detection from a data stream is critical for the safety and security of many applications but is facing severe challenges due to complex and evolving data streams from IoT devices and cloud-based infrastructures. Unfortunately, existing approaches fall too short for these challenges; online anomaly detection methods bear the burden of handling the complexity while offline deep anomaly detection methods suffer from the evolving data distribution. This paper presents a framework for online deep anomaly detection, ARCUS, which can be instantiated with any autoencoder-based deep anomaly detection methods. It handles the complex and evolving data streams using an adaptive model pooling approach with two novel techniques: concept-driven inference and drift-aware model pool update; the former detects anomalies with a combination of models most appropriate for the complexity, and the latter adapts the model pool dynamically to fit the evolving data streams. In comprehensive experiments with ten data sets which are both high-dimensional and concept-drifted, ARCUS improved the anomaly detection accuracy of the streaming variants of state-of-the-art autoencoder-based methods and that of the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods by up to 22% and 37%, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Real-time outlier detection from a data stream has become increasingly important in the current hyperconnected world. This paper focuses on an important yet unaddressed challenge in continuous outlier detection: the multiplicity and dynamicity of queries. This challenge arises from various contexts of outliers evolving over time, but the state-of-the-art algorithms cannot handle the challenge effectively, as they can only process a fixed set of outlier detection queries for each data point separately. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, abbreviated as MDUAL, based on a new idea called duality-based unified processing. The underlying rationale is to exploit the duality of data and queries so that a group of similar data points are processed together by a group of similar queries incrementally. Two main techniques embodying the idea, data-query grouping and prioritized group processing, are employed. Comprehensive experiments showed that MDUAL runs 216 to 221 times faster while consuming 11 to 13 times less memory than the state-of-the-art algorithms through its efficient and effective handling of the multiplicity-dynamicity challenge.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning has emerged as a new paradigm of collaborative machine learning; however, many prior studies have used global aggregation along a star topology without much consideration of the communication scalability or the diurnal property relied on clients' local time variety. In contrast, ring architecture can resolve the scalability issue and even satisfy the diurnal property by iterating nodes without an aggregation. Nevertheless, such ring-based algorithms can inherently suffer from the high-variance problem. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called TornadoAggregate that improves both accuracy and scalability by facilitating the ring architecture. In particular, to improve the accuracy, we reformulate the loss minimization into a variance reduction problem and establish three principles to reduce variance: Ring-Aware Grouping, Small Ring, and Ring Chaining. Experimental results show that TornadoAggregate improved the test accuracy by up to 26.7% and achieved near-linear scalability.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of efficiently detecting outliers from a data stream as old data points expire from and new data points enter the window incrementally. The proposed method is based on a newly discovered characteristic of a data stream that the change in the locations of data points in the data space is typically very insignificant. This observation has led to the finding that the existing distance-based outlier detection algorithms perform excessive unnecessary computations that are repetitive and/or canceling out the effects. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel set-based approach to detecting outliers, whereby data points at similar locations are grouped and the detection of outliers or inliers is handled at the group level. Specifically, a new algorithm NETS is proposed to achieve a remarkable performance improvement by realizing set-based early identification of outliers or inliers and taking advantage of the \"net effect\" between expired and new data points. Additionally, NETS is capable of achieving the same efficiency even for a high-dimensional data stream through two-level dimensional filtering. Comprehensive experiments using six real-world data streams show 5 to 25 times faster processing time than state-of-the-art algorithms with comparable memory consumption. We assert that NETS opens a new possibility to real-time data stream outlier detection.",
