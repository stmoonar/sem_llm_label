            "abstract": "Safety control is one of the most important tasks for power grid operation. However, safety control and risk warning models with high accuracy always have multitudinous parameters and need scaled resources for calculation. So as to sort out this problem, we proposed a novel and adaptive model lightweight method based on knowledge distillation. In our method, the intermediate features of the teacher network is utilized to guide the learning of the student network and a regressor is introduced behind the selected middle layer of teacher network to realize dimension match. The prediction confidence of teacher network is mapped to the feature space for the regressor initialization. Besides, the prediction confidence is used to construct the distillation temperature to improve the adaptability of information transfer. Experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR 100 and Grid-specific datasets demonstrate the lightweight model obtained by our method possesses powerful and adaptive feature extraction and representation ability.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks have proved its capability in many machine learning tasks. The effectiveness of deep neural networks in real-world applications, however, is greatly affected by the distribution discrepancy between the training and testing data. To address the issue, domain adaptation methods have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method which combines the feature learning and the distribution estimation into one learning framework, enabling automatic update of feature representations through fine-tuning parameterized distributions. As such, our model can produce an unified distribution to represent both source and target samples. Furthermore, two new regularizers are integrated into the optimization objective to minimize the divergence of the unified distribution from those of source and target domains. Experiments on character reconstruction show that our method demonstrates much better learning ability compared to the existing variational autoencoder. More importantly, our method improves recognition accuracy by more than 5% from that of the state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation tasks built upon popular character datasets.",

            "abstract": "Judging imaging quality is an important part of the maintenance of visual intelligent monitoring systems for electrical power scenes. However, accurate and efficient identification of possible abnormalities in imaging quality remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel multi-region two-stream deep architecture to improve judging abnormalities. The proposed architecture incorporates two-stream scheme and multi-region strategy to identify relevant information and explore hidden details. More specifically, in addition to color and intensity in the original images, the two-stream scheme uses high-frequency structure information from gradient images to enhance its performance. The multi-region strategy employs spatial pyramid random cropping and region fusion to handle locally non-uniform changes among categories: spatial pyramid random cropping characterizes images at different spatial pyramid levels, while region fusion focuses attention on cropped regions relevant to quality perception by using adaptive learning weights in a fully connected layer. In this way, the proposed strategy guides the framework to adequately and adaptively explore the discriminative regions hidden in the input images, and provides an end-to-end learning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate its strong performance for judging abnormalities, and the proposed method can be easily extended to the entire surveillance system.",

            "abstract": "The status judgment of converter valve equipment is an important part of ultra high voltage maintenance. However, accurate judgment of possible failures remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel multi-region deep architecture to improve abnormal judgement by considering long-range context information in increasingly finer spatial regions. Specifically, the specified characteristics of video sequence will be completely explored through C3D and recurrent neural network with LSTM cells, extracting high-level spatio-temporal features. In addition, spatial pyramid crop is proposed to characterize each video at different spatial pyramid levels. These sampling sub-videos can encode locally saliency among categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.",
