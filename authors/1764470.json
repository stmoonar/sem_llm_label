            "abstract": "This position paper presents ThothSP, a Semantic Programming framework with the aim of lowering the coding effort in building smart applications on the Device-Edge-Cloud continuum by leveraging semantic knowledge. It introduces a novel neural-symbolic stream fusion mechanism, which enables the specification of data fusion pipelines via declarative rules, with degrees of learnable probabilistic weights. Moreover, it includes an adaptive federator that allows the Thoth\u22b3runtime to be distributed across multiple compute nodes in a network, and to coordinate their resources to collaboratively process tasks by delegating partial workloads to their peers. To demonstrate ThothSP's capability, we report a case study on a distributed camera network to show ThothSP's behaviour against a traditional edge-cloud setup.",

            "title": "Building a P2P RDF Store for Edge Devices",
            "abstract": "The Semantic Web technologies have been used in the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate data interoperability and address data heterogeneity issues. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) model is employed in the integration of IoT data, with RDF engines serving as gateways for semantic integration. However, storing and querying RDF data obtained from distributed sources across a dynamic network of edge devices presents a challenging task. The distributed nature of the edge shares similarities with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. These similarities include attributes like node heterogeneity, limited availability, and resources. The nodes primarily undertake tasks related to data storage and processing. Therefore, the P2P models appear to present an attractive approach for constructing distributed RDF stores. Based on P-Grid, a data indexing mechanism for load balancing and range query processing in P2P systems, this paper proposes a design for storing and sharing RDF data on P2P networks of low-cost edge devices. Our design aims to integrate both P-Grid and an edge-based RDF storage solution, RDF4Led for building an P2P RDF engine. This integration can maintain RDF data access and query processing while scaling with increasing data and network size. We demonstrated the scaling behavior of our implementation on a P2P network, involving up to 16 nodes of Raspberry Pi 4 devices.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, billions of phones, IoT and edge devices around the world generate data continuously, enabling many Machine Learning (ML)-based products and applications. However, due to increasing privacy concerns and regulations, these data tend to reside on devices (clients) instead of being centralized for performing traditional ML model training. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed approach in which a single server and multiple clients collaboratively build an ML model without moving data away from clients. Whereas existing studies on FL have their own experimental evaluations, most experiments were conducted using a simulation setting or a small-scale testbed. This might limit the understanding of FL implementation in realistic environments. In this empirical study, we systematically conduct extensive experiments on a large network of IoT and edge devices (called IoT-Edge devices) to present FL real-world characteristics, including learning performance and operation (computation and communication) costs. Moreover, we mainly concentrate on heterogeneous scenarios, which is the most challenging issue of FL. By investigating the feasibility of on-device implementation, our study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, promoting the practicality of FL and assisting in improving the current design of real FL systems.",

            "abstract": "The availability of vast amounts of visual data with heterogeneous features is a key factor for developing, testing, and benchmarking of new computer vision (CV) algorithms and architectures. Most visual datasets are created and curated for specific tasks or with limited image data distribution for very specific situations, and there is no unified approach to manage and access them across diverse sources, tasks, and taxonomies. This not only creates unnecessary overheads when building robust visual recognition systems, but also introduces biases into learning systems and limits the capabilities of data-centric AI. To address these problems, we propose the Vision Knowledge Graph (VisionKG), a novel resource that interlinks, organizes and manages visual datasets via knowledge graphs and Semantic Web technologies. It can serve as a unified framework facilitating simple access and querying of state-of-the-art visual datasets, regardless of their heterogeneous formats and taxonomies. One of the key differences between our approach and existing methods is that ours is knowledge-based rather than metadatabased. It enhances the enrichment of the semantics at both image and instance levels and offers various data retrieval and exploratory services via SPARQL. VisionKG currently contains 519 million RDF triples that describe approximately 40 million entities, and are accessible at https://vision.semkg.org and through APIs. With the integration of 30 datasets and four popular CV tasks, we demonstrate its usefulness across various scenarios when working with CV pipelines.",

However, a traditional DNN-based data fusion pipeline like object tracking has to hard-wire an engineered set of DNN models to a fixed processing logic, which makes it difficult to infuse new models to that pipeline. To overcome this, we propose a novel neural-symbolic stream reasoning approach realised by semantic stream reasoning programs which specify DNN-based data fusion pipelines via logic rules with learnable probabilistic degrees as weights. The reasoning task over this program is governed by a novel incremental reasoning algorithm, which lends itself also as a core building block for a scalable and parallel algorithm to learn the weights for such program. Extensive experiments with our first prototype on multi-object tracking benchmarks for autonomous driving and traffic monitoring show that our flexible approach can considerably improve both accuracy and processing throughput compared to the DNN-based counterparts.",

            "abstract": "Semantic interoperability for the Internet of Things (IoT) is enabled by standards and technologies from the Semantic Web. As recent research suggests a move towards decentralised IoT architectures, we have investigated the scalability and robustness of RDF (Resource Description Framework)engines that can be embedded throughout the architecture, in particular at edge nodes. RDF processing at the edge facilitates the deployment of semantic integration gateways closer to low-level devices. Our focus is on how to enable scalable and robust RDF engines that can operate on lightweight devices. In this paper, we have first carried out an empirical study of the scalability and behaviour of solutions for RDF data management on standard computing hardware that have been ported to run on lightweight devices at the network edge. The findings of our study shows that these RDF store solutions have several shortcomings on commodity ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) boards that are representative of IoT edge node hardware. Consequently, this has inspired us to introduce a lightweight RDF engine, which comprises an RDF storage and a SPARQL processor for lightweight edge devices, called RDF4Led. RDF4Led follows the RISC-style (Reduce Instruction Set Computer) design philosophy. The design constitutes a flash-aware storage structure, an indexing scheme, an alternative buffer management technique and a low-memory-footprint join algorithm that demonstrates improved scalability and robustness over competing solutions. With a significantly smaller memory footprint, we show that RDF4Led can handle 2 to 5 times more data than popular RDF engines such as Jena TDB (Tuple Database) and RDF4J, while consuming the same amount of memory. In particular, RDF4Led requires 10%\u201330% memory of its competitors to operate on datasets of up to 50 million triples. On memory-constrained ARM boards, it can perform faster updates and can scale better than Jena TDB and Virtuoso. Furthermore, we demonstrate considerably faster query operations than Jena TDB and RDF4J.",
