            "abstract": "The application of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts, including finance, has expanded rapidly. Domain-specific LLMs are typically evaluated based on their performance in various downstream tasks relevant to the domain. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of fine-tuning LLMs for such tasks. Somewhat counterintuitively, we find that in domain-specific cases, fine-tuning exclusively on the target task is not always the most effective strategy. Instead, multi-task fine-tuning - where models are trained on a cocktail of related tasks - can significantly enhance performance. We demonstrate how this approach enables a small model, such as Phi-3-Mini, to achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing the much larger GPT-4-o model on financial benchmarks. Our study involves a large-scale experiment, training over 200 models using several widely adopted LLMs as baselines, and empirically confirms the benefits of multi-task fine-tuning. Additionally, we explore the use of general instruction data as a form of regularization, suggesting that it helps minimize performance degradation. We also investigate the inclusion of mathematical data, finding improvements in numerical reasoning that transfer effectively to financial tasks. Finally, we note that while fine-tuning for downstream tasks leads to targeted improvements in task performance, it does not necessarily result in broader gains in domain knowledge or complex domain reasoning abilities.",

            "abstract": "We combine vision transformers with operator learning to solve diverse inverse problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach, named ViTO, combines a U-Net based architecture with a vision transformer. We apply ViTO to solve inverse PDE problems of increasing complexity, namely for the wave equation, the Navier-Stokes equations and the Darcy equation. We focus on the more challenging case of super-resolution, where the input dataset for the inverse problem is at a significantly coarser resolution than the output. The results we obtain are comparable or exceed the leading operator network benchmarks in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, ViTO`s architecture has a small number of trainable parameters (less than 10% of the leading competitor), resulting in a performance speed-up of over 5x when averaged over the various test cases.",

            "abstract": "Extrapolation remains a grand challenge in deep neural networks across all application domains. We propose an operator learning method to solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) continuously and with extrapolation in time without any temporal discretization. The proposed method, named Diffusion-inspired Temporal Transformer Operator (DiTTO), is inspired by latent diffusion models and their conditioning mechanism, which we use to incorporate the temporal evolution of the PDE, in combination with elements from the transformer architecture to improve its capabilities. Upon training, DiTTO can make inferences in real-time. We demonstrate its extrapolation capability on a climate problem by estimating the temperature around the globe for several years, and also in modeling hypersonic flows around a double-cone. We propose different training strategies involving temporal-bundling and sub-sampling and demonstrate performance improvements for several benchmarks, performing extrapolation for long time intervals as well as zero-shot super-resolution in time.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate a vast amount of factual information within their pre-trained weights, as evidenced by their ability to answer diverse questions across different domains. However, this knowledge is inherently limited, relying heavily on the characteristics of the training data. Consequently, using external datasets to incorporate new information or refine the capabilities of LLMs on previously seen information poses a significant challenge. In this study, we compare two common approaches: unsupervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate both approaches on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks across different topics. Our findings reveal that while unsupervised fine-tuning offers some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-tuning, and that exposing them to numerous variations of the same fact during training could alleviate this problem.",

A widespread treatment is ablating the arrhythmia maintaining regions, which requires electro-anatomical mapping. A proposed sparse ultrasonic/electrode array can potentially map the anatomy and activity in real time. However, a limited amount of elements causes a difficulty in mapping anatomical openings. We propose a deep learning model to increase the mapping capacity. We empirically show that our proposed method is able to accurately detect openings in a heart chamber anatomy simulation. We further improve the accuracy of the model by adding Fourier-based pre-processing steps. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the model to changes in the physical parameters of the problem.",

            "abstract": "Novel infectious disease outbreaks, including most recently that of the COVID-19 pandemic, could be detected by non-specific syndromic surveillance systems. Such systems, utilizing a variety of data sources ranging from Electronic Health Records to internet data such as aggregated search engine queries, create alerts when unusually high rates of symptom reports occur. This is especially important for the detection of novel diseases, where their manifested symptoms are unknown. Here we improve upon a set of previously-proposed non-specific syndromic surveillance methods by taking into account both how unusual a preponderance of symptoms is and their effect size. We demonstrate that our method is as accurate as previously-proposed methods for low dimensional data and show its effectiveness for high-dimensional aggregated data by applying it to aggregated time-series health-related search engine queries. We find that in 2019 the method would have raised alerts related to several disease outbreaks earlier than health authorities did. During the COVID-19 pandemic the system identified the beginning of pandemic waves quickly, through combinations of symptoms which varied from wave to wave. Thus, the proposed method could be used as a practical tool for decision makers to detect new disease outbreaks using time series derived from search engine data even in the absence of specific information on the diseases of interest and their symptoms.",
