            "title": "Dynamic Swarm Orchestration and Semantics in IoT Edge Devices: A Systematic Literature Review",
            "abstract": "In its dynamic evolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, ranging from domestic appliances to industrial robots. This integration brings together people, processes, data, and devices, prompting new types of interactions among them. Besides acquiring data, these devices also have actuation and processing capabilities, making them susceptible of becoming autonomous entities with coordination potential. Given the inherent limitations of storage, power, or computation of IoT devices, delegation and cooperation strategies, including intermediary nodes in the network, can significantly optimize the usage of resources. Hence, this type of node can rely on swarm-inspired intelligence to orchestrate edge nodes, possibly with semantics-enabled behaviors. This study proposes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) investigating different solutions and approaches for the orchestration of edge devices powered by declarative and semantic models of their affordances, goals, and capabilities. The SLR explores different aspects of the literature, including demographics, application domains, goals, requirements, scope, services, frameworks, and technologies, as well as challenges and future directions in the field. The purpose of this SLR is to provide software engineers, researchers, and innovators comprehensive insights into the present status of advancements in this area and a discussion of the unresolved issues and opportunities.",

            "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive disease for which researchers have yet to discover the main cause, but believe it probably involves a combination of age-related changes in the brain, genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Alzheimer\u2019s is an irreversible disease that still has no cure. Therefore, its early diagnosis is very important to prevent its progression. Developing Machine Learning algorithms in healthcare, especially in brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, provides new opportunities for early diagnosis and recognition of important biomarkers. This paper presents an overview of advanced studies based on Machine Learning techniques for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease and different stages of mild cognitive impairment based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in the last 10 years. Also, this paper comprehensively describes the commonly efficient Machine Learning algorithms in each stage of magnetic resonance imaging processing used in the papers, which can facilitate the comparison of algorithms with each other and provide insight into the impact of each technique on classification performance. This review can be a valuable resource to gain a new perspective on the various research methods used in recent studies on Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

            "abstract": "We work towards a vocabulary to represent processes and temporal logic specifications as graph-structured data. Different fields use incompatible terminologies for describing essentially the same process-related concepts. In addition, processes can be represented from different perspectives and levels of abstraction: both state-centric and event-centric perspectives offer distinct insights into the underlying processes. In this work, we strive to unify the representation of processes and related concepts by leveraging the power of knowledge graphs. We survey approaches to representing processes and reasoning with process descriptions from different fields and provide a selection of scenarios to help inform the scope of a unified representation of processes. We focus on processes that can be executed and observed via web interfaces. We propose to provide a representation designed to combine state-centric and event-centric perspectives while incorporating temporal querying and reasoning capabilities on temporal logic specifications. A standardised vocabulary and representation for processes and temporal specifications would contribute towards bridging the gap between the terminologies from different fields and fostering the broader application of methods involving temporal logics, such as formal verification and program synthesis.",

            "abstract": "In this position paper, we propose that Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are one of the prime approaches to support the programming of autonomous software systems at the knowledge level . From this viewpoint, we survey how KGs can support different dimensions of autonomy in such systems: For example, the autonomy of systems with respect to their environment, or with respect to organisations; and we discuss related practical and research challenges. We emphasise that KGs need to be able to support systems of autonomous software agents that are themselves highly heterogeneous , which limits how these systems may use KGs. Furthermore, these heterogeneous software agents may populate highly dynamic environments , which implies that they require adaptive KGs. The scale of the envisioned systems \u2013 possibly stretching to the size of the Internet \u2013 highlights the maintain-ability of the underlying KGs that need to contain large-scale knowledge, which requires that KGs are maintained jointly by humans and machines. Furthermore, autonomous agents require procedural knowledge , and KGs should hence be explored more towards the provisioning of such knowledge to augment autonomous behaviour. Finally, we highlight the importance of modelling choices , including with respect to the selected abstraction level when modelling and with respect to the provisioning of more expressive constraint languages.",

Although major corporations have taken the lead in market share, public media companies have also started to produce and broadcast films, series, and documentaries centered on locally-created content. Moreover, beyond the purely commercial goals of major corporations, these public streaming platforms have the mission of expanding the cultural landscape of the viewers, for instance, through the exploration of content produced in other regions and other languages, especially in multicultural societies such as Switzerland. In such a context, this paper proposes a novel approach for personalized recommendations of streaming media content, focusing on serendipity and multicultural diversity, while minimizing the need for personal data sharing. The approach is based on the feature extraction from user media consumption and a combination of data-driven recommendation algorithms. The approach has been tested with real data from the public PlaySuisse streaming platform.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. With the rapid evolution of the wind energy sector, there is an ever-increasing need to create value from the vast amounts of data made available both from within the domain and from other sectors. This article addresses the challenges faced by wind energy domain experts in converting data into domain knowledge, connecting and integrating them with other sources of knowledge, and making them available for use in next-generation artificial intelligence systems. To this end, this article highlights the role that knowledge engineering can play in the digital transformation of the wind energy sector. It presents the main concepts underpinning knowledge-based systems and summarises previous work in the areas of knowledge engineering and knowledge representation in a manner that is relevant and accessible to wind energy domain experts. A systematic analysis of the current state of the art on knowledge engineering in the wind energy domain is performed with available tools put into perspective by establishing the main domain actors and their needs, as well as identifying key problematic areas. Finally, recommendations for further development and improvement are provided.\n",

            "abstract": "Context. Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support human\u2013machine interactions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained into humans\u2019 habits due to factors including (i) the availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based mechanisms to power the bots\u2019 behaviors. Nevertheless, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work addresses the challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii) enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive physical conditioning, smoking cessation, and support for breast-cancer survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals characterized by diverse age, gender, and country distribution have actively participated in the experimentation, reporting advancements in the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and exercises\u2019 variety they have been proposed.",
