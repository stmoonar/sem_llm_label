            "abstract": "We examine the threat to individuals\u2019 privacy based on the feasibility of reidentifying users through distinctive pro\ufb01les of their browsing history visible to websites and third parties. This work replicates and extends the 2012 paper Why Johnny Can\u2019t Browse in Peace: On the Uniqueness of Web Browsing History Patterns [48]. The original work demonstrated that browsing pro\ufb01les are highly distinctive and stable. We reproduce those results and extend the original work to detail the privacy risk posed by the aggregation of browsing histories. Our dataset consists of two weeks of browsing data from ~52,000 Firefox users. Our work replicates the original paper\u2019s core \ufb01ndings by identifying 48,919 distinct browsing pro\ufb01les, of which 99% are unique. High uniqueness holds even when histories are truncated to just 100 top sites. We then \ufb01nd that for users who visited 50 or more distinct domains in the two-week data collection period, ~50% can be reidenti\ufb01ed using the top 10k sites. Reidenti\ufb01ability rose to over 80% for users that browsed 150 or more distinct domains. Finally, we observe numerous third parties pervasive enough to gather web histories suf\ufb01cient to leverage browsing history as an identi\ufb01er.",

            "abstract": "Differential privacy is a formal, mathematical conception of privacy preservation. An algorithm is differentially private when it injects a precisely calculated quantity of noise to any statistical query, masking the possible contribution of any one individual to the result. This provides a gold standard definition of privacy protection for data scientists who want to analyze data that contains personal information that must remain private. The open source project provides several basic building blocks that can be used by people involved with sensitive data, with implementations based on vetted and mature differential privacy research. It aims to connect theoretical solutions from the academic community with practical lessons learned from real-world deployments and to make differential privacy broadly accessible to future deployments. The core library is a native runtime that is built in Rust to be memory safe and fast. It can be used to safely build differentially private releases from native code running on various devices. It has a SQL data access layer that allows users to compose analysis graphs using the SQL language. The data access layer supports a wide variety of SQL database engines. To ease deployment, it includes a sample hosted service that shows users how to compose heterogeneous queries over the same dataset, fronted by a REST-based endpoint.",

Fairlearn has two components: an interactive visualization dashboard and unfairness mitigation algorithms. These components are designed to help with navigating trade-offs between fairness and model performance. We emphasize that prioritizing fairness in AI systems is a sociotechnical challenge. Because there are many complex sources of unfairness\u2014some societal and some technical\u2014it is not possible to fully \u201cdebias\u201d a system or to guarantee fairness; the goal is to mitigate fairness-related harms as much as possible.

            "abstract": "As online tracking continues to grow, existing anti-tracking and fingerprinting detection techniques that require significant manual input must be augmented. Heuristic approaches to fingerprinting detection are precise but must be carefully curated. Supervised machine learning techniques proposed for detecting tracking require manually generated label-sets. Seeking to overcome these challenges, we present a semi-supervised machine learning approach for detecting fingerprinting scripts. Our approach is based on the core insight that fingerprinting scripts have similar patterns of API access when generating their fingerprints, even though their access patterns may not match exactly. Using this insight, we group scripts by their JavaScript (JS) execution traces and apply a semi-supervised approach to detect new fingerprinting scripts. We detail our methodology and demonstrate its ability to identify the majority of scripts ($\\geqslant$94.9%) identified by existing heuristic techniques. We also show that the approach expands beyond detecting known scripts by surfacing candidate scripts that are likely to include fingerprinting. Through an analysis of these candidate scripts we discovered fingerprinting scripts that were missed by heuristics and for which there are no heuristics. In particular, we identified over one hundred device-class fingerprinting scripts present on hundreds of domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time device-class fingerprinting has been measured in the wild. These successes illustrate the power of a sparse vector representation and semi-supervised learning to complement and extend existing tracking detection techniques.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale Web crawls have emerged as the state of the art for studying characteristics of the Web. In particular, they are a core tool for online tracking research. Web crawling is an attractive approach to data collection, as crawls can be run at relatively low infrastructure cost and don\u2019t require handling sensitive user data such as browsing histories. However, the biases introduced by using crawls as a proxy for human browsing data have not been well studied. Crawls may fail to capture the diversity of user environments, and the snapshot view of the Web presented by one-time crawls does not reflect its constantly evolving nature, which hinders reproducibility of crawl-based studies. In this paper, we quantify the repeatability and representativeness of Web crawls in terms of common tracking and fingerprinting metrics, considering both variation across crawls and divergence from human browser usage. We quantify baseline variation of simultaneous crawls, then isolate the effects of time, cloud IP address vs. residential, and operating system. This provides a foundation to assess the agreement between crawls visiting a standard list of high-traffic websites and actual browsing behaviour measured from an opt-in sample of over 50,000 users of the Firefox Web browser. Our analysis reveals differences between the treatment of stateless crawling infrastructure and generally stateful human browsing, showing, for example, that crawlers tend to experience higher rates of third-party activity than human browser users on loading pages from the same domains.",

We propose to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the intersection of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics such as hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for metrics beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference, SysML, that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and machine learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in systems and ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the two.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques are enjoying rapidly increasing adoption. However, designing and implementing the systems that support ML models in real-world deployments remains a significant obstacle, in large part due to the radically different development and deployment profile of modern ML methods, and the range of practical concerns that come with broader adoption. We propose to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the intersection of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics such as hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for metrics beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference, MLSys, that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and machine learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in systems and ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the two.",

            "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners from different disciplines have highlighted the ethical and legal challenges posed by the use of machine learned models and data-driven systems, and the potential for such systems to discriminate against certain population groups, due to biases in algorithmic decision-making systems. This tutorial aims to present an overview of algorithmic bias / discrimination issues observed over the last few years and the lessons learned, key regulations and laws, and evolution of techniques for achieving fairness in machine learning systems. We will motivate the need for adopting a \"fairness-first\" approach (as opposed to viewing algorithmic bias / fairness considerations as an afterthought), when developing machine learning based models and systems for different consumer and enterprise applications. Then, we will focus on the application of fairness-aware machine learning techniques in practice, by presenting case studies from different technology companies. Based on our experiences in industry, we will identify open problems and research challenges for the data mining / machine learning community.",
