            "title": "A Novel Homomorphic Encryption and Consortium Blockchain-Based Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Industrial Internet of Medical Things",
            "abstract": "Securing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is one of the most critical applications of cryptography over the Internet due to the value and importance of data contained in such EMRs. Although blockchain-based healthcare systems can provide security, privacy, and immutability to EMRs, several outstanding security and latency issues are associated with existing schemes. For example, some researchers have used the blockchain as a storage tool which increases delay and adversely affects the blockchain performance since it stores a copy of each transaction. A distributed ledger also requires appropriate space and computational power with increased data size. In addition, existing healthcare-based approaches usually rely on centralized servers connected to clouds, which are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and collusion attacks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-deep learning-based homomorphic encryption (HE) model for the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) to cope with such challenges using a consortium blockchain. Integrating HE with the proposed IIoMT system is a vital contribution of this work. The use of HE while outsourcing to the cloud the storage provides a unique facility to perform any statistical and machine learning operation on the encrypted EMR data, hence providing resistance to collusion and phishing attacks. Our proposed model uses a pre-trained hybrid deep learning model in the cloud and deploys the trained model into blockchain-based edge devices in order to classify and train local models using EMRs. This is further conditioned on the private data of each edge and IoT device connected with the consortium blockchain. All local models obtained are aggregated to the cloud to update a global model, which is finally disseminated to the edge nodes. Our proposed approach provides more privacy and security than conventional models and can deliver high efficiency and low end-to-end latency for users. Comparative simulation analysis with state-of-the-art approaches is carried out using benchmark performance metrics, which show that our proposed model provides enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency.",

            "abstract": "The expeditious propagation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies implanted in different smart devices, such as smartphones and smartwatches have a ubiquitous consequence on the modern population. These devices are employed to collect data and to aid in tracking and analyzing the users\u2019 daily activities using various human activity monitoring and recognition (HAMR) techniques. However, most current HAMR approaches rely on exploratory case-based shallow feature learning architectures, which endeavor to recognize activities correctly in real-world situations. To address this issue, we offer a unique strategy for HAMR that leverages the attention mechanism with multihead convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long-short-term-memory (LSTM). The accuracy of activity detection is improved in the presented method by integrating attention into multihead CNNs followed by LSTM for better feature extraction and selection. Verification investigations are carried out using data from the University of California (UCI) repository, which is publicly available. The results show that our proposed framework is more accurate than current frameworks using both the 10-fold and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Finally, the proposed method can recognize human activity in real time, regardless of the type of smart device.",

            "abstract": "Item identification is an important issue in modern supply chains where product items are traced by means of electronic tags that, despite the advantages they bring in terms of automation, are still subject to counterfeiting attacks such as tag modification, cloning, and re-application. To counter these threats (i) tags must be able to safely demonstrate their identity without giving attackers the ability to clone them or modify their content, and (ii) auxiliary identification techniques should be adopted in the case tags are removed from original items and reapplied to fake ones. Using Physically Unclonable Functions as tag \u201cdigital fingerprint\u201d has proven to be a viable solution for tag authentication. On the other hand, artificial intelligence has proven its effectiveness in the field of object identification. In this paper we describe a tag architecture immune to cloning and modification attacks, and illustrate how this can be coupled with a product item in a supply chain scenario to confer a stable and durable identity for authentication, in order to identify the items and track them in a distributed ledger framework. We also propose a deep learning approach to perform anti-counterfeiting controls when tag reapplication attacks are in place.",

            "abstract": "Binary obfuscation is a very broad set of techniques widely employed in the context of code protection from piracy. However, it is also used for malicious goals, e.g. virus writers often employ obfuscation in order to evade signature-based antivirus detection. Thus, the ability to detect if an executable has been obfuscated is of paramount importance, as it allows to thwart the execution of potentially malicious code. The task of detection, however, is not easy, since many different obfuscating transformations exist and the alteration of an original code is not always easily detectable. In this paper, we want to shed light on the blurry task of obfuscation detection. We will look at this task through the brand new lenses of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), in order to finally sharpen the obscure landscape of obfuscated software. Thanks to XAI we will be able to identify the relevant features altered by the transformating obfuscation as well as the invariant ones, that can be used for obfuscation-resistant malware signatures. We show our findings thanks to an evaluation with a dataset of obfuscated and non-obfuscated binaries, explaining the important features that lead to the detection of obfuscating transformations.",

The identification of malicious activities happened in the past and the prediction of future menaces is crucial more than ever. In this paper we propose a new methodology based on Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTTP) and Neural Networks in order to identify and predict threats. Our technique differs from classical Temporal Point Processes because it does not rely on prior assumptions on the form of the conditional intensity function. The latter, in fact, is learned leveraging two different Deep Learning approaches. The experimental evaluation, performed on a dataset obtained from gas pipelines, highlights that our methodology is suitable to represent logs and identify past and future threats in a completely unsupervised fashion. The results obtained confirm the validity of our approach.",

The security, safety and privacy are constantly under attack due to the huge number of easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities in these devices. It is straightforward to notice how a careful analysis of IoT devices is more topical and urgent than ever and it is important to adopt effective vulnerability assessment methodologies in order to identify and thwart many types of cyberattacks. In order to perform traditional analyses on the firmware, however, it is important to emulate the latter in a controlled environment: a process called firmware re-hosting. In this paper we discuss the limitations of the existing re-hosting approaches when dealing with vulnerability assessment and we propose a novel methodology to speed up security analyses and allow the application to firmware of traditional security tools, such as binary fuzzers.",

            "abstract": "Process mining (PM) is a well\u2010known research area that includes techniques, methodologies, and tools for analyzing processes in a variety of application domains. In the case of healthcare, processes are characterized by high variability in terms of activities, duration, and involved resources (e.g., physicians, nurses, administrators, machineries, etc.). Besides, the multitude of diseases that the patients housed in healthcare facilities suffer from makes medical contexts highly heterogeneous. As a result, understanding and analyzing healthcare processes are certainly not trivial tasks, and administrators and doctors look for tools and methods that can concretely support them in improving the healthcare services they are involved in. In this context, PM has been increasingly used for a wide range of applications as reported in some recent reviews. However, these reviews mainly focus on discussion on applications related to the clinical pathways, while a systematic review of all possible applications is absent. In this article, we selected 172 papers published in the last 10\u2009years, that present applications of PM in the healthcare domain. The objective of this study is to help and guide researchers interested in the medical field to understand the main PM applications in the healthcare, but also to suggest new ways to develop promising and not yet fully investigated applications. Moreover, our study could be of interest for practitioners who are considering applications of PM, who can identify and choose PM algorithms, techniques, tools, methodologies, and approaches, toward what have been the experiences of success.",

            "abstract": "Smartwatch based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is gaining popularity due to habitual unhealthy behavior of the population and the rich in-built sensors of smartwatch. Raw sensor data is not well suited for the classifiers to identify similar activity patterns. According to the HAR literature handcrafted features are beneficial to properly identify the activities, which is time consuming and need expert domain knowledge. Automatic feature extraction libraries give high-dimensional feature sets that increase the computation and memory cost. In this work, we present an Ensemble Learning framework that exploit dimensional reduction and visualization to improve performance specification. Specifically, using Time Series Feature Extraction Library (TSFEL), the high dimensional features are extracted automatically. Then, to reduce the dimension of the feature set and proper visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are used respectively. The relevant extracted features using PCA are fed to an ensemble of three different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to identify six different human physical activities. We also compare the proposed method with three popularly used shallow ML methods. Self collected human activity smartwatch sensor signal is used to establish the feasibility of the proposed framework. We observe that the proposed framework outper-forms the existing state-of-the-art benchmark frameworks, with an accuracy of 96%.",
