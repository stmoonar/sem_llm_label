            "title": "TokenRec: Learning to Tokenize ID for LLM-based Generative Recommendation",
            "abstract": "There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an indispensable and important component, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems, these DNN-based methods still exhibit some limitations, such as inferior capabilities to effectively capture textual side information about users and items, difficulties in generalization to various recommendation scenarios, and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization capabilities and reasoning skills. As a result, recent studies have actively attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems. Therefore, in this survey, we comprehensively review LLM-empowered recommender systems from various perspectives including pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting paradigms. More specifically, we first introduce the representative methods to learn user and item representations, leveraging LLMs as feature encoders. Then, we systematically review the emerging advanced techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the promising future directions in this emerging field.",

            "abstract": "Wireless-networked control system (WNCS) connecting sensors, controllers, and actuators via wireless communications is a key enabling technology for highly scalable and low-cost deployment of control systems in the Industry 4.0 era. Despite the tight interaction of control and communications in WNCSs, most existing works adopt separate design approaches. This is mainly because the co-design of control-communication policies requires large and hybrid state and action spaces, making the optimal problem mathematically intractable and difficult to be solved effectively by classic algorithms. In this article, we systematically investigate deep-learning (DL)-based estimator-control-scheduler co-design for a model-unknown nonlinear WNCS over wireless fading channels. In particular, we propose a co-design framework with the awareness of the sensor\u2019s Age-of-Information (AoI) states and dynamic channel states. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm for controller and scheduler optimization utilizing both model-free and model-based data. An AoI-based importance sampling algorithm that takes into account the data accuracy is proposed for enhancing learning efficiency. We also develop novel schemes for enhancing the stability of joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed joint training algorithm can effectively solve the estimation\u2013control\u2013scheduling co-design problem in various scenarios and provide significant performance gain compared to separate designs and some benchmark policies.",
