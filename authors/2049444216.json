            "abstract": "The capacitated location-routing problem involves determining the depots from a set of candidate capacitated depot locations and finding the required routes from the selected depots to serve a set of customers whereas minimizing a cost function that includes the cost of opening the chosen depots, the fixed utilization cost per vehicle used, and the total cost (distance) of the routes. This paper presents a multi-population integrated framework in which a multi-depot edge assembly crossover generates promising offspring solutions from the perspective of both depot location and route edge assembly. The method includes an effective neighborhood-based local search, a feasibility-restoring procedure and a diversification-oriented mutation. Of particular interest is the multi-population scheme which organizes the population into multiple subpopulations based on depot configurations. Extensive experiments on 281 benchmark instances from the literature show that the algorithm performs remarkably well, by improving 101 best-known results (new upper bounds) and matching 84 best-known results. Additional experiments are presented to gain insight into the role of the key elements of the algorithm.",

The problem is of great practical interest because it can be used to formulate several real-life applications. To solve this computationally challenging problem, we propose a leaning-driven iterated local search approach that combines an aggressive local search procedure with a probabilistic acceptance criterion to find high-quality local optimal solutions and a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select various removal and insertion operators to escape local optimal traps.

            "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against data poisoning attacks. These attacks aim to inject poisoning samples into the models' training dataset such that the trained models have inference failures. While previous studies have executed different types of attacks, one major challenge that greatly limits their effectiveness is the uncertainty of the re-training process after the injection of poisoning samples, including the re-training initialization or algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose a novel attack method called ''Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack (SAPA)''. In particular, it leverages the concept of DNNs' loss landscape sharpness to optimize the poisoning effect on the worst re-trained model. It helps enhance the preservation of the poisoning effect, regardless of the specific retraining procedure employed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAPA offers a general and principled strategy that significantly enhances various types of poisoning attacks.",

            "abstract": "With the growing popularity of API-driven multiservice application (mashup) development, the burgeoning web APIs have left developers drowning in the sea of web API selections. Matching developers with the most appropriate APIs is the key to improving user satisfaction and promoting more popular web applications. As a result, more and more researchers pay attention to web API recommender systems based on collaborative filtering. However, employing collaborative filtering to recommend APIs is challenging due to the severe sparsity of mashup and API interactions. To address this problem, we propose a probabilistic generative model, called the Binary-API Topic model (BAT), to parameterize mashups and APIs. Technically, BAT is equipped with a mechanism to extract binary-APIs and predict unknown pairwise interactions. To improve generality and capture more relevance from a limited number of interactions, we learn binary-API topics by directly modeling the generation of API co-occurrence patterns across the repository (all mashup collections from programmableweb.com). The main advantage of BAT is that it preserves API co-occurrence patterns in model learning and exploits the rich global relevance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BAT can achieve the highest performance on the sparse real-world data set.",

This study introduces a hybrid genetic algorithm that addresses both the OP and PCTSP under a unified framework. The algorithm combines an extended edge\u2010assembly crossover operator to produce promising offspring solutions, and an effective local search to ameliorate each offspring solution.

            "abstract": "Real-world recommender systems usually consist of two phases. Predictive models in Phase I provide accurate predictions of users' actions on items, and Phase II is to aggregate the predictions withstrategic parameters to make final recommendations, which aim to meet multiple business goals, such as maximizing users' like rate and average engagement time. Though it is important to generate accurate predictions in Phase I, it is also crucial to optimize the strategic parameters in Phase II. Conventional solutions include manually tunning, Bayesian optimization, contextual multi-armed bandit optimization, etc. However, these methods either produce universal strategic parameters for all the users or focus on a deterministic solution, which leads to an undesirable performance. In this paper, we propose a personalized probabilistic solution for strategic parameter optimization. We first formulate the personalized probabilistic optimizing problem and compare its solution with deterministic and context-free solutions theoretically to show its superiority. We then introduce a novel Personalized pRObabilistic strategic parameter optimizing Policy Network (PROPN) to solve the problem. PROPN follows reinforcement learning architecture where a neural network serves as an agent that dynamically adjusts the distributions of strategic parameters for each user. We evaluate our model under the streaming recommendation setting on two public real-world datasets. The results show that our framework outperforms representative baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Cloud APIs have always been the best carrier for service delivery, capability replication, and data output. The proliferation of cloud APIs has increased the difficulty of selecting the right, composable cloud APIs. However, very little research has attempted to address long-tail API recommendation or complementary API recommendation. In this paper, we focus on this shortcoming and propose Complementary LongTail API Recommendation (CLAR). To address the problem, we propose an attribute-aware recommender system, Neural Complementary Recommendation (NCR). Specifically, we use multi-modality embedding, including self-embedding and global embedding, to perform feature transformation. Self-embeddings use matrix factorization techniques to convert category features into factor-based generalized embeddings. And in global embedding, document fuzzification is performed using Minhash and Latent Dirichlet Allocation models to transform uncertain and non-standard text documents into vectors that conform to the same probability distribution. In addition, we customize an appropriative neural network for each API semantic cluster to introduce asymmetries in complementarity recommendations and reconstruct complementary relations. Finally, the proposed approach outperforms baseline approaches through experiments using real-world datasets in both normal and long-tail cases.",
