            "title": "A Generalized Community-Structure-Aware Optimization Framework for Efficient Subgraph Matching in Social Network Analysis",
            "abstract": "Subgraph matching is a common and important query for analyzing social networks. However, existing subgraph matching algorithms are still unsatisfactory in efficiency. As different subgraph matching algorithms are suitable for different conditions, this article aims to find optimization methods effective for different subgraph matching algorithms. Specifically, the contributions of this article mainly include three aspects. First, this article defines the concept of a community distribution scheme (c-scheme), and proposes an efficient generalized community-structure-aware optimization framework named GCF to accelerate the process of subgraph matching. Specifically, in the GCF framework, subgraph matching is performed by dealing with all c-schemes, and GCF can accelerate different subgraph matching algorithms by exploiting the community structure of the graph data. Second, three strategies are proposed and applied in GCF to further accelerate the process of subgraph matching. In detail, GCF analyzes the structure of the pattern graph and avoids redundant calculation with the strategy of two-level symmetry-breaking (2LS). Besides, GCF builds indexes on the community paths of the data graph to detect useless c-schemes in advance. Moreover, GCF performs community-structure-based boundary pruning and reduces the search space. Third, in the experiments, four state-of-the-art subgraph matching algorithms, i.e., TurboISO, VF3, VF3-Light, and DAF, are optimized with GCF. The results of the experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that the GCF is efficient and can significantly reduce the time consumption of different existing subgraph matching algorithms. Specifically, the optimized subgraph matching algorithms can be more than $2800\\times $ faster than the original algorithms in the best condition. Moreover, the experimental results on datasets with different scales demonstrate that GCF has considerable scalability.",

            "title": "Fast Unsupervised Graph Embedding via Graph Zoom Learning",
            "abstract": "Unsupervised graph representation learning, i.e., learning node or graph embeddings from graph data in an unsupervised manner, has become an important problem when we study graph data. With the development of self-supervised learning, researchers have designed graph-level self-supervised learning paradigms and learn embeddings under these paradigms. The learned embeddings can serve as a fine initial solution to downstream tasks such as node classification or graph classification. In this paper, we propose a fast unsupervised graph embedding method, which follows the way of self-supervised learning. This method performs representation learning on the graph under a novel concept called Graph Zoom Learning (abbr. GZL), which is orthogonal to the existing concepts of unsupervised graph embedding, such as random walk and contrastive learning. Two crucial components, graph zoom-out and point-to-point contrast, help GZL reduce the overall training time cost. Specifically, on the one hand, a lightweight miniature graph is generated from the raw graph by graph zoom-out and the learning on the miniature graph is more efficient than the learning on the raw graph; on the other hand, we design the miniature-scale learning on the miniature graph and introduce community structure into this learning pattern, which contributes to the final point-to-point contrast. Since point-to-point contrast is independent of negatives, it makes the whole training more efficient. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the advantage of GZL on representation learning. On two downstream tasks of node classification and graph classification, GZL outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised graph embedding methods. Particularly, on the largest experimental graph dataset (ogbn-arxiv) with 169k nodes and 1.1m edges, GZL outperforms the runner-up by 3.3% relative accuracy and achieves up to 22.6x speedup over it.",

            "abstract": "Modern recommender systems often deal with a variety of user interactions, e.g., click, forward, purchase, etc., which requires the underlying recommender engines to fully understand and leverage multi-behavior data from users. Despite recent efforts towards making use of heterogeneous data, multi-behavior recommendation still faces great challenges. Firstly, sparse target signals and noisy auxiliary interactions remain an issue. Secondly, existing methods utilizing self-supervised learning (SSL) to tackle the data sparsity neglect the serious optimization imbalance between the SSL task and the target task. Hence, we propose a Multi-Behavior Self-Supervised Learning (MBSSL) framework together with an adaptive optimization method. Specifically, we devise a behavior-aware graph neural network incorporating the self-attention mechanism to capture behavior multiplicity and dependencies. To increase the robustness to data sparsity under the target behavior and noisy interactions from auxiliary behaviors, we propose a novel self-supervised learning paradigm to conduct node self-discrimination at both inter-behavior and intra-behavior levels. In addition, we develop a customized optimization strategy through hybrid manipulation on gradients to adaptively balance the self-supervised learning task and the main supervised recommendation task. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the consistent improvements obtained by MBSSL over ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. We release our model implementation at: https://github.com/Scofield666/MBSSL.git.",

            "title": "Learning Adaptive Node Embeddings Across Graphs",
            "abstract": "Recently, learning embeddings of nodes in graphs has attracted increasing research attention. There are two main kinds of graph embedding methods, i.e., transductive embedding methods and inductive embedding methods. The former focuses on directly optimizing the embedding vectors, and the latter tries to learn a mapping function for the given nodes and features. However, little work has focused on applying the learned model from one graph to another, which is a pervasive idea in Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing. Although some of the graph neural networks (GNNs) present a similar motivation, none of them considers both the structure bias and the feature bias between graphs. In this paper, we present a novel graph embedding problem called Adaptive Task (AT), and propose a unified framework for the adaptive task, which introduces two types of alignment to learn adaptive node embeddings across graphs. Then, based on the proposed framework, a novel Graph Adaptive Embedding network (GraphAE) is designed to address the adaptive task. Furthermore, we extend GraphAE to a multi-graph version to consider a more complex adaptive situation. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and also show that our framework can make a great improvement over a number of existing GNNs.",

            "abstract": "Mixed data distribution is widely observed, for example, the bird migration data consist of the observed locations of various birds in different years, varying in data distribution. Learning a single regression model over such a mixed data distribution is often ineffective, while manually segmenting the data, e.g., by bird, date or region, for learning individual models is truly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose to automatically discover the regression models that apply conditionally to only a part of the data, namely conditional regression rules (CRRs), enlightened by the conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) that are FDs hold only in some data. Remarkably, a regression model may apply in different parts of data, e.g., the seasonal migration of birds is similar in different years. To capture the shared regression models, we investigate the inference of CRRs. An algorithm is devised to learn and discover CRRs from data, with the help of CRR inference. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the discovered conditional regression rules are more effective than the regression models without conditions. In particular, with the inference of CRRs, the number of learned CRRs is significantly reduced without sacrificing rule semantics.",

            "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks have shown the superiority of modeling the complex topological structures in heterogeneous network-based recommender systems. Due to the diverse interactions among nodes and abundant semantics emerging from diverse types of nodes and edges, there is a bursting research interest in learning expressive node repre-sentations in multiplex heterogeneous networks. One of the most important tasks in recommender systems is to predict the potential connection between two nodes under a specific edge type (i.e., relationship). Although existing studies utilize explicit metapaths to aggregate neighbors, practically they only consider intra-relationship metapaths and thus fail to leverage the potential uplift by inter-relationship information. Moreover, it is not always straightforward to exploit inter-relationship metapaths comprehensively under diverse relationships, espe-cially with the increasing number of node and edge types. In addition, contributions of different relationships between two nodes are difficult to measure. To address the challenges, we propose HybridGNN, an end-to-end GNN model with hybrid aggregation flows and hierarchical attentions to fully utilize the heterogeneity in the multiplex scenarios. Specifically, HybridGNN applies a randomized inter-relationship exploration module to exploit the multiplexity property among different relationships. Then, our model leverages hybrid aggregation flows under intra-relationship metapaths and randomized exploration to learn the rich semantics. To explore the importance of different aggregation flow and take advantage of the multiplexity property, we bring forward a novel hierarchical attention module which leverages both metapath-Ievel attention and relationship-level attention. Extensive experimental results on five real-world datasets suggest that HybridGNN achieves the best performance compared to several state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.01, t-test) with statistical significance.",

            "abstract": "Online relevance matching is an essential task of e-commerce product search to boost the utility of search engines and ensure a smooth user experience. Previous work adopts either classical relevance matching models or Transformer-style models to address it. However, they ignore the inherent bipartite graph structures that are ubiquitous in e-commerce product search logs and are too inefficient to deploy online. In this paper, we design an efficient knowledge distillation framework for e-commerce relevance matching to integrate the respective advantages of Transformer-style models and classical relevance matching models. Especially for the core student model of the framework, we propose a novel method using $k$-order relevance modeling. The experimental results on large-scale real-world data (the size is 6$\\sim$174 million) show that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction accuracy in terms of human relevance judgment. We deploy our method to the anonymous online search platform. The A/B testing results show that our method significantly improves 5.7% of UV-value under price sort mode.",

            "title": "Time-Topology Analysis",
            "abstract": "\n Many real-world networks have been evolving, and are finely modeled as temporal graphs from the viewpoint of the graph theory. A temporal graph is informative, and always contains two types of information, i.e., the temporal information and topological information, where the temporal information reflects the time when the relationships are established, and the topological information focuses on the structure of the graph. In this paper, we perform time-topology analysis on temporal graphs to extract useful information. Firstly, a new metric named T-cohesiveness is proposed to evaluate the cohesiveness of a temporal subgraph. It defines the cohesiveness of a temporal subgraph from the time and topology dimensions jointly. Specifically, given a temporal graph\n \n G\n s\n \n = (\n Vs\n , \u03b5\n Es\n ), cohesiveness in the time dimension reflects whether the connections in\n \n G\n s\n \n happen in a short period of time, while cohesiveness in the topology dimension indicates whether the vertices in\n \n V\n s\n \n are densely connected and have few connections with vertices out of\n \n G\n s\n \n . Then, T-cohesiveness is utilized to perform time-topology analysis on temporal graphs, and two time-topology analysis methods are proposed. In detail, T-cohesiveness evolution tracking traces the evolution of the T-cohesiveness of a subgraph, and combo searching finds out all the subgraphs that contain the query vertex and have T-cohesiveness larger than a given threshold. Moreover, a pruning strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of combo searching. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed time-topology analysis methods and the pruning strategy.\n",
