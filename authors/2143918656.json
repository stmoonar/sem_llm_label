            "title": "Towards Next-Generation Intelligent Assistants Leveraging LLM Techniques",
            "abstract": "Virtual Intelligent Assistants take user requests in the voice form, perform actions such as setting an alarm, turning on a light, and answering a question, and provide answers or confirmations in the voice form or through other channels such as a screen. Assistants have become prevalent in the past decade, and users have been taking services from assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana. The emergence of AR/VR devices raised many new challenges for building intelligent assistants. The unique requirements have inspired new research directions such as (a) understanding users' situated multi-modal contexts (e.g. vision, sensor signals) as well as language-oriented conversational contexts, (b) personalizing the assistant services by grounding interactions on growing public and personal knowledge graphs and online search engines, and (c) on- device model inference and training techniques that satisfy strict resource and privacy constraints. In this tutorial, we will provide an in-depth walk-through of techniques in the afore-mentioned areas in the recent literature. We aim to introduce techniques for researchers and practitioners who are building intelligent assistants, and inspire research that will bring us one step closer to realizing the dream of building an all-day accompanying assistant. Additionally, we will highlight the significant role that Large Language Models (LLMs) play in enhancing these strategies, underscoring their potential to reshape the future landscape of intelligent assistance.",

            "title": "Cross-Modal Content Inference and Feature Enrichment for Cold-Start Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Multimedia recommendation aims to fuse the multi-modal information of items for feature enrichment to improve the recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically introduce multi-modal information based on collaborative information to improve the overall recommendation precision, while failing to explore its cold-start recommendation performance. Meanwhile, these above methods are only applicable when such multi-modal data is available. To address this problem, this paper proposes a recommendation framework, named Cross-modal Content Inference and Feature Enrichment Recommendation (CIERec), which exploits the multi-modal information to improve its cold-start recommendation performance. Specifically, CIERec first introduces image annotation as the privileged information to help guide the mapping of unified features from the visual space to the semantic space in the training phase. And then CIERec enriches the content representation with the fusion of collaborative, visual, and cross-modal inferred representations, so as to improve its cold-start recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the content representations learned by CIERec are able to achieve superior cold-start recommendation performance over existing visually-aware recommendation algorithms. More importantly, CIERec can consistently achieve significant improvements with different conventional visually-aware backbones, which verifies its universality and effectiveness.",

Verifying such textual attributes in product catalogs is essential to improve their reliability.

In this paper, we present Tab-Cleaner, a model designed to handle error detection over text-rich tabular data following a pre-training / fine-tuning paradigm. We train Tab-Cleaner on a real-world Amazon Product Catalog table w.r.t millions of products and show improvements over state-of-the-art methods by 16\\% on PR AUC over attribute applicability classification task and by 11\\% on PR AUC over attribute value validation task.",

            "abstract": "Although product graphs (PGs) have gained increasing attentions in recent years for their successful applications in product search and recommendations, the extensive power of PGs can be limited by the inevitable involvement of various kinds of errors. Thus, it is critical to validate the correctness of triples in PGs to improve their reliability. Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods have strong error detection abilities. Yet, existing KG embedding methods may not be directly applicable to a PG due to its distinct characteristics: (1) PG contains rich textual signals, which necessitates a joint exploration of both text information and graph structure; (2) PG contains a large number of attribute triples, in which attribute values are represented by free texts. Since free texts are too flexible to define entities in KGs, traditional way to map entities to their embeddings using ids is no longer appropriate for attribute value representation; (3) Noisy triples in a PG mislead the embedding learning and significantly hurt the performance of error detection. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an end-to-end noise-tolerant embedding learning framework, PGE, to jointly leverage both text information and graph structure in PG to learn embeddings for error detection. Experimental results on real-world product graph demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Automatic extraction of product attributes from their textual descriptions is essential for online shopper experience. One inherent challenge of this task is the emerging nature of e-commerce products \u2014 we see new types of products with their unique set of new attributes constantly. Most prior works on this matter mine new values for a set of known attributes but cannot handle new attributes that arose from constantly changing data. In this work, we study the attribute mining problem in an open-world setting to extract novel attributes and their values. Instead of providing comprehensive training data, the user only needs to provide a few examples for a few known attribute types as weak supervision. We propose a principled framework that first generates attribute value candidates and then groups them into clusters of attributes. The candidate generation step probes a pre-trained language model to extract phrases from product titles. Then, an attribute-aware fine-tuning method optimizes a multitask objective and shapes the language model representation to be attribute-discriminative. Finally, we discover new attributes and values through the self-ensemble of our framework, which handles the open-world challenge. We run extensive experiments on a large distantly annotated development set and a gold standard human-annotated test set that we collected. Our model significantly outperforms strong baselines and can generalize to unseen attributes and product types.",

            "abstract": "If one customer buys a tennis racket, what are the best 3 complementary products to purchase together? 3 tennis ball packs, 3 headbands, 3 overgrips, or 1 of each respectively? Complementary product recommendation (CPR), aiming at providing product suggestions that are often bought together to serve a joint demand, forms a pivotal component of e-commerce service, however, existing methods are far from optimal. Given one product, how to recommend its complementary products of different types is the key problem we tackle in this work. We first conduct an extensive analysis to correct the inaccurate assumptions adopted by existing work to show that co-purchased products are not always complementary and further propose a new strategy to generate clean distant supervision labels for CPR modeling. Moreover, to bridge in the gap from existing work that CPR does not only need relevance modeling but also requires diversity to fulfill the whole purchase demand, we develop a deep learning framework, P-Companion to explicitly model both relevance and diversity. More specifically, given one product with its product type, P-Companion first uses an encoder-decoder network to predict multiple complementary product types, then a transfer metric learning network is developed to project the embedding of query product to each predicted complementary product type subspace and further learn the complementary relationship based on the distant supervision labels within each subspace. The whole framework can be trained from end-to-end and robust to cold-start products attributed to a novel pretrained product embedding module named Product2Vec, based on graph attention networks. Extensive offline experiments show that P-Companion outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 7.1% increase on the Hit@10 score with well-controlled diversity. Production-wise, we deploy P-Companion to provide online recommendations for over 200M products at Amazon and observe significant gains on product sales and profit.",
