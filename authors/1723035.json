            "title": "$k$-local Graphs",
            "abstract": "In 2017 Day et al. introduced the notion of locality as a structural complexity-measure for patterns in the field of pattern matching established by Angluin in 1980. In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search. Finally, we perform a case study on a DBLP subgraph to demonstrate the potential of $k$-locality for knowledge discovery.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "A special focus in data mining is to identify agglomerations of data points in spatial or spatio-temporal databases. Multiple applications have been presented to make use of such clustering algorithms. However, applications exist, where not only dense areas have to be identified, but also requirements regarding the correlation of the cluster to a specific shape must be met, i.e. circles. This is the case for eddy detection in marine science, where eddies are not only specified by their density, but also their circular-shaped rotation. Traditional clustering algorithms lack the ability to take such aspects into account. In this paper, we introduce Vortex Correlation Clustering which aims to identify those correlated groups of objects oriented along a vortex. This can be achieved by adapting the Circle Hough Transformation, already known from image analysis. The presented adaptations not only allow to cluster objects depending on their location next to each other, but also allows to take the orientation of individual objects into considerations. This allows for a more precise clustering of objects. A multi-step approach allows to analyze and aggregate cluster candidates, to also include final clusters, which do not perfectly satisfy the shape condition. We evaluate our approach upon a real world application, to cluster particle simulations composing such shapes. Our approach outperforms comparable methods of clustering for this application both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Damage detection in materials and structures plays a critical role in engineering and science applications like structural health monitoring. A particular challenge is presented by micro-scale cracks, which are imperceptible to the naked eye or in images, but may ultimately evolve into larger, potentially dangerous cracks. In this work, we propose spatio-temporal pattern recognition techniques to enable the detection of such imperceptible micro-cracks. In order to make these cracks detectable, we generate seismic waves on the surface area of interest and monitor how cracks interfere with the spatial propagation of the wave over time. On the resulting propagation image series we then apply segmentation techniques using deep encoder-decoder CNNs to predict the location of cracks, which otherwise could not be directly observed. Our solution is evaluated through extensive experiments on highly-realistic finite element simulations, which were developed by domain experts.",

            "title": "A Framework for Extracting Scientific Measurements and Geo-Spatial Information from Scientific Literature",
            "abstract": "Research papers are often the primary source of scientific information dissemination, as researchers encapsulate their findings in these documents. Generally such findings are of complex types, diverse expressions and also carry rich context. The traditional approach for extracting certain scientific information from these documents is manual extraction, which is very time consuming. Due to the rapid increase in number of publications, using the full potential of these rich data sources by manual extraction is becoming infeasible. In this paper, we propose a framework for the automatic extraction of targeted (user defined) quantitative information, e.g. temperature sensor values, with its geo-spatial context from scientific documents. Given a database of scientific documents and a targeted user-defined geo-tagable measurement variables, mass accumulation rate (MAR) and sedimentation rate (SR), the problem we are addressing is to retrieve all the values together with their geo-spatial information respectively. Though there has been done a lot in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been explored, yet. We design a novel heterogeneous linking solution, that links measurements with locations, which are found by our tailored extraction pipeline. In experimental studies based on our novel dataset of Marine Geology papers, we showcase the capabilities of our linking framework using common geo-tagable Marine Geology measurements.",

            "abstract": "The ocean is an important part of the global system. Tracking the connectivity between bodies of water is crucial for understanding local, regional and global changes in the ocean dynamics that mediate the spreading of nutrients and influence the marine ecosystem and ocean productivity. We developed a Data Fusion approach that enhances and automates the existing methods for the analysis of this connectivity. This approach combines and condenses two different data sources in two stages, Data Enhancement followed by Data Reduction. The Data Enhancement stage fuses equidistantly gridded data containing physical measurements and trajectories representing movement data. The Data Reduction stage aggregates the fused data into a Markov Model representation of the transition probabilities between ocean regions. We applied this framework to an exemplary analysis for the connectivity between two oceanic areas using real ocean data stemming from marine research. We show that this method directly tackles the limitations of existing marine data analysis methods and furthermore introduces new means to answer questions that had no quantitative answers up to now.",

            "abstract": "Marine scientists investigate the movement of oceanic water particles with floating measurement devices released in the real ocean, as well as with virtual particles released in numerical model simulations. The detection, visualization, and evolution of clustered particles is key for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes in the oceans. Thereby, vast amounts of mobility data (3D coordinates of these particles over time) need to be analyzed using mobility data science methods. In this paper, we describe the application of data science techniques to detect particle clusters and, more importantly, to track the evolution of these clusters over time in order to support the analysis of oceanic flows. In particular, we apply a well-known concept for tracking the cluster evolution from the data mining community that relies on pair-counting and, thus, is rather inefficient. In order to be applicable to large amounts of particles, we further elaborate two heuristic solutions to compute the cluster transitions based on spatial approximations. Experiments on real world data show a considerable speed-up while sacrificing marginal accuracy drops. Our prototype is used by domain experts for the analysis of the large-scale ocean by virtual particle release experiments in ocean simulations.",

            "abstract": "The problem of single-channel audio source separation is to recover (separate) multiple audio sources that are mixed in a single-channel audio signal (e.g. people talking over each other). Some of the best performing single-channel source separation methods utilize downsampling to either make the separation process faster or make the neural networks bigger and increase accuracy. The problem concerning downsampling is that it usually results in information loss. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SFSRNet which contains a super-resolution (SR) network. The SR network is trained to reconstruct the missing information in the upper frequencies of the audio signal by operating on the spectrograms of the output audio source estimations and the input audio mixture. Any separation method where the length of the sequence is a bottleneck in speed and memory can be made faster or more accurate by using the SR network.\nBased on the WSJ0-2mix benchmark where estimations of the audio signal of two speakers need to be extracted from the mixture, in our experiments our proposed SFSRNet reaches a scale-invariant signal-to-noise-ratio improvement (SI-SNRi) of 24.0 dB outperforming the state-of-the-art solution SepFormer which reaches an SI-SNRi of 22.3 dB.",
