            "title": "G2GT: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Graph-to-Graph Attention Neural Network and Self-Training",
            "abstract": "Retrosynthesis prediction, the task of identifying reactant molecules that can be used to synthesize product molecules, is a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry and related fields. To address this challenge, we propose a novel graph-to-graph transformation model, G2GT. The model is built on the standard transformer structure and utilizes graph encoders and decoders. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of self-training, a data augmentation technique that utilizes unlabeled molecular data, in improving the performance of the model. To further enhance diversity, we propose a weak ensemble method, inspired by reaction-type labels and ensemble learning. This method incorporates beam search, nucleus sampling, and top-k sampling to improve inference diversity. A simple ranking algorithm is employed to retrieve the final top-10 results. We achieved new state-of-the-art results on both the USPTO-50K data set, with a top-1 accuracy of 54%, and the larger more challenging USPTO-Full data set, with a top-1 accuracy of 49.3% and competitive top-10 results. Our model can also be generalized to all other graph-to-graph transformation tasks. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Anonnoname/G2GT_2.",

            "title": "Embedding Based Retrieval in Friend Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Friend recommendation systems in online social and professional networks such as Snapchat helps users find friends and build connections, leading to better user engagement and retention. Traditional friend recommendation systems take advantage of the principle of locality and use graph traversal to retrieve friend candidates, e.g. Friends-of-Friends (FoF). While this approach has been adopted and shown efficacy in companies with large online networks such as Linkedin and Facebook, it suffers several challenges: (i) discrete graph traversal offers limited reach in cold-start settings, (ii) it is expensive and infeasible in realtime settings beyond 1 or 2 hop requests owing to latency constraints, and (iii) it cannot well-capture the complexity of graph topology or connection strengths, forcing one to resort to other mechanisms to rank and find top-K candidates. In this paper, we proposed a new Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) system for retrieving friend candidates, which complements the traditional FoF retrieval by retrieving candidates beyond 2-hop, and providing a natural way to rank FoF candidates. Through online A/B test, we observe statistically significant improvements in the number of friendships made with EBR as an additional retrieval source in both low- and high-density network markets. Our contributions in this work include deploying a novel retrieval system to a large-scale friend recommendation system at Snapchat, generating embeddings for billions of users using Graph Neural Networks, and building EBR infrastructure in production to support Snapchat scale.",

            "abstract": "In the present day, online users are incentivized to engage in short text-based communication. These short texts harbor a significant amount of implicit information, including opinions, topics, and emotions, which are of notable value for both exploration and analysis. By alleviating the sparsity in short texts, topic models can be used to discover topics from large collections of short texts. While there is a large body of surveys focused on topic modeling, but only a few of them have focused on the short texts. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of topic modeling methods for short texts from a novel perspective. Firstly, it discusses short text probabilistic topic models and outlines the directions in which they can be improved. Secondly, it explores short text neural topic models, which can be categorized into three groups based on their underlying structures. In addition, this paper provides a detailed investigation of embedding methods in topic modeling. Moreover, various applications and corresponding works are surveyed, with a focus on short texts. The commonly used public corpora and evaluation indicators for topic modeling are also summarized. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of short text topic modeling are discussed in detail, and future research directions are proposed.",

            "title": "ICAI-SR: Item Categorical Attribute Integrated Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) has attracted much research attention in the past few years. Most existing attribute integrated SR models do not directly model the complex relations between items and categorical attributes, as well do not exploit the power of attribute sequence in predicting the next item. In this paper, we propose an Item Categorical Attribute Integrated Sequential Recommendation (ICAI-SR) framework, which consists of an Item-Attribute Aggregation (IAA) model and Entity Sequential (ES) models. In IAA model, we employ a heterogeneous graph to represent the complex relations between items and different types of categorical attributes, then the attention mechanism based neighborhood aggregation is designed to model the correlations between items and attributes. For ES models, there are one Item Sequential (IS) model and one or more Attribute Sequential (AS) models. With IS and AS models, not only the item sequence but also the attribute sequence are used to predict the next item during model training. ICAI-SR is instantiated by taking Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as ES models, resulting in ICAI-GRU and ICAI-BERT respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three public datasets to validate the performance of ICAI-SR. Experimental Results show that ICAI-SR performs better than both basic SR models and a competitive attribute integrated SR model.",

            "abstract": "The flourishing of intelligent mobile devices, significantly prompts various location-Based Services (LBSs), especially continuous LBSs. However, continuous LBSs can suffer from location association attacks and trajectory attacks. The existing dummy-based schemes aren't protect users' privacy effectively since ignoring the reasonability of dummies. Therefore, in this paper we consider the Time-Sensitive Side Information(TSSI), spatiotemporal correlations and movement patterns of previous locations simultaneously to present a Dummy Filtering Algorithm(DFA). First we consider the TSSI to generate dummies. Then we propose two constraints time reachability and out-degree/indegree to cut off spatiotemporal correlations. Next, we utilize area overlapping and trend similarity to protect users' trajectory privacy. Security analysis indicates that our scheme can assure dummies' rationality and availability. Furthermore, experiments show that our scheme not only defends location association attacks and trajectory attacks effectively, but increases the ratio of available dummies from 42% up to 66.7%.",

            "abstract": "The large volume of event information makes it difficult for users to find interesting events in social networks. Therefore, we would like to develop an intelligent event recommendation to reduce information overload. Specifically, by exploring the behavior of users during the selection process, we are able to find particular rules associated with various event attributes which reflect the willingness of users. However, traditional event recommendations in social networks mainly concern the basic items like time and location. It is noted that few studies have yielded specific aspects such as the influence and spread capability of events and hosts. In this paper, we propose an event recommender approach fusing multiple features that can provide users with customized contents. To be specific, we consider hybridizing features including event influence, host impact, fee, social relationship and spatiotemporal characteristics. In order to achieve better performance, we concern the match degree between user and event properties especially in terms of their content and impact. Based on the improved idea of RankNet with neural networks, we build a Learning to Rank algorithm to reveal the importance of each feature. We rectify the problem of data sparse and cold start to grasp the balance of accuracy and novelty. Extensive experiments on datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising results in comparison with other schemes.",
