            "abstract": "This paper presents the results of four lottery-type experiments that investigate the effects of incentive structures on decision-making under uncertainty. We compare choices made with and without incentives, with fixed targets, with binary targets, and with four-outcome targets that are discretized from a logistic distribution. The results of the behavioral experiments (i) validate theoretical findings of utility functions induced by fixed and uncertain targets. Further, the behavioral results show that (ii) individuals\u2019 choices are indeed affected by incentive structures, which we quantify by several deviation measures. (iii) Defined consistency measures show that choices under uncertain targets become less consistent as the number of uncertain target outcomes increases. The results of these experiments provide insights into the effects of setting incentive structures on decision-making behavior.",

            "abstract": "Tool wear is an important factor in determining machining productivity. In this paper, tool wear is characterized by remaining useful tool life in a turning operation and is predicted using spindle power and a random sample path method of Bayesian inference. Turning tests are performed at different speeds and feed rates using a carbide tool and MS309 steel work material. The spindle power and the tool flank wear are monitored during cutting; the root mean square of the time domain power is found to be sensitive to tool wear. Sample root mean square power growth curves are generated and the probability of each curve being the true growth curve is updated using Bayes\u2019 rule. The updated probabilities are used to determine the remaining useful tool life. Results show good agreement between the predicted tool life and the empirically-determined true remaining life. The proposed method takes into account the uncertainty in tool life and the growth of the root mean square power at the end of tool life and is, therefore, robust and reliable.",

Therefore, options are valuable in settings with high uncertainty and high upfront investments. This paper presents an engineering management decision and determines the corresponding value of the option to delay using a decision analytic approach. The case study and sensitivity analyses show that the option value attains its maximum at the parameter setting that makes the decision maker without the option to delay indifferent between alternatives, indicating the close relationship between the value of perfect information and option value. The insights provide rules of thumb and provide an upper limit to how much should be spent on attaining an option to delay.",

One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides various sensitivity analyses for the effects of the elicitation parameters of two methods for the utility function assessments needed to deal with risky decisions involving health state and consumption. The two methods include: a) Using a utility function over a deterministic value function, and b) Using a utility copula function over utility functions for each attribute. The two methods are explored and compared in terms of the derived Micromort value (a way to value a risky decision deal in dollars) and how it is sensitive to each parameter needed for the assessments of each method. The results show that the Micromort value increases with the consumption level and decreases with age. As the decision-maker increases the tradeoff between health and wealth, the Micromort value tends to increase. In addition, becoming highly risk averse over value, the decision-maker also has a higher Micromort value.",

            "abstract": "An agent choosing between various actions tends to take the one with the lowest loss. But this choice is arguably too rigid (not adaptive) to be useful in complex situations, e.g. where exploration-exploitation trade-off is relevant, or in creative task solving. Here we study an agent that -- given a certain average utility invested into adaptation -- chooses his actions via probabilities obtained through optimizing the entropy. As we argue, entropy minimization corresponds to a risk-averse agent, whereas a risk-seeking agent will maximize the entropy. The entropy minimization can (under certain conditions) recover the epsilon-greedy probabilities known in reinforced learning. We show that the entropy minimization -- in contrast to its maximization -- leads to rudimentary forms of intelligent behavior: (i) the agent accounts for extreme events, especially when he did not invest much into adaptation. (ii) He chooses the action related to lesser loss (lesser of two evils) when confronted with two actions with comparable losses. (iii) The agent is subject to effects similar to cognitive dissonance and frustration. Neither of these features are shown by the risk-seeking agent whose probabilities are given by the maximum entropy. Mathematically, the difference between entropy maximization versus its minimization corresponds with maximizing a convex function (in a convex domain, i.e.convex programming) versus minimizing it (concave programming).",

            "abstract": "To maximize its profit, a firm has to design a product or a system and sell it at the price that maximizes its expected profit. The selling price has a direct influence on the demand for the product. Consequently, corporations spend vast amounts of money and resources on gathering information to improve demand forecasting. This paper investigates the behavior of the value of information (VOI) for uncertain demand, and the effects of demand elasticity for the product on the information value. We discuss the variation of the VOI with demand elasticity and show that VOI is maximum at the specific elasticity at which the decision maker is indifferent between two selling price alternatives. The results enable firms to determine the value of demand information and the effects of demand elasticity for a selling price.",
