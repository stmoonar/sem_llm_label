            "abstract": "In this article, we present the capabilities of the Common Metadata Framework (CMF) to enable trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). CMF is a decentralized framework for tracking metadata and lineages of datasets and machine learning (ML) models in AI pipelines. The framework provides a few unique features for ML practitioners, such as effortless management of distributed AI pipelines that span across the edge, high-performance systems, and public and private clouds. It provides an unbreakable audit trail and model provenance, resulting in trustworthy models. It ensures reproducibility by versioning artifacts and source code. CMF bridges the gap between the pipeline- and model-centric views of the AI metadata. This end-to-end approach to metadata logging unlocks a comprehensive understanding of ML workflows, enabling more efficient management and optimization of AI pipelines.",

            "title": "Knowledge Graph Empowered Machine Learning Pipelines for Improved Efficiency, Reusability, and Explainability",
            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines are complex, heavily parameterized, and expensive to execute in terms of time and computational resources. Consequently, it is onerous to run experiments with all possible parameter combinations to achieve an optimal solution. However, these AI experiments can be optimized by recommending relevant parameters to commence the experiments, reducing search space significantly, which can be fine tuned further. The relevant parameters can be identified by observing the metadata of pipelines executed in the past, and the relevant pipeline with relevant parameters can be recommended to the user. Currently, there are various metadata frameworks that automatically record the metadata of AI pipelines. Developing a recommendation system requires understanding pipeline metadata components and their interactions. There is a need to represent the metadata generated by these AI pipelines that capture the relationship among these pipeline entities. This article presents a knowledge-infused recommender that utilizes prior knowledge and metadata of already executed pipelines represented using the proposed metadata schema to recommend a relevant pipeline per user queries. Unlike black-box models, the use of knowledge graphs makes recommendations explainable, improving transparency and trustworthiness for the users.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach, Active Meta-learning, to improve computational control across various scientific experiments. It's particularly valuable for spectral reconstruction in STEM EELS nanoparticle plasmonic images. Traditionally, separate AI models were trained for each experiment via active learning, but this approach could face scalability issues with high-resolution data and the need for complex AI models due to intricate structure-property relationships. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of learning AI structural representations across multiple experiments. We train a meta model from 10 prior experiments carried out such that the model can adapt to new unseen conditions in considerably less time than when trained from scratch. We utilize the Reptile algorithm, a first-order, model-agnostic meta-learning approach. To enhance and expand the meta-training dataset, conventional computer vision methods are applied to augment images from previous experiments. We observe up to \u223c30-40% reduction in the number of training epochs for active learning exploration. The approach will be extended to distributed meta-learning workflows; meta-model trained in HPC datacenter using data from different microscopy sites and pushed to individual sites for active learning.",

We validate our design using industry standard System-on-chip virtual prototyping and synthesis tools.

            "abstract": "Many-cores on chip have now become a reality. They necessitate the revisit of several layers of a cloud infrastructure. For this to happen, parallel programming runtimes need to be designed for many-cores on chip as the target architecture. In this paper, we show that Map Reduce programming paradigm can be adapted to run on Intel's experimental single chip cloud computer (SCC) with 48-cores on chip. We demonstrate this using a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender system as an application. CF is widely used in e-commerce deployments to predict user's preference towards an unknown item from their past ratings. We address scalability with data partitioning, combining and sorting algorithms, maximize data locality to minimize communication cost within the SCC cores. We demonstrate ~2x speedup, ~94% lower power consumption for benchmark workloads as compared to a distributed cluster multi-processor nodes in use today.",

            "abstract": "The web is moving from an era of \"search\" to that of \"discovery\". Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems are now commonly used to predict user's preference towards an unknown item from past ratings. To be scalable or effective, they are typically deployed in distributed clusters and operate on extremely large apriori datasets. Improvement of the efficiency of these systems is increasingly recognized important and challenging. Meanwhile, emerging many-core processors present an opportunity to optimize these systems on a per-node basis. We identify and address challenges in fast computation of correlations by maximizing data locality and minimizing communication cost between individual cores. We experiment run-time, power and energy consumed on: (1) Intel's experimental single chip cloud computer (SCC), (2) NVIDIA's CUDA-enabled GPGPU co-processor and (3) traditional server class x86 processor. We achieve super linear speedups (~30x), reduction in energy consumption (~90%) for benchmark workloads. Introduction of this design in CF systems can significantly reduce the number of servers required in a data center, energy consumption, operation costs and floor area bringing in significant savings.",

            "title": "Designing a Collaborative Filtering Recommender on the Single Chip Cloud Computer",
            "abstract": "Fast response requirements for big-data applications on cloud infrastructures continues to grow. At the same time, many cores on-chip have now become a reality. These developments are set to redefine infrastructure nodes of cloud data centers in the future. For this to happen, parallel programming runtimes need to be designed for many-cores on chip as the target architecture. In this paper, we show that the commonly used MapReduce programming paradigm can be adapted to run on Intel's experimental single chip cloud computer (SCC) with 48-cores on chip. We demonstrate this using a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender system as an application. This is a widely used technique for information filtering to predict user's preference towards an unknown item from their past ratings. These systems are typically deployed in distributed clusters and operate on large apriori datasets. We address scalability with data partitioning, combining and sorting algorithms, maximize data locality to minimize communication cost within the SCC cores. We demonstrate ~2x speedup, ~94% lower energy consumption for benchmark workloads as compared to a distributed cluster of single and multi-processor nodes.",

            "abstract": "Emerging semantic search techniques require fast comparison of large \"concept trees\". This paper addresses the challenges involved in fast computation of similarity between two large concept trees using a CUDA-enabled GPGPU co-processor. We propose efficient techniques for the same using fast hash computations, membership tests using Bloom Filters and parallel reduction. We show how a CUDA-enabled mass produced GPU can form the core of a semantic comparator for better semantic search. We experiment run-time, power and energy consumed for similarity computation on two platforms: (1) traditional sever class Intel x86 processor (2) CUDA enabled graphics hardware. Results show 4x speedup with 78% overall energy reduction over sequential processing approaches. Our design can significantly reduce the number of servers required in a distributed search engine data center and can bring an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption, operational costs and floor area.",

Semantic comparison involves dot product computation of large sparse tensors which is time consuming and expensive. In this paper we present a low power parallel architecture that consumes only 15.41 Watts and demonstrates a speed-up in the order of 10textsuperscript{5} compared to a contemporary hardware design, and in the order of 10textsuperscript{4} compared to a purely software approach. Such high performance low power architecture can be used in semantic routers to elegantly implement energy efficient distributed search engines.",
