            "title": "Multi-Hop Knowledge Graph Reasoning in Few-Shot Scenarios",
            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-hop reasoning has become an interpretable way for knowledge graph reasoning owing to its persuasive explanations for the predicted results, but the reasoning performance of these methods drops significantly over few-shot relations (only contain few triplets). To address this problem, recent studies introduce meta-learning into RL-based reasoning methods. However, the performance of these studies is still limited due to the following points: (1) the overall reasoning accuracy is impaired due to the low reasoning accuracies over some hard relations; (2) the reasoning process becomes laborious and ineffective owing to the existence of noisy data; (3) the generalizability is negatively affected due to the lack of knowledge-sharing. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel model HMLS consisting of two modules HHML (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Meta-reinforcement Learning) and HHS (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Sampling). Specifically, HHML contains the following two components: (1) a hardness-aware RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by training hardness-aware batches and reducing noise; (2) a knowledge-sharing meta-learning adapts to few-shot relations by exploiting common features in the hierarchical relation structure. The other module HHS generates hardness-aware batches from relation and relation-cluster levels. The experimental results demonstrate that this work notably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in few-shot scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), have been successfully applied in sequential recommendation. These methods require sampling from probability distributions and adopt auxiliary loss functions to optimize the model, which can capture the uncertainty of user behaviors and alleviate exposure bias. However, existing generative models still suffer from the posterior collapse problem or the model collapse problem, thus limiting their applications in sequential recommendation. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we leverage a new paradigm of the generative models, i.e., diffusion models, and present sequential recommendation with diffusion models (DiffRec), which can avoid the issues of VAE- and GAN-based models and show better performance. While diffusion models are originally proposed to process continuous image data, we design an additional transition in the forward process together with a transition in the reverse process to enable the processing of the discrete recommendation data. We also design a different noising strategy that only noises the target item instead of the whole sequence, which is more suitable for sequential recommendation. Based on the modified diffusion process, we derive the objective function of our framework using a simplification technique and design a denoise sequential recommender to fulfill the objective function. As the lengthened diffusion steps substantially increase the time complexity, we propose an efficient training strategy and an efficient inference strategy to reduce training and inference cost and improve recommendation diversity. Extensive experiment results on three public benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach and show that DiffRec outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning and symbolic learning are two frequently employed methods in Sequential Recommendation (SR). Recent neural-symbolic SR models demonstrate their potential to enable SR to be equipped with concurrent perception and cognition capacities. However, neural-symbolic SR remains a challenging problem due to open issues like representing users and items in logical reasoning. In this paper, we combine the Deep Neural Network (DNN) SR models with logical reasoning and propose a general framework named Sequential Recommendation with Probabilistic Logical Reasoning (short for SR-PLR). This framework allows SR-PLR to benefit from both similarity matching and logical reasoning by disentangling feature embedding and logic embedding in the DNN and probabilistic logic network. To better capture the uncertainty and evolution of user tastes, SR-PLR embeds users and items with a probabilistic method and conducts probabilistic logical reasoning on users' interaction patterns. Then the feature and logic representations learned from the DNN and logic network are concatenated to make the prediction. Finally, experiments on various sequential recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness of the SR-PLR. Our code is available at https://github.com/Huanhuaneryuan/SR-PLR.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation, which aims to recommend next item that the user will likely interact in a near future, has become essential in various Internet applications. Existing methods usually consider the transition patterns between items, but ignore the transition patterns between features of items. We argue that only the item-level sequences cannot reveal the full sequential patterns, while explicit and implicit feature-level sequences can help extract the full sequential patterns. Meanwhile, the item-level sequential recommendation also suffers from limited supervised signal issues. In this article, we propose a novel model Feature-level Deeper Self-Attention Network with Contrastive Learning (FDSA-CL) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, FDSA-CL first integrates various heterogeneous features of items into feature-level sequences with different weights through a vanilla attention mechanism. After that, FDSA-CL applies separated self-attention blocks on item-level sequences and feature-level sequences, respectively, to model item transition patterns and feature transition patterns. Moreover, we propose contrastive learning and item feature recommendation tasks to capture the embedding commonality and further utilize the beneficial interaction among the two levels, so as to alleviate the sparsity of the supervised signal and extract the most critical information. Finally, we jointly optimize the above tasks. We evaluate the proposed model using two real-world datasets and experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to model user preferences by capturing behavior patterns from their item historical interaction data. Most existing methods model user preference in the time domain, omitting the fact that users\u2019 behaviors are also influenced by various frequency patterns that are difficult to separate in the entangled chronological items. However, few attempts have been made to train SR in the frequency domain, and it is still unclear how to use the frequency components to learn an appropriate representation for the user. To solve this problem, we shift the viewpoint to the frequency domain and propose a novel Contrastive Enhanced SLIde Filter MixEr for Sequential Recommendation, named SLIME4Rec. Specifically, we design a frequency ramp structure to allow the learnable filter slide on the frequency spectrums across different layers to capture different frequency patterns. Moreover, a Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and a Static Frequency Split (SFS) module are proposed to replace the self-attention module for effectively extracting frequency information in two ways. DFS is used to select helpful frequency components dynamically, and SFS is combined with the dynamic frequency selection module to provide a more fine-grained frequency division. Finally, contrastive learning is utilized to improve the quality of user embedding learned from the frequency domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed model performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art approaches.

            "abstract": "Fastest route recommendation (FRR) is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. The existing methods treat it as a pathfinding problem on dynamic graphs, and extend A* algorithm with neuralized travel time estimators as cost functions. However, they fail to provide effective heuristic cost due to the neglect of its admissibility and the utilization of noise path information, resulting in sub-optimal results and inefficiency. Besides, path sequentiality is also ignored, affecting algorithm accuracy as well. In this paper, we propose a variational inference based fastest route recommendation method, which follows the framework of A* algorithm and provides effective costs for routing. Specifically, we first adopt a sequential estimator to accurately estimate the travel time of a specific path. More importantly, we design a variational inference based estimator, which models the distribution of travel time between two nodes and provides an effective heuristic cost with high probability of being admissible. We further take advantage of adversarial learning to enrich the fastest path information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use variational estimator to consider the admissibility of heuristics in FRR. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. The results verify the performance advantage of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to capture users' dynamic interest and predicts the next item of users' preference. Most sequential recommendation methods use a deep neural network as sequence encoder to generate user and item representations. Existing works mainly center upon designing a stronger sequence encoder. However, few attempts have been made with training an ensemble of networks as sequence encoders, which is more powerful than a single network because an ensemble of parallel networks can yield diverse prediction results and hence better accuracy. In this paper, we present Ensemble Modeling with contrastive Knowledge Distillation for sequential recommendation (EMKD). Our framework adopts multiple parallel networks as an ensemble of sequence encoders and recommends items based on the output distributions of all these networks. To facilitate knowledge transfer between parallel networks, we propose a novel contrastive knowledge distillation approach, which performs knowledge transfer from the representation level via Intra-network Contrastive Learning (ICL) and Cross-network Contrastive Learning (CCL), as well as Knowledge Distillation (KD) from the logits level via minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher network and the student network. To leverage contextual information, we train the primary masked item prediction task alongside the auxiliary attribute prediction task as a multi-task learning scheme. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets show that EMKD achieves a significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we demonstrate that our ensemble method is a generalized approach that can also improve the performance of other sequential recommenders.

            "abstract": "The self-attention mechanism, which equips with a strong capability of modeling long-range dependencies, is one of the extensively used techniques in the sequential recommendation field. However, many recent studies represent that current self-attention based models are low-pass filters and are inadequate to capture high-frequency information. Furthermore, since the items in the user behaviors are intertwined with each other, these models are incomplete to distinguish the inherent periodicity obscured in the time domain. In this work, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain, and propose a novel Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Attention Network for Sequential Recommendation, namely FEARec. In this model, we firstly improve the original time domain self-attention in the frequency domain with a ramp structure to make both low-frequency and high-frequency information could be explicitly learned in our approach. Moreover, we additionally design a similar attention mechanism via auto-correlation in the frequency domain to capture the periodic characteristics and fuse the time and frequency level attention in a union model. Finally, both contrastive learning and frequency regularization are utilized to ensure that multiple views are aligned in both the time domain and frequency domain. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Contrastive Learning (CL) performances as a rising approach to address the challenge of sparse and noisy recommendation data. Although having achieved promising results, most existing CL methods only perform either hand-crafted data or model augmentation for generating contrastive pairs to find a proper augmentation operation for different datasets, which makes the model hard to generalize. Additionally, since insufficient input data may lead the encoder to learn collapsed embeddings, these CL methods expect a relatively large number of training data (e.g., large batch size or memory bank) to contrast. However, not all contrastive pairs are always informative and discriminative enough for the training processing. Therefore, a more general CL-based recommendation model called Meta-optimized Contrastive Learning for sequential Recommendation (MCLRec) is proposed in this work. By applying both data augmentation and learnable model augmentation operations, this work innovates the standard CL framework by contrasting data and model augmented views for adaptively capturing the informative features hidden in stochastic data augmentation. Moreover, MCLRec utilizes a meta-learning manner to guide the updating of the model augmenters, which helps to improve the quality of contrastive pairs without enlarging the amount of input data. Finally, a contrastive regularization term is considered to encourage the augmentation model to generate more informative augmented views and avoid too similar contrastive pairs within the meta updating. The experimental results on commonly used datasets validate the effectiveness of MCLRec.",

            "abstract": "Recently, contrastive learning alleviates data sparsity issues and improves the performance of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) recommender models by employing graph structure dropout augmentations. However, these models still face following limitations: (1) Information loss. Dropout may discard helpful information. (2) Insufficient utilization of path-level information. Meta-path is carried numerous high-order information, which has not been well considered in these models. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, Node and Meta-Path Contrastive Learning for Recommender Systems (NPCRS), which utilizes meta-path to capture path-level information for model learning. Specifically, our approach first generates a meta-path view on the user-item bipartite graph by leveraging meta-path instead of random dropout. Then, we learn the node representation on a user-item bipartite graph and meta-path view to capture both node and path-level information simultaneously. Further, a multi-positive sample mechanism is introduced to define positive and negative samples for contrastive learning. Finally, NPCRS utilizes contrastive learning to learn a more informative node representation. We evaluate the proposed model using three real-world datasets and our experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",
