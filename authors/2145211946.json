            "abstract": "Self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for clustering multivariate time-series data. However, real-world time-series data often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we present a S elf-supervised L earning-based A pproach to C lustering multivariate T ime-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we examined informatics challenges and opportunities related to emergency department visit data during public health emergencies. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the volume and acuity of adult patients visiting the emergency department (ED) of a medical center in Arizona during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. We performed a negative binomial regression analysis to understand how different public health-related mandates and statewide business opening/closing orders in Arizona affected the daily emergency department visits. The results of this study show that the average daily ED visits decreased by 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with the same period in 2019. In addition, the business closure order had the most impact on emergency department visits in comparison to other public health mandates.",
