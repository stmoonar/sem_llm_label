            "title": "SCO-VIST: Social Interaction Commonsense Knowledge-based Visual Storytelling",
            "abstract": "Visual storytelling aims to automatically generate a coherent story based on a given image sequence. Unlike tasks like image captioning, visual stories should contain factual descriptions, worldviews, and human social commonsense to put disjointed elements together to form a coherent and engaging human-writeable story. However, most models mainly focus on applying factual information and using taxonomic/lexical external knowledge when attempting to create stories. This paper introduces SCO-VIST, a framework representing the image sequence as a graph with objects and relations that includes human action motivation and its social interaction commonsense knowledge. SCO-VIST then takes this graph representing plot points and creates bridges between plot points with semantic and occurrence-based edge weights. This weighted story graph produces the storyline in a sequence of events using Floyd-Warshall\u2019s algorithm. Our proposed framework produces stories superior across multiple metrics in terms of visual grounding, coherence, diversity, and humanness, per both automatic and human evaluations.",

            "title": "RoViST: Learning Robust Metrics for Visual Storytelling",
            "abstract": "Visual storytelling (VST) is the task of generating a story paragraph that describes a given image sequence. Most existing storytelling approaches have evaluated their models using traditional natural language generation metrics like BLEU or CIDEr. However, such metrics based on n-gram matching tend to have poor correlation with human evaluation scores and do not explicitly consider other criteria necessary for storytelling such as sentence structure or topic coherence. Moreover, a single score is not enough to assess a story as it does not inform us about what specific errors were made by the model. In this paper, we propose 3 evaluation metrics sets that analyses which aspects we would look for in a good story: 1) visual grounding, 2) coherence, and 3) non-redundancy. We measure the reliability of our metric sets by analysing its correlation with human judgement scores on a sample of machine stories obtained from 4 state-of-the-arts models trained on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). Our metric sets outperforms other metrics on human correlation, and could be served as a learning based evaluation metric set that is complementary to existing rule-based metrics.",

            "title": "Arterial corridor travel time prediction under non-recurring conditions",
            "abstract": "Abstract Accurate travel time prediction for major freeways and corridors is crucial but challenging when road incidents happen. Data-driven models require a large set of historical data to estimate the spatial and temporal correlations between road incidents and traffic dynamics. More often than not, the amount of historical data under non-recurring conditions is limited when it comes to training the models. This paper investigates the application of data-driven models on an enriched database with simulated travel times. A well-calibrated traffic simulation is used to capture the artificial incident\u2019s impact on a major urban corridor in Sydney, Australia. This procedure is repeated for multiple created incidents, resulting in a synthetic dataset validated by the available actual historical data. Several machine learning models, such as Regression Tree, Support Vector Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Recurrent Neural Networks are trained and tested based on the simulated travel time and incident information. As a baseline model for comparison, the measured travel time at the prediction time is considered equal to multi-step ahead travel time. Based on the results, the data-driven models developed with the simulated data outperformed the baseline, indicating that our approach can be effectively employed in the travel time prediction.",
