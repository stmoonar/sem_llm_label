            "title": "IGCN: Item Influence Enhanced Graph Convolution Networks for Recommendation of Cold-Start Items",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems supported by collaborative filtering (CF) have recently been extensively deployed in various e-commerce platforms. However, CF models suffer from the cold-start issue, i.e., limited preference history of cold-start users/items causes inaccurate similarity measurements. Addressing the cold-start issue has attracted considerable attention. However, existing work mainly focuses on the user cold-start issue and pays less attention to the item cold-start issue, and their performance is still unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, in this paper, we aim to address the item cold-start issue and propose a novel recommendation framework called Item Influence Enhanced Graph Convolution Networks (IGCN). We handle the item cold-start issue via influence-aware item representation learning. In particular, we mine the item influence signal to perform item influence graph modeling. Then we propose an influence-aware neural item aggregation module to capture high-order item-item influence signal for item representation via iteratively aggregating the influence-related item context. With the help of influence-aware item representation learning, both local and global item influence signals are captured to enrich the item representation, even for the cold-start item. Furthermore, we propose a residual-connected factorization machine to join the user embedding and item embedding for scoring and prediction incorporating second-order interactions. Empirical results on three benchmark recommendation datasets demonstrate significant performance-boosting compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in not only cold-start setting (up to 14% gain) but also regular setting (up to 17% gain). The further efficient study also shows that the proposed method has lower complexities in time (up to 44% drop in epoch number and up to 27% drop in training time) and space (up to 14% drop in graph size).",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are currently dominating in modeling graph-structure data, while their high reliance on graph structure for inference significantly impedes them from widespread applications. By contrast, Graph-regularized MLPs (GR-MLPs) implicitly inject the graph structure information into model weights, while their performance can hardly match that of GNNs in most tasks. This motivates us to study the causes of the limited performance of GR-MLPs. In this paper, we first demonstrate that node embeddings learned from conventional GR-MLPs suffer from dimensional collapse, a phenomenon in which the largest a few eigenvalues dominate the embedding space, through empirical observations and theoretical analysis. As a result, the expressive power of the learned node representations is constrained. We further propose OrthoReg, a novel GR-MLP model to mitigate the dimensional collapse issue. Through a soft regularization loss on the correlation matrix of node embeddings, OrthoReg explicitly encourages orthogonal node representations and thus can naturally avoid dimensionally collapsed representations. Experiments on traditional transductive semi-supervised classification tasks and inductive node classification for cold-start scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.",

            "abstract": "Given a data lake of tabular data as well as a query table, how can we retrieve all the tables in the data lake that can be unioned with the query table? Table union search constitutes an essential task in data discovery and preparation as it enables data scientists to navigate massive open data repositories. Existing methods identify uniability based on column representations (word surface forms or token embeddings) and column relation represented by column representation similarity. However, the semantic similarity obtained between column representations is often insufficient to reveal latent relational features to describe the column relation between pair of columns and not robust to the table noise. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-stage self-supervised table union search framework called A UTO TUS , which represents column relation as a vector\u2013 column relational representation and learn column relational representation in a multi-stage manner that can better describe column relation for table unionability prediction. In particular, the large language model powered contextualized column relation encoder is updated by adaptive clustering and pseudo label classification iteratively so that the better column relational representation can be learned. Moreover, to improve the robustness of the model against table noises, we",

            "abstract": "The knowledge graph (KG) enhanced recommendation system has shown superior performance and attracted considerable attention. In recent years, researchers have attempted to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) and build end-to-end knowledge graph enhanced recommendation systems. Although several methods are proposed, it is still challenging to apply GNNs to solve the problem of KG enhanced recommendation due to the heterogeneous, redundant, and large-scale nature of KG versus the homogeneous nature of GNNs. To address the limitations of existing techniques, we propose a transformed heterogeneous graph neural network (TRANSGNN), an item-centric and GNN-powered framework that can better explore the heterogeneous, redundant, and large-scale relations among items in KG for an effective and efficient KG enhanced top- K recommendation. In particular, we propose an item-centric graph transformation module to transform the heterogeneous KG into a homogeneous item-item graph. This scheme allows us to distill the knowledge from the KG and encode the heterogeneous, redundant, and large-scale item-item relationship into a smaller, compact, homogeneous graph, better fitting the GNNs architecture that prefers homogeneous and small-scale graph input. We further introduce a collaborative graph fusion module to fuse the item-wise KG relational signals and the collaborative signals by augmenting the collaborative graph with the transformed item-item graph. Next, we propose to use a graph collaborative encoder over the augmented graph to propagate information along with high-order connectivity. The proposed framework is general and can be easily extended with advanced KG embedding and GNN models. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in significantly (up to 23%) improving the KG enhanced recommendation performance over the state-of-the-art methods, such as KGIN, KGAT, KGNN-LS in both regular and cold-start settings. The proposed approach is also efficient with significantly (up to 31%) fewer parameters.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) enhanced recommendation has demonstrated improved performance in the recommendation system (RecSys) and attracted considerable research interest. Recently the literature has adopted neural graph networks (GNNs) on the collaborative knowledge graph and built an end-to-end KG-enhanced RecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations: (1) treat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the highly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2) lack of design to explicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich knowledge in user preference.To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the rich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced recommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender System (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs to explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of meta-knowledge. In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user knowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The constructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph and user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to recursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs. This scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In addition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user representations from different Meta-KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant gains over the state-of-the-art baselines on both regular and cold-start recommendation settings.",

However, recent studies show that GNN is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. How to make GNN more robust? What are the key vulnerabilities in GNN? How to address the vulnerabilities and defend GNN against the adversarial attacks? Adversarial training has shown to be effective in improving the robustness of traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing adversarial training works mainly focus on the image data, which consists of continuous features, while the features and structures of graph data are often discrete. Moreover, rather than assuming each sample is independent and identically distributed as in DNN, GNN leverages the contextual information across the graph (e.g., neighborhoods of a node). Thus, existing adversarial training techniques cannot be directly applied to defend GNN.In this paper, we propose ContrastNet, an effective adversarial defense framework for GNN. In particular, we propose an adversarial contrastive learning method to train the GNN over the adversarial space. To further improve the robustness of GNN, we investigate the latent vulnerabilities in every component of a GNN encoder and propose corresponding refining strategies. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ContrastNet in improving the robustness of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Network and GraphSage, under various types of adversarial attacks.",

This new paradigm has revolutionized the entire field of natural language processing, and set the new state-of-the-art performance for a wide variety of NLP tasks. However, though PLMs could store certain knowledge/facts from training corpus, their knowledge awareness is still far from satisfactory. To address this issue, integrating knowledge into PLMs have recently become a very active research area and a variety of approaches have been developed. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the literature on this emerging and fast-growing field - Knowledge Enhanced Pretrained Language Models (KE-PLMs). We introduce three taxonomies to categorize existing work. Besides, we also survey the various NLU and NLG applications on which KE-PLM has demonstrated superior performance over vanilla PLMs. Finally, we discuss challenges that face KE-PLMs and also promising directions for future research.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph enhanced information retrieval systems have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to improve performance and provide additional explainability. As the knowledge graphs usually include fruitful facts, they are also good sources of side information. However, recent studies have shown that the usefulness of knowledge graphs depends highly on their representation, e.g., the embeddings of entities and relations. Embedding entities and relations in low-dimensional space is a successful knowledge graph representation solution. Most of the works lie in modeling symmetry/asymmetry/composition/inversion relations but pay less attention to the hierarchical relations. Recent studies have observed the fact that there exist rich semantic hierarchical relations in knowledge graphs such as Freebase (entities are connected in a taxonomic hierarchy) and WordNet (entities are synsets linked together in a hierarchy).To address the above problems, we propose Hierarchical Hyperbolic Neural Graph Embedding (H2E), a new knowledge graph representation approach, which is able to better preserve hierarchical relations. Specifically, the entities/relations representations are learned in a hyperbolic polar embedding space. In a hyperbolic polar embedding space, the entity and relation are modeled as a dual-embedding with modulus embedding part and phase embedding part, enabling the explicitly modeling of two types of hierarchies: inter-level hierarchy and intra-level hierarchy. As the polar embedding is defined i n hyperbolic space, the ability of modeling and inferring hierarchical relations are mutual enhanced. In addition, by noticing the existence of the rich relational context, we propose an attentional neural context aggregation to adaptively integrate the relational context for further enhancing the ability to preserve the hierarchical relations. The empirical study on three benchmark datasets for the link prediction task demonstrates significant performance gains compared to some existing state-of-the-art methods and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method on hierarchical relations.",

            "title": "Mixed-Curvature Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network for Knowledge Graph Completion",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gradually become valuable assets for many AI applications. In a KG, a node denotes an entity, and an edge (or link) denotes a relationship between the entities represented by the nodes. Knowledge graph completion infers and predicts missing edges in a KG automatically. Knowledge graph embeddings have shed light on addressing this task. Recent research embeds KGs in hyperbolic (negatively curved) space instead of conventional Euclidean (zero curved) space and is effective in capturing hierarchical structures. However, as multi-relational graphs, KGs are not structured uniformly and display intrinsic heterogeneous structures. They usually contain rich types of structures, such as hierarchical and cyclic typed structures. Embedding KGs in single-curvature space, such as Euclidean or hyperbolic space, overlooks the intrinsic heterogeneous structures of KGs, and therefore cannot accurately capture their structures. To address this issue, we propose Mixed-Curvature Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network (M2GNN), a generic approach that embeds multi-relational KGs in a mixed-curvature space for knowledge graph completion. Specifically, we define and construct a mixed-curvature space through a product manifold combining multiple single-curvature spaces (e.g., spherical, hyperbolic, or Euclidean) with the purpose of modeling a variety of structures. However, constructing a mixed-curvature space typically requires manually defining the fixed curvatures, which needs domain knowledge and additional data analysis. Improperly defined curvature space also cannot capture the structures of KGs accurately. To address this problem, we set mixed-curvatures as trainable parameters to better capture the underlying structures of the KGs. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Neural Updater by leveraging the heterogeneous relational context in mixed-curvature space to improve the quality of the embedding. Experiments on three KG datasets demonstrate that the proposed M2GNN can outperform its single geometry counterpart as well as state-of-the-art embedding methods on the KG completion task.",

            "abstract": "The sequential patterns within the user interactions are pivotal for representing the user's preference and capturing latent relationships among items. The recent advancements of sequence modeling by Transformers advocate the community to devise more effective encoders for the sequential recommendation. Most existing sequential methods assume users are deterministic. However, item-item transitions might fluctuate significantly in several item aspects and exhibit randomness of user interests. This stochastic characteristics brings up a solid demand to include uncertainties in representing sequences and items. Additionally, modeling sequences and items with uncertainties expands users' and items' interaction spaces, thus further alleviating cold-start problems. In this work, we propose a Distribution-based Transformer for Sequential Recommendation (DT4SR), which injects uncertainties into sequential modeling. We use Elliptical Gaussian distributions to describe items and sequences with uncertainty. We describe the uncertainty in items and sequences as Elliptical Gaussian distribution. And we adopt Wasserstein distance to measure the similarity between distributions. We devise two novel Transformers for modeling mean and covariance, which guarantees the positive-definite property of distributions. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The experiments on three benchmark datasets also demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating cold-start issues.
