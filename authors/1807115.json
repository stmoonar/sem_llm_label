            "abstract": "Many recent works on Entity Resolution (ER) leverage Deep Learning techniques involving language models to improve effectiveness. This is applied to both main steps of ER, i.e., blocking and matching. Several pre-trained embeddings have been tested, with the most popular ones being fastText and variants of the BERT model. However, there is no detailed analysis of their pros and cons. To cover this gap, we perform a thorough experimental analysis of 12 popular language models over 17 established benchmark datasets. First, we assess their vectorization overhead for converting all input entities into dense embeddings vectors. Second, we investigate their blocking performance, performing a detailed scalability analysis, and comparing them with the state-of-the-art deep learning-based blocking method. Third, we conclude with their relative performance for both supervised and unsupervised matching. Our experimental results provide novel insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the main language models, facilitating researchers and practitioners to select the most suitable ones in practice.",

These marketplaces require a set of value-added services, such as advanced search and discovery, that have been proposed in the database research community for years, but are yet to be put to practice. In this paper we propose to demonstrate the Topio Marketplace, an open-source data market platform that facilitates the search, exploration, discovery and augmentation of data assets. To support filtering, searching and discovery of data assets, we developed methods to extract and visualise a variety of metadata, as well as methods to discover related assets and mechanism to augment them. This paper aims at presenting these methods with a real deployment of the Topio marketplace, comprising hundreds of open and proprietary datasets.",

In this paper, we focus on Chebyshev distance, which is the largest difference between each individual pair of points across the entire length of two compared subsequences. We call such similar pairs <italic>twins</italic>. We first show how existing time series indices can be extended to perform twin subsequence search.

            "abstract": "Efficiently computing spatio-textual queries has become increasingly important in various applications that need to quickly retrieve geolocated entities associated with textual information, such as in location-based services and social networks. To accelerate such queries, several works have proposed combining spatial and textual indices into hybrid index structures. Recently, the novel idea of replacing traditional indices with ML models has attracted a lot of attention. This includes works on learned spatial indices, where the main challenge is to address the lack of a total ordering among objects in a multidimensional space. In this work, we investigate how to extend this novel type of index design to the case of spatio-textual data. We study different design choices, based on either loose or tight coupling between the spatial and textual part, as well as a hybrid index that combines a traditional and a learned component. We also perform an experimental evaluation using several real-world datasets to assess the potential benefits of using a learned index for evaluating spatio-textual queries.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) represent different types of entities and relationships between them. Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios.",

            "abstract": "\n Set similarity join is an important problem with many applications in data discovery, cleaning and integration. To increase robustness, fuzzy set similarity join calculates the similarity of two sets based on maximum weighted bipartite matching instead of set overlap. This allows pairs of elements, represented as sets or strings, to also match approximately rather than exactly, e.g., based on Jaccard similarity or edit distance. However, this significantly increases the verification cost, making even more important the need for efficient and effective filtering techniques to reduce the number of candidate pairs. The current state-of-the-art algorithm relies on similarity computations between pairs of elements to filter candidates. In this paper, we propose token-based instead of element-based filtering, showing that it is significantly more lightweight, while offering similar or even better pruning effectiveness. Moreover, we address the top-\n k\n variant of the problem, alleviating the need for a user-specified similarity threshold. We also propose early termination to reduce the cost of verification. Our experimental results on six real-world datasets show that our approach always outperforms the state of the art, being an order of magnitude faster on average.\n",

Existing works detect fixed-shape regions, such as circles or rectangles, thus often missing interesting regions occurring in real-world data that may have arbitrary shapes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of mixture-based best region search for arbitrarily shaped regions, introducing certain desired properties to ensure their cohesiveness and completeness. Since computing exact solutions to this problem has exponential cost with respect to the number of points, we propose anytime algorithms that efficiently search the space of candidate solutions to produce high-scoring regions under any given time budget. Our experiments on several real-world datasets show that our algorithms can produce high-quality results even within tight time constraints.",

            "abstract": "We have developed SimSearch , a tool that simplifies data exploration by enabling top-\ud835\udc58 similarity search over large collections of entities involving multiple heterogeneous attributes from different sources. We present the supported modes for data access, and the query mechanism orchestrating multi-attribute similarity search over diverse types of attributes, including textual, numerical and spatial. Users can specify their query parameters and preferences through a web interface, and visually inspect and compare the results through appropriate visualizations for the different types of attributes involved. We demonstrate SimSearch using a real-world, commercial dataset, highlighting its capabilities for interactive, user-friendly, and intuitive data exploration.",
