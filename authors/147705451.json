            "title": "Challenges of Moderating Social Virtual Reality",
            "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rise in social virtual reality (VR) platforms that allow people to interact in real-time through voice and gestures. The ephemeral nature of communication on these platforms can enable new forms of harmful behavior and new challenges for moderators. We performed virtual field research on three VR environments (AltspaceVR, Horizon Worlds, Rec Room). Based on observing 100 scheduled events, our analysis uncovered 13 distinct types of potentially harmful behaviors enabled by real-time voice, embodied interactions, and platform affordances. We witnessed potential harm at 45% of our observed events; only 24% of these incidents were addressed by moderators. To understand moderation practices, we conducted interviews with 11 moderators to investigate how they assess real-time interactions and how they operate within the current state of moderation tools. Our work sheds light on how moderation tools and practices must evolve to meet the new challenges of social VR.",

            "abstract": "The internet is often thought of as a democratizer, enabling equality in aspects such as pay, as well as a tool introducing novel communication and monetization opportunities. In this study we examine athletes on Cameo, a website that enables bi-directional fan-celebrity interactions, questioning whether the well-documented gender pay gaps in sports persist in this digital setting. Traditional studies into gender pay gaps in sports are mostly in a centralized setting where an organization decides the pay for the players, while Cameo facilitates grass-roots fan engagement where fans pay for video messages from their preferred athletes. The results showed that even on such a platform gender pay gaps persist, both in terms of cost-per-message, and in the number of requests, proxied by number of ratings. For instance, we find that female athletes have a median pay of 30$ per-video, while the same statistic is 40$ for men. The results also contribute to the study of parasocial relationships and personalized fan engagements over a distance. Something that has become more relevant during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where in-person fan engagement has often been limited.",

            "abstract": "Emotion recognition is one of the machine learning applications which can be done using text, speech, or image data gathered from social media spaces. Detecting emotion can help us in different \ufb01elds, including opinion mining. With the spread of social media, different platforms like Twitter have become data sources, and the language used in these platforms is informal, making the emotion detection task dif\ufb01cult. EmoPars and ArmanEmo are two new human-labeled emotion datasets for the Persian language. These datasets, especially EmoPars, are suffering from inequality between several samples between two classes. In this paper, we evaluate EmoPars and compare them with ArmanEmo. Throughout this analysis, we use data augmentation techniques, data re-sampling, and class-weights with Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models(PLMs) to handle the imbalance problem of these datasets. Moreover, feature selection is used to enhance the models\u2019 performance by emphasizing the text\u2019s speci\ufb01c features. In addition, we provide a new policy for selecting data from EmoPars, which selects the high-con\ufb01dence samples; as a result, the model does not see samples that do not have speci\ufb01c emotion during training. Our model reaches a Macro-averaged F1-score of 0.81 and 0.76 on ArmanEmo and EmoPars, re-spectively, which are new state-of-the-art results in these benchmarks. 1",

            "abstract": "Social media influencers have become an undeniably powerful part of the online world. The huge following behind these people allows them to promote ideas, beliefs and products to a large number of people. Thus, understanding what these accounts publish and how they behave on the platform can be of great value. In this study, we look at Iranian Instagram influencers and compare what they publish on their pages, how users interact with these accounts, and if field of work effects these interactions and the relationships among these accounts. Our results indicate that these accounts can be separated into meaningful groups corresponding with their field of work from the perspective of the interactions users have with them via comments. We also find that the influencer following graph is highly assortative with regards to field of work We further find that a large proportion of comments on all accounts are comments and statements indicating affection towards the user rather than reactions to that specific post\u2019s content.",

            "abstract": "Microaggressions are subtle manifestations of bias (Breitfeller et al., 2019). These demonstrations of bias can often be classified as a subset of abusive language. However, not as much focus has been placed on the recognition of these instances. As a result, limited data is available on the topic, and only in English. Being able to detect microaggressions without the need for labeled data would be advantageous since it would allow content moderation also for languages lacking annotated data. In this study, we introduce an unsupervised method to detect microaggressions in natural language expressions. The algorithm relies on pre-trained wordembeddings, leveraging the bias encoded in the model in order to detect microaggressions in unseen textual instances. We test the method on a dataset of racial and gender-based microaggressions, reporting promising results. We further run the algorithm on out-of-domain unseen data with the purpose of bootstrapping corpora of microaggressions \u201cin the wild\u201d, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Social media advertising data, particularly data from Facebook's advertising platform, have been successfully used for monitoring population and development indicators, with an emphasis on monitoring digital gender inequality. This paper contributes to this literature by assessing the feasibility of the attribute of user behavior of \"using a mobile device for X months\" available from Facebook's advertising platform to understand short-term global mobile diffusion dynamics and mobile phone gender gaps. We compare this attribute with other features of the platform to form a better understanding of the data and the digital behaviours they capture, and show how this Facebook attribute relates to mobile phone penetration rates and gender gaps in mobile access. We find that this \"Uses a mobile device (X months)\" advertising targeting attribute can be used as a proxy for changes in mobile phone penetration rates, especially among younger users, and that it captures cross-national variation in mobile gender gaps. We further find that countries with larger gender gaps disfavoring women are comparatively more gender-equal among the most recently joined cohort.",
