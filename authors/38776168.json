            "abstract": "This article studies the problem of computing a minimum zero forcing set (ZFS) in undirected graphs and presents new approaches to reducing the size of the minimum ZFS via edge augmentation. The minimum ZFS problem has numerous applications; for instance, it relates to the minimum leader selection problem for the strong structural controllability of networks defined over graphs. Computing a minimum ZFS is an NP-hard problem in general. We show that the greedy heuristic for the ZFS computation, though it typically performs well, could give arbitrarily bad solutions for some graphs. We provide a linear-time algorithm to compute a minimum ZFS in trees and a complete characterization of the minimum ZFS in the clique chain graphs. We also present a game-theoretic solution for general graphs by formalizing the minimum ZFS problem as a potential game. In addition, we consider the effect of edge augmentation on the size of the ZFS. Adding edges could improve network robustness; however, it could increase the size of the ZFS. We show that adding a set of carefully selected missing edges to a graph may actually reduce the size of the minimum ZFS. Finally, we numerically evaluate our results on random graphs.",

            "abstract": "Network control theory (NCT) offers a robust analytical framework for understanding the influence of network topology on dynamic behaviors, enabling researchers to decipher how certain patterns of external control measures can steer system dynamics towards desired states. Distinguished from other structure-function methodologies, NCT's predictive capabilities can be coupled with deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have demonstrated exceptional utility in various network-based learning tasks. However, the performance of G NN s heavily relies on the expressiveness of node features, and the lack of node features can greatly degrade their performance. Furthermore, many real-world systems may lack node-level information, posing a challenge for GNNs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, NCT-based Enhanced Feature Augmentation (NCT-EFA), that assimilates average controllability, along with other centrality indices, into the feature augmentation pipeline to enhance GNNs performance. Our evaluation of NCT-EFA, on six benchmark GNN models across two experimental setting-solely employing average controllability and in combination with additional centrality metrics-showcases an improved performance reaching as high as 11 %. Our results demonstrate that incorporating NCT into feature enrichment can substantively extend the applicability and heighten the performance of GNNs in scenarios where node-level information is unavailable.",

            "abstract": "Graph representation methods have recently become the de facto standard for downstream machine learning tasks on graph-structured data and have found numerous applications, e.g., drug discovery & development, recommendation, and forecasting. However, the existing methods are specially designed to work in a centralized environment, which limits their applicability to small or medium-sized graphs. In this work, we present a graph embedding method that extracts graph representations in a distributed environment with independent and parallel machines. The proposed method is built-upon the existing approach, distributed graph statistical distance (DGSD), to enhance the scalability on large graphs. The key innovation of our work lies in the proposition of a batching mechanism for client-server message passing, which reduces communication overhead during the computation of the distance matrix. In addition, we present a sampling approach for computing pairwise distances between the nodes to compute the desired graph embedding. Moreover, we systematically explore six distinct variations of a distributed graph embeddings and subsequently subject them to comprehensive evaluation. Our extensive evaluations on over 20 graph datasets and ten baseline methods demonstrate improved running time and comparative classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art embedding techniques.",

            "abstract": "This article studies the problem of computing zero-forcing sets (ZFS) in graphs and provides a machine-learning solution. Zero-forcing is a vertex coloring process to color the entire vertex set from a small subset of initially colored vertices constituting a ZFS. Such sets have several applications in network science and networked control systems. However, computing a minimum ZFS is an NP-hard problem, and popular heuristics encounter scalability issues. We investigate the greedy heuristic for this problem and propose a combination of the random selection and greedy algorithm called the random-greedy algorithm, which offers an efficient solution to the ZFS problem. Moreover, we enhance this approach by incorporating a data-driven solution based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), leveraging a random selection process. Our machine-learning architecture, designed to imitate the greedy algorithm, achieves significant speed improvements, surpassing the computational efficiency of the greedy algorithm by several orders of magnitude. We perform thorough numerical evaluations to demonstrate that the proposed approach is considerably efficient, scalable to graphs about ten times larger than those used in training, and generalizable to several different families of synthetic and real-world graphs with comparable and sometimes better results in terms of the size of ZFS. We also curate a comprehensive database comprising synthetic and real-world graph datasets, including approximate and optimal ZFS solutions. This database serves as a benchmark for training machine-learning models and provides valuable resources for further research and evaluation in this problem domain. Our findings showcase the effectiveness of the proposed machine-learning solution and advance the state-of-the-art in solving the ZFS problem.",

Existing solutions typically rely on human expertise to annotate datasets or specify features, which is prone to error. In addition, the learning models have a high rate of false positives. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a properly curated C/C++ source code vulnerability dataset, denoted as CVEFunctionGraphEmbeddings (CVEFGE), to aid in developing models. CVEFGE is automatically crawled from the CVE database, which contains authentic and publicly disclosed source code vulnerabilities. We also propose a learning framework based on graph neural networks, denoted SEquential Graph Neural Network (SEGNN) for learning a large number of code semantic representations.

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable merit in performing various learning-based tasks in complex networks. The superior performance of GNNs often correlates with the availability and quality of node-level features in the input networks. However, for many network applications, such node-level information may be missing or unreliable, thereby limiting the applicability and efficacy of GNNs. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach denoted as Ego-centric Spectral subGraph Embedding Augmentation (ESGEA), which aims to enhance and design node features, particularly in scenarios where information is lacking. Our method leverages the topological structure of the local subgraph to create topology-aware node features. The subgraph features are generated using an efficient spectral graph embedding technique, and they serve as node features that capture the local topological organization of the network. The explicit node features, if present, are then enhanced with the subgraph embeddings in order to improve the overall performance. ESGEA is compatible with any GNN-based architecture and is effective even in the absence of node features. We evaluate the proposed method in a social network graph classification task where node attributes are unavailable, as well as in a node classification task where node features are corrupted or even absent. The evaluation results on seven datasets and eight baseline models indicate up to a 10% improvement in AUC and a 7% improvement in accuracy for graph and node classification tasks, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph1, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the controllability backbone problem in dynamical networks defined over graphs. The main idea of the controllability backbone is to identify a small subset of edges in a given network such that any subnetwork containing those edges/links has at least the same network controllability as the original network while assuming the same set of input/leader vertices. We consider the strong structural controllability (SSC) in our work, which is useful but computationally challenging. Thus, we utilize two lower bounds on the network's SSC based on the zero forcing notion and graph distances. We provide algorithms to compute controllability backbones while preserving these lower bounds. We thoroughly analyze the proposed algorithms and compute the number of edges in the controllability backbones. Finally, we compare and numerically evaluate our methods on random graphs.",
