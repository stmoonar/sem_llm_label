            "abstract": "Chronic disease management and follow-up are vital for realizing sustained patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Recent advancements in wearable sensing technologies, particularly wrist-worn devices, offer promising solutions for longitudinal patient follow-up by shifting from subjective, intermittent self-reporting to objective, continuous monitoring. However, collecting and analyzing wearable data presents unique challenges, such as data entry errors, non-wear periods, missing wearable data, and wearable artifacts. We therefore present an in-depth exploration of data analysis challenges tied to wrist-worn wearables and ambulatory label acquisition, using two real-world datasets (i.e., mBrain21 and ETRI lifelog2020). We introduce novel practical countermeasures, including participant compliance visualizations, interaction-triggered questionnaires to assess personal bias, and an optimized wearable non-wear detection pipeline. Further, we propose a visual analytics approach to validate processing pipelines using scalable tools such as tsflex and Plotly-Resampler. Lastly, we investigate the impact of missing wearable data on\"window-of-interest\"analysis methodologies. Prioritizing transparency and reproducibility, we offer open access to our detailed code examples, facilitating adaptation in future wearable research. In conclusion, our contributions provide actionable approaches for wearable data collection and analysis in chronic disease management.",

            "abstract": "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a fundamental technology in the Semantic Web, enabling the representation and interchange of structured data. However, RDF lacks the capability to express negated statements in a generic way. As a result, exchanging negative information on a Web scale is thus far restricted to specific cases and predefined statements. The ability to negate (virtually) any RDF statement allows for a comprehensive way to refute, deny or otherwise invalidate claims on a Web scale. Via an intermediate step of a diagrammatic approach to logical expressions called Peirce graphs, we introduce RDF Surfaces, an extension of RDF that incorporates the concept of classic negation, known from first-order logic. Overall, RDF Surfaces provides an abstract, visual approach to negation within the Semantic Web, offering a more general and widely applicable approach than previous attempts at incorporating negation. Aside from a (traditional) programmatic syntax, RDF Surfaces can also be represented visually by means of diagrams inspired by Peirce graphs. We demonstrate negation via RDF Surfaces and how to reason upon it in illustrative use cases drawn from the domains of academic publishing and eHealth. We hope this vision paper attracts new implementers and opens the discussion to its formal specification.",

            "abstract": "Many data-intensive applications, including smart logistics, smart cities, intelligent factories, etc. have been made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to the large amounts of data produced, it is no longer viable to upload all data to the cloud, as it results in network congestion, low throughput, high latency, and privacy issues. Edge processing provides a solution to these problems and aims to process data as close to the source. However, a generic approach to edge processing that can decide which components to offload is still missing. Cascading Reasoning (CR) is a vision that aims to realize highly expressive reasoning over high-frequency data by introducing a layered approach. The lowest layers employ low-complexity techniques and select relevant parts of the data. Going up in the layers, the complexity increases while the data volume decreases as each layer selects relevant parts for further processing. CR aligns with Edge processing, as lower layers can be processed closer to the source, i.e. the Edge, and the expressive reasoning allows to handle the data variety and domain knowledge imposed by the IoT. However, until now, CR approaches required to manually define the various layers. In this paper, we propose a generic CR Edge processing platform that can decide which parts of the queries to offload to the Edge and how to optimize the queries and reasoning rules for efficient Edge processing.",

Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.",

            "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) algorithms today are designed and evaluated on data collected in controlled settings, providing limited insights into their performance in real-world situations with noisy and missing sensor data and natural human activities. We present a real-world HAR open dataset compiled from a wristband equipped with a triaxial accelerometer. During data collection, participants had autonomy in their daily life activities, and the process remained unobserved and uncontrolled. A general convolutional neural network model was trained on this dataset, achieving a mean balanced accuracy (MBA) of 80%. Personalizing the general model through transfer learning can yield comparable and even superior results using fewer data, with the MBA improving to 85%. To emphasize the issue of insufficient real-world training data, we conducted training of the model using the public MHEALTH dataset, resulting in 100% MBA. However, upon evaluating the MHEALTH-trained model on our real-world dataset, the MBA drops to 62%. After personalizing the model with real-world data, an improvement of 17% in the MBA is achieved. This paper showcases the potential of transfer learning to make HAR models trained in different contexts (lab vs. real-world) and on different participants perform well for new individuals with limited real-world labeled data available.",

Generic queries can deal with context changes but often lead to performance issues caused by the need for expressive real-time semantic reasoning. In addition, query window parameters are part of the manual configuration and cannot be made context-dependent. To tackle these problems, this paper presents DIVIDE, a component for a semantic IoT platform that adaptively derives and manages the queries of the platform\u2019s stream processing components in a context-aware and scalable manner, and that enables privacy by design. By performing semantic reasoning to derive the queries when context changes are observed, their real-time evaluation does require any reasoning. The results of an evaluation on a homecare monitoring use case demonstrate how activity detection queries derived with DIVIDE can be evaluated in on average less than 3.7 seconds and can therefore successfully run on low-end IoT devices.",

            "abstract": "Feature selection is a crucial step in developing robust and powerful machine learning models. Feature selection techniques can be divided into two categories: filter and wrapper methods. While wrapper methods commonly result in strong predictive performances, they suffer from a large computational complexity and therefore take a significant amount of time to complete, especially when dealing with high-dimensional feature sets. Alternatively, filter methods are considerably faster, but suffer from several other disadvantages, such as (i) requiring a threshold value, (ii) not taking into account intercorrelation between features, and (iii) ignoring feature interactions with the model. To this end, we present powershap, a novel wrapper feature selection method, which leverages statistical hypothesis testing and power calculations in combination with Shapley values for quick and intuitive feature selection. Powershap is built on the core assumption that an informative feature will have a larger impact on the prediction compared to a known random feature. Benchmarks and simulations show that powershap outperforms other filter methods with predictive performances on par with wrapper methods while being significantly faster, often even reaching half or a third of the execution time. As such, powershap provides a competitive and quick algorithm that can be used by various models in different domains. Furthermore, powershap is implemented as a plug-and-play and open-source sklearn component, enabling easy integration in conventional data science pipelines. User experience is even further enhanced by also providing an automatic mode that automatically tunes the hyper-parameters of the powershap algorithm, allowing to use the algorithm without any configuration needed.",
