The complete set of equipment includes a Raspberry Pi, a camera and an Android App. We connected the CSI camera to the raspberry PI interface to complete the image acquisition of physical paper reading materials and connected the playback device to the Raspberry Pi audio interface to provide users with reading services. The Android app communicates with the Raspberry Pi to control the Raspberry Pi\u2019s actions, including recognizing images to generate text, selecting the appropriate reading file, and choosing to play or pause of file reading. Unlike such devices developed in the past, the service is made easier by the fact that visually impaired people can operate this optophone directly from their phones. The technical overview of each subsystem of the optophone is presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Measurement samples are often taken in various monitoring applications. To reduce the sensing cost, it is desirable to achieve better sensing quality while using fewer samples. Compressive Sensing (CS) technique finds its role when the signal to be sampled meets certain sparsity requirements. In this paper we investigate the possibility and basic techniques that could further reduce the number of samples involved in conventional CS theory by exploiting learning-based non-uniform adaptive sampling. Based on a typical signal sensing application, we illustrate and evaluate the performance of two of our algorithms, Individual Chasing and Centroid Chasing, for signals of different distribution features. Our proposed learning-based adaptive sampling schemes complement existing efforts in CS fields and do not depend on any specific signal reconstruction technique. Compared to conventional sparse sampling methods, the simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms allow 46% less number of samples for accurate signal reconstruction and achieve up to 57% smaller signal reconstruction error under the same noise condition.",

            "abstract": "WiFi will be an important choice to load off the ever increasing data demand of end users in future mobile converged networks, which will inevitably result in high-density WiFi deployments. However, higher density of WiFi networks is not a guarantee to obtain higher throughput, because of the increasing interference among end users and overlapped WiFi networks. As a solution to this problem, this research proposes a flexible framework for fine-grained channel width adaptation and multi-channel access in WiFi networks. The framework adopts DOFDM (Discontinuous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) in physical layer, which allocates the frequency resource in the granularity of sub-carrier. And in MAC layer, it uses a frequency-time domain backoff scheme to decrease the access collision, resulting in higher access probability for the contending nodes.",

Some existing approaches designed for wired networks are not applicable to wireless networks, due to their overwhelming control overheads. In this paper, we propose a reliable and scalable binary range vector summary tree (BRVST) infrastructure for flexible information expression support, effective content matching and timely information dissemination over the dynamic wireless network. A novel attribute range vector structure has been introduced for efficient and accurate content representation and a summary tree structure to facilitate information aggregation. For robust and scalable operations over dynamic wireless network, the proposed overlay system exploits a virtual hierarchical geographic management framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that BRVST has a significantly faster event matching speed, while incurs very low storage and traffic overhead, as compared with peer schemes tested.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we consider transmit beamforming (BF) design under per-antenna power constraint (PPC) for multiple-input-single-output (MISO) frequency-selective channels. Both cyclic-prefixed (CP) single carriers and orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems are investigated. Since there is no closed-form expression for the optimal PPC BF coefficients, and the optimization tools employed to find the PPC solution are usually complicated, here, we propose three computationally more effective suboptimal solutions to minimize the arithmetic mean of the effective error probabilities. Moreover, we address the issue of limited-rate feedback, and a simple codebook design method for frequency-selective channels is proposed. Unlike conventional methods where the codebook is directly designed for BF vectors, here, we construct codebooks for the amplitude and phase of the time-domain channel state information (CSI) to reduce the rate of feedback. Further, the nonuniform feedback strategy is investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed suboptimal solutions have much lower complexities than the convex optimization-based PPC solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed uniform and nonuniform limited-rate feedback methods is also demonstrated via simulations.",

However, a long power-delay profile (PDP), which we encounter frequently in broadband systems, will deteriorate the performance rapidly. In this paper, a noncoherent sequence detection of DSFM MIMO-OFDM is proposed, which exploits the correlation among subcarriers and utilizes the past several symbols to detect the current one and it can be used to alleviate the performance degradation introduced by long PDPs. We also present an analytical approximation of the symbol-error rate (SER) for DSFM, which enables quick and accurate performance evaluations. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of our approach and it is more flexible than the fixed window multiple-symbols detection under variable numbers of subcarriers.",
