            "abstract": "As the number of determined and predicted protein structures and the size of druglike \u2018make-on-demand\u2019 libraries soar, the time-consuming nature of structure-based computer-aided drug design calls for innovative computational algorithms. De novo drug design introduces in silico heuristics to accelerate searching in the vast chemical space. This review focuses on recent advances in structure-based de novo drug design, ranging from conventional fragment-based methods, evolutionary algorithms, and Metropolis Monte Carlo methods to deep generative models. Due to the historical limitation of de novo drug design generating readily available drug-like molecules, we highlight the synthetic accessibility efforts in each category and the benchmarking strategies taken to validate the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "In computer-aided drug discovery, quantitative structure activity relation models are trained to predict biological activity from chemical structure. Despite the recent success of applying graph neural network to this task, important chemical information such as molecular chirality is ignored. To fill this crucial gap, we propose Molecular-Kernel Graph Neural Network (MolKGNN) for molecular representation learning, which features SE(3)-/conformation invariance, chiralityawareness, and interpretability. For our MolKGNN, we first design a molecular graph convolution to capture the chemical pattern by comparing the atom\u2019s similarity with the learnable molecular kernels. Furthermore, we propagate the similarity score to capture the higher-order chemical pattern. To assess the method, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with nine well-curated datasets spanning numerous important drug targets that feature realistic high class imbalance and it demonstrates the superiority of MolKGNN over other GNNs in CADD. Meanwhile, the learned kernels identify patterns that agree with domain knowledge, confirming the pragmatic interpretability of this approach. Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/meilerlab/MolKGNN.",

            "abstract": "Computer-aided drug discovery is an essential component of modern drug development. Therein, deep learning has become an important tool for rapid screening of billions of molecules in silico for potential hits containing desired chemical features. Despite its importance, substantial challenges persist in training these models, such as severe class imbalance, high decision thresholds, and lack of ground truth labels in some datasets. In this work we argue in favor of directly optimizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in such cases, due to its robustness to class imbalance, its ability to compromise over different decision thresholds, certain freedom to influence the relative weights in this compromise, fidelity to typical benchmarking measures, and equivalence to positive/unlabeled learning. We also propose new training schemes (coherent mini-batch arrangement, and usage of out-of-batch samples) for cost functions based on the ROC, as well as a cost function based on the logAUC metric that facilitates early enrichment (i.e. improves performance at high decision thresholds, as often desired when synthesizing predicted hit compounds). We demonstrate that these approaches outperform standard deep learning approaches on a series of PubChem high-throughput screening datasets that represent realistic and diverse drug discovery campaigns on major drug target families.",

            "abstract": "Many scientific disciplines rely on computational methods for data analysis, model generation, and prediction. Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community. The practices described here are independent of subject area and can be readily adopted by other software development communities.",

While freely available to academic users, external usage is limited by the need for expertise in the Unix command line environment. To make Rosetta protocols available to a wider audience, we previously created a web server called Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone (ROSIE), which provides a common environment for hosting web\u2010accessible Rosetta protocols. Here we describe a simplification of the ROSIE protocol specification format, one that permits easier implementation of Rosetta protocols. Whereas the previous format required creating multiple separate files in different locations, the new format allows specification of the protocol in a single file. This new, simplified protocol specification has more than doubled the number of Rosetta protocols available under ROSIE. These new applications include pKa determination, lipid accessibility calculation, ribonucleic acid redesign, protein\u2010protein docking, protein\u2010small molecule docking, symmetric docking, antibody docking, cyclic toxin docking, critical binding peptide determination, and mapping small molecule binding sites.

The overwhelming positive response to this publication we received motivates us to here share the next iteration of these tutorials that feature de novo folding, comparative modeling, loop construction, protein docking, small molecule docking, and protein design. This updated and expanded set of tutorials is needed, as since 2010 Rosetta has been fully redesigned into an object-oriented protein modeling program Rosetta3. Notable improvements include a substantially improved energy function, an XML-like language termed \u201cRosettaScripts\u201d for flexibly specifying modeling task, new analysis tools, the addition of the TopologyBroker to control conformational sampling, and support for multiple templates in comparative modeling. Rosetta\u2019s ability to model systems with symmetric proteins, membrane proteins, noncanonical amino acids, and RNA has also been greatly expanded and improved.",
