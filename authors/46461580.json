            "title": "Distributed Optimal Dynamic Communication Paths Planning for PMUs in the WAMS Communication Network",
            "abstract": "The wide application of phasor measurement units (PMUs) increases the interdependence between the smart grid and wide-area measurement systems (WAMS). However, the end-to-end (ETE) delay that the data experienced from PMUs to the phasor data concentrator (PDC) has become non-negligible. A significant delay may affect the data completeness received by the PDC, thereby affecting the performance of the WAMS application, e.g., state estimation (SE). The previous research focuses on centralized path planning to mitigate the physical distance between PMUs and the PDC. Few studies have considered addressing the data completeness problem using the distributed algorithm from the aspect of the ETE delay. This article proposes a distributed bias min-consensus-based approach in path construction to minimize the ETE delay. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in addressing the data completeness and enhancing the SE performance. Also, it is computationally efficient in path reconstruction when the links suffer cyber-attacks.",

            "title": "Random Smoothing Regularization in Kernel Gradient Descent Learning",
            "abstract": "Random smoothing data augmentation is a unique form of regularization that can prevent overfitting by introducing noise to the input data, encouraging the model to learn more generalized features. Despite its success in various applications, there has been a lack of systematic study on the regularization ability of random smoothing. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a framework for random smoothing regularization that can adaptively and effectively learn a wide range of ground truth functions belonging to the classical Sobolev spaces. Specifically, we investigate two underlying function spaces: the Sobolev space of low intrinsic dimension, which includes the Sobolev space in $D$-dimensional Euclidean space or low-dimensional sub-manifolds as special cases, and the mixed smooth Sobolev space with a tensor structure. By using random smoothing regularization as novel convolution-based smoothing kernels, we can attain optimal convergence rates in these cases using a kernel gradient descent algorithm, either with early stopping or weight decay. It is noteworthy that our estimator can adapt to the structural assumptions of the underlying data and avoid the curse of dimensionality. This is achieved through various choices of injected noise distributions such as Gaussian, Laplace, or general polynomial noises, allowing for broad adaptation to the aforementioned structural assumptions of the underlying data. The convergence rate depends only on the effective dimension, which may be significantly smaller than the actual data dimension. We conduct numerical experiments on simulated data to validate our theoretical results.",

            "abstract": "Visual object tracking is a very important task for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Limited resources of UAV lead to strong demand for efficient and robust trackers. In recent years, deep learning-based trackers, especially, siamese trackers achieve very impressive results. Though siamese trackers can run a relatively fast speed on the high-end GPU, they are becoming heavier and heavier which restricts them to be deployed on UAV platform. In this work, we propose a lightweight aerial tracker based on the siamese network. We use EfficientNet as the backbone, which has less parameters and stronger feature extract ability compared with ResNet-50. After a pixel-wise correlation, a classification branch and a regression branch are applied to predict the front/back score and offset of the target without the predefined anchor. The results show that our tracker works efficiently and achieves impressive performance on UAV tracking datasets. In addition, the real-world test shows that it runs effectively on the Nvidia Jetson NX deployed on DJI UAV.",

To develop and evaluate our approach, a large urban driving dataset dubbed AV Breadcrumbs is automatically labeled by leveraging vector map representations and projective geometry to annotate over 900,000 images. Our results demonstrate potential for dynamic scene modeling across various urban driving scenarios. Our model achieves an F1 score of 0.684 and an average normalized depth error of 2.083.

In this paper, the downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) multi-beam satellite is used as the system model, and a greedy principle-based joint user grouping and subchannel joint access algorithm is proposed to solve the problems of user grouping and bandwidth allocation. On this basis, a power resource allocation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. By optimizing the reachability and rate of the system and user fairness under the constraints of the total transmission power and the user's minimum transmission rate, the optimization problem is modeled as Markov decision process, using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to achieve optimal allocation. The validity and superiority of the algorithm are verified by simulation, which is of great significance to the research of multi-beam satellite resource allocation.",

            "abstract": "Personalized recommendation has been instrumental in many real applications. Despite the great progress, the underlying multi-scenario characteristics (e.g., users may behave differently under different scenarios) are largely ignored by existing recommender systems. Intuitively, modeling different scenarios properly could significantly improve the recommendation accuracy, and some existing work has explored this direction. However, these work assumes the scenarios are explicitly given, and thus becomes less effective when such information is unavailable. To complicate things further, proper scenario modeling from data is challenging and the recommendation models may easily overfit to some scenarios. In this paper, we propose a multi-scenario learning framework, MUSENET, for personalized recommendation. The key idea of MUSENET is to learn multiple implicit scenarios from the user behaviors, with a careful design inspired by the causal interpretation of recommender systems to avoid the overfitting issue. Additionally, since users' repeat consumptions account for a large part of the user behavior data on many e-commerce platforms, a repeat-aware mechanism is integrated to handle users' repurchase intentions within each scenario. Comprehensive experimental results on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "The next generation digital TV (DTV) broadcast, namely Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) 3.0, relies on substantial single frequency networks (SFN), each of which requires a studio to transmitter link (STL) to transmit data from the broadcast gateway (BG), leading to significant construction costs. Therefore, the wireless in-band distribution link (IDL) technology is proposed, which uses layered-division multiplexing (LDM) to transmit the STL data via wireless links from the BG to the SFN transmitters within the same spectrum as the broadcast services. In this paper, we propose the time synchronization and signal detection algorithm for wireless IDL systems with both unicast and broadcast signals. We introduce two multiplexing schemes, N-LDM and 3-LDM, and demonstrate their superiority over traditional frequency division multiplexing (FDM). To overcome the challenge of multi-access interference and synchronization errors caused by multipath, we develop a unique word (UW) design algorithm for transmitted signals and a double threshold correlation detection algorithm (DTCDA) that outperforms traditional ones. We employ a second threshold to enhance detection performance at low signal-to-noise ratios, and utilizes successive interference cancellation (SIC) to mitigate multiple-access interference. More importantly, our approach requires no knowledge of the unicast user number or channel state information. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

            "abstract": "Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications. Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website.",

            "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of the hepatic vein can improve the precision of liver disease diagnosis and treatment. Since the hepatic venous system is a small target and sparsely distributed, with various and diverse morphology, data labeling is difficult. Therefore, automatic hepatic vein segmentation is extremely challenging. We propose a lightweight contextual and morphological awareness network and design a novel morphology aware module based on attention mechanism and a 3D reconstruction module. The morphology aware module can obtain the slice similarity awareness mapping, which can enhance the continuous area of the hepatic veins in two adjacent slices through attention weighting. The 3D reconstruction module connects the 2D encoder and the 3D decoder to obtain the learning ability of 3D context with a very small amount of parameters. Compared with other SOTA methods, using the proposed method demonstrates an enhancement in the dice coefficient with few parameters on the two datasets. A small number of parameters can reduce hardware requirements and potentially have stronger generalization, which is an advantage in clinical deployment.",

            "title": "On the Sweet Spot of Contrastive Views for Knowledge-enhanced Recommendation",
            "abstract": "In recommender systems, knowledge graph (KG) can offer critical information that is lacking in the original user-item interaction graph (IG). Recent process has explored this direction and shows that contrastive learning is a promising way to integrate both. However, we observe that existing KG-enhanced recommenders struggle in balancing between the two contrastive views of IG and KG, making them sometimes even less effective than simply applying contrastive learning on IG without using KG. In this paper, we propose a new contrastive learning framework for KG-enhanced recommendation. Specifically, to make full use of the knowledge, we construct two separate contrastive views for KG and IG, and maximize their mutual information; to ease the contrastive learning on the two views, we further fuse KG information into IG in a one-direction manner.Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, compared to the state-of-the-art.
