            "abstract": "We present a framework SCStory for online story discovery, that helps people digest rapidly published news article streams in real-time without human annotations. To organize news article streams into stories, existing approaches directly encode the articles and cluster them based on representation similarity. However, these methods yield noisy and inaccurate story discovery results because the generic article embeddings do not effectively reflect the story-indicative semantics in an article and cannot adapt to the rapidly evolving news article streams. SCStory employs self-supervised and continual learning with a novel idea of story-indicative adaptive modeling of news article streams. With a lightweight hierarchical embedding module that first learns sentence representations and then article representations, SCStory identifies story-relevant information of news articles and uses them to discover stories. The embedding module is continuously updated to adapt to evolving news streams with a contrastive learning objective, backed up by two unique techniques, confidence-aware memory replay and prioritized-augmentation, employed for label absence and data scarcity problems. Thorough experiments on real and the latest news data sets demonstrate that SCStory outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised online story discovery.",

            "abstract": "Network-based time series forecasting is a challenging task as it involves complex geometric properties, higher-order relations, and scale-free characteristics. Previous work has modeled network-based series as oversimplified graphs or has ignored the power law dynamics of real-world temporal and dynamic networks, which could yield suboptimal results. With the aim to address these issues, here we propose THINK, a novel framework based on hypergraph learning that captures the hyperbolic properties of time-evolving dynamic hypergraphs. We design an elegant hyperbolic distance-aware hypergraph attention mechanism to better capture informative internal structural features on the Poincar\u00e9 ball. Through quantitative and conceptual analysis on seven tasks across temporal, and time-evolving dynamic hypergraphs, we demonstrate THINK\u2019s practicality in comparison to a variety of benchmarks spanning finance, health, and energy networks.",

            "abstract": "Modern object detection for aerial images requires numerous annotated data. However, the data annotation process inevitably introduces noise due to the bird\u2019s eye view perspective of aerial images and the professional requirements of annotations. While recent noise-robust object detection methods achieved great success, the noise side effect during the early training stage was still a problem. As demonstrated in this letter, noise during the early training stage will cumulatively affect the final performance. Based on the abovementioned observations, we propose a training strategy called correction maximization training to purify the noisy annotations and then train models. In particular, we design a novel noise filter called the probability differential (PD) to identify and revise wrong labels. After purification, we train the detector with the revised dataset. Compared with the existing works, the proposed method could be adapted in most modern object detectors (e.g., Faster RCNN and RetinaNet) and requires little hyperparameter tuning across different datasets and models. Extensive experiments on DOTA show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results with both symmetric and asymmetric noise.",

            "abstract": "Automatic extraction of product attributes from their textual descriptions is essential for online shopper experience. One inherent challenge of this task is the emerging nature of e-commerce products \u2014 we see new types of products with their unique set of new attributes constantly. Most prior works on this matter mine new values for a set of known attributes but cannot handle new attributes that arose from constantly changing data. In this work, we study the attribute mining problem in an open-world setting to extract novel attributes and their values. Instead of providing comprehensive training data, the user only needs to provide a few examples for a few known attribute types as weak supervision. We propose a principled framework that first generates attribute value candidates and then groups them into clusters of attributes. The candidate generation step probes a pre-trained language model to extract phrases from product titles. Then, an attribute-aware fine-tuning method optimizes a multitask objective and shapes the language model representation to be attribute-discriminative. Finally, we discover new attributes and values through the self-ensemble of our framework, which handles the open-world challenge. We run extensive experiments on a large distantly annotated development set and a gold standard human-annotated test set that we collected. Our model significantly outperforms strong baselines and can generalize to unseen attributes and product types.",

            "abstract": "Twitter, a microblogging platform, has developed into an increasingly invaluable information source, where millions of users post a great quantity of tweets with various topics per day. Heterogeneous information networks consisting of multi-type objects and relations are becoming more and more prevalent as an organization form of knowledge and information. The task of linking an entity mention in a tweet with its corresponding entity in a heterogeneous information network is of great importance, for the purpose of enriching heterogeneous information networks with the abundant and fresh knowledge embedded in tweets. However, the entity mention is ambiguous. Additionally, tweets are short and informal, making it difficult to mine enough information from a single tweet for entity linking. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised iterative clustering framework TELHIN to link multiple similar tweets with a heterogeneous information network jointly. Our framework takes three dimensions of tweet similarity into consideration: (1) content similarity, (2) temporal similarity, and (3) user similarity. The appropriate weights of different similarity dimensions for each entity mention are learned iteratively based on the metric learning algorithm by leveraging the pairwise constraints generated automatically. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in comparison with the baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great power in many network analytical tasks. However, graphs (i.e., networks) in the real world are usually text-rich, implying that valuable semantic information needs to be carefully considered. Existing GNNs for text-rich networks typically treat text as attribute words alone, which inevitably leads to the loss of important semantic structures, limiting the representation capability of GNNs. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end adaptive semantic architecture of graph convolutional networks, namely AS-GCN, which unifies neural topic model and graph convolutional networks, for text-rich network representation. Specifically, we utilize a neural topic model to extract the global topic semantics, and accordingly augment the original text-rich network into a tri-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the local word-sequence semantic structure and the global topic semantic structure from text. We then design an effective semantic-aware propagation of information by introducing a discriminative convolution mechanism. We further propose two strategies, that is, distribution sharing and joint training, to adaptively generate a proper network structure based on the learning objective to improve network representation. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks illustrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant improvement. Meanwhile, this architecture can also be applied to e-commerce search scenes, and experiments on a real e-commerce problem from JD further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture over the baselines.",

            "abstract": "Scientific literature analysis needs fine-grained named entity recognition (NER) to provide a wide range of information for scientific discovery. For example, chemistry research needs to study dozens to hundreds of distinct, fine-grained entity types, making consistent and accurate annotation difficult even for crowds of domain experts. On the other hand, domain-specific ontologies and knowledge bases (KBs) can be easily accessed, constructed, or integrated, which makes distant supervision realistic for fine-grained chemistry NER. In distant supervision, training labels are generated by matching mentions in a document with the concepts in the knowledge bases (KBs). However, this kind of KB-matching suffers from two major challenges: incomplete annotation and noisy annotation. We propose ChemNER, an ontology-guided, distantly-supervised method for fine-grained chemistry NER to tackle these challenges. It leverages the chemistry type ontology structure to generate distant labels with novel methods of flexible KB-matching and ontology-guided multi-type disambiguation. It significantly improves the distant label generation for the subsequent sequence labeling model training. We also provide an expert-labeled, chemistry NER dataset with 62 fine-grained chemistry types (e.g., chemical compounds and chemical reactions). Experimental results show that ChemNER is highly effective, outperforming substantially the state-of-the-art NER methods (with .25 absolute F1 score improvement).",
