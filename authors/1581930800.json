            "abstract": "Finding dense subnetworks, with density based on edges or more complex structures, such as subgraphs or $k$-cliques, is a fundamental algorithmic problem with many applications. While the problem has been studied extensively in static networks, much remains to be explored for temporal networks. In this work we introduce the novel problem of identifying the temporal motif densest subnetwork, i.e., the densest subnetwork with respect to temporal motifs, which are high-order patterns characterizing temporal networks. This problem significantly differs from analogous formulations for dense temporal (or static) subnetworks as these do not account for temporal motifs. Identifying temporal motifs is an extremely challenging task, and thus, efficient methods are required. To this end, we design two novel randomized approximation algorithms with rigorous probabilistic guarantees that provide high-quality solutions. We perform extensive experiments showing that our methods outperform baselines. Furthermore, our algorithms scale on networks with up to billions of temporal edges, while baselines cannot handle such large networks. We use our techniques to analyze a financial network and show that our formulation reveals important network structures, such as bursty temporal events and communities of users with similar interests.",

            "abstract": "In World Wide Web (WWW) systems, networks (or graphs) serve as a fundamental tool for representing, analyzing, and understanding linked data, providing significant insights into the underlying systems. Naturally, most real-world systems have inherent temporal information, e.g., interactions in social networks occur at specific moments in time and last for a certain period. Temporal networks, i.e., network data modeling temporal information, enable novel and fundamental discoveries about the underlying systems they model, otherwise not captured by static networks that ignore such temporal information. In this tutorial, we present state-of-the-art models and algorithmic techniques for mining temporal networks that can provide precious insights into a plethora of web-related applications. We present how temporal networks can be used to extract novel information, especially in web-related network data, and highlight the challenges that arise when modeling temporal information compared to traditional static network-based approaches. We first overview different temporal network models. We then show how such powerful models can be leveraged to extract novel insights through suitable mining primitives. In particular, we present recent advances addressing most foundational problems for temporal network mining---ranging from the computation of temporal centrality measures, temporal motif counting, and temporal communities to bursty events and anomaly detection.",

            "abstract": "In network analysis, the betweenness centrality of a node informally captures the fraction of shortest paths visiting that node. The computation of the betweenness centrality measure is a fundamental task in the analysis of modern networks, enabling the identification of the most central nodes in such networks. Additionally to being massive, modern networks also contain information about the time at which their events occur. Such networks are often called temporal networks. The temporal information makes the study of the betweenness centrality in temporal networks (i.e., temporal betweenness centrality) much more challenging than in static networks (i.e., networks without temporal information). Moreover, the exact computation of the temporal betweenness centrality is often impractical on even moderately-sized networks, given its extremely high computational cost. A natural approach to reduce such computational cost is to obtain high-quality estimates of the exact values of the temporal betweenness centrality. In this work we present , the first sampling-based approximation algorithm for estimating the temporal betweenness centrality values of the nodes in a temporal network, providing rigorous probabilistic guarantees on the quality of its output. is able to compute the estimates of the temporal betweenness centrality values under two different optimality criteria for the shortest paths of the temporal network. In addition, outputs high-quality estimates with sharp theoretical guarantees leveraging on the empirical Bernstein bound, an advanced concentration inequality. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that significantly reduces the computational resources required by the exact computation of the temporal betweenness centrality on several real world networks, while reporting high-quality estimates with rigorous guarantees.",

            "title": "odeN: Simultaneous Approximation of Multiple Motif Counts in Large Temporal Networks",
            "abstract": "Counting the number of occurrences of small connected subgraphs, called temporal motifs, has become a fundamental primitive for the analysis of temporal networks, whose edges are annotated with the time of the event they represent. One of the main complications in studying temporal motifs is the large number of motifs that can be built even with a limited number of vertices or edges. As a consequence, since in many applications motifs are employed for exploratory analyses, the user needs to iteratively select and analyze several motifs that represent different aspects of the network, resulting in an inefficient, time-consuming process. This problem is exacerbated in large networks, where the analysis of even a single motif is computationally demanding. As a solution, in this work we propose and study the problem of simultaneously counting the number of occurrences of multiple temporal motifs, all corresponding to the same (static) topology (e.g., a triangle). Given that for large temporal networks computing the exact counts is unfeasible, we propose odeN, a sampling-based algorithm that provides an accurate approximation of all the counts of the motifs. We provide analytical bounds on the number of samples required by odeN to compute rigorous, probabilistic, relative approximations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that odeN enables the approximation of the counts of motifs in temporal networks in a fraction of the time needed by state-of-the-art methods, and that it also reports more accurate approximations than such methods.",

            "abstract": "The identification and counting of small graph patterns, called network motifs, is a fundamental primitive in the analysis of networks, with application in various domains, from social networks to neuroscience. Several techniques have been designed to count the occurrences of motifs in static networks, with recent work focusing on the computational challenges provided by large networks. Modern networked datasets contain rich information, such as the time at which the events modeled by the networks edges happened, which can provide useful insights into the process modeled by the network. The analysis of motifs in temporal networks, called temporal motifs, is becoming an important component in the analysis of modern networked datasets. Several methods have been recently designed to count the number of instances of temporal motifs in temporal networks, which is even more challenging than its counterpart for static networks. Such methods are either exact, and not applicable to large networks, or approximate, but provide only weak guarantees on the estimates they produce and do not scale to very large networks. In this work we present an efficient and scalable algorithm to obtain rigorous approximations of the count of temporal motifs. Our algorithm is based on a simple but effective sampling approach, which renders our algorithm practical for very large datasets. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm provides estimates of temporal motif counts which are more accurate than the state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, with significantly lower running time than exact approaches, enabling the study of temporal motifs, of size larger than the ones considered in previous works, on billion edges networks.",
