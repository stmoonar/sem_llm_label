            "title": "Reading Broadly to Open Your Mind: Improving Open Relation Extraction With Search Documents Under Self-Supervisions",
            "abstract": "Open relation extraction is the task of extracting open-domain relation facts from natural language sentences. Existing works either utilize distant-supervised annotations to train a supervised classifier over pre-defined relations, or adopt unsupervised methods with additional dependency on external assumptions. However, these works can only obtain information signals from limited existing knowledge bases or datasets. In this work, we propose a self-supervised framework named Web-SelfORE, which exploits self-supervised signals by requiring a large pretrained language model to extensively read real-world relevant documents from the web, and obtain contextualized relational features by mixing contextualized representations of entities from different documents. We perform adaptive clustering on contextualized relational features and bootstrap the self-supervised signals by improving contextualized features in relation classification. We additionally compare the effectiveness of self-supervisions brought by different document sources, and introduce relevance and redundancy evaluation metrics to obtain higher-quality self-supervisions. Experimental results on four public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of Web-SelfORE on open-domain relation extraction task when comparing with competitive baselines.",

            "title": "Localize, Retrieve and Fuse: A Generalized Framework for Free-Form Question Answering over Tables",
            "abstract": "Question answering on tabular data (a.k.a TableQA), which aims at generating answers to questions grounded on a provided table, has gained significant attention recently. Prior work primarily produces concise factual responses through information extraction from individual or limited table cells, lacking the ability to reason across diverse table cells. Yet, the realm of free-form TableQA, which demands intricate strategies for selecting relevant table cells and the sophisticated integration and inference of discrete data fragments, remains mostly unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a generalized three-stage approach: Table-to- Graph conversion and cell localizing, external knowledge retrieval, and the fusion of table and text (called TAG-QA), to address the challenge of inferring long free-form answers in generative TableQA. In particular, TAG-QA (1) locates relevant table cells using a graph neural network to gather intersecting cells between relevant rows and columns, (2) leverages external knowledge from Wikipedia, and (3) generates answers by integrating both tabular data and natural linguistic information. Experiments showcase the superior capabilities of TAG-QA in generating sentences that are both faithful and coherent, particularly when compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, TAG-QA surpasses the robust pipeline-based baseline TAPAS by 17% and 14% in terms of BLEU-4 and PARENT F-score, respectively. Furthermore, TAG-QA outperforms the end-to-end model T5 by 16% and 12% on BLEU-4 and PARENT F-score, respectively.",

            "abstract": "For artificial intelligence, high-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) is a knowledge discovery method that can reveal the associations between events in the sequences. Recently, abundant methods have been proposed to discover high-utility sequence rules. However, the existing methods are all related to point-based sequences. Interval events that persist for some time are common. Traditional interval-event sequence knowledge discovery tasks mainly focus on pattern discovery, but patterns cannot reveal the correlation between interval events well. Moreover, the existing HUSRM algorithms cannot be directly applied to interval-event sequences since the relation in interval-event sequences is much more intricate than those in point-based sequences. In this work, we propose a utility-driven interval rule mining (UIRMiner) algorithm that can extract all utility-driven interval rules (UIRs) from the interval-event sequence database to solve the problem. In UIRMiner, we first introduce a numeric encoding relation representation, which can save much time on relation computation and storage on relation representation. Furthermore, to shrink the search space, we also propose a complement pruning strategy, which incorporates the utility upper bound with the relation. Finally, plentiful experiments implemented on both real-world and synthetic datasets verify that UIRMiner is an effective and efficient algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Social media is one of the main sources for news consumption, especially among the younger generation. With the increasing popularity of news consumption on various social media platforms, there has been a surge of misinformation which includes false information or unfounded claims. As various text- and social context-based fake news detectors are proposed to detect misinformation on social media, recent works start to focus on the vulnerabilities of fake news detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack framework against Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors to probe their robustness. Specifically, we leverage a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to simulate the adversarial behavior of fraudsters on social media. Research has shown that in real-world settings, fraudsters coordinate with each other to share different news in order to evade the detection of fake news detectors. Therefore, we modeled our MARL framework as a Markov Game with bot, cyborg, and crowd worker agents, which have their own distinctive cost, budget, and influence. We then use deep Q-learning to search for the optimal policy that maximizes the rewards. Extensive experimental results on two real-world fake news propagation datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively sabotage the GNN-based fake news detector performance. We hope this paper can provide insights for future research on fake news detection.",

            "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.",

Learningverse combines the key features of an immersive learning environment with avatars that mirror the real users, rich social interactions among avatars, custom tools that allow users to construct or create their own artefacts, and a low threshold for users to join the metaverse on an ordinary computer with a webcam and without having to wear a VR headset. A usability test was conducted to understand students' perceived teaching, social, and cognitive presences in a scenario called \u201cAssembling the Solar System,\u201d which had an immersive learning instructional design embedded in Learningverse. The study involved 36 postgraduate students in a course on the innovative design of interactive learning environments. The results showed that students perceived the three presences positively. Discussions were made, followed by design principles for the educational metaverse based on this study. Finally, future work was explored.",

Recently, the nested NER has attracted more attention since its practicality and difficulty. Existing works for nested NER ignore the recognition order and boundary position relation of nested entities. To address these issues, we propose a novel seq2seq model named GPRL, which formulates the nested NER task as an entity triplet sequence generation process. GPRL adopts the reinforcement learning method to generate entity triplets de-coupling the entity order in gold labels and expects to learn a reasonable recognition order of entities via trial and error. Based on statistics of boundary distance for nested entities, GPRL designs a Gaussian prior to represent the boundary distance distribution between nested entities and adjust the out-put probability distribution of nested boundary tokens. Experiments on three nested NER datasets demonstrate that GPRL outperforms previous nested NER models.",

DDIs refer to a change in the effect of one drug to the presence of another drug in the human body, which plays an essential role in drug discovery and clinical research. DDIs prediction through traditional clinical trials and experiments is an expensive and time-consuming process. To correctly apply the advanced AI and deep learning, the developer and user meet various challenges such as the availability and encoding of data resources, and the design of computational methods. This review summarizes chemical structure based, network based, natural language processing based and hybrid methods, providing an updated and accessible guide to the broad researchers and development community with different domain knowledge.

            "title": "A Counterfactual Fair Model for Longitudinal Electronic Health Records via Deconfounder",
            "abstract": "The fairness issue of clinical data modeling, especially on Electronic Health Records (EHRs), is of utmost importance due to EHR\u2019s complex latent structure and potential selection bias. However, traditional methods often encounter the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness, as they fail to capture the underlying factors beyond observed data. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model called Fair Longitudinal Medical Deconfounder (FLMD)1 that aims to achieve both fairness and accuracy in longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) modeling. FLMD employs a two-stage training process. In the first stage, FLMD captures unobserved confounders for each encounter, effectively representing underlying medical factors beyond observed EHR, such as patient genotypes and lifestyle habits. This unobserved confounder is crucial for addressing the accuracy/fairness dilemma. In the second stage, FLMD combines the learned latent representation with other relevant features to make predictions. By incorporating appropriate fairness criteria, such as counterfactual fairness, FLMD ensures that it maintains high prediction accuracy while simultaneously minimizing health disparities. We conducted comprehensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLMD. Apart from comparing baseline methods and FLMD variants in terms of fairness and accuracy, we assessed the performance of all models on disturbed/imbalanced and synthetic datasets to showcase the superiority of FLMD across different settings and provide valuable insights into its capabilities.

            "title": "TALENT: Targeted Mining of Non-overlapping Sequential Patterns",
            "abstract": "With the widespread application of efficient pattern mining algorithms, sequential patterns that allow gap constraints have become a valuable tool to discover knowledge from biological data such as DNA and protein sequences. Among all kinds of gap-constrained mining, non-overlapping sequence mining can mine interesting patterns and satisfy the anti-monotonic property (the Apriori property). However, existing algorithms do not search for targeted sequential patterns, resulting in unnecessary and redundant pattern generation. Targeted pattern mining can not only mine patterns that are more interesting to users but also reduce the unnecessary redundant sequence generated, which can greatly avoid irrelevant computation. In this paper, we define and formalize the problem of targeted non-overlapping sequential pattern mining and propose an algorithm named TALENT (TArgeted mining of sequentiaL pattErN with consTraints). Two search methods including breadth-first and depth-first searching are designed to troubleshoot the generation of patterns. Furthermore, several pruning strategies to reduce the reading of sequences and items in the data and terminate redundant pattern extensions are presented. Finally, we select a series of datasets with different characteristics and conduct extensive experiments to compare the TALENT algorithm with the existing algorithms for mining non-overlapping sequential patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed targeted mining algorithm, TALENT, has excellent mining efficiency and can deal efficiently with many different query settings.",
