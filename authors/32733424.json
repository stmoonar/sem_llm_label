            "title": "The Graph Database Interface: Scaling Online Transactional and Analytical Graph Workloads to Hundreds of Thousands of Cores",
            "abstract": "Graph databases (GDBs) are crucial in academic and industry applications. The key challenges in developing GDBs are achieving high performance, scalability, programmability, and portability. To tackle these challenges, we harness established practices from the HPC landscape to build a system that outperforms all past GDBs presented in the literature by orders of magnitude, for both OLTP and OLAP workloads. For this, we first identify and crystallize performance-critical building blocks in the GDB design, and abstract them into a portable and programmable API specification, called the Graph Database Interface (GDI), inspired by the best practices of MPI. We then use GDI to design a GDB for distributed-memory RDMA architectures. Our implementation harnesses one-sided RDMA communication and collective operations, and it offers architecture-independent theoretical performance guarantees. The resulting design achieves extreme scales of more than a hundred thousand cores. Our work will facilitate the development of next-generation extreme-scale graph databases.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "In 2015 the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling (ICM), University of Warsaw built a modern datacenter and installed three substantial HPC systems as part of a 168 M PLN (36 M Euro) OCEAN project. Some of the systems were ill-conceived, badly architected and for the five years of their life span have brought minimal ROI. This paper reports on a two-year intensive effort to reengineer two of these HPC systems into a hybrid, multi-cloud solution called A-CHOICeM (Akademicka CHmura Obliczeniowa ICM). The intention was to expand the user base of ICM typical HPC system from around 200 to 500 to about 100,000 potential general academic users from all institutes of higher learning in the Warsaw area. The main characteristics of this solution are integration of on-premises ICM Cloud with several public cloud providers, building solution tailored to particular groups of academic users, containerization, integration of special computational paradigms like AI and Quantum Computing. Full process of designing the solution, competitive dialogue with suppliers, and full final specifications for the solution are presented. Several roadblocks, pitfalls and difficulties encountered along the way, including the conservative attitude of\"the old school\"HPC admins, University bureaucracy, national funding policies and others are presented.",

            "abstract": "Collaboration between multiple computing centres, referred as federated computing is becoming important pillar of High Performance Computing (HPC) and will be one of its key components in the future. To test technical possibilities of future collaboration using 100Gb optic fiber link (Connection was 900 km in length with 9ms RTT time) we prepared two scenarios of operation. In the first one, Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling (ICM) in Warsaw and Centre of Informatics - Tricity Academic Supercomputer & networK (CI-TASK) in Gdansk prepared a long distance geographically distributed computing cluster. System consisted of 14 nodes (10 nodes at ICM facility and 4 at TASK facility) connected using InfiniBand. Our tests demonstrate that it is possible to perform computationally intensive data analysis on systems of this class without substantial drop in performance for a certain type of workloads. Additionally, we show that it is feasible to use High Performance Parallex [1], high level abstraction libraries for distributed computing, to develop software for such geographically distributed computing resources and maintain desired efficiency. In the second scenario, we prepared distributed simulation-postprocessing-visualization workflow using ADIOS2 [2] and two programming languages (C++ and python). In this test we prove capabilities of performing different parts of analysis in seperate sites.",

            "abstract": "The global effort to build ever more powerful supercomputers is faced with the challenge of ramping up High Performance Computing systems to ExaScale capabilities and, at the same time, keeping the electrical power consumption for a system of that scale at less than 20 MW level. One possible solution, bypassing this local energy limit, is to use distributed supercomputers to alleviate intense power requirements at any single location. The other critical challenge faced by the global computer industry and international scientific collaborations is the requirement of streaming colossal amounts of time-critical data. Examples abound: i) transfer of astrophysical data collected by the Square Kilometre Array to the international partners, ii) streaming of large facilities experimental data through the Pacific Research Platform collaboration of DoE, ESnet and other partners in the US and elsewhere, iii) the Superficilities vision expressed by DoE, iv) new architecture for CERN LHC data processing pipeline focussing on more powerful processing facilities connected by higher throughput connectivity. The InfiniCortex project led by A*STAR Computational Resource Centre demonstrates a worldwide InfiniBand fabric circumnavigating the globe and bringing together, as one concurrent globally distributer HPC system, several supercomputing facilities spanned across four continents (Asia, Australia, Europe and North America). Using global scale InfiniBand connections, with bandwidth utilisation approaching 98% link capacity, we have established a new architectural approach which might lead to the next generation supercomputing systems capable of solving the most complex problems through the aggregation and parallelisation of many globally distributed supercomputers into a single hive-mind of enormous scale.",

            "abstract": "Commencing in June 2014, A*STAR Computational Resource Centre (A*CRC) team in Singapore, together with dozens of partners world-wide, have been building the InfiniCortex. Four concepts are integrated together to realise InfiniCortex: i) High bandwidth (~ 10 to 100Gbps) intercontinental connectivity between four continents: Asia, North America, Australia and Europe; ii) InfiniBand extension technology supporting transcontinental distances using Obsidian's Longbow range extenders; iii) Connecting separate InfiniBand sub-nets with different net topologies to create a single computational resource: Galaxy of Supercomputers [10] iv) Running workflows and applications on such a distributed computational infrastructure. We have successfully demonstrated InfiniCortex prototypes at SC14 and SC15 conferences. The infrastructure comprised of computing resources residing at multiple locations in Singapore, Japan, Australia, USA, Canada, France and Poland. Various concurrent applications, including workflows, I/O heavy applications enabled with ADIOS system, Extempore real-time interactive applications, and in-situ realtime visualisations were demonstrated. In this paper we briefly report on basic ideas behind Infini-Cortex construct, our recent successes and some ideas about further growth and extension of this project.",

            "title": "Creating interconnect topologies by algorithmic edge removal: MOD and SMOD graphs",
            "abstract": "We introduce a method of constructing classes of graphs by algorithmic removal of entire groups of edges. Our approach to creating new classes of graphs is to focus entirely on the structure and properties of an adjacency matrix. At an initialisation step of the algorithm we start with a complete fully connected graph. In Part I we present MOD and arrested MOD graphs resulting from removal of square blocks of edges at each iteration and substitution of removed blocks with a diagonal matrix with one extra pivotal element along the main diagonal. The MOD graphs possess unique and useful properties. All important graph measures are easily expressed in analytical form and are presented in the paper. Several important properties of MOD graphs are compared very favourably with graphs representing common interconnect topologies: hypercube, 3D and 5D tori, TOFU and dragonfly. This lead us to consider MOD and arrested MOD graphs as interesting candidates for effective supercomputer interconnects. In Part II, at each iterative step we successively remove triangular shapes from the adjacency matrix. This iterative process leads to the final matrix which has two Sierpinski gaskets aligned along the main diagonal. It will be shown below that this new class of graphs is not a Sierpinski graph, since it is the adjacency matrix which has a structure of a Sierpinski gasket, and not a graph described by this matrix. We call this new class of graphs Sierpinski-Michalewicz-Or lowski-Deng SMOD graphs. The most remarkable property of the SMOD class of graphs, is that irrespective of the graph order, the diameter is constant and equals 2. The size of the graph, or the total number of edges, is about 10% of the size of a complete graph of the same order. We analyse important graph theoretic characteristics related to the topology such as diameter as a function of graph order, size, mean path length, ratio of the graph size to the size of a complete graph of the same order, and some spectral properties.",

            "abstract": "System event logs are often the primary source of information for diagnosing (and predicting) the causes of failures for cluster systems. Due to interactions among the system hardware and software components, the system event logs for large cluster systems are comprised of streams of interleaved events, and only a small fraction of the events over a small time span are relevant to the diagnosis of a given failure. Furthermore, the process of troubleshooting the causes of failures is largely manual and ad-hoc. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology for reconstructing event order and establishing correlations among events which indicate the root-causes of a given failure from very large syslogs. We developed a diagnostics tool, FDiag, to extract the log entries as structured message templates and uses statistical correlation analysis to establish probable cause and effect relationships for the fault being analyzed. We applied FDiag to analyze failures due to br eakdowns in interactions between the Lustre file system and its clients on the Ranger supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The results are positive. FDiag is able to identify the dates and the time periods that contain the significant events which eventually led to the occurrence of compute node soft lockups.",
