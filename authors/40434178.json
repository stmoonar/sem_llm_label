            "abstract": "Computing related entities for a given seed entity is an important task in exploratory search and comparative data analysis.Prior works, using the seed-based set expansion paradigm, have focused on the single aspect of identifying homogeneous sets with high pairwise relatedness. A few recent works discuss cluster-based approaches to tackle multi-faceted set expansion, however, they fail in harnessing the specificity of the clusters and generating an explanation for them. This paper poses the multi-faceted set expansion as an optimization problem, where the goal is to compute multiple groups of entities that convey different aspects in an explainable manner, with high similarity within each group and diversity across groups. To extend a seed entity, we collect a large pool of candidate entities and facets (e.g., categories)from Wikipedia and knowledge bases, and construct a candidate graph. We propose FASETS, an efficient algorithm for computing faceted groups of bounded size, based on random walks over the candidate graph. Our extensive evaluation shows the superiority of FASETS against prior baselines, with regard to ground-truth collected from crowdsourcing.",

We probe the LLMs using zero- and k-shot unconstrained probes, and compare with traditional methods for negation generation, i.e., pattern-based textual extractions and knowledge-graph-based inferences, as well as crowdsourced gold statements. We measure the correctness and salience of the generated lists about subjects from different domains. Our evaluation shows that guided probes do in fact improve the quality of generated negatives, compared to the zero-shot variant. Nevertheless, using both prompts, LLMs still struggle with the notion of factuality of negatives, frequently generating many ambiguous statements, or statements with negative keywords but a positive meaning.",

We describe the statistical inference methodology adopted to mine such data. We release subject-centric and group-centric datasets in JSON format, as well as a browsing interface. Finally, we forsee three areas where this dataset can be useful: in social sciences research, it provides a resource for demographic analyses; in web-scale collaborative encyclopedias, it serves as an edit recommender to fill knowledge gaps; and in web search, it offers lists of salient statements about queried subjects for higher user engagement.

            "abstract": "General-purpose knowledge bases (KBs) are a cornerstone of knowledge-centric AI. Many of them are constructed pragmatically from web sources and are thus far from complete. This poses challenges for the consumption as well as the curation of their content. While several surveys target the problem of completing incomplete KBs, the first problem is arguably to know whether and where the KB is incomplete in the first place, and to which degree. In this survey, we discuss how knowledge about completeness, recall, and negation in KBs can be expressed, extracted, and inferred. We cover (i) the logical foundations of knowledge representation and querying under partial closed-world semantics; (ii) the estimation of this information via statistical patterns; (iii) the extraction of information about recall from KBs and text; (iv) the identification of interesting negative statements; and (v) relaxed notions of relative recall. This survey is targeted at two types of audiences: (1) practitioners who are interested in tracking KB quality, focusing extraction efforts, and building quality-aware downstream applications; and (2) data management, knowledge base, and semantic web researchers who wish to understand the state-of-the-art of knowledge bases beyond the open-world assumption. Consequently, our survey presents both fundamental methodologies and the results that they have produced, and gives practice-oriented recommendations on how to choose between different approaches for a problem at hand.",

            "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge about everyday concepts is an important asset for AI applications, such as question answering and chatbots. Recently, we have seen an increasing interest in the construction of structured commonsense knowledge bases (CSKBs). An important part of human commonsense is about properties that do not apply to concepts, yet existing CSKBs only store positive statements. Moreover, since CSKBs operate under the open-world assumption, absent statements are considered to have unknown truth rather than being invalid. This paper presents the UNCOMMONSENSE framework for materializing informative negative commonsense statements. Given a target concept, comparable concepts are identified in the CSKB, for which a local closed-world assumption is postulated. This way, positive statements about comparable concepts that are absent for the target concept become seeds for negative statement candidates. The large set of candidates is then scrutinized, pruned and ranked by informativeness. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. A large dataset of informative negations is released as a resource for future research.",

            "abstract": "The Wikidata knowledge base (KB) is one of the most popular structured data repositories on the web, containing more than 1 billion statements for over 90 million entities. Like most major KBs, it is nonetheless incomplete and therefore operates under the open-world assumption (OWA) - statements not contained in Wikidata should be assumed to have an unknown truth. The OWA ignores however, that a significant part of interesting knowledge is negative, which cannot be readily expressed in this data model. In this paper, we review the challenges arising from the OWA, as well as some specific attempts Wikidata has made to overcome them. We review a statistical inference method for negative statements, called peer-based inference, and present Wikinegata, a platform that implements this inference over Wikidata. We discuss lessons learned from the development of this platform, as well as how the platform can be used both for learning about interesting negations, as well as about modelling challenges inside Wikidata.

Rooted in a long tradition in knowledge representation, all popular KBs only store positive information, but abstain from taking any stance towards statements not contained in them. In this paper, we make the case for explicitly stating interesting statements which are not true. Negative statements would be important to overcome current limitations of question answering, yet due to their potential abundance, any e\ufb00ort towards compiling them needs a tight coupling with ranking. We introduce two approaches towards automatically compiling negative statements. (i) In peer-based statistical inferences , we compare entities with highly related entities in order to derive potential negative statements, which we then rank using supervised and unsupervised features. (ii) In pattern-based query log extraction , we use a pattern-based approach for harvesting search engine query logs. Experimental results show that both approaches hold promising and complementary potential. Along with this paper, we publish the \ufb01rst datasets on interesting negative information, containing over 1.4M statements for 130K popular Wikidata entities.",
