            "title": "Multi-Task YOLO for Vehicle Colour Recognition and Automatic License Plate Recognition",
            "abstract": "Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems are crucial in extracting vehicle information. However, ALPR alone is insufficient for robust vehicle owner identification, especially in the event of misidentification or covered license plates (LPs). Acknowledging the significance of vehicle colour in enhancing identification accuracy, this paper proposes a more secure and comprehensive approach by integrating car colour recognition (VCR) with LP detection and optical character recognition (OCR) tasks. Unlike the conventional two-stage ALPR systems, our solution introduces a novel one-stage YOLO-based multi-task model. It incorporates additional object detection heads onto the YOLO backbone, allowing for parallel processing and efficient real-time detection for all three tasks. The proposed model achieves spectacular results with mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of 0.778, 0.963, and 0.881 for OCR, LP detection, and VCR, respectively. Promisingly, our model is comparable to single-head, single-task models, which are trained solely for each task. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms a single-head multi-task model, which naively shares all tasks using one single head. Specifically, our model is 3.07x faster than the conventional approach, which involves inference of single-task models for OCR, LP, and VCR sequentially. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution is robust in simultaneously addressing OCR, LP detection, and VCR within a unified, single-stage framework.",

            "abstract": "The inherent characteristics of Internet of things (IoT) such as low computation power of IoT nodes and transmission reliability of IoT links demand a new paradigm for efficient data processing and dissemination. This is especially true for disaster situations with high possibility of communication breakdowns. On one hand, the concept of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) has been introduced as a technology to push data storage and computing closer to the network edge. On the other hand, wireless mesh network offers a strong self-healing capability and network robustness against disaster damages. To enable smart disaster monitoring applications, we first implement a lightweight multi-task model that performs joint disaster classification and victim detection. These AI outputs are then wirelessly synchronized via a mesh network solution called NerveNet. All the experiments are conducted in a real urban environment, including static and mobile nodes. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, where text and images can be synchronized within two minutes across a multi-hop Wi-Fi network. Furthermore, the optimized AI model has ultra-low power consumption around 1.23 W with frames per second (FPS) of 2.01.",

            "abstract": "Multi-camera face detection and recognition is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technology that leverages multiple cameras placed at different locations to detect and recognize human faces in real-world conditions accurately. While face detection and recognition technologies have exhibited high accuracy rates in controlled conditions, recognizing individuals in open environments remains challenging due to factors such as changes in illumination, movement, and occlusions. In this paper, we propose a multi-camera face detection and recognition (MCFDR) pipeline, which consists of three main parts - face detection, face recognition, and tracking. A series of model training is done with the open-source dataset to build a robust pipeline, and finally, the pipeline adopted trained YOLOv5n for face detection model with mAP 0.495, precision value of 0.868, and recall value of 0.781. The system also adopted the SphereFace SFNet20 model with an accuracy of 82.05% and a higher inference rate than SFNet64 for face recognition. These models are then fed into DeepSORT for multi-camera tracking. Our dataset has been applied to the pipeline and shows ideal outcomes with objectives achieved.",

            "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their sensitive and bandwidth-hungry data. This paper presents a joint early client termination and local epoch adjustment for FL. We consider the challenges of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments including non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data as well as diverse computing and communication capabilities. The goal is to strike the best tradeoff among three conflicting objectives, namely global model accuracy, training latency and communication cost. We first leverage the balanced-MixUp technique to mitigate the influence of non-IID data on the FL convergence rate. A weighted sum optimization problem is then formulated and solved via our proposed FL double deep reinforcement learning (FedDdrl) framework, which outputs a dual action. The former indicates whether a participating FL client is dropped, whereas the latter specifies how long each remaining client needs to complete its local training task. Simulation results show that FedDdrl outperforms the existing FL scheme in terms of overall tradeoff. Specifically, FedDdrl achieves higher model accuracy by about 4% while incurring 30% less latency and communication costs.",

Next, the development of MTDRS is depicted and the taxonomy is introduced from the task relation and methodology aspects. Specifically, the task relation is categorized into parallel, cascaded, and auxiliary with main, while the methodology is grouped into parameter sharing, optimization, and training mechanism.

To overcome all these technical hurdles, this survey paper presents the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in learning and adapting to the complex NTN environments. We begin by providing an overview of NTNs in the context of 6G, highlighting the potential security and privacy issues. Next, we review the existing AI methods adopted for 6G NTN optimization, starting from machine learning (ML), through deep learning (DL) to deep reinforcement learning (DRL). All these AI techniques have paved the way towards more intelligent network planning, resource allocation (RA), and interference management. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in AI-powered NTN for 6G networks. Finally, we conclude by providing insights and recommendations on the key enabling technologies for future AI-powered 6G NTNs.",

The goal is to maximize the worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of UAV via a joint optimization of flight trajectory, UAV active beamforming and RIS passive beamforming. By interacting with the dynamically changing UAV environment, real-time decision making per time slot is possible via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To decouple the continuous optimization variables, we introduce a twin- twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TTD3) to maximize the expected cumulative reward, which is linked to SEE enhancement.

            "abstract": "Disaster classification and victim detection are two important tasks in enabling efficient rescue operations. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) model which accomplishes these two tasks simultaneously. The idea is to attach one pruned head model to another backbone network. We mathematically pinpoint the optimal branching location and the depth of the pruned head model. Apart from the decoupled task training capability, the MTL model offers lesser memory requirements (12.8 MB saving) and better disaster classification accuracy (1-2% gain), while preserving the same detection performance (0.694 of average precision (AP)), as compared to the traditional method. Such advantages of flexibility, speed and accuracy facilitate the large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where we explore the potential of federated learning (FL) and active learning (AL). Given the high ambiguity within disaster images, a modified version of AL-based technique is introduced. For realistic implementation, production-ready OpenFL and OpenVINO tools are adopted to update the global FL model and to optimize the trained model, respectively. Experiment results are promising: the FL-based techniques are comparable to or better than their centralized learning (CL) counterparts. Also, our application portability is demonstrated via different hardware such as CPU and Raspberry Pi.",

            "title": "Joint Disaster Classification and Victim Detection using Multi-Task Learning",
            "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning and computer vision have transformed surveillance into an important application for smart disaster monitoring systems. Based on the detected number of victims and activity of disasters, emergency response unit can dispatch manpower more efficiently, which could save more lives. However, most of existing disaster detection methods fall into the class of single-task learning, which can either detect victim or classify disaster. In contrast, this paper proposes a YOLO-based multi-task model which performs the aforementioned tasks simultaneously. This is accomplished by attaching a disaster classification head model to the backbone of a victim detection model. The head model is inherited from the MobileNetv2 architecture, and we precisely select the backbone feature map layer to which the head model is attached. For the victim detection, results reveal that the solution achieves up to 0.6938 and 20.31 in terms of average precision and frame per second, respectively. Whereas for the disaster classification, the algorithm is comparable with most deep learning models that are specifically trained for single task. This shows that our solution is flexible and robust enough to handle both victim detection and disaster classification.",
