            "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) represent different types of entities and relationships between them. Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Accumulated Local Effect (ALE) is a method for accurately estimating feature effects, overcoming fundamental failure modes of previously-existed methods, such as Partial Dependence Plots. However, ALE's approximation, i.e. the method for estimating ALE from the limited samples of the training set, faces two weaknesses. First, it does not scale well in cases where the input has high dimensionality, and, second, it is vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) sampling when the training set is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a novel ALE approximation, called Differential Accumulated Local Effects (DALE), which can be used in cases where the ML model is differentiable and an auto-differentiable framework is accessible. Our proposal has significant computational advantages, making feature effect estimation applicable to high-dimensional Machine Learning scenarios with near-zero computational overhead. Furthermore, DALE does not create artificial points for calculating the feature effect, resolving misleading estimations due to OOD sampling. Finally, we formally prove that, under some hypotheses, DALE is an unbiased estimator of ALE and we present a method for quantifying the standard error of the explanation. Experiments using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the value of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "The investigation of the role of small bio-molecules (called microRNAs) in biological functions is a very popular topic in bioinformatics, since microRNAs have been shown to present novel therapeutic methods for diseases like cancer or Hepatitis C. In order to predict the involvement of microRNAs in biological functions many statistical approaches have been used that involve p-value calculations, with the most popular one being Fisher\u2019s exact test. However, it has been shown that data distribution does not match with any of the theoretical distributions used by the aforementioned approaches. Thus, an empirical randomization approach is preferred. Nevertheless, such analyses are computationally intensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach for microRNA enrichment analysis using Machine Learning techniques, in order to predict p-values instead of calculating them using randomization experiments. This simplifies the work for bioinformatics data analysts, helping them to efficiently perform multiple enrichment analysis tasks.",

In this work, we focus on the problem of estimating the expected citation-based popularity (or short-term impact) of papers. State-of-the-art methods for this problem attempt to leverage the current citation data of each paper. However, these methods are prone to inaccuracies for recently published papers, which have a limited citation history. In this context, we previously introduced ArtSim, an approach that can be applied on top of any popularity estimation method to improve its accuracy. Its power originates from providing more accurate estimations for the most recently published papers by considering the popularity of similar, older ones. In this work, we present ArtSim+, an improved ArtSim adaptation that considers an additional type of paper similarity and incorporates a faster configuration procedure, resulting in improved effectiveness and configuration efficiency.",

Analysing and extracting knowledge from HINs typically relies on the concept of metapaths, which are paths in the network schema denoting relations of different semantics among entities. Moreover, real-world HINs are often extremely large, containing millions of nodes and edges. Therefore, exploring and analysing HINs not only requires interdisciplinary expertise, being able both to interpret and select appropriate metapaths in the network, but also to run the analysis in an efficient and scalable manner.

            "abstract": "Investigating whether two different classifications of a population are associated, is an interesting problem in many scientific fields. For this reason, various statistical tests to reveal this type of associations have been developed, with the most popular of them being Fisher\u2019s exact test. However it has lately been shown that in some cases this test fails to produce accurate results. An alternative approach, known as randomization tests, was introduced to alleviate this issue, however, such tests are computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce two novel indexing approaches that exploit frequently occurring patterns in classifications to avoid performing redundant computations during the analysis. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments using real datasets and application scenarios to show that our approaches always outperform the state-of-the-art, with one approach being faster by an order of magnitude.",
