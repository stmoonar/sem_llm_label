            "title": "Efficient Exploration of the Rashomon Set of Rule Set Models",
            "abstract": "Today, as increasingly complex predictive models are developed, simple rule sets remain a crucial tool to obtain interpretable predictions and drive high-stakes decision making. However, a single rule set provides a partial representation of a learning task. An emerging paradigm in interpretable machine learning aims at exploring the Rashomon set of all models exhibiting near-optimal performance. Existing work on Rashomon-set exploration focuses on exhaustive search of the Rashomon set for particular classes of models, which can be a computationally challenging task. On the other hand, exhaustive enumeration leads to redundancy that often is not necessary, and a representative sample or an estimate of the size of the Rashomon set is sufficient for many applications. In this work, we propose, for the first time, efficient methods to explore the Rashomon set of rule set models with or without exhaustive search. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a variety of scenarios.",

            "title": "Mining Signed Networks: Theory and Applications: Tutorial proposal for the Web Conference 2020",
            "abstract": "Signed networks transform the information encoded by conventional graphs by attaching either a positive or a negative sign to every edge. This subtle modification vastly enhances the modelling capabilities of graphs. For instance, in a social network, where edges might represent interactions between users, the sign may determine whether an exchange was friendly or hostile. However, the introduction of edge signs invalidates many established methods and results from the graph-mining toolbox, and thus, problem formulations and algorithmic techniques must be studied anew. In this tutorial we aim to provide an overview of the literature in mining signed networks. We will present the most important theoretical results since their inception to the present day, we will discuss some of the most common applications, and we will reflect on emerging applications and directions for future work.",

            "title": "Searching for polarization in signed graphs: a local spectral approach",
            "abstract": "Signed graphs have been used to model interactions in social networks, which can be either positive (friendly) or negative (antagonistic). The model has been used to study polarization and other related phenomena in social networks, which can be harmful to the process of democratic deliberation in our society. An interesting and challenging task in this application domain is to detect polarized communities in signed graphs. A number of different methods have been proposed for this task. However, existing approaches aim at finding globally optimal solutions. Instead, in this paper we are interested in finding polarized communities that are related to a small set of seed nodes provided as input. Seed nodes may consist of two sets, which constitute the two sides of a polarized structure. In this paper we formulate the problem of finding local polarized communities in signed graphs as a locally-biased eigen-problem. By viewing the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix as the solution of a constrained optimization problem, we are able to incorporate the local information as an additional constraint. In addition, we show that the locally-biased vector can be used to find communities with approximation guarantee with respect to a local analogue of the Cheeger constant on signed graphs. By exploiting the sparsity in the input graph, an indicator-vector for the polarized communities can be found in time linear to the graph size. Our experiments on real-world networks validate the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its usefulness in finding local structures in this semi-supervised manner.",

            "abstract": "How has media attention to science changed over the past decade? Does media attention bring scientific attention too? To answer these questions, we collected media attention statistics from Altmetric.com for over 40,000 papers published in PNAS journal in the last 13 years. Our analysis reveals that (i) Media attention to science has slowly, but steadily increased over time, (ii) Media attention doesn't necessarily translate into scientific attention (citations) and, (iii) It is non-trivial to predict the amount of media attention a paper gets from attributes such as authors, author affiliations, abstract, and title.",
