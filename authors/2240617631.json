            "title": "Graph Neural Stochastic Diffusion for Estimating Uncertainty in Node Classification",
            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced the state of the art in various domains. Despite their remarkable success, the uncertainty estimation of GNN predictions remains under-explored, which limits their practical applications especially in risk-sensitive areas. Current works suffer from either intractable posteriors or inflexible prior specifications, leading to sub-optimal empirical results. In this paper, we present graph neural stochastic diffusion (GNSD), a novel framework for estimating predictive uncertainty on graphs by establishing theoretical connections between GNNs and stochastic partial differential equation. GNSD represents a GNN-based parameterization of the proposed graph stochastic diffusion equation which includes a Q -Wiener process to model the stochastic evolution of node representations. GNSD introduces a drift network to guarantee accurate prediction and a stochastic forcing network to model the propagation of epistemic uncertainty among nodes. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple detection tasks, demonstrating that GNSD yields the superior performance over existing strong approaches.",

            "title": "SMLP4Rec: An Efficient All-MLP Architecture for Sequential Recommendations",
            "abstract": "Self-attention models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommender systems by capturing the sequential dependencies among user\u2013item interactions. However, they rely on adding positional embeddings to the item sequence to retain the sequential information, which may break the semantics of item embeddings due to the heterogeneity between these two types of embeddings. In addition, most existing works assume that such dependencies exist solely in the item embeddings, but neglect their existence among the item features. In our previous study, we proposed a novel sequential recommendation model, i.e., MLP4Rec, based on the recent advances of MLP-Mixer architectures, which is naturally sensitive to the order of items in a sequence because matrix elements related to different positions of a sequence will be given different weights in training. We developed a tri-directional fusion scheme to coherently capture sequential, cross-channel, and cross-feature correlations with linear computational complexity as well as much fewer model parameters than existing self-attention methods. However, the cascading mixer structure, the large number of normalization layers between different mixer layers, and the noise generated by these operations limit the efficiency of information extraction and the effectiveness of MLP4Rec. In this extended version, we propose a novel framework \u2013 SMLP4Rec for sequential recommendation to address the aforementioned issues. The new framework changes the flawed cascading structure to a parallel mode, and integrates normalization layers to minimize their impact on the model\u2019s efficiency while maximizing their effectiveness. As a result, the training speed and prediction accuracy of SMLP4Rec are vastly improved in comparison to MLP4Rec. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "\\AcIR is one of the most important fields to help users find relevant information. The interaction between IR systems and users can be naturally formulated as a decision-making problem. In the last decade, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a promising direction to utilize the high model capacity of deep learning to improve long-term gains. On the one hand, there have been emerging research works focusing on leveraging DRL for IR tasks while the fundamental information theory under DRL settings, the principle of RL methods for IR tasks, or the experimental evaluation protocols of DRL-based IR systems, has not been deeply investigated. On the other hand, the emerging ChatGPT also provides new insights and challenges for DRL-based IR. Therefore, we propose the fourth DRL4IR workshop1 at CIKM 2023, which provides a venue for both academia researchers and industry practitioners to present the recent advances of DRL-based IR system, to foster novel research, interesting findings, and new applications of DRL for IR. We will pay more attention to fundamental research topics and recent application advances such as ChatGPT, with an expectation of over 300 workshop participants.",

            "title": "Embedding in Recommender Systems: A Survey",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that coverts the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors and can enhance the recommendation performance. Applying embedding techniques captures complex entity relationships and has spurred substantial research. In this survey, we provide an overview of the recent literature on embedding techniques in recommender systems. This survey covers embedding methods like collaborative filtering, self-supervised learning, and graph-based techniques. Collaborative filtering generates embeddings capturing user-item preferences, excelling in sparse data. Self-supervised methods leverage contrastive or generative learning for various tasks. Graph-based techniques like node2vec exploit complex relationships in network-rich environments. Addressing the scalability challenges inherent to embedding methods, our survey delves into innovative directions within the field of recommendation systems. These directions aim to enhance performance and reduce computational complexity, paving the way for improved recommender systems. Among these innovative approaches, we will introduce Auto Machine Learning (AutoML), hash techniques, and quantization techniques in this survey. We discuss various architectures and techniques and highlight the challenges and future directions in these aspects. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving field and serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners working in the area of recommender systems.",

            "title": "Whole-Chain Recommendations",
            "abstract": "With the recent prevalence of Reinforcement Learning (RL), there have been tremendous interests in developing RL-based recommender systems. In practical recommendation sessions, users will sequentially access multiple scenarios, such as the entrance pages and the item detail pages, and each scenario has its specific characteristics. However, the majority of existing RL-based recommender systems focus on optimizing one strategy for all scenarios or separately optimizing each strategy, which could lead to sub-optimal overall performance. In this paper, we study the recommendation problem with multiple (consecutive) scenarios, i.e., whole-chain recommendations. We propose a multi-agent RL-based approach (DeepChain), which can capture the sequential correlation among different scenarios and jointly optimize multiple recommendation strategies. To be specific, all recommender agents (RAs) share the same memory of users' historical behaviors, and they work collaboratively to maximize the overall reward of a session. Note that optimizing multiple recommendation strategies jointly faces two challenges in the existing model-free RL model - (i) it requires huge amounts of user behavior data, and (ii) the distribution of reward (users' feedback) are extremely unbalanced. In this paper, we introduce model-based RL techniques to reduce the training data requirement and execute more accurate strategy updates. The experimental results based on a real e-commerce platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
