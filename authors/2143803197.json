            "abstract": "Underwater acoustic (UWA) channels present diverse sparsity, which is challenging for UWA communications and underwater networked applications. Conventional methods fail to adapt to the uncertain sparsity due to inflexible adjustment rules or improper assumptions. This paper investigates the estimation of channels with uncertain sparsity and model-driven deep learning (DL) based estimation networks are proposed. We construct the channel estimation as sparse signal recovery model and exploit the channel sparsity based on the approximate message passing (AMP) method. Then the learned AMP network with soft-thresholding shrinkage function (ST-LAMP) is designed as a generalized estimator and suitable to random sparse UWA channels. Moreover, to achieve the Bayesian optimal solution, Gaussian mixture (GM) prior is imposed for UWA channels and the GM-LAMP network is formulated with the derived shrinkage function based on the minimum mean squared error criterion. The proposed networks incorporate the learning ability of DL methods by exploiting marine data and the domain knowledge from the classical model to realize parameter configuration and adaptive optimization. Experimental results verify that the proposed networks outperform benchmarks over UWA channels with diverse sparsity in terms of adaptability and effectiveness. Especially, real tests present the feasibility of proposed networks for on- line deployments.",

Specifically, a multi-antenna satellite communicates with two multi-antenna terrestrial NOMA users via a UAV relay under the wiretapping of a multi-antenna eavesdropper, which is randomly distributed. In addition, a maximum ratio transmission scheme is adopted at the satellite to transmit the information, and both a maximum ratio combining and a power splitting schemes are taken into account to process the multiple copies of the received signals. Considering the satellite channel is subject to the Shadowed-Rician distribution and the terrestrial channels are with Nakagami- ${m}$ distributed, the analytical expressions of secrecy outage probability as well as the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity for both NOMA users with perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation are obtained by using the stochastic geometry method, and verified with Monte-Carlo simulations.",

            "abstract": "As air-to-ground links tend to exhibit a high probability of being line-of-sight (LoS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used to improve the performance of wireless communications. The design of the UAV flight path plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness of UAV communication systems. However, the air-to-ground links with a high probability of LoS introduce a heightened risk of eavesdropping, posing a significant security challenge. In this work, we investigate the problem of ensuring secure data acquisition for quadrotor UAV-based communication systems in the presence of multiple location-uncertain terrestrial eavesdroppers. The bandwidth allocation and the three-dimensional trajectory of the UAV are jointly designed to maximize the system\u2019s overall fair secrecy rate. This design also considers the UAV\u2019s energy consumption during flight and aims to ensure fairness among users. Solving this problem poses a challenge since it is a non-convex and involves multiple variables, making it difficult to address using conventional optimization methods. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the security of aerial Internet of Things systems.",

Therefore, intelligent, anti-interference, and low-power systems are required to achieve the desired transmission performance. This article proposes a system for optimizing high-frequency satellite-to-ground communications using computer vision (CV) technology, like millimeter-wave (mmWave) satellite communication systems. The system uniquely combines CV-based target localization with adaptive beamforming and power control to optimize communication links with ground targets, such as base stations, ships, and aircraft. This approach significantly outperforms traditional radio frequency-based methods in accuracy and efficiency, particularly in dynamic mmWave scenarios. Simulation results confirm the superiority of our system in terms of sum rate and energy efficiency, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize high-frequency satellite communications by providing reliable, high-quality service to terrestrial targets. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.",

            "abstract": "Due to the unique merits of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, they have already been harnessed for military, public, and civil applications. Time synchronization is a significant premise of formatting and applying UAV networks. However, the irregular high-speed mobile UAVs pose new challenges to time synchronization, especially when external time references are unavailable in some rigid scenarios. Therefore, in these harsh cases, self-time-synchronization (STS) without any external assistance should be concerned to overcome the relative velocity between UAVs caused by irregular high-speed motion. In this paper, a realistic timestamps model for the multi-UAV networks is established, and then a dynamic topology-based maximum likelihood estimator will be developed to carry out the STS. Furthermore, by introducing the information on frequency offset, a new estimator with the closed-form expression is proposed based on a two-way message exchange framework. After that, a tracking algorithm with the assistance of estimation results will be introduced to compensate for the time-varying change of the clock parameters for the dynamic topology UAV networks. To evaluate the performance of the estimator, both the estimation error and Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound are analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits its superiority in STS performance and computational complexity compared to the existing two-way message exchange algorithm using timestamps only.",

In this article, we investigate a downlink RIS-empowered NOMA system with short packet communications (SPCs) in the presence of hardware impairments at the transceiver nodes. To characterize the performance of the proposed network, the approximate and asymptotic closed-form expressions of average block error rate (BLER) at far and near users are derived and analyzed. Based on asymptotic average BLER in high signal-to-noise ratio regime, the diversity order, minimum blocklength, and optimal power allocation are examined. RIS exhibits an improvement in diversity order and minimum blocklength. The achieved results show that users with poorer channel conditions have less sensitivity to hardware impairments whether for near users or RIS-assisted far users. Furthermore, our results manifest the benefits of NOMA and RIS in SPC over the benchmark orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.",

In the considered system, the transmission performance from end-to-end is influenced by several factors. These include path loss, small-scale fading, position randomness of the satellites in RF links, propagation loss, turbulence-induced fading, and random location distribution of the underwater sensors in UWOC links. To enhance our understanding of system design, geometric probability theory is employed to investigate the end-to-end secrecy outage performance of the dual-hop RF-UWOC space-ocean uplink transmission while comprehensively considering the impacts of these factors.

            "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing demands for wireless communication, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed. However, the line-of-sight (LoS) links are susceptible to severe deterioration due to complex distribution environments. To confront this challenge, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is introduced to ameliorate the environment, as well as enhance communication performance. This article explores an RIS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system to investigate the optimization problem involving UAV trajectory design, precoding, and RIS phase shift. The objective is to maximize the minimum information receivers' rate. Considering that the problem is nonconvex, we break it down into three subproblems and proceed to tackle it using an alternating optimization algorithm and the successive convex approximation technique. In addition, the article takes into account the phase dispersion of the UAV no-fly zone and RIS, based on the actual situation. To address these nonideal factors, we introduce an indicator function flag and employ the Dinkelbach method to attain the optimal solution for the nonideal optimization problem. The numerical outcomes clearly illustrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the system's rate performance.",

            "abstract": "With the development of satellite communication technology, the application of satellites in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) system can effectively solve the limitations and deficiencies of ground communication networks. In this article, we investigate the security outage performance of a satellite\u2013vehicle communication system consisting of a satellite ($S$), a legitimate receiving vehicle ($C$), and an eavesdropping vehicle ($E$), where $C$ and $E$ are randomly located on two different roads within the coverage area of $S$ and randomly distributed on their respective roads. The downlink communication links between $S$ and these terrestrial vehicles are assumed to suffer the shadowed-Rician fading. Then, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is studied under the most straightforward case that $ C$ and $E$ are equipped with a single antenna. Next, we extend to the more common scenario where both $C$ and $E$ adopt multiple antennas by deriving the analytical expression for the SOP. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify our proposed analytical models.",
