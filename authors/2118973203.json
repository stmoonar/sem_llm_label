            "abstract": "Unexpected responses or repeated clarification questions from conversational agents detract from the users\u2019 experience with technology meant to streamline their daily tasks. To reduce these frictions, Query Rewriting ( QR ) techniques replace transcripts of faulty queries with alternatives that lead to responses that satisfy the users\u2019 needs. Despite their successes, existing QR approaches are limited in their ability to fix queries that require considering users\u2019 personal preferences. We improve QR by proposing P ersonalized A daptive I nteractions G raph E ncoder (PAIGE). PAIGE is the first QR architecture that jointly models user\u2019s affinities and query semantics end-to-end. The core idea is to represent previous user-agent interactions and world knowledge in a structured form \u2014 a heterogeneous graph \u2014 and apply message passing to propagate latent representations of users\u2019 affinities to refine utterance embeddings. Using these embeddings, PAIGE can potentially provide different rewrites given the same query for users with different preferences. Our model, trained without any human-annotated data, improves the rewrite retrieval precision of state-of-the-art baselines by 12.5\u201317.5% while having nearly ten times fewer parameters.",

            "abstract": "In conversational AI agents, Query Rewriting 001 (QR) plays a crucial role in reducing users fric- 002 tions and satisfying their daily demands. Users 003 frictions are caused by various reasons, such 004 as errors in the spoken dialogue system, users\u2019 005 accent or their abridged language. In this work, 006 we present a novel Constrained Generation 007 Framework (CGF) for query rewriting at both 008 global and personalized level. The proposed 009 framework is based on the encoder-decoder 010 framework and consists of a context-enhanced 011 encoding and constrained generation decoding 012 phrases. The model takes the query and its 013 previous dialogue context information as the 014 encoder input, then the decoder relies on the 015 pre-defined global or personalized constrained 016 decoding space to generate the rewrites. Ex- 017 tensive offline and online A/B experimental re- 018 sults show that the proposed CGF significantly 019 boosts the query rewriting performance. 020",

These errors originate from various sources such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules. In this work, we construct a user interaction graph from their queries using data mined from a Markov Chain Model [1], and introduce a self-supervised pre-training process for learning query embeddings by leveraging the recent developments in Graph Representation Learning (GRL). We then fine-tune these embeddings with weak supervised data for the query rewriting task, and observe improvement over the neural retrieval baseline system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "For voice assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri, correctly interpreting users\u2019 intentions is of utmost importance. However, users sometimes experience friction with these assistants, caused by errors from different system components or user errors such as slips of the tongue. Users tend to rephrase their queries until they get a satisfactory response. Rephrase detection is used to identify the rephrases and has long been treated as a task with pairwise input, which does not fully utilize the contextual information (e.g. users\u2019 implicit feedback). To this end, we propose a contextual rephrase detection model ContReph to automatically identify rephrases from multi-turn dialogues. We showcase how to leverage the dialogue context and user-agent interaction signals, including the user\u2019s implicit feedback and the time gap between different turns, which can help significantly outperform the pairwise rephrase detection models.",

            "abstract": "Conversational Recommendation mimics the kind of dialog that takes between a customer and a shopkeeper involving multiple interactions where the user can give feedback at every interaction as opposed to Single Shot Retrieval, which corresponds to a scheme where the system retrieves a set of items in response to a user query in a single interaction. Compromise refers to a particular user preference which the recommender system failed to satisfy. But in the context of conversational systems, where the user's preferences keep on evolving as she interacts with the system, what constitutes as a compromise for her also keeps on changing. Typically, in Single Shot retrieval, the notion of compromise is characterized by the assignment of a particular feature to a particular dominance group such as MIB (higher value is better) or LIB (lower value is better) and this assignment remains true for all the users who use the system. In this paper, we propose a way to realize the notion of compromise in a conversational setting. Our approach, Flexi-Comp, introduces the notion of dynamically assigning a feature to two dominance groups simultaneously which is then used to redefine the notion of compromise. We show experimentally that a utility function based on this notion of compromise outperforms the existing conversational recommenders in terms of recommendation efficiency.",

The emerging concept maps can be used for automatic grouping and conceptual categorization of documents. Further, phrase structure grammar is employed to extract relationships among these entities from documents and index the document collection with these relations",
