            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

In particular, when provenance is recorded in HPC environments, it must be efficient and scalable. In this paper, we propose a provenance registration method for scientific workflows, efficient enough to run in supercomputers (thus, it could run in other environments with more relaxed restrictions, such as distributed ones). It also must be scalable in order to deal with large workflows, that are more typically used in HPC. We also target transparency for the user, shielding them from having to specify how provenance must be recorded. We implement our design using the COMPSs programming model as a Workflow Management System (WfMS) and use RO-Crate as a well-established specification to record and publish provenance. Experiments are provided, demonstrating the run time efficiency and scalability of our solution.",

            "title": "Towards Specification of a Software Architecture for Cross-Sectoral Big Data Applications",
            "abstract": "The proliferation of Big Data applications puts pressure on improving and optimizing the handling of diverse datasets across different domains. Among several challenges, major difficulties arise in data-sensitive domains like banking, telecommunications, etc., where strict regulations make very difficult to upload and experiment with real data on external cloud resources. In addition, most Big Data research and development efforts aim to address the needs of IT experts, while Big Data analytics tools remain unavailable to non-expert users to a large extent. In this paper, we report on the work-in-progress carried out in the context of the H2020 project I-BiDaaS (Industrial-Driven Big Data as a Self-service Solution) which aims to address the above challenges. The project will design and develop a novel architecture stack that can be easily configured and adjusted to address cross-sectoral needs, helping to resolve data privacy barriers in sensitive domains, and at the same time being usable by non-experts. This paper discusses and motivates the need for Big Data as a self-service, reviews the relevant literature, and identifies gaps with respect to the challenges described above. We then present the I-BiDaaS paradigm for Big Data as a self-service, position it in the context of existing references, and report on initial work towards the conceptual specification of the I-BiDaaS software architecture.",

            "abstract": "Since the appearance of Docker in 2013, container technologies for computers have evolved and gained importance in cloud data centers. However, adoption of containers in High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers is still under discussion: on one hand, the ease in portability is very well accepted; on the other hand, the performance penalties and security issues introduced by the added software layers are often under scrutiny. Since very little evaluation of large production HPC codes running in containers is available, we provide in this paper a comparative study using a production simulation of a biological system. The simulation is performed using Alya, which is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code optimized for HPC environments and enabled to run multiphysics problems. In the paper, we analyze the productivity advantages of adopting containers for large HPC codes, and we quantify performance overhead induced by the use of three different container technologies (Docker, Singularity and Shifter) comparing it to native execution. Given the results of these tests, we selected Singularity as best technology, based on performance and portability.

            "abstract": "Spatial big data is considered an essential trend in future scientific and business applications. Indeed, research instruments, medical devices, and social networks generate hundreds of petabytes of spatial data per year. However, many authors have pointed out that the lack of specialized frameworks for multidimensional Big Data is limiting possible applications and precluding many scientific breakthroughs. Paramount in achieving High-Performance Data Analytics is to optimize and reduce the I/O operations required to analyze large data sets. To do so, we need to organize and index the data according to its multidimensional attributes. At the same time, to enable fast and interactive exploratory analysis, it is vital to generate approximate representations of large datasets efficiently. In this paper, we propose the Outlook Tree (or OTree), a novel Multidimensional Indexing with efficient data Sampling (MIS) algorithm. The OTree enables exploratory analysis of large multidimensional datasets with arbitrary precision, a vital missing feature in current distributed data management solutions. Our algorithm reduces the indexing overhead and achieves high performance even for write-intensive HPC applications. Indeed, we use the OTree to store the scientific results of a study on the efficiency of drug inhalers. Then we compare the OTree implementation on Apache Cassandra, named Qbeast, with PostgreSQL and plain storage. Lastly, we demonstrate that our proposal delivers better performance and scalability.",

            "abstract": "Many problems of industrial and scientific interest require the solving of tridiagonal linear systems. This paper presents several implementations for the parallel solving of large tridiagonal systems on multi-core architectures, using the OmpSs programming model. The strategy used for the parallelization is based on the combination of two different existing algorithms, PCR and Thomas. The Thomas algorithm, which cannot be parallelized, requires the fewest number of floating point operations. The PCR algorithm is the most popular parallel method, but it is more computationally expensive than Thomas. The method proposed in this paper starts applying the PCR algorithm to break down one large tridiagonal system into a set of smaller and independent ones. In a second step, these independent systems are concurrently solved using Thomas. The paper also contains an analytical study of which is the best point to switch from PCR to Thomas. Also, the paper addresses the main performance issues of combining PCR and Thomas proposing a set of alternative implementations, some of them even imply algorithmic changes. The performance evaluation shows that the best implementation achieves a peak speedup of 4 with respect to the Intel MKL counterpart routine and 2.5 with respect to a single-threaded Thomas.",

            "abstract": "The solving of tridiagonal systems is one of the most computationally expensive parts in many applications, so that multiple studies have explored the use of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate such computation. However, these studies have mainly focused on using parallel algorithms to compute such systems, which can efficiently exploit the shared memory and are able to saturate the GPUs capacity with a low number of systems, presenting a poor scalability when dealing with a relatively high number of systems. The gtsvStridedBatch routine in the cuSPARSE NVIDIA package is one of these examples, which is used as reference in this article. We propose a new implementation (cuThomasBatch) based on the Thomas algorithm. Unlike other algorithms, the Thomas algorithm is sequential, and so a coarse\u2010grained approach is implemented where one CUDA thread solves a complete tridiagonal system instead of one CUDA block as in gtsvStridedBatch. To achieve a good scalability using this approach, it is necessary to carry out a transformation in the way that the inputs are stored in memory to exploit coalescence (contiguous threads access to contiguous memory locations). Different variants regarding the transformation of the data are explored in detail. We also explore some variants for the case of variable batch, when the size of the systems of the batch has different size (cuThomasVBatch). The results given in this study prove that the implementations carried out in this work are able to beat the reference code, being up to 5\u00d7 (in double precision) and 6\u00d7 (in single precision) faster using the latest NVIDIA GPU architecture, the Pascal P100.",

            "abstract": "The simulation of the behavior of the Human Brain is one of the most important challenges in computing today. The main problem consists of finding efficient ways to manipulate and compute the huge volume of data that this kind of simulations need, using the current technology. In this sense, this work is focused on one of the main steps of such simulation, which consists of computing the Voltage on neurons\u2019 morphology. This is carried out using the Hines Algorithm and, although this algorithm is the optimum method in terms of number of operations, it is in need of non-trivial modifications to be efficiently parallelized on GPUs. We proposed several optimizations to accelerate this algorithm on GPU-based architectures, exploring the limitations of both, method and architecture, to be able to solve efficiently a high number of Hines systems (neurons). Each of the optimizations are deeply analyzed and described. Two different approaches are studied, one for mono-morphology simulations (batch of neurons with the same shape) and one for multi-morphology simulations (batch of neurons where every neuron has a different shape). In mono-morphology simulations we obtain a good performance using just a single kernel to compute all the neurons. However this turns out to be inefficient on multi-morphology simulations. Unlike the previous scenario, in multi-morphology simulations a much more complex implementation is necessary to obtain a good performance. In this case, we must execute more than one single GPU kernel. In every execution (kernel call) one specific part of the batch of the neurons is solved. These parts can be seen as multiple and independent tridiagonal systems. Although the present paper is focused on the simulation of the behavior of the Human Brain, some of these techniques, in particular those related to the solving of tridiagonal systems, can be also used for multiple oil and gas simulations. Our studies have proven that the optimizations proposed in the present work can achieve high performance on those computations with a high number of neurons, being our GPU implementations about 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 faster than the OpenMP multicore implementation (16 cores), using one and two NVIDIA K80 GPUs respectively. Also, it is important to highlight that these optimizations can continue scaling, even when dealing with a very high number of neurons.",

These individual problems do not provide enough parallelism and then, these must be computed as a batch. Today, vendors such as Intel and NVIDIA are developing their own suite of batch routines. Although most of the works focus on computing batches of fixed size, in real applications we can not assume a uniform size for all set of problems. We explore and analyze different strategies based on parallel for, task and taskloop OpenMP pragmas. Although these strategies are straightforward from a programmer's point of view, they have a different impact on performance. We also analyze a new prototype provided by Intel (MKL), which deals with batch operations (cblas dgemm batch). We propose a new approach called grouping. It basically groups a set of problems until filling a limit in terms of memory occupancy or number of operations. In this way, groups composed by different number of problems are distributed on cores, achieving a more balanced distribution in terms of computational cost. This strategy is able to be up to 6\u00d7 faster than the Intel (MKL) batch routine.",

We can find many different initiatives in the USA, Europe and Japan which attempt to achieve such a challenging target. In this work we focus on the most important European initiative (Human Brain Project) and on one of the tools (Arbor). This tool simulates the spikes triggered in a neuronal network by computing the voltage capacitance on the neurons' morphology, being one of the most precise simulators today. In the present work, we have evaluated the use of MPI+OpenMP tasking on top of the Arbor simulator. In this paper, we present the main characteristics of the Arbor tool and how these can be efficiently managed by using MPI+OpenMP tasking. We prove that this approach is able to achieve a good scaling even when computing a relatively low workload (number of neurons) per node using up to 32 nodes. Our target consists of achieving not only a highly scalable implementation based on MPI, but also to develop a tool with a high degree of abstraction without losing control and performance by using MPI+OpenMP tasking.",
