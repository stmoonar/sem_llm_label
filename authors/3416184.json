            "abstract": "Task assignment is a central component in crowdsourcing. Organizational studies have shown that worker motivation in completing tasks has a direct impact on the quality of individual contributions. In this work, we examine motivation-aware task assignment in the presence of a set of workers. We propose to model motivation as a balance between task relevance and task diversity and argue that an adaptive approach to task assignment can best capture the evolving nature of motivation. Worker motivation is observed and task assignment is revisited appropriately across iterations. We prove the problem to be NP-hard as well as MaxSNP-Hard and develop efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees. Our experiments with synthetic data examine the scalability of our algorithms, and our live real data experiments show that capturing motivation using relevance and diversity leads to high crowdwork quality.",

            "abstract": "We study task composition in crowdsourcing and the effect of personalization and diversity on performance. A central process in crowdsourcing is task assignment, the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, task assignment is facilitated by the ability to sort tasks by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount. Task composition improves task assignment by producing for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks, referred to as a Composite Task (CT). We propose different ways of producing CTs and formulate an optimization problem that finds for a worker, the most relevant and diverse CTs. We show empirically that workers\u2019 experience is greatly improved due to personalization that enforces an adequation of CTs with workers\u2019 skills and preferences. We also study and formalize various ways of diversifying tasks in each CT. Task diversity is grounded in organization studies that have shown its impact on worker motivation\u00a0 [33] . Our experiments show that diverse CTs contribute to improving outcome quality. More specifically, we show that while task throughput and worker retention are best with ranked lists, crowdwork quality reaches its best with CTs diversified by requesters, thereby confirming that workers look to expose their \u201cgood\u201d work to many requesters.",

            "abstract": "We investigate how to leverage the notion of motivation in assigning tasks to workers and improving the performance of a crowdsourcing system. In particular, we propose to model motivation as the balance between task diversity\u2013i.e., the difference in skills among the tasks to complete, and task payment\u2013i.e., the difference between how much a chosen task offers to pay and how much other available tasks pay. We propose to test different task assignment strategies: (1) relevance, a strategy that assigns matching tasks, i.e., those that fit a worker's profile, (2) diversity, a strategy that chooses matching and diverse tasks, and (3) div-pay, a strategy that selects matching tasks that offer the best compromise between diversity and payment. For each strategy , we study multiple iterations where tasks are reassigned to workers as their motivation evolves. At each iteration, relevance and diversity assign tasks to a worker from an available pool of filtered tasks. div-pay, on the other hand, estimates each worker's motivation on-the-fly at each iteration, and uses it to assign tasks to the worker. Our empirical experiments study the impact of each strategy on overall performance. We examine both requester-centric and worker-centric performance dimensions and find that different strategies prevail for different dimensions. In particular, relevance offers the best task throughput while div-pay achieves the best outcome quality.",

            "abstract": "In this thesis, we study scalable algorithms for monitoring activity traces. In several domains, monitoring is a key ability to extract value from data and improve a system. This thesis aims to design algorithms for monitoring two kinds of activity traces. First, we investigate temporal data monitoring. We introduce a new kind of interval join, that features scoring functions reflecting the degree of satisfaction of temporal predicates. We study these joins in the context of batch processing: we formalize Ranked Temporal Join (RTJ), that combine collections of intervals and return the k best results. We show how to exploit the nature of temporal predicates and the properties of their associated scored semantics to design TKIJ , an efficient query evaluation approach on a distributed Map-Reduce architecture. Our extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that TKIJ outperforms state-of-the-art competitors and provides very good performance for n-ary RTJ queries on temporal data. We also propose a preliminary study to extend our work on TKIJ to stream processing. Second, we investigate monitoring in crowdsourcing. We advocate the need to incorporate motivation in task assignment. We propose to study an adaptive approach, that captures workers\u2019 motivation during task completion and use it to revise task assignment accordingly across iterations. We study two variants of motivation-aware task assignment: Individual Task Assignment (Ita) and Holistic Task Assignment (Hta). First, we investigate Ita, where we assign tasks to workers individually, one worker at a time. We model Ita and show it is NP-Hard. We design three task assignment strategies that exploit various objectives. Our live experiments study the impact of each strategy on overall performance. We find that different strategies prevail for different performance dimensions. In particular, the strategy that assigns random and relevant tasks offers the best task throughput and the strategy that assigns tasks that best match a worker\u2019s compromise between task diversity and task payment has the best outcome quality. Our experiments confirm the need for adaptive motivation-aware task assignment. Then, we study Hta, where we assign tasks to all available workers, holistically. We model Hta and show it is both NP-Hard and MaxSNP-Hard. We develop efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees. We conduct offline experiments to verify the efficiency of our algorithms. We also conduct online experiments with real workers and compare our approach with various non-adaptive assignment strategies. We find that our approach offers the best compromise between performance dimensions thereby assessing the need for adaptability.",

            "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has gained popularity in a variety of domains as an increasing number of jobs are \"taskified\" and completed independently by a set of workers. A central process in crowdsourcing is the mechanism through which workers find tasks. On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, tasks can be sorted by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount. Research efforts on task assignment have focused on adopting a requester-centric approach whereby tasks are proposed to workers in order to maximize overall task throughput, result quality and cost. In this paper, we advocate the need to complement that with a worker-centric approach to task assignment, and examine the problem of producing, for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks that preserves overall task throughput. We formalize task composition for workers as an optimization problem that finds a representative set of k valid and relevant Composite Tasks (CTs). Validity enforces that a composite task complies with the task arrival rate and satisfies the worker's expected wage. Relevance imposes that tasks match the worker's qualifications. We show empirically that workers' experience is greatly improved due to task homogeneity in each CT and to the adequation of CTs with workers' skills. As a result task throughput is improved.",

            "abstract": "We study a particular kind of join, coined Ranked Temporal Join (RTJ), featuring predicates that compare time intervals and a scoring function associated with each predicate to quantify how well it is satisfied. RTJ queries are prevalent in a variety of applications such as network traffic monitoring, task scheduling, and tweet analysis. RTJ queries are often best interpreted as top-k queries where only the best matches are returned. We show how to exploit the nature of temporal predicates and the properties of their associated scoring semantics to design TKIJ, an efficient query evaluation approach on a distributed Map-Reduce architecture. TKIJ relies on an offline statistics computation that, given a time partitioning into granules, computes the distribution of intervals' endpoints in each granule, and an online computation that generates query-dependent score bounds. Those statistics are used for workload assignment to reducers. This aims at reducing data replication, to limit I/O cost. Additionally, high-scoring results are distributed evenly to enable each reducer to prune unnecessary results. Our extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that TKIJ outperforms state-of-the-art competitors and provides very good performance for n-ary RTJ queries on temporal data.",
