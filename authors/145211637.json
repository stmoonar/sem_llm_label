            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model and an e\ufb03cient estimation method for the problem of joint estimation of multiple graphical models, which have similar but di\ufb00erent sparsity structures and signal strength. Our proposed hierarchical Bayesian model is well suited for sharing of sparsity structures, and our procedure, called as GemBag, is shown to enjoy optimal theoretical properties in terms of (cid:96) 8 norm estimation accuracy and correct recovery of the graphical structure even when some of the signals are weak. Although optimization of the posterior distribution required for obtaining our proposed estimator is a non-convex optimization problem, we show that it turns out to be convex in a large constrained space facilitating the use of computationally e\ufb03cient algorithms. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to a bike sharing data set, we demonstrate that the proposed GemBag procedure has strong empirical performance in comparison with alternative methods.",

            "title": "Query-Specific Knowledge Summarization with Entity Evolutionary Networks",
            "abstract": "Given a query, unlike traditional IR that finds relevant documents or entities, in this work, we focus on retrieving both entities and their connections for insightful knowledge summarization. For example, given a query \"computer vision'' on a CS literature corpus, rather than returning a list of relevant entities like \"cnn'', \"imagenet'' and \"svm'', we are interested in the connections among them, and furthermore, the evolution patterns of such connections along particular ordinal dimensions such as time. Particularly, we hope to provide structural knowledge relevant to the query, such as \"svm'' is related to \"imagenet'' but not \"cnn''. Moreover, we aim to model the changing trends of the connections, such as \"cnn'' becomes highly related to \"imagenet'' after 2010, which enables the tracking of knowledge evolutions. In this work, to facilitate such a novel insightful search system, we propose SetEvolve, which is a unified framework based on nonparanomal graphical models for evolutionary network construction from large text corpora. Systematic experiments on synthetic data and insightful case studies on real-world corpora demonstrate the utility of SetEvolve.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian group regularization method based on the spike and slab Lasso priors for jointly estimating multiple graphical models. The proposed method can be used to estimate the common sparsity structure underlying the graphical models while capturing potential heterogeneity of the precision matrices corresponding to those models. Our theoretical results show that the proposed method enjoys the optimal rate of convergence in $\\ell_\\infty$ norm for estimation consistency and has a strong structure recovery guarantee even when the signal strengths over different graphs are heterogeneous. Through simulation studies and an application to the capital bike-sharing network data, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our method compared to existing alternatives.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT We consider a Bayesian framework for estimating a high-dimensional sparse precision matrix, in which adaptive shrinkage and sparsity are induced by a mixture of Laplace priors. Besides discussing our formulation from the Bayesian standpoint, we investigate the MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimator from a penalized likelihood perspective that gives rise to a new nonconvex penalty approximating the \u21130 penalty. Optimal error rates for estimation consistency in terms of various matrix norms along with selection consistency for sparse structure recovery are shown for the unique MAP estimator under mild conditions. For fast and efficient computation, an EM algorithm is proposed to compute the MAP estimator of the precision matrix and (approximate) posterior probabilities on the edges of the underlying sparse structure. Through extensive simulation studies and a real application to a call center data, we have demonstrated the fine performance of our method compared with existing alternatives. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",
