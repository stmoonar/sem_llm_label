            "title": "An Approach to Diversify Entity Search Results",
            "abstract": "Having named entities (person, country, company...) in response to users' queries is becoming more and more important in search engines. Indeed, in some cases users are not searching for a ranked list of documents, but for specific information (i.e. entities). In this work, we assume that users are interested in finding entities (e.g., name of a politician) and related entities (e.g., country of the politician 'x', name of the wife of the politician 'x'...) and the documents related to each entity. The user can then search entities by keywords or entities. Our goal is to return to the user diverse and relevant entities and documents. We then use the different types of an entity (Washington: city, person) and different categories of documents (Sport, Politics...) to diversify the results. In this paper, we develop a search semantics based on the types and categories of ranked results of entities. This new approach provides a variety of interpretations of relevant results. We conduct user studies to show the effectiveness of our approach and the quality of the results.",
