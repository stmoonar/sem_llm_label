            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and applications due to their excellent performance in graph representation learning. Most existing GNNs can only aggregate 1-hop neighbors in a GNN layer, so they usually stack multiple GNN layers to obtain more information from larger neighborhoods. However, many studies have shown that model performance experiences a significant degradation with the increase of GNN layers. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of distinguishability of class to indirectly evaluate the learned node representations, and verify the positive correlation between distinguishability of class and model performance. Then, we propose a Graph Neural Network guided by Distinguishability of class (Disc-GNN) to monitor the representation learning, so as to learn better node representations and improve model performance. Specifically, we first perform inter-layer filtering and initial compensation based on Local Distinguishability of Class (LDC) in each layer, so that the learned node representations have the ability to distinguish different classes. Furthermore, we add a regularization term based on Global Distinguishability of Class (GDC) to achieve global optimization of model performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have shown that the competitive performance of Disc-GNN to the state-of-the-art methods on node classification and node clustering tasks.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which obtain node embeddings by attribute propagates along graph topology, exhibit significant power in graph-structured data mining. However, graphs in the real world are usually text-rich, where the text can not only be represented as node attributes, but also contains valuable objective semantic structures. Moreover, the graph topology also exhibits complex subjective semantic structures, especially the heterophily where nodes from different classes are prone to build connections, making existing GNNs that work under the assumption of homophily incapable to realize generalization. To tackle aforementioned limitations, we design a new text-rich graph neural network from a unified perspective, namely SO-GNN. It can effectively enhance the expressive power of GNNs by modeling the implicit but informative subjective-objective semantics underlying the text-rich graphs. Specifically, we first introduce a new constrained Markov matrix with well-defined probabilistic diffusion dynamics to guide information propagation, where the neighbors are more appropriate and indicative in providing both local and global subjective semantics. We then construct a flexible heterogeneous text graph to gain a deeper insight into objective semantics, providing indispensable information for learning node embedding. Finally, we unite subjective and objective semantics in an end-to-end manner, so that the model can fully utilize the most relevant information for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments across various text-rich graphs with low-to-high homophily demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed SO-GNN over state-of-the-arts.",

            "abstract": "Social Internet of Things (SIoT), a promising and emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (i.e., things), paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation. Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward way such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node characteristics, which ignores the valuable semantic knowledge attached to nodes. Moreover, the underlying structure of SIoT is usually complex, including both the heterogeneous graph structure and pairwise trust relationships, which renders hard to preserve the properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. To address these aforementioned problems, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced graph neural network (KGTrust) for better trust evaluation in SIoT. Specifically, we first extract useful knowledge from users\u2019 comment behaviors and external structured triples related to object descriptions, in order to gain a deeper insight into the semantics of users and objects. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative convolutional layer that utilizes heterogeneous graph structure, node semantics, and augmented trust relationships to learn node embeddings from the perspective of a user as a trustor or a trustee, effectively capturing multi-aspect properties of SIoT trust during information propagation. Finally, a trust prediction layer is developed to estimate the trust relationships between pairwise nodes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of KGTrust over state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained great prevalence in tackling various analytical tasks on graph-structured data (i.e., networks). Typical GNNs and their variants adopt a message-passing principle that obtains network representations by the attribute propagates along network topology, which however ignores the rich textual semantics (e.g., local word-sequence) that exist in numerous real-world networks. Existing methods for text-rich networks integrate textual semantics by mainly using internal information such as topics or phrases/words, which often suffer from an inability to comprehensively mine the textual semantics, limiting the reciprocal guidance between network structure and textual semantics. To address these problems, we present a novel text-rich GNN with external knowledge (TeKo), in order to make full use of both structural and textual information within text-rich networks. Specifically, we first present a flexible heterogeneous semantic network that integrates high-quality entities as well as interactions among documents and entities. We then introduce two types of external knowledge, that is, structured triplets and unstructured entity descriptions, to gain a deeper insight into textual semantics. Furthermore, we devise a reciprocal convolutional mechanism for the constructed heterogeneous semantic network, enabling network structure and textual semantics to collaboratively enhance each other and learn high-level network representations. Extensive experiments illustrate that TeKo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of text-rich networks as well as a large-scale e-commerce searching dataset.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) has become a popular tool to analyze the graph data. Existing GNNs only focus on networks with first-order dependency, that is, conventional networks following the Markov property. However, many networks in real life own the higher-order dependency, such as click-stream data where the choice of the next page depends not only on the current page but also on previous pages. This kind of sequential data from complex systems (including natural dependencies) are often ignored by existing GNNs which makes them ineffective. To address this problem, we propose for the first time new GNN approaches for higher-order networks in this paper. First, we form sequence fragments by the current node and its predecessor nodes of different orders as candidate higher-order dependencies. When the fragment significantly affects the probability distribution of different successor nodes of the current node, we include it in the higher-order dependency set. We formulize the network with higher-order dependency as an augmented conventional first-order network, and then feed it into GNNs to derive network embeddings. Moreover, we further propose a new end-to-end GNN framework for dealing with higher-order networks directly in the model. Specifically, the higher-order dependency is used as the neighbor aggregation controller when the node is embedded and updated. In the graph convolutional layer, in addition to the first-order neighbor information, we also aggregate the middle node information from the higher-order dependency segment. We finally test the new approaches on three real networks with higher-order dependency, and compare with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show significant improvements of the new approaches which consider higher-order dependency.",

However, most of the existing community detection methods only focused on identify communities, while learning the semantics interpretation of communities has not been fully studied. In this paper, we focused on the problem of identifying communities and learning the semantics interpretation of modules jointly in an end-to-end model. We designed a novel generative model which combines two closely related parts, one for community discovery and the other for content clustering and semantics interpretation. By extracting the potential correlation between these two parts, our new method is not only robust to discovering communities, but also able to provide a community with more than one semantic topic. As for model inference, we developed a variational algorithm from a Bayesian point of view. Experimental results on the artificial benchmark and real networks showed the superior performance of the proposed approach over existing methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We also analyzed semantic interpretability of community detection results through a case study over a large-scale music platform dataset.",

            "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), aiming to obtain the representation of a node by aggregating its neighbors, have demonstrated great power in tackling various analytics tasks on graph (network) data. The remarkable performance of GCNs typically relies on the homophily assumption of networks, while such assumption cannot always be satis\ufb01ed, since the heterophily or randomness are also widespread in real-world. This gives rise to one fundamental question: whether networks with different structural properties should adopt different propagation mechanisms? In this paper, we \ufb01rst conduct an experimental investigation. Surprisingly, we discover that there are actually segmentation rules for the propagation mechanism, i.e., 1-hop, 2-hop and k -nearest neighbor ( k NN) neighbors are more suitable as neighborhoods of network with complete homophily, complete heterophily and randomness, respectively. However, the real-world networks are complex, and may present diverse structural properties, e.g., the network dominated by homophily may contain a small amount of randomness. So can we reasonably utilize these segmentation rules to design a universal propagation mechanism independent of the network structural assumption? To tackle this challenge, we develop a new universal GCN framework, namely U-GCN. It \ufb01rst introduces a multi-type convolution to extract information from 1-hop, 2-hop and k NN networks simultaneously, and then designs a discriminative aggregation to suf\ufb01ciently fuse them aiming to given learning objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of U-GCN over state-of-the-arts. The code and data are available at https://github.com/jindi-tju.",

            "abstract": "Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research.",

            "title": "AS-GCN: Adaptive Semantic Architecture of Graph Convolutional Networks for Text-Rich Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great power in many network analytical tasks. However, graphs (i.e., networks) in the real world are usually text-rich, implying that valuable semantic information needs to be carefully considered. Existing GNNs for text-rich networks typically treat text as attribute words alone, which inevitably leads to the loss of important semantic structures, limiting the representation capability of GNNs. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end adaptive semantic architecture of graph convolutional networks, namely AS-GCN, which unifies neural topic model and graph convolutional networks, for text-rich network representation. Specifically, we utilize a neural topic model to extract the global topic semantics, and accordingly augment the original text-rich network into a tri-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the local word-sequence semantic structure and the global topic semantic structure from text. We then design an effective semantic-aware propagation of information by introducing a discriminative convolution mechanism. We further propose two strategies, that is, distribution sharing and joint training, to adaptively generate a proper network structure based on the learning objective to improve network representation. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks illustrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant improvement. Meanwhile, this architecture can also be applied to e-commerce search scenes, and experiments on a real e-commerce problem from JD further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture over the baselines.",

            "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation can help users stay on top of the current affairs without being overwhelmed by the endless torrents of online news. However, the freshness or timeliness of news has been largely ignored by current news recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach dubbed HyperNews which explicitly models the effect of timeliness on news recommendation. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task of predicting the so-called \"active-time\" that users spend on each news article. Our key finding is that it is beneficial to address the problem of news recommendation together with the related problem of active-time prediction in a multi-task learning framework. Specifically, we train a double-task deep neural network (with a built-in timeliness module) to carry out news recommendation and active-time prediction simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such a \"kill-two-birds-with-one-stone\" solution has seldom been tried in the field of news recommendation before. Our extensive experiments on real-life news datasets have not only confirmed the mutual reinforcement of news recommendation and active-time prediction but also demonstrated significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art news recommendation techniques.",
