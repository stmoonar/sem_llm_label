            "abstract": "Deep learning has attracted much attention in hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification. However, most deep learning methods ignore the information loss during spatial\u2013spectral feature extraction, which potentially affects the classification performance. In this article, mask-reconstruction-based decoupled convolution network (MrDCN) is proposed, which includes the decoupled feature extraction module (DFEM) to extract spectral information and spatial information of the target HSI patch, respectively. The reconstruction modules are designed to maintain the feature extraction ability of DFEM and ensure that discriminative information in high-dimensional and low-dimensional features is preserved. MrDCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in classification on three datasets of various scenarios, which indicates its effectiveness, and experiments on embedded devices are executed to affirm the efficiency of MrDCN.",

            "abstract": "The illegal misuse of noncooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses huge threats to society and life safety. Infrared imaging is reliable to monitor UAVs and the anti-UAVs technology via infrared images has attracted more and more attention. In order to provide sufficient time for follow-up, UAVs are acquired at long distances, usually exhibiting the features of weak and small. Furthermore, infrared images are usually with low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). These factors make the correct detection of UAVs a challenge. Existing methods do not fully exploit the phenomenon that the UAVs are easily isolated, resulting in unsatisfactory detection results. For alleviating the issue, a novel detection method via isolation forest (iForest) is proposed. In the proposed method, the multidirection couple-order derivative properties are first analyzed, which enlarges the feature difference between UAVs and background. Then, a global iForest is constructed, which takes full advantage of the phenomenon that UAVs are susceptible to being isolated. As far as we know, this is the first time that iForest is constructed in an infrared small targets detection field. Furthermore, a local iForest is created, which further eliminates the residual false alarms of the result of global iForest. Experiments on nine sequences demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, which is capable of detecting various UAVs under diverse backgrounds.",

            "abstract": "Recently, many lightweight neural networks have been deployed on airborne or satellite remote sensing platforms for real-time object detection. To bridge the performance gap between lightweight models and complex models, many knowledge distillation (KD) methods are investigated. However, existing KD methods ignore to transfer effective directional knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge of different subtasks interferes with each other. To this end, a directional alignment instance knowledge distillation (DAIK) method for improving the performance of the lightweight object detection model is proposed. Specifically, an angle distillation (AD) module is developed to combine the circular smooth label (CSL) and teacher logits to transfer effective directional knowledge. Angular distance aspect ratio lookup table (AAL) is incorporated into label assignment and reweighting loss to enhance the prediction sensitivity of direction and shape in a discrete manner. Sample alignment distillation (SAD) reduces the spatial misalignment by mimicking the teacher model\u2019s distribution of anchor points. Extensive experiments are performed on several public remote sensing object detection datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DAIK.",

            "abstract": "The detection of camouflaged targets in the complex background is a hot topic of current research. The existing hyperspectral target detection algorithms do not take advantage of spatial information and rarely use temporal information. It is difficult to obtain the required targets, and the detection performance in hyperspectral sequences with complex background will be low. Therefore, a hyperspectral time-series target detection method based on spectral perception and spatial\u2013temporal tensor (SPSTT) decomposition is proposed. First, a sparse target perception strategy based on spectral matching is proposed. To initially acquire the sparse targets, the matching results are adjusted by using the correlation mean of the prior spectrum, the pixel to be measured, and the four-neighborhood pixel spectra. The separation of target and background is enhanced by making full use of local spatial structure information through local topology graph representation of the pixel to be measured. Second, in order to obtain a more accurate rank and make full use of temporal continuity and spatial correlation, a spatial\u2013temporal tensor (STT) model based on the gamma norm and $L_{2,1}$ norm is constructed. Furthermore, an excellent alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve this model. Finally, spectral matching is fused with STT decomposition in order to reduce false alarms and retain more right targets. A 176-band Beijing Institute of Technology hyperspectral image sequence - I (BIT-HSIS-I) dataset is collected for the hyperspectral target detection task. It is found by testing on the collected dataset that the proposed SPSTT has superior performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, objects corresponding to pixels of different classes exhibit varying size characteristics, which causes a challenge for effective pixelwise feature extraction and classification. In this article, we propose a novel multiscale model, called multiarea target attention (MATA). The proposed MATA uses an architecture that includes a shared feature extractor (FE) and classifier to capture multiscale spectral\u2013spatial information effectively and efficiently. The FE uses a multiscale target attention module (MSTAM) to extract spectral\u2013spatial information from target pixels and their similar pixels across multiscale areas, while $L_{2}$ -normalization is used to address discrepancies between features of different scales. The classifier adopts a classwise decision weighting strategy to account for the varying sizes of different classes and the different contributions of semantic features at each scale to each class. Experimental results on five public HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed MATA outperforms existing state-of-the-art single- and multiscale models, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency in HSI classification.

To better exploit HSIs, a large number of algorithms have been developed during the past few decades.

The sparse representation (SR) and low-rank representation (LRR)-based methods have proven to be powerful tools for HSI processing and are widely used in different HS fields. In this article, we present a survey of low-rank and sparse-based HSI processing methods in the fields of denoising, superresolution, dimension reduction, unmixing, classification, and anomaly detection.

Due to the gap of imaging mechanism and imbalanced information between multisource data, integrating the complementary merits for interpretation is still full of difficulties. In this article, a classification method based on asymmetric feature fusion, named asymmetric feature fusion network (AsyFFNet), is proposed. First, the weight-share residual blocks are utilized for feature extraction while keeping separate batch normalization (BN) layers. In the training phase, redundancy of the current channel is self-determined by the scaling factors in BN, which is replaced by another channel when the scaling factor is less than a threshold. To eliminate unnecessary channels and improve the generalization, a sparse constraint is imposed on partial scaling factors. Besides, a feature calibration module is designed to exploit the spatial dependence of multisource features, so that the discrimination capability is enhanced. Experimental results on the three datasets demonstrate that the proposed AsyFFNet significantly outperforms other competitive approaches.",

It is still a challenging problem, especially for complex scenarios and real-time constraints. In this letter, an efficient tracking by relocalization (TRL) framework is proposed for small flying object tracking, aiming to alleviate the issue of losing moving targets in a complex background. Our designed relocalization module consists of a feature-aggregated module and a global search module. On the one hand, a feature-aggregated module is integrated into the designed framework to increase the ability to locate small targets. On the other hand, a global search module is developed to update the tracking performance, which attempts to address missed targets in long-term small object tracking tasks. What needs to be declared is that the basic tracking module cooperates with the relocalization module we designed to achieve the tracking of small targets. Performance evaluation of two small-flying target data sets and comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing data for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and exploiting the complementary merits from multisource data. In this article, the depthwise feature interaction network (DFINet) is proposed for wetland classification. A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract self-correlation and cross correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this way, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification. DFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and classification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space under the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and feature discrimination are preserved. Comprehensive experimental results on two hyperspectral and multispectral wetland datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFINet outperforms other competitive methods in terms of overall accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Multisource image registration is challenging due to intensity, rotation, and scale differences among the images. Considering the characteristics and differences in multisource remote sensing images, a feature-based registration algorithm named multiscale histogram of local main orientation (MS-HLMO) is proposed. Harris corner detection is first adopted to generate feature points. The HLMO feature of each Harris feature point is extracted on a partial main orientation map (PMOM) with a generalized gradient location and orientation histogram-like (GGLOH) feature descriptor, which provides high intensity, rotation, and scale invariance. The feature points are matched through a multiscale matching strategy. Comprehensive experiments on 17 multisource remote sensing scenes demonstrate that the proposed MS-HLMO and its simplified version MS-HLMO+ outperform other competitive registration algorithms in terms of effectiveness and generalization.",
