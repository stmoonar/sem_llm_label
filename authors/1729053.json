            "title": "Streamlined Edge Computing for Fire Science and Management using WIFIRE Edge",
            "abstract": "In recent years, frequent and highly destructive megafires become one of the biggest climate-induced disasters. Fire behavior models using data from many emerging sources can inform decision support tools to respond to and mitigate such megafires. Emerging edge sensing and computing technologies within the fire environment can enhance the speed, reliability, and efficiency of wildland fire management, leading to better prevention, faster response times, and more effective mitigation of fire-related disasters. However, a unified system that streamlines the integration of edge technology advances within fire science and management workflows is needed. This paper presents the design and demonstrated case studies of the WIFIRE Edge Platform that facilitates the integration of sensing and AI capabilities at the edge. The initial attack and prescribed burn concept scenarios are described, highlighting the sensor deployment and utilization at the fire front.",

            "abstract": "The FAIR and CARE data principles are critical to ensuring widespread and equitable access to open data. They provide guidelines for what should be contained in metadata and how certain types of data should be handled. This study examines how large, collective data hubs such as the WIFIRE Data Commons can implement the FAIR and CARE data principles through evaluating the datasets hosted on the platform. An automation pipeline was developed to check for specified criteria in these principles, allowing fast integration of the principles on a large scale data hub. This pipeline can be expanded to check for all FAIR and CARE criteria, and similar pipelines can be created for a variety of other data hubs. Automating for the FAIR and CARE principles will help simplify organization of open data, allowing for a greater expansion of open science.",

Scientific reproducibility becomes particularly challenging when dealing with vast amounts of input files that change hands or move across different laboratories or organizations. Preserving the provenance of data files ensures critical information about the originality of data files is captured to support the reproducibility of scientific research. The paper focuses on capturing and verifying input and output data file provenance using the principles of blockchain. The technique stores the hashes of data files in a database along with user and workflow information. It allows the workflow to verify the data against the hashes at any point. The method is demonstrated using Parflow, a Hydrologic model, as a proof-of-concept.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "title": "Keynote Talk: Leveraging the Edge-Cloud Continuum to Manage the Impact of Wildfires on Air Quality",
            "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale cyberinfrastructure composed of heterogeneous computing capabilities and diverse sensors and other data sources are enabling new classes of dynamic data-driven \u201curgent\u201d applications. However, as the variety of data sources, and the volume and velocity of data grow, processing this data while considering the uncertainty of infrastructure and timeliness constraints of urgent application workflows can be nontrivial and presents a new set of challenges. In this paper, we use an application workflow that monitors and manage the air quality impacts of remote wildfires to illustrate how the R-Pulsar programming system, leveraging the SAGE and WIFIRE platforms, can enable urgent analytics across the computing continuum. R-Pulsar supports urgent data-processing pipelines that tradeoff the content of data, cost of computation, and urgency of the results to support such workflows. We also discuss research challenges associated with programming urgent application workflows and managing resources in an autonomic manner.",

            "abstract": "eScience is now an example field for conducting science using advanced computational methodologies, middle-ware and workflows. With the ever-increasing data intensity in various scientific disciplines and the opportunities provided by novel artificial intelligence (AI) and computing techniques, there is a pressing need for eScience to adapt and develop holistic approaches for AI-integrated science and interdisciplinary collaboration between science, AI and computing experts. This paper discusses the transformative shift needed in the conduct and tools of eScience from traditional workflows, often linear, pre-defined to coordinate task execution and individually developed, to integrated \u201cteamflows\u201d, a term coined to encapsulate methods for effective team collaboration and communication, dynamic data and service integration, and use-inspired thinking. In the AI in science era of scientific investigation, this \u201cfuture of eScience\u201d special track paper: 1) emphasizes the vital importance of eScience to the success of collaborative AI in science teams; 2) recites some requirements for open data and services for AI-enhanced workflows, team science and incentive structures to create a more inclusive and efficient discovery environment; and 3) discusses impact as a measure of success in eScience.",

            "title": "Visualization and Labeling of Terrestrial LiDAR Data for Three-Dimensional Fuel Classification",
            "abstract": "Wildland fire modeling tools can ingest high resolution 3D vegetation models as inputs. However, data used to build the surface fuels in these models is often at a 30-meter resolution, which does not necessarily provide sufficient detail for accurate modeling of fires. Terrestrial laser scans are increasingly being used to collect detailed vegetation data that could be integrated with new approaches to fuel and fire modeling, but manual segmentation of scans is not scalable beyond a small number of scans. There is a need to automatically segment these high resolution point clouds as they are collected in the field, such that they may be leveraged by fuel and fire models for wildland fire response and mitigation and other applied climate science. This paper summarizes our early work on a labeling, visualization and machine learning pipeline for detailed segmentation of fuels. Specific contributions are: (1) a labeling approach involving 3 dimensional segmentation of point clouds using a point cloud processing engine; (2) a visualization approach using a computer graphics engine; and (3) early results from a deep learning modeling approach for fuel segmentation by category (live and dead) and size class (1, 10, 100 and 1000 hour fuels).",
