            "title": "Preserve Integrity in Realtime Event Summarization",
            "abstract": "Online text streams such as Twitter are the major information source for users when they are looking for ongoing events. Realtime event summarization aims to generate and update coherent and concise summaries to describe the state of a given event. Due to the enormous volume of continuously coming texts, realtime event summarization has become the de facto tool to facilitate information acquisition. However, there exists a challenging yet unexplored issue in current text summarization techniques: how to preserve the integrity, i.e., the accuracy and consistency of summaries during the update process. The issue is critical since online text stream is dynamic and conflicting information could spread during the event period. For example, conflicting numbers of death and injuries might be reported after an earthquake. Such misleading information should not appear in the earthquake summary at any timestamp. In this article, we present a novel realtime event summarization framework called IAEA (i.e., Integrity-Aware Extractive-Abstractive realtime event summarization). Our key idea is to integrate an inconsistency detection module into a unified extractive\u2013abstractive framework. In each update, important new tweets are first extracted in an extractive module, and the extraction is refined by explicitly detecting inconsistency between new tweets and previous summaries. The extractive module is able to capture the sentence-level attention which is later used by an abstractive module to obtain the word-level attention. Finally, the word-level attention is leveraged to rephrase words. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets. To reduce efforts required for building sufficient training data, we also provide automatic labeling steps of which the effectiveness has been empirically verified. Through experiments, we demonstrate that IAEA can generate better summaries with consistent information than state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Online gaming is growing faster than ever before, with increasing challenges of providing better user experience. Recommender systems (RS) for online games face unique challenges since they must fulfill players\u2019 distinct desires, at different user levels, based on their action sequences of various action types. Although many sequential RS already exist, they are mainly single-sequence, single-task, and single-user-level. In this paper, we introduce a new sequential recommendation model for multiple sequences, multiple tasks, and multiple user levels (abbreviated as M3Rec) in Tencent Games platform, which can fully utilize complex data in online games. We leverage Graph Neural Network and multi-task learning to design M3Rec in order to model the complex information in the heterogeneous sequential recommendation scenario of Tencent Games. We verify the effectiveness of M3Rec on three online games of Tencent Games platform, in both offline and online evaluations. The results show that M3Rec successfully addresses the challenges of recommendation in online games, and it generates superior recommendations compared with state-of-the-art sequential recommendation approaches.",

            "abstract": "Biases and de-biasing in recommender systems (RS) have become a research hotspot recently. This paper reveals an unexplored type of bias, i.e., sentiment bias. Through an empirical study, we find that many RS models provide more accurate recommendations on user/item groups having more positive feedback (i.e., positive users/items) than on user/item groups having more negative feedback (i.e., negative users/items). We show that sentiment bias is different from existing biases such as popularity bias: positive users/items do not have more user feedback (i.e., either more ratings or longer reviews). The existence of sentiment bias leads to low-quality recommendations to critical users and unfair recommendations for niche items. We discuss the factors that cause sentiment bias. Then, to fix the sources of sentiment bias, we propose a general de-biasing framework with three strategies manifesting in different regularizers that can be easily plugged into RS models without changing model architectures. Experiments on various RS models and benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of our de-biasing framework. To our best knowledge, sentiment bias and its de-biasing have not been studied before. We hope that this work can help strengthen the study of biases and de-biasing in RS.",

            "abstract": "Automatic code summarization frees software developers from the heavy burden of manual commenting and benefits software development and maintenance. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which depicts the source code\u2019s syntactic structure, has been incorporated to guide the generation of code summaries. However, existing AST based methods suffer from the difficulty of training and generate inadequate code summaries. In this paper, we present the Block-wise Abstract Syntax Tree Splitting method (BASTS for short), which fully utilizes the rich tree-form syntax structure in ASTs, for improving code summarization. BASTS splits the code of a method based on the blocks in the dominator tree of the Control Flow Graph, and generates a split AST for each code split. Each split AST is then modeled by a Tree-LSTM using a pre-training strategy to capture local non-linear syntax encoding. The learned syntax encoding is combined with code encoding, and fed into Transformer to generate high-quality code summaries. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks have demonstrated that BASTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various evaluation metrics. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is available at https://github.com/XMUDM/BASTS.",

            "abstract": "Recommendation Systems (RS) have become an essential part of many online services. Due to its pivotal role in guiding customers towards purchasing, there is a natural motivation for unscrupulous parties to spoof RS for profits. In this paper, we study the shilling attack: a subsistent and profitable attack where an adversarial party injects a number of user profiles to promote or demote a target item. Conventional shilling attack models are based on simple heuristics that can be easily detected, or directly adopt adversarial attack methods without a special design for RS. Moreover, the study on the attack impact on deep learning based RS is missing in the literature, making the effects of shilling attack against real RS doubtful. We present a novel Augmented Shilling Attack framework (AUSH) and implement it with the idea of Generative Adversarial Network. AUSH is capable of tailoring attacks against RS according to budget and complex attack goals, such as targeting a specific user group. We experimentally show that the attack impact of AUSH is noticeable on a wide range of RS including both classic and modern deep learning based RS, while it is virtually undetectable by the state-of-the-art attack detection model.",

A variety of machine learning models are considered to be effective means of predicting DTI. Most current studies regard DTI prediction as a classification task (that is, negative or positive labels are applied to indicate the intensity of interaction) or regression tasks (numerical value is used to measure detailed DTI). In this article, we explore how to balance bias and variance through a multi-task learning framework. Because the classifier is more likely to produce higher bias, and the regression models are more prone to create a significant variance and overfit the training data. We propose a novel model, named Multi-DTI, that can predict the precise value and determine the correct labels of positive or negative interactions. Besides, these two tasks are performed with similar feature representations of CNN, which is adopted with a co-attention mechanism. Detailed experiments show that Multi-DTI is superior to state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Modeling sentiment evolution for social incidents in Microblogs is of vital importance for both enterprises and government officials. Existing works on sentiment tracking are not satisfying, due to the lack of entity-level sentiment extraction and accurate sentiment shift detection. Identifying entity-level sentiment is challenging as Microbloggers often use multiple opinion expressions in a sentence which targets different entities. Moreover, the evolution of the background sentiment, which is essential to shift detection, is ignored in the previous study. To address these issues, we leverage the proximity information to obtain more precise entity-level sentiment extraction. Based on it, we propose to simultaneously model the evolution of background opinion and the sentiment shift using a state space model on the time series of sentiment polarities. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods on the task of modeling sentiment evolution for social incidents.",

            "abstract": "The prediction of Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) is an important research direction in bioinformatics as it greatly shortens the development cycle of new drugs. State-of-the-art computational methods for DTI prediction adopt a binary classification framework. The supervision is incomplete, i.e. only a small amount of DTIs are known and treated as positive instances, while the rest are unknown and treated as negative. Two severe problems occur in such a framework: (1) the number of negative samples is overwhelming and (2) a negative label cannot rule out the possibility of a positive drug-target interaction. In this paper, we address the problem of learning from incomplete labels in DTI prediction. The key assumption here is that labels are missing not at random. For example, negative DTI labels are more likely to be missing because biomedical researchers prioritize to study DTIs that are more likely to be positive. We introduce a novel probabilistic model, factorization with non-random missing labels (FNML). It models the generative process for the DTI labels (i.e. the labels are positive or negative) and responses (i.e. the labels are observed or missing). In particular, the probability of observing or missing a label is associated with the sign of the label. In order to further reduce prediction variance and improve prediction accuracy on highly imbalanced DTI datasets, we present FNML-EN, an ensemble scheme which is designed specifically for FNML model. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the latest DTI database, demonstrating the superior and robust performance of the proposed models.",

            "abstract": "The study of consumer psychology reveals two categories of consumption decision procedures: compensatory rules and non-compensatory rules. Existing recommendation models which are based on latent factor models assume the consumers follow the compensatory rules, i.e. they evaluate an item over multiple aspects and compute a weighted or/and summated score which is used to derive the rating or ranking of the item. However, it has been shown in the literature of consumer behavior that, consumers adopt non-compensatory rules more often than compensatory rules. Our main contribution in this paper is to study the unexplored area of utilizing non-compensatory rules in recommendation models.Our general assumptions are (1) there are K universal hidden aspects. In each evaluation session, only one aspect is chosen as the prominent aspect according to user preference. (2) Evaluations over prominent and non-prominent aspects are non-compensatory. Evaluation is mainly based on item performance on the prominent aspect. For non-prominent aspects the user sets a minimal acceptable threshold. We give a conceptual model for these general assumptions. We show how this conceptual model can be realized in both pointwise rating prediction models and pair-wise ranking prediction models. Experiments on real-world data sets validate that adopting non-compensatory rules improves recommendation performance for both rating and ranking models.",

            "title": "Drug Target Interaction Prediction using Multi-task Learning and Co-attention",
            "abstract": "Various machine learning models have been proposed as cost-effective means to predict Drug-Target Interactions (DTI). Most existing researches treat DTI prediction either as a classification task (i.e. output negative or positive labels to indicate existence of interaction) or as a regression task (i.e. output numerical values as the strength of interaction). However, classifiers are more prone to higher bias and regression models tend to overfit the training data to generate large variance. In this paper, we explore to balance the bias and variance by a multi-task learning framework. We propose an architecture to both predict accurate values of strength of interaction and decide correct boundary between positive and negative interactions. Furthermore, the two tasks are performed on a shared feature representation, which is learnt using a co-attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",
