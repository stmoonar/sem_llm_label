            "title": "Parametric Constraints for Bayesian Knowledge Tracing from First Principles",
            "abstract": "Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a probabilistic model of a learner's state of mastery corresponding to a knowledge component. It considers the learner's state of mastery as a\"hidden\"or latent binary variable and updates this state based on the observed correctness of the learner's response using parameters that represent transition probabilities between states. BKT is often represented as a Hidden Markov Model and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to infer these parameters. However, this algorithm can suffer from several issues including producing multiple viable sets of parameters, settling into a local minima, producing degenerate parameter values, and a high computational cost during fitting. This paper takes a\"from first principles\"approach to deriving constraints that can be imposed on the BKT parameter space. Starting from the basic mathematical truths of probability and building up to the behaviors expected of the BKT parameters in real systems, this paper presents a mathematical derivation that results in succinct constraints that can be imposed on the BKT parameter space. Since these constraints are necessary conditions, they can be applied prior to fitting in order to reduce computational cost and the likelihood of issues that can emerge from the EM procedure. In order to see that promise through, the paper further introduces a novel algorithm for estimating BKT parameters subject to the newly defined constraints. While the issue of degenerate parameter values has been reported previously, this paper is the first, to our best knowledge, to derive the constrains from first principles while also presenting an algorithm that respects those constraints.",

            "abstract": "Contributing to the literature on aptitude-treatment interactions between worked examples and problem-solving, this paper addresses differential learning from the two approaches when students are positioned as domain experts learning new concepts. Our evaluation is situated in a team project that is part of an advanced software engineering course. In this course, students who possess foundational domain knowledge but are learning new concepts engage alternatively in programming followed by worked example-based reflection. They are either allowed to finish programming or are curtailed after a pre-specified time to participate in a longer worked example-based reflection. We find significant preto post-test learning gains in both conditions. Then, we not only find significantly more learning when students participated in longer worked example-based reflections but also a significant performance improvement on a problem-solving transfer task. These findings suggest that domain experts learning new concepts benefit more from worked example-based reflections than from problem-solving.",

            "abstract": "Computer science pedagogy has overwhelmingly favored problem-solving practice over methods of engagement like worked-out example study especially in advanced classes. This is due to the belief that while these alternative methods may improve student conceptual learning, they may leave them less able to perform on authentic problem-solving tasks from a lack of hands-on practice. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison of this trade-off in a synchronous collaborative programming project by adjusting the boundary between problem-solving and collaborative reflection based on a worked-out example while keeping the total time on task constant. We find that the more time students spent on worked example study, the more was the observed improvement in the pre- to post-test scores with no significant difference in performance on a subsequent problem-solving task. These results, therefore, challenge the dominant place of problem-solving practice in the advanced curricular context and inform the design of collaborative programming projects at scale.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have transitioned to online instruction. With learning promising to be online, at least in part, for the near future, instructors may be thinking of providing online collaborative learning opportunities to their students who are increasingly isolated from their peers because of social distancing guidelines. This paper aims to provide design recommendations for online collaborative project-based learning exercises based on this research in a software engineering course at the university level. Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.",

            "abstract": "This lightning talk presents an ongoing effort investigating the use of a collaborative programming paradigm originating in industry called Mob Programming, for effective collaborative learning in the classroom. In industry, Mob Programming involves the participation of a group of developers solving one problem at the same time and place. Developers take turns cycling through a structured process for collaboration having been assigned pre-defined roles responsible for brainstorming ideas, deciding on a path forward and implementing the consensus decision respectively. Pedagogically, there are several compelling reasons to motivate the adoption of Mob Programming in learning settings . First, the collaboration is well-structured meaning that the interaction between even a large group of students will not descend into chaos. Second, students are assigned to roles, which allows for the differentiation of responsibilities and development of skills in different aspects of solving the problem. Third, the rotation of assigned roles allows students to learn and exhibit multiple competencies as well as appreciate bringing different perspectives to bear on solving the problem. In order to investigate whether this promise is borne out in practice, the paradigm is currently being investigated in the context of a Cloud Computing course offered online to undergraduate and graduate students at a large American university and its satellite campuses. Since this effort is still underway, faculty who implement or are interested in implementing collaborative learning for this classrooms are invited to attend and provide feedback or consider joining the effort to investigate this paradigm for use in learning settings.",

Traditional research on group formation has investigated mostly separate learner characteristics as preconditions of learning. Combinations of different learner characteristics and of learner characteristics with collaborative processes have been less in focus. Considering such combinations is necessary to represent the complexity of group interactions and learning. Despite the digitalization of learning, there has been only few attempts to investigate the diagnostic information that mining learner texts and learning processes can contribute to addressing this complexity for optimal group formation, and to assign groups automatically based on multiple parameters simultaneously. This symposium brings together a multi-disciplinary and international consortium of researchers who all focus on group formation for computer supported collaborative learning. They complement each other in investigating different combinations of learner characteristics, learning processes and automatic techniques for optimal group formation.",

            "abstract": "This work presents a new paradigm for collaborative project-based computer science education called Online Mob Programming (OMP). OMP is adapted from the industrial practice of Mob Programming, where groups of developers work on the same problem, at the same time, in the same place. OMP was designed and implemented as a technique where a group of 4-6 students collaborate online through a structured process for solving programming tasks. In OMP, students rotate through clearly defined roles to collectively contribute towards a solution to a programming challenge. These roles require students to brainstorm potential solutions, decide on a path forward, and implement the correct course of action respectively. OMP was investigated in the context of a 6-week free online course on Cloud Computing. During the course, students participated in four intelligent conversational agent-coordinated OMP sessions. By instrumenting the online development environment, all student code revisions and chat logs were collected in addition to qualitative data from questionnaires. Analyses show evidence of success in terms of students following the structure of OMP and further investigations into differences in mob behavior based on the size, and problem outcome provide pedagogically valuable insights and a path toward building OMP into the computer science education curriculum.",

            "abstract": "Q-Ensembles are a model-free approach where input images are fed into different Q-networks and exploration is driven by the assumption that uncertainty is proportional to the variance of the output Q-values obtained. They have been shown to perform relatively well compared to other exploration strategies. Further, model-based approaches, such as encoder-decoder models have been used successfully for next frame prediction given previous frames. This paper proposes to integrate the model-free Q-ensembles and model-based approaches with the hope of compounding the benefits of both and achieving superior exploration as a result. Results show that a model-based trajectory memory approach when combined with Q-ensembles produces superior performance when compared to only using Q-ensembles.",

            "title": "Coordinating Collaborative Chat in Massive Open Online Courses",
            "abstract": "An earlier study of a collaborative chat intervention in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) identified negative effects on attrition stemming from a requirement for students to be matched with exactly one partner prior to beginning the activity. That study raised questions about how to orchestrate a collaborative chat intervention in a MOOC context in order to provide the benefit of synchronous social engagement without the coordination difficulties. In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning. The results suggest the most positive impact when experiencing a chat with exactly one partner rather than more or less. A qualitative analysis of the chat data reveals differential experiences between these configurations that suggests a potential explanation for the effect and raises questions for future research.",
