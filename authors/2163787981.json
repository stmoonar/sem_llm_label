            "abstract": "Recently, many researchers have applied Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to multi-label learning tasks by establishing relations among labels. However, these researchers have only used GCN as an auxiliary module and have lacked exploration of object relations, which has limited the inference capability of GCN. Applying GCN to multi-label classification in information systems poses significant challenges to address because information systems are considered as a graph with only nodes and no edges. This article proposes a multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (MG-GCN) based on object relations to enhance the versatility of GCN and demonstrate its reasoning ability. The MG-GCN efficiently solves complex multi-label classification problems in information systems. Firstly, based on the multi-granularity thinking, the attribute set is divided into several attribute subsets based on granularity. Secondly, a graph of differences representing the relationship between objects is established under each attribute subset. Finally, based on the attention mechanism and multiple difference matrices of objects, MG-GCN is proposed and applied to multi-label classification within information systems. The effectiveness and significance of performance of MG-GCN has been verified through ranking-based indicators and hypothesis tests, respectively.",

            "abstract": "When data privacy is imposed as a necessity, Federated learning (FL) emerges as a relevant artificial intelligence field for developing machine learning (ML) models in a distributed and decentralized environment. FL allows ML models to be trained on local devices without any need for centralized data transfer, thereby reducing both the exposure of sensitive data and the possibility of data interception by malicious third parties. This paradigm has gained momentum in the last few years, spurred by the plethora of real-world applications that have leveraged its ability to improve the efficiency of distributed learning and to accommodate numerous participants with their data sources. By virtue of FL, models can be learned from all such distributed data sources while preserving data privacy. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical tutorial on FL, including a short methodology and a systematic analysis of existing software frameworks. Furthermore, our tutorial provides exemplary cases of study from three complementary perspectives: i) Foundations of FL, describing the main components of FL, from key elements to FL categories; ii) Implementation guidelines and exemplary cases of study, by systematically examining the functionalities provided by existing software frameworks for FL deployment, devising a methodology to design a FL scenario, and providing exemplary cases of study with source code for different ML approaches; and iii) Trends, shortly reviewing a non-exhaustive list of research directions that are under active investigation in the current FL landscape. The ultimate purpose of this work is to establish itself as a referential work for researchers, developers, and data scientists willing to explore the capabilities of FL in practical applications.",

            "abstract": "Fidelity plays an important role in quantum information processing, which provides a basic scale for comparing two quantum states. At present, one of the most commonly used fidelities is Uhlmann-Jozsa (U-J) fidelity. However, U-J fidelity needs to calculate the square root of the matrix, which is not trivial in the case of large or infinite density matrices. Moreover, U-J fidelity is a measure of overlap, which has limitations in some cases and cannot reflect the similarity between quantum states well. Therefore, a novel quantum fidelity measure called quantum Tanimoto coefficient (QTC) fidelity is proposed in this paper. Unlike other existing fidelities, QTC fidelity not only considers the overlap between quantum states, but also takes into account the separation between quantum states for the first time, which leads to a better performance of measure. Specifically, we discuss the properties of the proposed QTC fidelity. QTC fidelity is compared with some existing fidelities through specific examples, which reflects the effectiveness and advantages of QTC fidelity. In addition, based on the QTC fidelity, three discrimination coefficients d1QTC, d2QTC, and d3QTC are defined to measure the difference between quantum states. It is proved that the discrimination coefficient d3QTC is a true metric. Finally, we apply the proposed QTC fidelity-based discrimination coefficients to measure the entanglement of quantum states to show their practicability.",

            "abstract": "Appropriate maintenance of industrial equipment keeps production systems in good health and ensures the stability of production processes. In specific production sectors, such as the electrical power industry, equipment failures are rare but may lead to high costs and substantial economic losses not only for the power plant but for consumers and the larger society. Therefore, the power production industry relies on a variety of approaches to maintenance tasks, ranging from traditional solutions and engineering know-how to smart, AI-based analytics to avoid potential downtimes. This review shows the evolution of maintenance approaches to support maintenance planning, equipment monitoring and supervision. We present older techniques traditionally used in maintenance tasks and those that rely on IT analytics to automate tasks and perform the inference process for failure detection. We analyze prognostics and health-management techniques in detail, including their requirements, advantages and limitations. The review focuses on the power-generation sector. However, some of the issues addressed are common to other industries. The article also presents concepts and solutions that utilize emerging technologies related to Industry 4.0, touching on prescriptive analysis, Big Data and the Internet of Things. The primary motivation and purpose of the article are to present the existing practices and classic methods used by engineers, as well as modern approaches drawing from Artificial Intelligence and the concept of Industry 4.0. The summary of existing practices and the state of the art in the area of predictive maintenance provides two benefits. On the one hand, it leads to improving processes by matching existing tools and methods. On the other hand, it shows researchers potential directions for further analysis and new developments.",

            "abstract": "The blockchain cross-chain is a significant technology for inter-chain interconnection and value transfer among different blockchain networks. Cross-chain overcomes the \u201cinformation island\u201d problem of the closed blockchain network and is increasingly applied to multiple critical areas such as finance and the internet of things (IoT). Blockchain can be divided into three main categories of blockchain networks: public blockchains, private blockchains, and consortium blockchains. However, there are differences in block structures, consensus mechanisms, and complex working mechanisms among heterogeneous blockchains. The fragility of the cross-chain system itself makes the cross-chain system face some potential security and privacy threats. This paper discusses security defects on the cross-chain implementation mechanism, and discusses the impact of the structural features of blockchain networks on cross-chain security. In terms of cross-chain intercommunication, a cross-chain attack can be divided into a multi-chain combination attack, native chain attack, and inter-chain attack diffusion. Then various security threats and attack paths faced by the cross-chain system are analyzed. At last, the corresponding security defense methods of cross-chain security threats and future research directions for cross-chain applications are put forward.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the diabetes population has grown younger. Therefore, it has become a key problem to make a timely and effective prediction of diabetes, especially given a single data source. Meanwhile, there are many data sources of diabetes patients collected around the world, and it is extremely important to integrate these heterogeneous data sources to accurately predict diabetes. For the different data sources used to predict diabetes, the predictors may be different. In other words, some special features exist only in certain data sources, which leads to the problem of missing values. Considering the uncertainty of the missing values within the fused dataset, multiple imputation and a method based on graph representation is used to impute the missing values within the fused dataset. The logistic regression model and stacking strategy are applied for diabetes training and prediction on the fused dataset. It is proved that the idea of combining heterogeneous datasets and imputing the missing values produced in the fusion process can effectively improve the performance of diabetes prediction. In addition, the proposed diabetes prediction method can be further extended to any scenarios where heterogeneous datasets with the same label types and different feature attributes exist.",

            "abstract": "Hierarchical quotient space structure (HQSS), as a typical description of granular computing (GrC), focuses on hierarchically granulating fuzzy data and mining hidden knowledge. The key step of constructing HQSS is to transform the fuzzy similarity relation into fuzzy equivalence relation. However, on one hand, the transformation process has high time complexity. On the other hand, it is difficult to mine knowledge directly from fuzzy similarity relation due to its information redundancy, i.e., sparsity of effective information. Therefore, this article mainly focuses on proposing an efficient granulation approach for constructing HQSS by quickly extracting the effective value of fuzzy similarity relation. First, the effective value and effective position of fuzzy similarity relation are defined according to whether they could be retained in fuzzy equivalence relation. Second, the number and composition of effective values are presented to confirm that which elements are effective values. Based on these above theories, redundant information and sparse effective information in fuzzy similarity relation could be completely distinguished. Next, both isomorphism and similarity between two fuzzy similarity relations are researched based on the effective value. The isomorphism between two fuzzy equivalence relations is discussed based on the effective value. Then, the algorithm with low time complexity for extracting effective values of fuzzy similarity relation is introduced. On the basis, the algorithm for constructing HQSS is presented to realize efficient granulation of fuzzy data. The proposed algorithms could accurately extract effective information from the fuzzy similarity relation and construct the same HQSS with the fuzzy equivalence relation while greatly reducing the time complexity. Finally, relevant experiments on 15 UCI datasets, 3 UKB datasets, and 5 image datasets are shown and analyzed to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

            "title": "Amer: A New Attribute-Missing Network Embedding Approach",
            "abstract": "Network embedding which aims to learn a low dimensional representation of nodes is a powerful technique for network analysis. While network embedding for networks with complete attributes has been widely investigated, in many real-world applications the attributes of partial nodes are unobserved (i.e., missing) due to privacy concern or resource limit. Very recently, several network embedding methods have been proposed for attribute-missing networks. They first complete the missing attributes and then use the complemented network to learn network embedding. The parameters of these two processes cannot be adjusted by each other, resulting in compromised results. To address this problem, we propose a unified model in which the process of completing missing attributes and the process of learning embedding are not separated but closely intertwined. Being specific, completing missing attributes is under the guidance of learning network representation via mutual information maximization, and the complemented attributes directly enter network representation module which will generate further feedback for completing missing attributes. We further impose attribute-structure relationship constraint for completing missing attributes by designing a new generative adversarial networks (GANs) model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified model for attribute-missing network embedding. Empirical results on real-world datasets show the superiority of our new method over other state-of-the-art methods on four network analysis tasks, including node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and network visualization.",

            "title": "Collective Entity Alignment for Knowledge Fusion of Power Grid Dispatching Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely accepted as powerful tools for modeling the complex relationships between concepts and developing knowledge-based services. In recent years, researchers in the field of power systems have explored KGs to develop intelligent dispatching systems for increasingly large power grids. With multiple power grid dispatching knowledge graphs (PDKGs) constructed by different agencies, the knowledge fusion of different PDKGs is useful for providing more accurate decision supports. To achieve this, entity alignment that aims at connecting different KGs by identifying equivalent entities is a critical step. Existing entity alignment methods cannot integrate useful structural, attribute, and relational information while calculating entities' similarities and are prone to making many-to-one alignments, thus can hardly achieve the best performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a collective entity alignment model that integrates three kinds of available information and makes collective counterpart assignments. This model proposes a novel knowledge graph attention network (KGAT) to learn the embeddings of entities and relations explicitly and calculates entities' similarities by adaptively incorporating the structural, attribute, and relational similarities. Then, we formulate the counterpart assignment task as an integer programming (IP) problem to obtain one-to-one alignments. We not only conduct experiments on a pair of PDKGs but also evaluate our model on three commonly used cross-lingual KGs. Experimental comparisons indicate that our model outperforms other methods and provides an effective tool for the knowledge fusion of PDKGs.",

            "title": "A Network Embedding-Enhanced NMF Method for Finding Communities in Attributed Networks",
            "abstract": "Community detection is an extremely important task for complex network analysis. There still remains a challenge of how to improve the performance of community detection in real-world scenario. Some researchers think that the content in networks is helpful to identify communities, and also focus on combining network topology with node contents, alongside the eradication of inauspicious performance. Furthermore, network topology is often sparse, which is reflected in the lack of capability to represent communities. To address the above problems, this study identifies a novel non-negative matrix factorization method which both employs network embedding to enhance the representation power of network topology for communities and also integrates network topology and node contents for further raising the quality of community detection. Furthermore, we then obtain the parameters of the model for finding communities which is based on model inference. Alongside both synthetic and real-world networks with ground-truths, we compare the new method with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the new method obtains significant improvement for community detection both by incorporating node contents and by enhancing network topology.",
