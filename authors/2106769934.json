            "abstract": "We introduce the ECG-Image-Database, a large and diverse collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) images generated from ECG time-series data, with real-world scanning, imaging, and physical artifacts. We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts. The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms. ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.",

            "title": "Human-AI Complex Task Planning",
            "abstract": "The process of complex task planning is ubiquitous and arises in a variety of compelling applications. A few leading examples include designing a personalized course plan or trip plan, designing music playlists/work sessions in web applications, or even planning routes of naval assets to collaboratively discover an unknown destination. For all of these aforementioned applications, creating a plan requires satisfying a basic construct, i.e., composing a sequence of sub-tasks (or items) that optimizes several criteria and satisfies constraints. For instance, in course planning, sub-tasks or items are core and elective courses, and degree requirements capture their complex dependencies as constraints. In trip planning, sub-tasks are points of interests (POIs) and constraints represent time and monetary budget, or user-specified requirements. Needless to say, task plans are to be individualized and designed considering uncertainty. When done manually, the process is human-intensive and tedious, and unlikely to scale. The goal of my research is to present computational frameworks that synthesize the capabilities of human and AI algorithms to enable task planning at scale while satisfying multiple objectives and complex constraints.I present a set of computational frameworks for automated task planning as a sequence generation problem that requires minimal inputs from the end users and produces personalized task plans in an uncertain environment while satisfying multiple objectives and complex constraints. At the core, I propose a set of multi-objective optimization problems with constraints, solving which will generate task plans as a sequence of sub-tasks that are highly dependent and optimize the underlying problems. From the algorithmic standpoint, I design novel algorithms by adapting Reinforcement Learning (RL) and discrete optimization-based techniques with theoretical guarantees. I also study data engineering and data management opportunities to design scalable algorithms. Finally, I provide large-scale synthetic and real-world experiments, as well as deployment challenges in the real-world environment.",

            "abstract": "This work formalizes the Route Planning Problem (RPP), wherein a set of distributed assets (e.g., ships, submarines, unmanned systems) simultaneously plan routes to optimize a team goal (e.g., find the location of an unknown threat or object in minimum time and/or fuel consumption) while ensuring that the planned routes satisfy certain constraints (e.g., avoiding collisions and obstacles). This problem becomes overwhelmingly complex for multiple distributed assets as the search space grows exponentially to design such plans. The RPP is formalized as a Team Discrete Markov Decision Process (TDMDP) and we propose a Multi-agent Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MaMoRL) framework for solving it. We investigate challenges in deploying the solution in real-world settings and study approximation opportunities. We experimentally demonstrate MaMoRL's effectiveness on multiple real-world and synthetic grids, as well as for transfer learning. MaMoRL is deployed for use by the Naval Research Laboratory - Marine Meteorology Division (NRL-MMD), Monterey, CA.",

            "title": "Guided Task Planning Under Complex Constraints",
            "abstract": "Creating a plan, i.e., composing a sequence of items to achieve a task is inherently complex if done manually. This requires not only finding a sequence of relevant items but also understanding user requirements and incorporating them as constraints. For instance, in course planning, items are core and elective courses, and degree requirements capture their complex dependencies as constraints. In trip planning, items are points of interest (POIs) and constraints represent time and monetary budget, two user-specified requirements. Most importantly, a plan must comply with the ideal interleaving of items to achieve a goal such as enhancing students' skills towards the broader learning goal of an education program, or in the travel scenario, improving the overall user experience. We study the Task Planning Problem (TPP) with the goal of generating a sequence of items that optimizes multiple objectives while satisfying complex constraints. TPP is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process, and we adapt weighted Reinforcement Learning to learn a policy that satisfies complex dependencies between items, user requirements, and satisfaction. We present a computational framework RL-Planner for TPP. RL-Planner requires minimal input from domain experts (academic advisors for courses, or travel agents for trips), yet produces personalized plans satisfying all constraints. We run extensive experiments on datasets from university programs and from travel agencies. We compare our solutions with plans drafted by human experts and with fully automated approaches. Our experiments corroborate that existing automated solutions are not suitable to solve TPP and that our plans are highly comparable to expensive handcrafted ones.",

            "title": "Multi-Session Diversity to Improve User Satisfaction in Web Applications",
            "abstract": "In various Web applications, users consume content in a series of sessions. That is prevalent in online music listening, where a session is a channel and channels are listened to in sequence, or in crowdsourcing, where a session is a set of tasks and task sets are completed in sequence. Content diversity can be defined in more than one way, e.g., based on artists or genres for music, or on requesters or rewards in crowdsourcing. A user may prefer to experience diversity within or across sessions. Naturally, intra-session diversity is set-based, whereas, inter-session diversity is sequence-based. This novel multi-session diversity gives rise to four bi-objective problems with the goal of minimizing or maximizing inter and intra diversities. Given the hardness of those problems, we propose to formulate a constrained optimization problem that optimizes inter diversity, subject to the constraint of intra diversity. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve our problem. Our experiments with human subjects on two real datasets, music and crowdsourcing, show our diversity formulations do serve different user needs, and yield high user satisfaction. Our large data experiments on real and synthetic data empirically demonstrate that our solution satisfy the theoretical bounds and is highly scalable, compared to baselines.",
