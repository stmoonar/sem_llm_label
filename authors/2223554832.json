            "abstract": "Temporal link prediction on dynamic graphs has attracted considerable attention. Most methods focus on the graph at each timestamp and extract features for prediction. As graphs are directly compressed into feature matrices, the important latent information at each timestamp has not been well revealed. Eventually, the acquisition of dynamic evolution-related patterns is rendered inadequately. In this paper, inspired by the process of Super-Resolution (SR), a novel deep generative model SRG (Super Resolution Graph) is proposed. We innovatively introduce the concepts of the Low-Resolution (LR) graph, which is a single adjacent matrix at a timestamp, and the High-Resolution (HR) graph, which includes the link status of surrounding snapshots. Specifically, two major aspects are considered regarding the construction of the HR graph. For edges, we endeavor to obtain an extensive information transmission description that affects the current link status. For nodes, similar to the SR process, the neighbor relationship among nodes is maintained. In this form, we could predict the link status from a new perspective: Under the supervision of the graph moving average strategy, the conditional normalizing flow effectively realizes the transformation between LR and HR graphs. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets from different applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.",
