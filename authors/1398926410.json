            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

            "abstract": "Recording the provenance of scientific computation results is key to the support of traceability, reproducibility and quality assessment of data products. Several data models have been explored to address this need, providing representations of workflow plans and their executions as well as means of packaging the resulting information for archiving and sharing. However, existing approaches tend to lack interoperable adoption across workflow management systems. In this work we present Workflow Run RO-Crate, an extension of RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) and Schema.org to capture the provenance of the execution of computational workflows at different levels of granularity and bundle together all their associated objects (inputs, outputs, code, etc.). The model is supported by a diverse, open community that runs regular meetings, discussing development, maintenance and adoption aspects. Workflow Run RO-Crate is already implemented by several workflow management systems, allowing interoperable comparisons between workflow runs from heterogeneous systems. We describe the model, its alignment to standards such as W3C PROV, and its implementation in six workflow systems. Finally, we illustrate the application of Workflow Run RO-Crate in two use cases of machine learning in the digital image analysis domain.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "title": "Declarative RDF Construction from In-Memory Data Structures with RML",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are often constructed from heterogeneous data sources using declarative mapping languages. Mapping languages define rules that apply ontology terms to raw data to describe how a knowledge graph should be constructed from these raw data. While most mapping languages and systems support knowledge graph construction from different data formats, e.g., CSV, XML or JSON, and different types of data sources, e.g., files, Web APIs or databases, there is still no support for mapping in-memory data structures to knowledge graphs, i.e. data which is temporarily stored in RAM. Currently, this data must first be stored in HDD, locally or in the cloud, for RDF construction systems to access them and construct a knowledge graph. However, writing these data to HDD and reading from HDD is a computationally expensive and redundant task. In this paper, we propose a method to construct RDF graphs from data produced by a software process and stored in RAM. We introduce an extension of RML\u2019s Logical Source to describe data structures produced by software, and exemplify our proposal with Python data structures. We extend a well-known RML system, Morph-KGC, to show the feasibility of our method and validate this extension with two use cases: OpenML, which translates machine learning executions into RDF, and SOMEF, which extracts software metadata from its documentation, converting them to triples. This proposal simplifies the construction of RDF graphs from in-memory data structures stored temporarily in RAM and enables the integration of data stored both in RAM and HDD.",

However, creating ROs (and collecting the respective metadata of their constituent resources) is still a time-consuming task. In this demo we present ya2ro, a tool designed to ease the creation of Research Objects following the RO-Crate specification. Given an input file with external resources available on the Web (datasets, software, publications and people), ya2ro will retrieve their metadata descriptions (if available), creating an aggregated RO-Crate available both in human-readable manner (HTML) and machine-readable manner (JSON-LD).",

Research Objects (ROs) are becoming a popular means to capture the context and research artefacts associated with a research investigation in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. However, it is unclear how well ROs themselves adhere to the FAIR (find-able, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles. In this work, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the FAIR assessment of more than 2500 ROs across multiple disciplines. Our work integrates FAIROs, our existing RO evaluation service, in the ROHub platform. We discuss the challenges of calculating the FAIR assessment of aggregations of resources, and how we supplement the FAIROs tests with information from the RO-Crate descriptor file generated by ROHub.",

Given an input folder with code, inspect4py uses abstract syntax trees and state of the art tools to find all functions, classes, tests, documentation, call graphs, module dependencies and control flows within all code files in that repository. Using these findings, inspect4py infers different ways of invoking a software component. We have evaluated our framework on 95 annotated repositories, obtaining promising results for software type classification (over 95% F1-score). With inspect4py, we aim to ease the understandability and adoption of software repositories by other researchers and developers.

            "abstract": "An increasing amount of researchers use software images to capture the requirements and code dependencies needed to carry out computational experiments. Software images preserve the computational environment required to execute a scientific experiment and have become a crucial asset for reproducibility. However, software images are usually not properly documented and described, making it challenging for scientists to find, reuse and understand them. In this paper, we propose a framework for automatically describing software images in a machine-readable manner by (i) creating a vocabulary to describe software images; (ii) developing an annotation framework designed to automatically document the underlying environment of software images and (iii) creating DockerPedia, a Knowledge Graph with over 150,000 annotated software images, automatically described using our framework. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach in finding images with specific software dependencies, comparing similar software images, addressing versioning problems when running computational experiments; and flagging problems with vulnerable software dependencies.",
