            "abstract": "Matrix low rank approximation is an effective method to reduce or eliminate the statistical redundancy of its components. Compared with the traditional global low rank methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD), local low rank approximation methods are more advantageous to uncover interpretable data structures when clear duality exists between the rows and columns of the matrix. Local low rank approximation is equivalent to low rank submatrix detection. Unfortunately,existing local low rank approximation methods can detect only submatrices of specific mean structure, which may miss a substantial amount of true and interesting patterns. In this work, we develop a novel matrix computational framework called RPSP (Random Probing based submatrix Propagation) that provides an effective solution for the general matrix local low rank representation problem. RPSP detects local low rank patterns that grow from small submatrices of low rank property, which are determined by a random projection approach. RPSP is supported by theories of random projection. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that RPSP outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, with the capacity to robustly and correctly identify the low rank matrices when the pattern has a similar mean as the background, background noise is heteroscedastic and multiple patterns present in the data. On real-world datasets, RPSP also demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying interpretable local low rank matrices.",

            "abstract": "Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) is a combinatorial problem arising from a wide range of applications including recommendation system, collaborative filtering, and dimensionality reduction. Currently, the noise model of existing BMF methods is often assumed to be homoscedastic; however, in real world data scenarios, the deviations of observed data from their true values are almost surely diverse due to stochastic noises, making each data point not equally suitable for fitting a model. In this case, it is not ideal to treat all data points as equally distributed. Motivated by such observations, we introduce a probabilistic BMF model that recognizes the object- and feature-wise bias distribution respectively, called bias aware BMF (BABF). To the best of our knowledge, BABF is the first approach for Boolean decomposition with consideration of the feature-wise and object-wise bias in binary data. We conducted experiments on datasets with different levels of background noise, bias level, and sizes of the signal patterns, to test the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios. We demonstrated that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art factorization methods in both accuracy and efficiency in recovering the original datasets, and the inferred bias level is highly significantly correlated with true existing bias in both simulated and real world datasets.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Spatial Robust Mixture Regression model to investigate the relationship between a response variable and a set of explanatory variables over the spatial domain, assuming that the relationships may exhibit complex spatially dynamic patterns that cannot be captured by constant regression coefficients. Our method integrates the robust finite mixture Gaussian regression model with spatial constraints, to simultaneously handle the spatial non-stationarity, local homogeneity, and outlier contaminations. Compared with existing spatial regression models, our proposed model assumes the existence a few distinct regression models that are estimated based on observations that exhibit similar response-predictor relationships. As such, the proposed model not only accounts for non-stationarity in the spatial trend, but also clusters observations into a few distinct and homogenous groups. This provides an advantage on interpretation with a few stationary sub-processes identified that capture the predominant relationships between response and predictor variables. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates robust procedures to handle contaminations from both regression outliers and spatial outliers. By doing so, we robustly segment the spatial domain into distinct local regions with similar regression coefficients, and sporadic locations that are purely outliers. Rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure has been designed to test the significance of such segmentation. Experimental results on many synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of our proposed method, compared with other robust finite mixture regression, spatial regression and spatial segmentation methods.",

            "abstract": "Can one build a knowledge graph (KG) for all products in the world? Knowledge graphs have firmly established themselves as valuable sources of information for search and question answering, and it is natural to wonder if a KG can contain information about products offered at online retail sites. There have been several successful examples of generic KGs, but organizing information about products poses many additional challenges, including sparsity and noise of structured data for products, complexity of the domain with millions of product types and thousands of attributes, heterogeneity across large number of categories, as well as large and constantly growing number of products. We describe AutoKnow, our automatic (self-driving) system that addresses these challenges. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. AutoKnow is (a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, (b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions (many domains, many products, and many attributes), and (c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs. AutoKnow has been operational in collecting product knowledge for over 11K product types.",

            "abstract": "If one customer buys a tennis racket, what are the best 3 complementary products to purchase together? 3 tennis ball packs, 3 headbands, 3 overgrips, or 1 of each respectively? Complementary product recommendation (CPR), aiming at providing product suggestions that are often bought together to serve a joint demand, forms a pivotal component of e-commerce service, however, existing methods are far from optimal. Given one product, how to recommend its complementary products of different types is the key problem we tackle in this work. We first conduct an extensive analysis to correct the inaccurate assumptions adopted by existing work to show that co-purchased products are not always complementary and further propose a new strategy to generate clean distant supervision labels for CPR modeling. Moreover, to bridge in the gap from existing work that CPR does not only need relevance modeling but also requires diversity to fulfill the whole purchase demand, we develop a deep learning framework, P-Companion to explicitly model both relevance and diversity. More specifically, given one product with its product type, P-Companion first uses an encoder-decoder network to predict multiple complementary product types, then a transfer metric learning network is developed to project the embedding of query product to each predicted complementary product type subspace and further learn the complementary relationship based on the distant supervision labels within each subspace. The whole framework can be trained from end-to-end and robust to cold-start products attributed to a novel pretrained product embedding module named Product2Vec, based on graph attention networks. Extensive offline experiments show that P-Companion outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 7.1% increase on the Hit@10 score with well-controlled diversity. Production-wise, we deploy P-Companion to provide online recommendations for over 200M products at Amazon and observe significant gains on product sales and profit.",

Boolean Tensor Decomposition (BTD) factorizes a binary tensor into the Boolean sum of multiple rank-1 tensors, which is an NP-hard problem. Existing BTD methods have been limited by their high computational cost, in applications to large scale or higher order tensors. In this work, we presented a computationally efficient BTD algorithm, namely \\textit{Geometric Expansion for all-order Tensor Factorization} (GETF), that sequentially identifies the rank-1 basis components for a tensor from a geometric perspective. We conducted rigorous theoretical analysis on the validity as well as algorithemic efficiency of GETF in decomposing all-order tensor. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that GETF has significantly improved performance in reconstruction accuracy, extraction of latent structures and it is an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we integrate structural information (from which tuple, which sentence) and semantic information (semantic similarity) to do the canonicalization. We represent the two types of information as a multi-layered graph: the structural information forms the links across the sentence, relational phrase, and noun phrase layers; the semantic information forms weighted intra-layer links for each layer. We propose a graph neural network model to aggregate the representations of noun phrases and relational phrases through the multi-layered meta-graph structure. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing approaches on a public datasets in general domain.",

            "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a crucial role in studying a vast number of problems in science and engineering. Numerically solving nonlinear and/or high-dimensional PDEs is often a challenging task. Inspired by the traditional finite difference and finite elements methods and emerging advancements in machine learning, we propose a sequence deep learning framework called Neural-PDE, which allows to automatically learn governing rules of any time-dependent PDE system from existing data by using a bidirectional LSTM encoder, and predict the next n time steps data. One critical feature of our proposed framework is that the Neural-PDE is able to simultaneously learn and simulate the multiscale variables.We test the Neural-PDE by a range of examples from one-dimensional PDEs to a high-dimensional and nonlinear complex fluids model. The results show that the Neural-PDE is capable of learning the initial conditions, boundary conditions and differential operators without the knowledge of the specific form of a PDE this http URL our experiments the Neural-PDE can efficiently extract the dynamics within 20 epochs training, and produces accurate predictions. Furthermore, unlike the traditional machine learning approaches in learning PDE such as CNN and MLP which require vast parameters for model precision, Neural-PDE shares parameters across all time steps, thus considerably reduces the computational complexity and leads to a fast learning algorithm.",
