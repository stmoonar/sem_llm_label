            "abstract": "EEG emotion recognition plays a significant role in various mental health services. Deep learning-based methods perform excellently, but still suffer from interpretability. Although methods such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM) can cope with the above problem, their coarse granularity cannot accurately reveal the mechanism to promote emotional intelligence. In this paper, fine-grained interpretability is proposed, called Concat-aided Grad-CAM. Specifically, the multi-level feature mapping before the fully connected layer is concatenated to obtain the gradients of the target concept so that the discriminant information can be directly located in the high-precision area. Unlike coarse-grained interpretability methods applied in EEG emotion recognition, it can accurately highlight the EEG channels related to emotion rather than an obscure area. In addition, a systematic brain functional network is proposed to reveal the relationship between those channels and to further improve emotion recognition performance. The channels with greater contributions are connected, and those connections are learned by dynamic graph convolutional networks, while the others are independent to eliminate interference. Experiments on four EEG emotion recognition datasets manifest that Concat-aided Grad-CAM can be interpreted by the fine-grained. In addition, it has been shown that the learned brain functional network can improve the performance of the baselines. Significantly, the experiment results achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple experiments.",

            "abstract": "Corporate financial distress will significantly damage the company\u2019s and its stakeholders\u2019 interests and even lead to a global financial crisis. Therefore, finding an efficient method for financial distress prediction (FDP) to avoid greater losses is essential. Although there is a lot of research and progress in this field, the existing methods rarely consider the problems of high dimensionality and class imbalance, which will largely limit the models to achieve satisfactory performance. To alleviate these problems, this article first proposes a novel Lightspace-SMOTE upsampling method, which can reduce the feature dimensionality and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the original data and then upsample it to increase the number of minor class samples. In addition, this article proposes an efficient ensemble framework (LiFoL) that combines Lightspace-SMOTE, focal loss (FL), and LightGBM, which can not only focus more on minor class and the hard-to-class samples but also obtain better performance. At the same time, the feature importance provided by the model can provide strong support for model interpretability. Experimental results show that the Lightspace-SMOTE upsampling method can help the model achieve higher scores in area under ROC curve (AUC) and recall, especially in the case of longer prediction periods. Compared with current methods, LiFoL can achieve more than 10% improvement in AUC and more than 20% in recall.",

            "abstract": "In modern precision medicine, it is an important research topic to predict cancer drug response. Due to incomplete chemical structures and complex gene features, however, it is an ongoing work to design efficient data-driven methods for predicting drug response. Moreover, since the clinical data cannot be easily obtained all at once, the data-driven methods may require relearning when new data are available, resulting in increased time consumption and cost. To address these issues, an incremental broad Transformer network (iBT-Net) is proposed for cancer drug response prediction. Different from the gene expression features learning from cancer cell lines, structural features are further extracted from drugs by Transformer. Broad learning system is then designed to integrate the learned gene features and structural features of drugs to predict the response. With the capability of incremental learning, the proposed method can further use new data to improve its prediction performance without retraining totally. Experiments and comparison studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of iBT-Net under different experimental configurations and continuous data learning.",

            "abstract": "Cement has been widely used in civil engineering directly and plays a critical role in cement-based materials, e.g., concrete. As the microstructural evolution of cement hydration predominates the final physical properties, an accurate simulation of hydration is highly required to enable scientists to evaluate the performance and help design new cementitious materials. However, despite significant effort and progress, a satisfactory model to realistically and accurately simulate the evolution of three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure has not yet to be constructed, mainly because cement hydration is one of the most complex phenomena in material science. In this work, a novel near-realistic microstructural model is proposed to simulate the cement hydration system using deep learning and cellular automata. It is designed to break through the bottleneck of fidelity to real microstructural evolution. The dynamical system is constructed based on a 3-D cellular automaton, in which behavior is controlled by deep neural networks distilled from microstructural images. In addition, a dynamic stratified sampling method with variable capacity is proposed to ensure the representativeness of samples for reducing the computation cost of training. Experiments manifest that the simulated hydration is in accordance with the actual development in different aspects, such as near-realistic microstructure and approximate process. Furthermore, the constructed system also demonstrates promising generalization capability even under various conditions.",

            "abstract": "Cement has been widely used in civil engineering, whose quality directly affects the safety of buildings. Cement compressive strength, as an important quality indicator, its accurate estimation is of great significance in quality inspections and the design of high-performance products. However, existing measurement technology remains traditional and destructive. Except for high time-consuming and the waste of various resources, it requires significant improvement since the unprofessional operations will give rise to large errors. In this article, an efficient system is proposed to estimate the cement compressive strength based on the broad learning and internal factors, in which the index system describes the internal factors affecting the compressive strength, and the broad learning system distills the potential correlation between the compressive strength and those factors. It can nondestructively estimate the strength directly with the internal factors, e.g., clinker composition and physical properties. In addition, to verify its practicability and to assist the formula optimization in the application, the robustness test and factorial analysis are designed. The experimental results prove that this model can accurately estimate the strength with excellent generalization ability, which saves labor power and material, avoids large errors caused by unprofessional operations, and aids high-performance cement production. Especially, its ability to rapidly build an accurate estimation model is beneficial for the production of various cement in industry.",

Since the micro structure of cement has significant effect on its comprehensive performance, the research on cement microstructure evolution has become extremely important [1]. As the basis of the research of cement micro structure evolution, the surface fitting of cement image is of great significance. The cement micro structure image has features with multi-scale and multi-object, thus its surface fitting becomes difficult. The moving least squares (MLS) has unique advantages for surface fitting with large amount of discrete data and complex shapes. Therefore, this paper adopts the moving least squares method to achieve the surface fitting of cement images.

They contain ample physical properties during the hydration process. Different gray values represent different substances in the grayscale image of cement. Deep learning algorithm based on microstructure images have been proposed to estimate cement compressive strength (CCS). However, there are a large number of parameters that need to be adjusted in deep structure. The high-efficiency system named broad learning system (BLS) is tried to use to estimate the cement compressive strength. The original cement microstructure images and the extracted features are used as input respectively, the connection weights can be obtained directly by calculating pseudo inverse matrix of feature matrix of microstructure image. If the structure is not sufficient to gain suitable result, BLS only calculates the pseudo inverse matrix of additional nodes to improve accuracy. The experiment shows that the broad learning structure (BLS) is an effective and efficient method on estimating cement compressive strength by contrasting with deep learning structure.",

            "title": "Prediction of share price trend using FCM neural network classifier",
            "abstract": "High-noise, chaos, non-linearity and instability are notable features of share price time series. Traditional economic model assumes that the change of share price is linear, but the assumption does not conform to reality. Therefore, the accuracy of prediction of traditional economic model is not satisfying. In this paper, considering these existed problems of traditional model, a novel method, Floating Centroids Method (FCM), is used to establish the share price trend model. FCM algorithm fits law of share price trend by finding the optimal neural network. Through the optimal neural network, share price data points are mapped into a new space which is called partition space. In the new space, same tendency of share price data points are as close as possible and different tendency points are as far as possible. Then, share price data points are clustered by K-means algorithm in partition space. Every cluster is classed. Lastly, the class of the cluster that share price point belongs to is taken as share price trend in the future. Based on experimental data, FCM algorithm has higher average accuracy and better generalization ability than comparative algorithms.",
