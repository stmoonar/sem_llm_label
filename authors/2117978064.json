            "title": "Graph-Augmented Co-Attention Model for Socio-Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "A sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action sequence. While previous methods have made many efforts to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce a new concept dubbed socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. In light of this, we contribute a novel solution named GCARec (short for graph-augmented co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. GCARec decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps. First, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user preference. Then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at sequential-level and social-level, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of GCARec against several state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets have been released at: https://github.com/wubinzzu/GCARec.",

            "title": "Graph attentive matrix factorization for social recommendation",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems commonly encounter with the problems of data sparsity and cold start. Recently, social recommendation has emerged with the rapid expansion of social platforms, offering an opportunity to alleviate such two obstacles. Nevertheless, there are still two key limitations in existing studies. From the perspective of model design, previous social recommenders only consider the influence of a user's direct friends or uniformly treat the influences from different friends. From the perspective of model learning, most of them apply a sampling\u2010based optimization strategy, which requires high\u2010quality positive and negative samples. In light of the aforementioned limitations, we propose a new probabilistic method, named Graph Attentive Matrix Factorization (GAMF). Our method not only explicitly captures high\u2010order social relationships, but also adopts an attention mechanism to automatically pick up different influences between friends. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to learn model parameters in a non\u2010sampling manner. Extensive experiments on four large\u2010scale datasets show the superiority of GAMF over state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art recommenders, especially under the cold start scenario.",

            "title": "Manifold Graph Signal Restoration Using Gradient Graph Laplacian Regularizer",
            "abstract": "In the graph signal processing (GSP) literature, graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) was used for signal restoration to promote piecewise smooth / constant reconstruction with respect to an underlying graph. However, for signals slowly varying across graph kernels, GLR suffers from an undesirable \u201cstaircase\u201d effect. In this paper, focusing on manifold graphs\u2014collections of uniform discrete samples on low-dimensional continuous manifolds\u2014we generalize GLR to gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that promotes planar / piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction. Specifically, for a graph endowed with sampling coordinates (e.g., 2D images, 3D point clouds), we first define a gradient operator, using which we construct a gradient graph for nodes\u2019 gradients in the sampling manifold space. This maps to a gradient-induced nodal graph (GNG) and a positive semi-definite (PSD) Laplacian matrix with planar signals as the $0$ frequencies. For manifold graphs without explicit sampling coordinates, we propose a graph embedding method to obtain node coordinates via fast eigenvector computation. We derive the means-square-error minimizing weight parameter for GGLR efficiently, trading off bias and variance of the signal estimate. Experimental results show that GGLR outperformed previous graph signal priors like GLR and graph total variation (GTV) in a range of graph signal restoration tasks.",

            "abstract": "Our goal is to efficiently compute low-dimensional latent coordinates for nodes in an input graph\u2014known as graph embedding\u2014for subsequent data processing such as clustering. Focusing on finite graphs that are interpreted as uniform samples on continuous manifolds (called manifold graphs), we leverage existing fast extreme eigenvector computation algorithms for speedy execution. We first pose a generalized eigenvalue problem for sparse matrix pair (A, B), where A = L \u2013 \u03bcQ + \u220aI is a sum of graph Laplacian L and disconnected two-hop difference matrix Q. Eigenvector v minimizing Rayleigh quotient $\\tfrac{\\mathbf{v}^ \\top \\mathbf{Av}}{\\mathbf{v}^ \\top \\mathbf{v}}$ thus minimizes 1-hop neighbor distances while maximizing distances between disconnected 2-hop neighbors, preserving graph structure. Matrix B = diag({bi}) that defines eigenvector orthogonality is then chosen so that boundary/interior nodes in the sampling domain have the same generalized degrees. K-dimensional latent vectors for the N graph nodes are the first K generalized eigenvectors for (A, B), computed in $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ using LOBPCG, where K \u226a N. Experiments show that our embedding is among the fastest in the literature, while producing the best clustering performance for manifold graphs.",

            "abstract": "Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have been widely applied to recommender systems during the last few years. Existing GCNs propagate the collaborative signals within the user-item interacted graph to find the similar nodes. However, this kind of network only uses implicit features that limited by the sparsity of the graph, and many nodes cannot be well represented. Here implicit feature refers to the interaction of user-item. In this paper, we propose an adaptive boosting graph convolution network algorithm (BoostGCN) for recommender, which combines multiple homogeneous component graph-based models linearly. In the framework, we choose the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) as the parameter of re-weight function for each component models. At last, we conduct experiments on two public datasets and our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on common metrics and convergence time.",
