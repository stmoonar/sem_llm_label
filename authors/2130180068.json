            "abstract": "GIS spatial big data presents the characteristics of massive, multi-source, heterogeneous, spatiotemporal, multiscale. The traditional GIS data storage technology can not meet the needs of GIS spatial big data management. In this paper, for the construction of lightweight WebGIS management system of Oilfield Engineering, aiming at the application requirements of 2D and 3D vector data in security, fault tolerance and scalability, the application strategy of distributed spatial data management technology in cloud environment is proposed, which has made progress in the aspects of high concurrent access of spatial data, fast data loading and high efficiency operation.",

This paper proposes to apply the edge cloud computing platform to WebGIS services to solve the problems of insufficient bandwidth and computing delay in GIS applications. In this paper, KubeEdge platform is used as the basic architecture support, and it is oriented to WebGIS based oilfield production management system to realize the edge computing of convective spatial big data and relieve the intensive computing pressure of underlying data in GIS system.",
