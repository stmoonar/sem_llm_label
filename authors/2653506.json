            "abstract": "With the increasing maturity and scale of quantum hardware and its integration into HPC systems, there is a need to develop robust techniques for developing, characterizing, and benchmarking quantum-HPC applications and middleware systems. This requires a better understanding of interaction, coupling, and common execution patterns between quantum and classical workload tasks and components. This paper identifies six quantum-HPC execution motifs - recurring execution patterns characterized by distinct coupling and interaction modes. These motifs provide the basis for a suite of quantum mini-apps - simplified application prototypes that encapsulate essential characteristics of production systems. To support these developments, we introduce a mini-app framework that offers the necessary abstractions for creating and executing mini-apps across heterogeneous quantum-HPC infrastructure, making it a valuable tool for performance characterizations and middleware development.",

            "abstract": "Message brokers often mediate communication between data producers and consumers by adding variable-sized messages to ordered distributed queues. Our goal is to determine the number of consumers and consumer-partition assignments needed to ensure that the rate of data consumption keeps up with the rate of data production. We model the problem as a variable item size bin packing problem. As the rate of production varies, new consumer-partition assignments are computed, which may require rebalancing a partition from one consumer to another. While rebalancing a queue, the data being produced into the queue is not read leading to additional latency costs. As such, we focus on the multi-objective optimization cost of minimizing both the number of consumers and queue migrations. We present a variety of algorithms and compare them to established bin packing heuristics for this application. Comparing our proposed consumer group assignment strategy with Kafka's, a commonly employed strategy, our strategy presents a 90th percentile latency of 4.52s compared to Kafka's 217s with both using the same amount of consumers. Kafka's assignment strategy only improved the consumer group's performance with regards to latency with configurations that used at least 60% more resources than our approach.",

            "abstract": "Fog computing platforms became essential for deploying low-latency applications at the network's edge. However, placing and managing time-critical applications over a Fog infrastructure with many heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices over a dynamic network is challenging. This paper proposes an incremental multilayer resource-aware partitioning (M-RAP) method that minimizes resource wastage and maximizes service placement and deadline satisfaction in a dynamic Fog with many application requests. M-RAP represents the heterogeneous Fog resources as a multilayer graph, partitions it based on the network structure and resource types, and constantly updates it upon dynamic changes in the underlying Fog infrastructure. Finally, it identifies the device partitions for placing the application services according to their resource requirements, which must overlap in the same low-latency network partition. We evaluated M-RAP through extensive simulation and two applications executed on a real testbed. The results show that M-RAP can place 1.6 times as many services, satisfy deadlines for 43% more applications, lower their response time by up to 58%, and reduce resource wastage by up to 54% compared to three state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Quantum computing is important for science and industry as it offers the potential to solve certain complex problems and perform calculations significantly faster than classical computers. Quantum computing systems evolved from monolithic systems towards modular architectures comprising multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) coupled to classical computing nodes (HPC). With the increasing scale, middleware systems that facilitate the efficient coupling of quantum-classical computing are becoming critical. Through an in-depth analysis of quantum applications, integration patterns and systems, we identified a gap in understanding Quantum-HPC middleware systems. We present a conceptual middleware to facilitate reasoning about quantum-classical integration and serve as the basis for a future middleware system. A key contribution of this paper lies in leveraging well-established high-performance computing abstractions for managing workloads, tasks, and resources to seamlessly integrate quantum computing into HPC systems.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "Community evolution prediction enables business-driven social networks to detect customer groups modeled as communities based on similar interests by splitting them into temporal segments and utilizing ML classification to predict their structural changes. Unfortunately, existing methods overlook business contexts and focus on analyzing customer activities, raising privacy concerns. This paper proposes a novel method for community evolution prediction that applies a context-aware approach to identify future changes in community structures through three complementary features. Firstly, it models business events as transactions, splits them into explicit contexts, and detects contextualized communities for multiple time windows. Secondly, it uses novel structural metrics representing temporal features of contextualized communities. Thirdly, it uses extracted features to train ML classifiers and predict the community evolution in the same context and other dependent contexts. Experimental results on two real-world data sets reveal that traditional ML classifiers using the context-aware approach can predict community evolution with up to three times higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score than other baseline classification methods (i.e., majority class, persistence).",

            "abstract": "Media production and consumption behaviors are changing in response to new technologies and demands, giving birth to a new generation of social applications. Among them, crowd journalism represents a novel way of constructing democratic and trustworthy news relying on ordinary citizens arriving at breaking news locations and capturing relevant videos using their smartphones. The ARTICONF project [1] proposes a trustworthy, resilient, and globally sustainable toolset for developing decentralized applications (DApps). Leveraging the ARTICONF tools, we introduce a new DApp for crowd journalism called MOGPlay. MOGPlay collects and manages audio-visual content generated by citizens and provides a secure blockchain platform that rewards all stakeholders involved in professional news production. Besides live streaming, MOGPlay offers a marketplace for audio-visual content trading among citizens and free journalists with an internal token ecosystem. We discuss the functionality and implementation of the MOGPlay DApp and illustrate three pilot crowd journalism live scenarios that validate the prototype.",

            "abstract": "Fog computing emerged as a crucial platform for the deployment of IoT applications. The complexity of such applications require methods that handle the resource diversity and network structure of Fog devices, while maximizing the service placement and reducing the resource wastage. Prior studies in this domain primarily focused on optimizing application-specific requirements and fail to address the network topology combined with the different types of resources encountered in Fog devices. To overcome these problems, we propose a multilayer resource-aware partitioning method to minimize the resource wastage and maximize the service placement and deadline satisfaction rates in a Fog infrastructure with high multi-user application placement requests. Our method represents the heterogeneous Fog resources as a multilayered network graph and partitions them based on network topology and resource features. Afterwards, it identifies the appropriate device partitions for placing an application according to its requirements, which need to overlap in the same network topology partition. Simulation results show that our multilayer resource-aware partitioning method is able to place twice as many services, satisfy deadlines for three times as many application requests, and reduce the resource wastage by up to 15\u201332 times compared to two availability-aware and resource-aware state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "The ADAPT project started during the most critical phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe when the demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) from each country's healthcare system surpassed national stock amounts. Due to national shutdowns, reduced transport logistics, and containment measures on the federal and provincial levels, the authorities could not meet the rising demand from the health care system on the PPE equipment. Fortunately, the PPE production capacities in China have regained (and expanded) their available capacities through which Austria now can get the demand of PPE to protect its citizens. ADAPT develops an adaptive and autonomous decision-making network to support the involved stakeholders along the PPE supply chain to save and protect human lives. The ADAPT decentralized blockchain platform optimizes supply, demand, and transport capacities between China and Austria with transparent, real-time certification checks on equipment, production documentation, and intelligent decision-making capabilities at all levels of this multidimensional logistic problem.",
