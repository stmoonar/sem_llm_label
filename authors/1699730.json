            "abstract": "The vision of collecting all of one's personal information into one searchable database has been around at least since Vannevar Bush's 1945 paper on the Memex System [2]. In the late 1990's, Gordon Bell and his colleagues at Microsoft Research built MyLifeBits [1, 6], which was the first serious attempt to build such a database. Since then, there has been continued interest in our community to build personal information management systems [3-5, 7, 8, 10]. Recently, the Solid Project proposes a more radical approach to personal information, arguing that all of one's data should reside in their own data pod, and applications should be redesigned to fetch data from the pod [9].",

            "abstract": "Spoken Reading Comprehension (SRC) is a challenging problem in spoken natural language retrieval, which automatically extracts the answer from the text-form contents according to the audio-form question. However, the existing spoken question answering approaches are mainly based on synthetically generated audio-form data, which may be ineffectively applied for multi-accent spoken question answering directly in many real-world applications. In this paper, we construct a large-scale multi-accent human spoken dataset SQuAD-SRC, in order to study the problem of multi-accent spoken reading comprehension. We choose 24 native English speakers from six different countries with various English accents and construct audio-form questions to the correspondent text-form contents by the chosen speakers. The dataset consists of 98,169 spoken question answering pairs and 20,963 passages from the popular machine reading comprehension dataset SQuAD. We present a statistical analysis of our SQuAD-SRC dataset and conduct extensive experiments on it by comparing cascaded SRC approaches and the enhanced end-to-end ones. Moreover, we explore various adaption strategies to improve the SRC performance, especially for multi-accent spoken questions.",

In this paper, we propose ChartNavigator, an interactive pattern identification and annotation framework for unlabeled visualization charts. ChartNavigator leverages a novel chart-sensitive deep factor model to map patterns into a low-dimensional factor representation space, and facilitates rich analysis with the derived representations. We design and implement a visual interface to support efficient identification and annotation of potential patterns in charts. Evaluations with multiple datasets show that our approach outperforms the baseline models in identifying and annotating patterns.",

            "title": "A New Sparse Data Clustering Method Based On Frequent Items",
            "abstract": "Large, sparse categorical data is a natural way to represent complex data like sequences, trees, and graphs. Such data is prevalent in many applications, e.g., Criteo released a terabyte size click log data of 4 billion records with millions of dimensions. While most existing clustering algorithms like k-Means work well on dense, numerical data, there exist relatively few algorithms that can cluster sets of sparse categorical features. In this paper, we propose a new method called k-FreqItems that performs scalable clustering over high-dimensional, sparse data. To make clustering results easily interpretable, k-FreqItems is built upon a novel sparse center representation called FreqItem which will choose a set of high-frequency, non-zero dimensions to represent the cluster. Unlike most existing clustering algorithms, which adopt Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, k-FreqItems uses the popular Jaccard distance for comparing sets. Since the efficiency and effectiveness of k-FreqItems are highly dependent on an initial set of representative seeds, we introduce a new randomized initialization method, SILK, to deal with the seeding problem of k-FreqItems. SILK uses locality-sensitive hash (LSH) functions for oversampling and identifies frequently co-occurred data in LSH buckets to determine a set of promising seeds, allowing k-FreqItems to converge swiftly in an iterative process. Experimental results over seven real-world sparse data sets show that the SILK seeding is around 1.1\\sim3.2\u00d7 faster yet more effective than the state-of-the-art seeding methods. Notably, SILK scales up well to a billion data objects on a commodity machine with 4 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangQiang/k-FreqItems.",

            "abstract": "Early detection of anomalies from sensor-based Multivariate Time Series (MTS) is vital for timely response to the signs of operation failures and errors. While many interesting works have been done toward solving this problem, existing methods typically detect such anomalies as outliers by making certain assumptions that allow efficient and easily understandable solutions to be used but might not be applicable to time series. Meanwhile, unsupervised deep learning-based methods might be highly accurate but often lead to challenges for real-time industrial scenarios, e.g., requiring a large amount of training data and producing unstable output.In this paper, we propose a new approach, CAD, to detect anomalies from sensor-based MTS. We aim to leverage the latent correlations between sensors by first converting the MTS into a sequence of Time-Series Graphs (TSGs) that connect sensors to their highly correlated neighbors within a certain time period. Then, we track the unusual correlation variations between sensors on the sequence of TSGs. By analyzing the correlation variations with a theoretical guarantee, CAD can detect the time of occurrence for the anomalies simultaneously with the sensors that are affected as early as possible.Extensive experiments over eight real-world datasets show that CAD is effective, scalable, yet stable compared to nine state-of-the-art methods while keeping comparable efficiency. Moreover, it maintains above 85% accuracy on large-scale datasets with over 1,000 sensors. Notably, CAD can determine relevant sensors in a very early stage of the anomaly so that timely predictive maintenance can be done. The code is available at https://github.com/YihaoAng/CAD.",

            "abstract": "Finding the nearest neighbor to a hyperplane (or Point-to-Hyperplane Nearest Neighbor Search, simply P2HNNS) is a new and challenging problem with applications in many research domains. While existing state-of-the-art hashing schemes (e.g., NH and FH) are able to achieve sublinear time complexity without the assumption of the data being in a unit hypersphere, they require an asymmetric transformation, which increases the data dimension from d to \u03a9(d2). This leads to considerable overhead for indexing and incurs significant distortion errors.In this paper, we investigate a tree-based approach for solving P2HNNS using the classical Ball-Tree index. Compared to hashing-based methods, tree-based methods usually require roughly linear costs for construction, and they provide different kinds of approximations with excellent flexibility. A simple branch-and-bound algorithm with a novel lower bound is first developed on Ball-Tree for performing P2HNNS. Then, a new tree structure named BC-Tree, which maintains the Ball and Cone structures in the leaf nodes of Ball-Tree, is described together with two effective strategies, i.e., point-level pruning and collaborative inner product computing. BC-Tree inherits both the low construction cost and lightweight property of Ball-Tree while providing a similar or more efficient search. Experimental results over 16 real-world data sets show that Ball-Tree and BC-Tree are around 1.1~10\u00d7 faster than NH and FH, and they can reduce the index size and indexing time by about 1~3 orders of magnitudes on average.

            "abstract": "This paper investigates a new yet challenging problem called Reverse k-Maximum Inner Product Search (RkMIPS). Given a query (item) vector, a set of item vectors, and a set of user vectors, the problem of RkMIPS aims to find a set of user vectors whose inner products with the query vector are one of the k largest among the query and item vectors. We propose the first subquadratic-time algorithm, i.e., Shifting-aware Asymmetric Hashing (SAH), to tackle the RkMIPS problem. To speed up the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) on item vectors, we design a shifting-invariant asymmetric transformation and develop a novel sublinear-time Shifting-Aware Asymmetric Locality Sensitive Hashing (SA-ALSH) scheme. Furthermore, we devise a new blocking strategy based on the Cone-Tree to effectively prune user vectors (in a batch). We prove that SAH achieves a theoretical guarantee for solving the RMIPS problem. Experimental results on five real-world datasets show that SAH runs 4~8x faster than the state-of-the-art methods for RkMIPS while achieving F1-scores of over 90%.

            "title": "Modeling Spatial Nonstationarity via Deformable Convolutions for Deep Traffic Flow Prediction",
            "abstract": "Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for short-term traffic flow prediction, which can be generally categorized as convolutional (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs). CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction by taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves better performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to region-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying territory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to learn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with fixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics of local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable convolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional offsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity. On this basis, we design a deep deformable convolutional residual network, namely DeFlow-Net, that can effectively model global spatial dependence, local spatial nonstationarity, and temporal periodicity of traffic flows. Furthermore, to better fit with convolutions, we suggest to first aggregate traffic flows according to pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions based on traffic flows, then dispose to sequentially organized raster images for network input. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic flows demonstrate that DeFlow-Net outperforms GNNs and existing CNNs using standard convolutions, and spatial partition by pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions further enhances the performance. We also demonstrate the advantage of DeFlow-Net in maintaining spatial autocorrelation, and reveal the impacts of partition shapes and scales on deep traffic flow prediction.",
