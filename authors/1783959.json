            "abstract": "In this work, we study the Stochastic Budgeted Multi-round Submodular Maximization (SBMSm) problem, where we aim to adaptively maximize the sum, over multiple rounds, of a monotone and submodular objective function defined on subsets of items. The objective function also depends on the realization of stochastic events, and the total number of items we can select over all rounds is bounded by a limited budget. This problem extends, and generalizes to multiple round settings, well-studied problems such as (adaptive) influence maximization and stochastic probing. We show that, if the number of items and stochastic events is somehow bounded, there is a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for SBMSm. Then, we provide a simple greedy $1/2(1-1/e-\\epsilon)\\approx 0.316$-approximation algorithm for SBMSm, that first non-adaptively allocates the budget to be spent at each round, and then greedily and adaptively maximizes the objective function by using the budget assigned at each round. Finally, we introduce the {\\em budget-adaptivity gap}, by which we measure how much an adaptive policy for SBMSm is better than an optimal partially adaptive one that, as in our greedy algorithm, determines the budget allocation in advance. We show that the budget-adaptivity gap lies between $e/(e-1)\\approx 1.582$ and $2$.",

            "abstract": "Several elections run in the last years have been characterized by attempts to manipulate the result of the election through the diffusion of fake or malicious news over social networks. This problem has been recognized as a critical issue for the robustness of our democracy. Analyzing and understanding how such manipulations may occur is crucial to the design of effective countermeasures to these practices. Many studies have observed that, in general, to design an optimal manipulation is usually a computationally hard task. Nevertheless, literature on bribery in voting and election manipulation has frequently observed that most hardness results melt down when one focuses on the setting of (nearly) single-peaked agents, i.e., when each voter has a preferred candidate (usually, the one closer to her own belief) and preferences of remaining candidates are inversely proportional to the distance between the candidate position and the voter's belief. Unfortunately, no such analysis has been done for election manipulations run in social networks. In this work, we try to close this gap: specifically, we consider a setting for election manipulation that naturally raises (nearly) single-peaked preferences, and we evaluate the complexity of election manipulation problem in this setting: while most of the hardness and approximation results still hold, we will show that single-peaked preferences allow to design simple, efficient and effective heuristics for election manipulation.",

In this work, we advocate the necessity to extend the study of this problem in order to include several different features such as a budget constraint on the number of observations, the chance of adaptively choosing what we observe or the presence of multiple rounds.

            "abstract": ". Security Games have been widely adopted to model scenarios in which one player, the Defender , has to decide how to deploy her resources to minimize the loss that can be caused by an attack performed by another player, the Attacker , aiming at maximizing such loss. In the present paper, we focus on scenarios in which the De-fender has lexicographic-like preferences on the targets, being primarily interested in defending the integrity of a subset of the targets and, only secondarily , to reduce the amount of the other damaged targets. Our central motivation for studying this problem comes from the need to reduce the impact of malicious \ufb02ows in networks, that can be either physical, like cities, or virtual, e.g., social networks. In this work, we introduce a new class of security games to model these scenarios, characterizing it and proving the NP -hardness of computing a leader-follower equilibrium, which is the most appropriate solution concept for this setting. To compute such an equilibrium, we then provide an exact exponential-time algorithm, capable of exploiting the topological properties of the network. Finally, we show that, with opportune optimizations, this algorithm can work ef-\ufb01ciently even on network of 10000 nodes.",

The social proof marketing strategy assumes that the marketer provides a novel product for free to some users of a social network and then promptly recommends the product to other users, by informing them that a number of their friends are already using it. In this paper we study this popular marketing strategy in scenarios where the new product enters in markets where two old products are already competing. We show that if customers tend to adopt the product that is the most popular one (over the three alternative products) among their friends, then this marketing strategy allows to maximize the diffusion of the new product only on a narrow class of networks. Moreover, even if we focus on this narrow class of networks, computing the best order of the recommendations is computationally intractable. Instead, if customers are less prone to change their mind, that is, if they are willing to adopt some product only when an absolute majority of their friends has already agreed on it, then the marketing strategy always works well and, furthermore, an optimal order of recommendations can be computed in polynomial time.",

            "abstract": "Online social networks are nowadays one of the most effective and widespread tools used to share information. In addition to being employed by individuals for communicating with friends and acquaintances, and by brands for marketing and customer service purposes, they constitute a primary source of daily news for a significant number of users. Unfortunately, besides legit news, social networks also allow to effectively spread inaccurate or even entirely fabricated ones. Also due to sensationalist claims, misinformation can spread from the original sources to a large number of users in a very short time, with negative consequences that, in extreme cases, can even put at risk public safety or health. \nIn this work we discuss and propose methods to limit the spread of misinformation over online social networks. The issue is split in two separate sub-problems. We first aim to identify the most probable sources of the misinformation among the subset of users that have been reached by it. In the second step, assuming to know the misinformation sources, we want to locate a minimum number of monitors (that is, entities able to identify and block false information) in the network in order to prevent that the misinformation campaign reaches some \u201ccritical\u201d nodes while maintaining low the number of nodes exposed to the infection. \nFor each of the two issues, we provide both heuristics and mixed integer programming formulations. To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks. The results of this extensive experimental phase validate our heuristics as effective tools to contrast the spread of misinformation in online social networks. \nRegarding the source identification step, our approach showed success rates above 80% in most of the considered settings, and above 60% in almost all of them. \nWith respect to the second issue, our heuristic proved to be able to obtain solutions that exceeded (in terms of number of required monitors) the ones obtained through our MILP-based approach of more than 20% in only few test scenarios. Our heuristics for both problems also proved to outperform significantly some previously proposed algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Opinion diffusion has been largely studied in the literature on settings where the opinion whose spread has to be maximized, say white, competes against one opinion only, say black. For instance, for diffusion mechanisms modeled in terms of best response dynamics over majority agents (who change their opinion as to conform it to the majority of their neighbors), it is known that the spread can be maximized via certain greedy dynamics that can be computed in polynomial time. This setting is precisely the one considered in the paper. However, differently from earlier literature, it is assumed that one further opinion, say gray, is available to the agents. Moving from the observation that, with the third alternative to hand, greedy dynamics can dramatically fail to maximize the spread of opinion \\emphwhite, the paper then embarks in thorough computational, algorithmic and experimental studies. The picture that emerges is totally different from what is known for the case when two opinions are available only. Indeed, it is shown that greedy dynamics can dramatically fail in maximizing the spread. In particular, deciding whether there exists a dynamics that can spread the opinion white to at least k agents or can reach a consensus is shown to be intractable, formally $\\NP$-hard. On the other hand, islands of tractability based on certain structural properties of the interaction graph are identified. Finally, experimental results are discussed, which shed lights on opinion diffusion in real social networks.",

Within this setting, questions related to which extent a minority/majority can spread the opinion it supports to the other agents are considered. It is shown that if there are only two available opinions, no matter of the underlying social graph G = (N,E), there is always a group formed by a half of the agents that can annihilate the opposite opinion. A polynomial-time algorithm to compute a group of agents enjoying these properties is also devised and analyzed. The result marks the boundary of tractability, since the influence power of minorities is shown to depend on certain features of the underlying graphs, which are NP-hard to be identified. Finally, for more than two opinions we show that even the simpler problem of deciding whether there exists a sequence of updates leading to consensus is NP-hard.",

            "abstract": "Friedkin and Johnsen (1990) modeled opinion formation in social networks as a dynamic process which evolves in rounds: at each round each agent updates her expressed opinion to a weighted average of her innate belief and the opinions expressed in the previous round by her social neighbors. The stubbornness level of an agent represents the tendency of the agent to express an opinion close to her innate belief. \nMotivated by the observation that innate beliefs, stubbornness levels and even social relations can co-evolve together with the expressed opinions, we present a new model of opinion formation where the dynamics runs in a co-evolving environment. We assume that agents\u2019 stubbornness and social relations can vary arbitrarily, while their innate beliefs slowly change as a function of the opinions they expressed in the past. We prove that, in our model, the opinion formation dynamics converges to a consensus if reasonable conditions on the structure of the social relationships and on how the personal beliefs can change are satisfied. Moreover, we discuss how this result applies in several simpler (but realistic) settings.",

Within this setting, questions related to whether a minority/majority can spread the opinion it supports to all the other agents are considered.It is shown that, no matter of the graph given at hand, there always exists a group formed by a half of the agents that can annihilate the opposite opinion.

            "abstract": "The emergence of online social networks has revolutionized the way people seek and share information. Nowadays, popular online social sites as Twitter, Facebook and Google+ are among the major news sources as well as the most effective channels for viral marketing. However, these networks also became the most effective channel for spreading misinformation, accidentally or maliciously. The widespread diffusion of inaccurate information or fake news can lead to undesirable and severe consequences, such as widespread panic, libelous campaigns and conspiracies. In order to guarantee the trustworthiness of online social networks it is a crucial challenge to find effective strategies to contrast the spread of the misinformation in the network. \n \nIn this paper we concentrate our attention on two problems related to the diffusion of misinformation in social networks: identify the misinformation sources and limit its diffusion in the network. We consider a social network where some nodes have already been infected from misinformation. We first provide an heuristics to recognize the set of most probable sources of the infection. Then, we provide an heuristics to place a few monitors in some network nodes in order to control information diffused by the suspected nodes and block misinformation they injected in the network before it reaches a large part of the network. To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks. Empirical results indicate that our heuristics are among the most effective known in literature.",

In this work, we investigate the robustness of these results to variants of the model. Our starting point is the observation that bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Stability can be very dependent on the way the quality of an equilibrium is measured. On the other side, results about the disagreement between majority at equilibria and majority among beliefs continue to hold even if we consider different classes of dynamics, such as no-worse-response dynamics, best response with multiple players updating at the same time, or with weighted neighbors.",

In this paper, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games.

            "abstract": "We study discrete preference games in heterogeneous social networks. These games model the interplay between a player's private belief and his/her publicly stated opinion (which could be different from the player's belief) as a strategic game in which the players' strategies are the opinions and the cost of an opinion in a state is a convex combination through a parameter $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ of two factors: the disagreement between the player's opinion and his/her internal belief and the number of neighbors whose opinions differ from the one of the player. The parameter $\\alpha$ models how stubborn a player is: players with large $\\alpha$ change their opinion only if many neighbors disagree with his/her belief. We consider social networks that are heterogeneous in the sense that the parameter $\\alpha$ can vary from player to player. \nWe ask if it is possible that the belief shared by the majority of the players does not coincide with the opinion that is publicly announced by the majority of the players in an equilibrium state. Our main result is a characterization of the social networks that admit an initial belief assignment for which there exists a sequence of best response moves that reach an equilibrium in which the initial majority is subverted. Our characterization is effective in the sense that can be tested efficiently and the initial belief assignment that can be subverted can be computed in time polynomial in the number of players. Our result is actually stronger as we show that in each initial belief assignment that can be subverted, subversion is actually obtained in a very strong way: it only takes one move of a single player, the swing player, to lead the social network to a point of no return in which any rational move from any player leads to a subverted majority.",

            "abstract": "Drawing on ideas from game theory and quantum physics, we investigate nonlocal correlations from the point of view of equilibria in games of incomplete information. These equilibria can be classified in decreasing power as general communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria and correlated equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of belief-invariant equilibrium has appeared in game theory before, in the 1990s. However, the class of non-signalling correlations associated to belief-invariance arose naturally already in the 1980s in the foundations of quantum mechanics. \nIn the present work, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the above classes of equilibria, and furthermore quantum correlated equilibria, using tools from quantum information but the language of game theory. We present a general framework of belief-invariant communication equilibria, which contains (quantum) correlated equilibria as special cases. Our framework also contains the theory of Bell inequalities, a question of intense interest in quantum mechanics and the original motivation for the above-mentioned studies. \nWe then use our framework to show new results related to social welfare. Namely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than correlated equilibria, and one where all non-belief-invariant equilibria are socially suboptimal. Then, we show that in some cases optimal social welfare is achieved by quantum correlations, which do not need an informed mediator to be implemented. Furthermore, we illustrate potential practical applications: for instance, situations where competing companies can correlate without exposing their trade secrets, or where privacy-preserving advice reduces congestion in a network. Along the way, we highlight open questions on the interplay between quantum information, cryptography, and game theory.",

Recent papers have obtained bounds on the price of anarchy and stability of these games. Our starting point is the observation that such bounds can be very sensitive on the way the quality of equilibria is quantified. This motivates us to foc us on properties of the games that do not depend on these details. In particular, we consider the question of whether the public opinion can be different than the public \u201cbelief\u201d. We show that strategi c behavior typically leads to changes of the public opinion compared to the public belief. We completely characterize the social networks (graphs) where such changes can happen and furthermore study the complexity of such transitions. We show that deciding whether a minority belief can become the majority opinion is NP-hard even when the initial number of supporters of this belief is very c lose to 1/4 of the social network size. Next, motivated by the limited expressive power of discrete preference games, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games . These games have additional characteristics and can model social relations to allies or compet itors, including complex relations between more than two agents, introduce different levels of strengt h for each relation, and personalize the dependence of each agent to its neighborhood.

            "abstract": "Logit dynamics [Blume, Games and Economic Behavior, 1993] is a randomized best response dynamics where at every time step a player is selected uniformly at random and she chooses a new strategy according to the \u201clogit choice function\u201d, i.e. a probability distribution biased towards strategies promising higher payoffs, where the bias level corresponds to the degree of rationality of the agents. While the logit choice function is a very natural behavioral model for approximately rational agents, the specific revision process that selects one single player per time step seems less justified. In this paper we thus focus on the dynamics where at every time step every player simultaneously updates her strategy according to the logit choice function. We call such a dynamics the \u201call-logit\u201d, as opposed to the classical \u201cone-logit\u201d dynamics. The all-logit dynamics for a game induces an ergodic Markov chain over the set of strategy profiles which is significantly different from the Markov chain induced in the one-logit case. In this paper we first highlight similarities and differences between the two dynamics with some simple examples of two-player games; we then give a characterization of the class of games such that the Markov chains induced by the all-logit dynamics are reversible and we show it is a subclass of potential games; finally, we analyze the mixing time of the all-logit dynamics for a well-known coordination game.",

            "abstract": "We consider general resource assignment games involving selfish users/agents in which users compete for resources and try to be assigned to those which maximize their own benefits (e.g., try to route their traffic through links which minimize the latency of their own traffic). We propose and study a mechanism design approach in which an allocation mechanism assigns users to resources and charges the users for using the resources so as to induce each user to truthfully report a private piece of information he/she holds (e.g., how much traffic he/she needs to transmit). This information is crucial for computing optimal (or close to optimal) allocations and an agent could misreport his/her information to induce the underlying allocation algorithm to output a solution which he/she likes more (e.g., which assigns better resources to him/her). For our resource allocation problems, we give an algorithmic characterization of the solutions for which truth-telling is a Nash equilibrium. A natural application of these results is to a scheduling/routing problem which is the mechanism design counterpart of the selfish routing game of Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [1999]: Each selfish user wants to route a piece of unsplittable traffic using one of m links of different speeds so as to minimize his/her own latency. Our mechanism design counterpart can be seen as the problem of scheduling selfish jobs on parallel related machines and is the dual of the problem of scheduling (unselfish) jobs on parallel selfish machines studied by Archer and Tardos [2001]. Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou studied an \u201canarchic\u201d scenario in which each user chooses his/her own link, and this may produce Nash equilibria of cost \u03a9(log m/log log m) times the optimum. Our mechanism design counterpart is a possible way of reducing the effect of selfish behavior via suitable incentives to the agents (i.e., taxes for using the links). We indeed show that in the resulting game, it is possible to guarantee an approximation factor of 8 for any number of links/machines (this solution also works for online settings). However, it remains impossible to guarantee arbitrarily good approximate solutions, even for 2 links/machines and even if the allocation algorithm is allowed superpolynomial time. This result shows that our scheduling problem with selfish jobs is more difficult than the scheduling problem with selfish machines by Archer and Tardos (which admits exact solutions). We also study some generalizations of this basic problem.",

            "abstract": "Over the last years, a call for embedding computation into the environment has been arisen. This philosophy has been often referred to as pervasive or ubiquitous computing, to remark the aim to a dense and widespread interaction among computing devices. User intervention and awareness are discarded, in opposition to an automatic adaptation of applications to location and context. To this aim, much attention is drawn to technologies supporting dynamicity and mobility over small devices which can follow the user anytime, anywhere. The Bluetooth standard particularly fits this idea, by providing a versatile and flexible wireless network technology with low power consumption. Operating in a license-free frequency, users are not charged for accessing the network nor they need an account with any company. Bluetooth dynamically sets up and manages evolving networks, by providing the possibility of automatically discovering devices and services within its transmission range. Research studies have forecasted that within a few years, most of the devices accessing the Web will be mobile, and presumably most of them will be Bluetooth-enabled. Therefore, we need solutions that encompass networking, systems, and application issues involved in realizing mobile and ubiquitous access to services. In this paper, we present a transparent middleware which extends the possibility of accessing Web resources also from Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. All the implementation details will be hidden both to users and to application developers, allowing an easy and complete portability of applications working on traditional TCP/IP communication protocols towards the Bluetooth technology.",

We refer to the most common architecture used to invoke Web services, where a client and a server exchange SOAP messages using HTTP as the transport protocol. To the best of our knowledge, there is no implemented support for executing a HTTP POST operation over a Bluetooth channel. Therefore, to guarantee the independence of the application from the type of communication channel used, in this paper, we deal with the problem of designing a framework allowing a Java application programmer to directly interface Web services from a mobile device using a Bluetooth connection. This paper presents a proof of concept of how Bluetooth technology can be used to design, develop, and deploy Web services-based applications. According to our experiments, programming interfaces like Blue Cove and kSOAP, despite being still under development, are mature enough to be used as the underlying technologies for Web services invocation over Bluetooth in a real world application",

            "abstract": "We study the problem of assigning unsplittable traffic to a set of m links so to minimize the maximum link congestion (i.e., the makespan). We consider the case of selfish agents owning pieces of the traffic. In particular, we introduce a variant of the model by Koutsopias and Papadimitriou [1999] in which owners of the traffic cannot directly choose which link to use; instead, the assignment is performed by a scheduler. The agents can manipulate the scheduler by reporting falseinformation regarding the size of each piece of unsplittable traffic.We provide upper and ower bounds on the approximation achievable by mechanisms that induce a Nash equilibrium when all agents report their true values.For the case of each agent owning one job, our positive results for m identical links show the effectiveness of introducing such a scheduler since, in this case, (1+\u03b5)-approximate solutions are guaranteed in polynomial time. In contrast, the result by Koutsopias and Papadimitriou [1999] shows that, without payments and allowing selfish routing, Nash equilibria yield (in the worst case) \u03a9(log m over log log m)-approximate solutions, even for unitary weighted traffic. When links have different speeds we prove lower and upper bounds on the approximation achievable by a mechanism inducing a Nash equilibrium.Similar approximability results for identical machines have been achieved by Feldman et al. [2003]. However these results do not hold in our setting because their model assumes that the algorithm is provided with the correct traffic weights. For the case of agents owning more than one job, we give mechanisms that achieve constant approximation and prove lower bounds on the approximation ratio that can be achieved by a mechanism.",

Combining properties of inclusion-minimal k-vertex connected graphs and of k-out-connected graphs (i.e., graphs which contain a vertex from which there exist k internally vertex-disjoint paths to every other vertex), we derive polynomial time algorithm for finding a (?k/2?+1)-connected subgraph with a weight at most twice the optimum to the original problem. In particular, we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for the case k=3 of our problem. This improves the best previously known approximation ratio 3. The complexity of the algorithm is O(|V|3|E|)=O(|V|5).",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of placing k identical resources in a graph where each vertex is associated with a nonnegative weight representing the frequency of requests issued by that vertex for the resource. We define the cost of a placement as the sum over all vertices of their distances to the closest resource weighted by their weights. The optimal placement is the placement with the least cost among all placements. We give an algorithm for placing optimally k resources on a growing line. The algorithm starts with an empty line. At each step a new vertex is appended to the line and the algorithm has to recompute the optimal placement of the k resources. Our algorithm processes each new vertex in O(k) amortized time. As a corollary, we obtain an algorithm that computes the optimal placement of k resources in an n-vertex line in time O(kn), which optimal for constant k.",

Typical templates for accessing trees are subtrees, root-to-leaf paths, or levels which are referred to as elementary templates. They first propose a new mapping algorithm for accessing both paths and subtrees of size M with an optimal number of conflicts (i.e., only one conflict) when the number of memory modules is limited to M. They also propose another mapping algorithm for a composite template, say /spl Vscr/ (as versatile), such that its size is not fixed and an instance of /spl Vscr/ is composed of any combination of c instances of elementary templates. The number of conflicts for accessing an S-node instance of template /spl Vscr/ is O(S//spl radic/M log M+c) and the memory load is 1+o(1) where load is defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum number of data items mapped onto each memory module.",

A measure of the complexity of a converter is given by its maximum degree (i.e., the maximum number of potential conversions of any given wavelength). We present trade-oos between the complexityof the converters and the number of wavelengths necessary to route a set of requests as function of the load l in directed ber trees, where load is the maximum number of requests traversing a directed tree link. In particular our results show that it is possible to beat the known lower bounds using constant or poly-logarithmic degree converters and even obtain optimal wavelength routing (i.e., full bandwidth utilization) in case of binary trees using converters of constant degree.",

We consider both converters with full conversion capabilities and converters with limited capabilities. We give upper and lower bounds on the number of full wavelength converters necessary to fully utilize the optical bandwidth available. For converters of limited capabilities we show that, for general trees, converters of degree dL=3e + 1 are suucient to route a set of requests of load L using at most 3=2L wavelengths. For the special case of binary trees, we show that converters of degree O(p L) are suucient to route a set of requests of load L using exactly L wavelengths.

            "abstract": "Studies the problem of mapping the N nodes of a data structure onto M memory modules so that they can be accessed in parallel by templates, i.e. distinct sets of nodes. In the literature, several algorithms are available for arrays (accessed by rows, columns, diagonals and subarrays) and trees (accessed by subtrees, root-to-leaf paths, etc.). Although some mapping algorithms for arrays allow conflict-free access to several templates at once (e.g. rows and columns), no mapping algorithm is known for efficiently accessing both subtree and root-to-leaf path templates in complete binary trees. We prove that any mapping algorithm that is conflict-free for one of these two templates has /spl Omega/(M/log M) conflicts on the other. Therefore, no mapping algorithm can be found that is conflict-free on both templates. We give an algorithm for mapping complete binary trees with N=2/sup M/-1 nodes on M memory modules in such a way that: (a) the number of conflicts for accessing a subtree template or a root-to-leaf path template is O[/spl radic/(M/logM)], (b) the load (i.e. the ratio between the maximum and minimum number of data items mapped on each module) is 1+o(1), and (c) the time complexity for retrieving the module where a given data item is stored is O(1) if a preprocessing phase of space and time complexity O(log N) is executed, or O(log log N) if no preprocessing is allowed.",

We study the Supercube's ability to execute parallel programs, using graph-embedding techniques. We show that complete binary trees and bidimensional meshes (with a side length power of 2) are spanning subgraphs of the Supercube. We then prove that the Supercube is Hamiltonian and, when the number of nodes is not a power of 2, it contains all cycles of length greater than 3 as subgraphs. >",
