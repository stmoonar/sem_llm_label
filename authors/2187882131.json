            "abstract": "In this age where data is abundant, the ability to distill meaningful insights from the sea of information is essential. Our research addresses the computational and resource inefficiencies that current Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) suffer from. especially those employing attention-based models like SASRec, These systems are designed for next-item recommendations in various applications, from e-commerce to social networks. However, such systems suffer from substantial computational costs and resource consumption during the inference stage. To tackle these issues, our research proposes a novel method that combines automatic pruning techniques with advanced model architectures. We also explore the potential of resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a technique prevalent in the realm of recommendation systems, to fine-tune models for reduced FLOPs, latency, and energy usage while retaining or even enhancing accuracy. The main contribution of our work is developing the Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Long-term Sequential Recommender Systems (EASRec). This approach aims to find optimal compact architectures for attention-based SRSs, ensuring accuracy retention. EASRec introduces data-aware gates that leverage historical information from input data batch to improve the performance of the recommendation network. Additionally, it utilizes a dynamic resource constraint approach, which standardizes the search process and results in more appropriate architectures. The effectiveness of our methodology is validated through exhaustive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which demonstrates EASRec's superiority in SRSs. Our research set a new standard for future exploration into efficient and accurate recommender systems, signifying a substantial advancement within this swiftly advancing field.",

            "abstract": "Reranking is a critical component in recommender systems, playing an essential role in refining the output of recommendation algorithms. Traditional reranking models have focused predominantly on accuracy, but modern applications demand consideration of additional criteria such as diversity and fairness. Existing reranking approaches often fail to harmonize these diverse criteria effectively at the model level. Moreover, these models frequently encounter challenges with scalability and personalization due to their complexity and the varying significance of different reranking criteria in diverse scenarios. In response, we introduce a comprehensive reranking framework enhanced by LLM, designed to seamlessly integrate various reranking criteria while maintaining scalability and facilitating personalized recommendations. This framework employs a fully connected graph structure, allowing the LLM to simultaneously consider multiple aspects such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness through a coherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. A customizable input mechanism is also integrated, enabling the tuning of the language model's focus to meet specific reranking needs. We validate our approach using three popular public datasets, where our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art reranking models in balancing multiple criteria. The code for this implementation is publicly available.",

            "abstract": "In the landscape of Recommender System (RS) applications, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool, primarily due to its proficiency in optimizing long-term rewards. Nevertheless, it suffers from instability in the learning process, stemming from the intricate interactions among bootstrapping, off-policy training, and function approximation. Moreover, in multi-reward recommendation scenarios, designing a proper reward setting that reconciles the inner dynamics of various tasks is quite intricate. In response to these challenges, we introduce DT4IER, an advanced decision transformer-based recommendation model that is engineered to not only elevate the effectiveness of recommendations but also to achieve a harmonious balance between immediate user engagement and long-term retention. The DT4IER applies an innovative multi-reward design that adeptly balances short and long-term rewards with user-specific attributes, which serve to enhance the contextual richness of the reward sequence ensuring a more informed and personalized recommendation process. To enhance its predictive capabilities, DT4IER incorporates a high-dimensional encoder, skillfully designed to identify and leverage the intricate interrelations across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive learning approach within the action embedding predictions, a strategy that significantly boosts the model's overall performance. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DT4IER against state-of-the-art Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) models in terms of both prediction accuracy and effectiveness in specific tasks. The source code is accessible online to facilitate replication",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems aim to predict users\u2019 next interested item given their historical interactions. However, a long-standing issue is how to distinguish between users\u2019 long/short-term interests, which may be heterogeneous and contribute differently to the next recommendation. Existing approaches usually set pre-defined short-term interest length by exhaustive search or empirical experience, which is either highly inefficient or yields subpar results. The recent advanced transformer-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performances despite the aforementioned issue, but they have a quadratic computational complexity to the length of the input sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming for better modeling users\u2019 long/short-term interests from their historical interactions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm for preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization. Through extensive experiments, we show that AutoMLP has competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining linear computational complexity.",

            "abstract": "With the acceleration of urbanization, traffic forecasting has become an essential role in smart city construction. In the context of spatio-temporal prediction, the key lies in how to model the dependencies of sensors. However, existing works basically only consider the micro relationships between sensors, where the sensors are treated equally, and their macroscopic dependencies are neglected. In this paper, we argue to rethink the sensor's dependency modeling from two hierarchies: regional and global perspectives. Particularly, we merge original sensors with high intra-region correlation as a region node to preserve the inter-region dependency. Then, we generate representative and common spatio-temporal patterns as global nodes to reflect a global dependency between sensors and provide auxiliary information for spatio-temporal dependency learning. In pursuit of the generality and reality of node representations, we incorporate a Meta GCN to calibrate the regional and global nodes in the physical data space. Furthermore, we devise the cross-hierarchy graph convolution to propagate information from different hierarchies. In a nutshell, we propose a Hierarchical Information Enhanced Spatio-Temporal prediction method, HIEST, to create and utilize the regional dependency and common spatio-temporal patterns. Extensive experiments have verified the leading performance of our HIEST against state-of-the-art baselines. We publicize the code to ease reproducibility1.",

            "abstract": "Long-term user responses, i.e., clicks or purchases on e-commerce platforms, are crucial for sequential recommender systems. Recent off-policy evaluation methods involve these responses by simultaneously maximizing expected cumulative rewards. However, two aspects of these methods require further consideration. Firstly, from the system's point of view, candidates with various values are interchangeable, which may result in contradictory future recommendations despite having the same interaction history. Secondly, rewards are manually designed, which necessitates a trial-and-error approach to strike a balance between training stabilization and reward distinction. To address these issues, we propose a new sequential recommender system called NCM4Rec. Specifically, for the distinction problem, NCM4Rec achieves counterfactual consistency via a neural causal model, which is learnable yet equally expressive as classic structural causal models. Such consistency is maintained by a Gumbel-Max design. For the representing problem, NCM4Rec encodes different types of responses as one-hot vectors and captures the long-term preference via adversarial learning. As a consequence, NCM4Rec is both adaptive and identifiable. Both theoretical analyses of the consistency and empirical studies over two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Layer Perceptron (MMMLP) for maintaining multi-modal sequences for sequential recommendation. MMMLP is a purely MLP-based architecture that consists of three modules - the Feature Mixer Layer, Fusion Mixer Layer, and Prediction Layer - and has an edge on both efficacy and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that MMMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity. We also conduct ablating analysis to verify the contribution of each component. Furthermore, compatible experiments are devised, and the results show that the multi-modal representation learned by our proposed model generally benefits other recommendation models, emphasizing our model\u2019s ability to handle multi-modal information. We have made our code available online to ease reproducibility1.",

            "abstract": "The identification of potential offenders, who are more likely to form a new group and co-offend in a crime, plays an essential role in narrowing down law enforcement investigations and improving predictive policing. Once a crime is committed, focusing on linking it to previously reported crimes and reducing the inspections based on shreds of evidence and the behavior of offenders can also greatly help law enforcement agencies. However, classical investigative techniques are generally case-specific and rely mainly on police officers manually combining information from different sources. Therefore, automatic methods designed to support co-offender research and crime linkage would be beneficial. This paper proposes two graph-based machine learning frameworks to address these issues based on a burglary use case, the first being transductive link prediction , which seeks to predict emergent links between existing graph nodes (which represent offenders or criminal cases), and the",

Considering the demand for its grand application, we recognize key factors for an ideal spatio-temporal prediction method: efficient, lightweight, and effective. However, the current deep model-based spatio-temporal prediction solutions generally own intricate architectures with cumbersome optimization, which can hardly meet these expectations. To accomplish the above goals, we propose an intuitive and novel framework, MLPST, a pure multi-layer perceptron architecture for traffic prediction. Specifically, we first capture spatial relationships from both local and global receptive fields. Then, temporal dependencies in different intervals are comprehensively considered. Through compact and swift MLP processing, MLPST can well capture the spatial and temporal dependencies while requiring only linear computational complexity, as well as model parameters that are more than an order of magnitude lower than baselines. Extensive experiments validated the superior effectiveness and efficiency of MLPST against advanced baselines, and among models with optimal accuracy, MLPST achieves the best time and space efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems (SRS) aim to infer the users' preferences from their interaction history and predict items that will be of interest to the users. The majority of SRS models typically incorporate all historical interactions for next-item recommendations. Despite their success, feeding all interactions into the model without filtering may lead to severe practical issues: (i) redundant interactions hinder the SRS model from capturing the users' intentions; (ii) the computational cost is huge, as the computational complexity is proportional to the length of the interaction sequence; (iii) more memory space is necessitated to store all interaction records from all users. To this end, we propose a novel storage-saving SRS framework, MAE4Rec, based on a unidirectional self-attentive mechanism and masked autoencoder. Specifically, in order to lower the storage consumption, MAE4Rec first masks and discards a large percentage of historical interactions, and then infers the next interacted item solely based on the latent representation of unmarked ones. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art SRS models with more than 40% compression of storage.",
