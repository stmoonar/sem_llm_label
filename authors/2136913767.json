            "abstract": "It is critical that machine learning (ML) model predictions be trustworthy for high-throughput catalyst discovery approaches. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods allow estimation of the trustworthiness of an ML model, but these methods have not been well explored in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we investigate different UQ methods applied to a crystal graph convolutional neural network to predict adsorption energies of molecules on alloys from the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset, the largest existing heterogeneous catalyst dataset. We apply three UQ methods to the adsorption energy predictions, namely k-fold ensembling, Monte Carlo dropout, and evidential regression. The effectiveness of each UQ method is assessed based on accuracy, sharpness, dispersion, calibration, and tightness. Evidential regression is demonstrated to be a powerful approach for rapidly obtaining tunable, competitively trustworthy UQ estimates for heterogeneous catalysis applications when using neural networks. Recalibration of model uncertainties is shown to be essential in practical screening applications of catalysts using uncertainties.",

            "title": "CONSEQUENCES \u2014 The 2nd Workshop on Causality, Counterfactuals and Sequential Decision-Making for Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems make algorithmic decisions about what will be shown to whom, billions of times every day across the web. These decisions have consequences that can often be far-reaching. Indeed, users that are exposed to certain items, might be convinced to explore interests that are novel to them. At the same time, exposure is often linked to economic incentives for the item producer, which platform-level metrics will be impacted by as well. Feedback loops in existing systems also imply that algorithmic decisions made by the model itself, have an impact on the data future model iterations will be trained and evaluated on. The literature on the intersection of recommender systems, and causal or counterfactual inference, is often focused on short-term, user-focused metrics. Nevertheless, as algorithmic consequences influence many stakeholders, it is our belief that a broader holistic view of the problem can lead to an improved understanding of these systems that touch upon many people\u2019s daily lives. The 2nd edition of the CONSEQUENCES workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in this research topic, and wish to help shape its future.",
