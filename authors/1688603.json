            "abstract": "To accommodate new applications such as extended reality, fully autonomous vehicular networks and the metaverse, next generation wireless networks are going to be subject to much more stringent performance requirements than the fifth-generation (5G) in terms of data rates, reliability, latency, and connectivity. It is thus necessary to develop next generation advanced transceiver (NGAT) technologies for efficient signal transmission and reception. In this tutorial, we explore the evolution of NGAT from three different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide an overview of new-field NGAT technology, which shifts from conventional far-field channel models to new near-field channel models. Then, three new-form NGAT technologies and their design challenges are presented, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, flexible antennas, and holographic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Subsequently, we discuss recent advances in semantic-aware NGAT technologies, which can utilize new metrics for advanced transceiver designs. Finally, we point out other promising transceiver technologies for future research.",

            "abstract": "This paper considers the Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT) with selfish transmitters, i.e., who are each solely interested in maximizing their individual secrecy rate. The question then arises as to whether selfish transmitters can increase their individual secrecy rate by participating in a collective, i.e, multiple access, protocol instead of operating on their own. If yes, the question arises whether there is a protocol that satisfies all the participating transmitters simultaneously, in the sense that no transmitter has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. Utilizing coalitional game theory, these questions are addressed for the degraded GMAC-WT with an arbitrary number of transmitters and for the non-degraded GMAC-WT with two transmitters. In particular, for the degraded GMAC-WT, cooperation is shown to be in the best interest of all transmitters, and the existence of protocols that incentivize all transmitters to participate is established. Furthermore, a unique, fair, stable, and achievable secrecy rate allocation is determined. For the non-degraded GMAC-WT, depending on the channel parameters, there are cases where cooperation is not in the best interest of all transmitters, and cases where it is. In the latter cases, a unique, fair, stable, and achievable secrecy rate allocation is determined.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies task-oriented, otherwise known as goal-oriented, communications, in a setting where a trans-mitter communicates with multiple receivers, each with its own task to complete on a dataset, e.g., images, available at the transmitter. A multi-task deep learning approach that involves training a common encoder at the transmitter and individual decoders at the receivers is presented for joint optimization of completing multiple tasks and communicating with multiple receivers. By providing efficient resource allocation at the edge of next-generation networks, the proposed approach allows the communications system to adapt to varying channel conditions and achieves task-specific objectives while minimizing trans-mission overhead. J oint training of the encoder and decoders using multi-task learning captures shared information across tasks and optimizes the communication process accordingly. By leveraging the broadcast nature of wireless communications, multi-receiver task-oriented communications (MTOC) reduces the number of transmissions required to complete tasks at differ-ent receivers. Performance evaluation with image classification tasks conducted on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of MTOC in terms of classification accuracy and resource utilization compared to single-task-oriented communication systems.",

            "abstract": "This work considers the problem of mitigating information leakage between communication and sensing in systems jointly performing both operations. Specifically, a discrete memoryless state-dependent broadcast channel model is studied in which (i) the presence of feedback enables a transmitter to convey information, while simultaneously performing channel state estimation; (ii) one of the receivers is treated as an eavesdropper whose state should be estimated but which should remain oblivious to part of the transmitted information. The model abstracts the challenges behind security for joint communication and sensing if one views the channel state as a key attribute, e.g., location. For independent and identically distributed states, perfect output feedback, and when part of the transmitted message should be kept secret, a partial characterization of the secrecy-distortion region is developed. The characterization is exact when the broadcast channel is either physically-degraded or reversely-physically-degraded. The partial characterization is also extended to the situation in which the entire transmitted message should be kept secret. The benefits of a joint approach compared to separation-based secure communication and state-sensing methods are illustrated with binary joint communication and sensing models.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the notion of age in task-oriented communications that aims to execute a task at a receiver utilizing the data at its transmitter. The transmitter-receiver operations are modeled as an encoder-decoder pair that is jointly trained while considering channel effects. The encoder converts data samples into feature vectors of small dimension and transmits them with a small number of channel uses thereby reducing the number of transmissions and latency. Instead of reconstructing input samples, the decoder performs a task, e.g., classification, on the received signals. Applying different deep neural networks of encoder-decoder pairs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, the classifier accuracy is shown to increase with the number of channel uses at the expense of longer service time. The peak age of task information (PAoTI) is introduced to analyze this accuracy-latency tradeoff when the age grows unless a received signal is classified correctly. By incorporating channel and traffic effects, design guidelines are obtained for task-oriented communications by characterizing how the PAoTI first decreases and then increases with the number of channel uses. A dynamic update mechanism is presented to adapt the number of channel uses to channel and traffic conditions, and reduce the PAoTI in task-oriented communications.",

The jammer is assumed to be oblivious of the communication signals emitted by the legitimate transmitter(s) but can employ any jamming strategy subject to a given power constraint and shares her jamming signal with the eavesdropper. Four such models are considered: (i) the Gaussian point-to-point wiretap channel; (ii) the Gaussian multiple-access wiretap channel; (iii) the Gaussian broadcast wiretap channel; and (iv) the Gaussian symmetric interference wiretap channel. The use of pre-shared randomness between the legitimate users is not allowed in our models. Inner and outer bounds are derived for these four models. For (i), the secrecy capacity is obtained. For (ii) and (iv) under a degraded setup, the optimal secrecy sum-rate is characterized. Finally, for (iii), ranges of model parameter values for which the inner and outer bounds coincide are identified.",

OTA-FL is naturally sensitive to wireless channel fading, which could significantly diminish its learning accuracy. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an OTA-FL algorithm called CHARLES (channel- quality-aware over-the-air local estimating and scaling). Our CHARLES algorithm performs channel state information (CSI) estimation and adaptive scaling to mitigate the impacts of wireless channel fading. We establish the theoretical convergence rate performance of CHARLES and analyze the impacts of CSI error on the convergence of CHARLES. We show that the adaptive channel inversion scaling scheme in CHARLES is robust under imperfect CSI scenarios. We also demonstrate through numerical results that CHARLES outperforms existing OTA-FL algorithms with heterogeneous data under imperfect CSI.",

            "abstract": "We study age of information (AoI) minimization in an ad hoc network consisting of energy harvesting transmitters that are scheduled to send status updates to their intended receivers. The transmission scheduling with power allocation problem over a communication session is first studied assuming apriori knowledge of channel state information, harvested energy, and update packet arrivals, i.e., the offline setting. The global optimal scheduling policy in this case is the solution of a mixed integer linear program which is known to be computationally hard. We propose a supervised-learning-based algorithm to mitigate the high computational complexity. A bidirectional recurrent neural network that interprets user scheduling as a time-series classification problem is trained and tested to achieve near-optimal AoI. Next, we consider online scheduling and power allocation with causal knowledge of the system state, which is an infinite-state Markov decision problem. In this case, the related reinforcement learning problem is solved by a model-free on-policy deep reinforcement learning, where the actor-critic algorithm with deep neural network function approximation is implemented. Comparable AoI to the optimal is demonstrated and faster runtime of learning solvers is observed, verifying the efficacy of learning in terms of both optimality and computational energy efficiency for AoI-focused scheduling and resource allocation problems in wireless networks.",

Specifically, when learners\u2019 local datasets are non-IID, a collaboratively trained global model (such as those learned through most federated learning algorithms to minimize the sum of losses across all agents) may sacrifice the local performance on agents\u2019 private datasets. To address this issue and enable personalized learning, we propose DiPLe : an algorithm for Directed Personalized Learning. Through our algorithm, each agent identifies \"relevant\" agents with whom to exchange model information. This leads to a weighted and directed collaboration graph. Agents repeatedly update this graph, and then exchange information with neighboring agents on this learned graph, to collaboratively train their personalized models. We provide analytical results on the generalization error bounds and convergence of our proposed learning method. We verify the performance of DiPLe through numerical experiments, and show its advantages in terms of personalization compared to a number of existing federated learning and personalized learning algorithms.",
