            "abstract": "The rapid development of semi-supervised machine learning (SSML) algorithms has shown enhanced versatility, but pinpointing the primary influencing factors remains a challenge. Historically, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to underpin these algorithms, resulting in improved classification precision. This study aims to delve into the performance determinants of SSML models by employing post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. By analyzing the components of well-established SSML algorithms and comparing them to newer counterparts, this work redefines semi-supervised computation processes for both data preprocessing and classification. Integrating different types of DNNs, we evaluated the effects of parameter adjustments during training across varied labeled and unlabeled data proportions. Our analysis of 45 experiments showed a notable 8% drop in training loss and a 6.75% enhancement in learning precision when using the Shake-Shake26 classifier with the RemixMatch SSML algorithm. Additionally, our findings suggest a strong positive relationship between the amount of labeled data and training duration, indicating that more labeled data leads to extended training periods, which further influences parameter adjustments in learning processes.",

            "title": "A CNN-LSTM Ensemble Model for Predicting Protein-Protein Interaction Binding Sites",
            "abstract": "Proteins commonly perform biological functions through protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The knowledge of PPI sites is imperative for the understanding of protein functions, disease mechanisms, and drug design. Traditional biological experimental methods for studying PPI sites still incur considerable drawbacks, including long experimental time and high labor costs. Therefore, many computational methods have been proposed for predicting PPI sites. However, achieving high prediction performance and overcoming severe data imbalance remain challenging issues. In this paper, we propose a new sequence-based deep learning model called CLPPIS (standing for CNN-LSTM ensemble based PPI Sites prediction). CLPPIS consists of CNN and LSTM components, which can capture spatial features and sequential features simultaneously. Further, it utilizes a novel feature group as input, which has 7 physicochemical, biophysical, and statistical properties. Besides, it adopts a batch-weighted loss function to reduce the interference of imbalance data. Our work suggests that the integration of protein spatial features and sequential features provides important information for PPI sites prediction. Evaluation on three public benchmark datasets shows that our CLPPIS model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "The adoption of AI systems has been widely used across multiple industry domains at an alerting rate without focusing on its ethical concerns. In order to address those concerns, an increasing number of AI ethics frameworks have been suggested recently, which focus on the algorithmic level rather than the systems level. Nonetheless, some system-level approaches mostly cover a single-level governance pattern of the system components in the entire software design life cycle. However, the need to go beyond the single-level system design AI ethics frameworks to allow not only a better responsible-AI-by-design but also a trustworthy process pattern that abstracts and links the underlying layers of responsible AI on every level. This paper illustrates a principal-to-practice guide of the multi-level governance within organizations across the globe for AI ethics frameworks. We outline the main gap areas in organizations for AI ethics frameworks. Consecutively, we propose a multi-level governance pattern for responsible AI systems within organizations which is participatory, iterative, flexible and operable that targets those main gap areas. Finally, to assist practitioners in applying the multi-level governance AI in organizations and its impact on the industry level, we will translate it into effective and responsible AI practices using a case study.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Understanding housing preferences is critical for successful compact city development. However, there is limited research on understanding preference heterogeneity in dwelling type choices. Using the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, this paper identifies the key housing and built environment characteristics associated with changes in dwelling type choice from detached houses to high-density. A latent class choice model captures the heterogeneity of dwelling type preferences within a traditionally low-density city, Brisbane, Australia. Findings reveal six household classes with distinct dwelling preferences: Class 1 (senior households without children with other family members) and Class 2 (couple families with children) in inner-city areas, Class 3 (high-income young households) and Class 4 (low-income households without children) in middle-city areas, Class 5 (low-income families with children) and Class 6 (middle-income young families without children) in outer-city areas. Residential environments with better access to educational facilities encourage Classes 3 and 6 to change to high-density living. Greater land use diversity encourages Classes 2, 3, and 6 to move towards high-density living. The findings can be used to design and improve high-density housing for targeted population groups across inner-, middle- and outer-city areas.",

            "abstract": "Causal analysis for time series data, in particular estimating individualized treatment effect (ITE), is a key task in many real world applications, such as finance, retail, healthcare, etc. Real world time series, i.e., large-scale irregular or sparse and intermittent time series, raise significant challenges to existing work attempting to estimate treatment effects. Specifically, the existence of hidden confounders can lead to biased treatment estimates and complicate the causal inference process. In particular, anomaly hidden confounders which exceed the typical range can lead to high variance estimates. Moreover, in continuous time settings with irregular samples, it is challenging to directly handle the dynamics of causality. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in Lipschitz regularization and neural controlled differential equations (CDE) to develop an effective and scalable solution, namely LipCDE, to address the above challenges. LipCDE can directly model the dynamic causal relationships between historical data and outcomes with irregular samples by considering the boundary of hidden confounders given by Lipschitz constrained neural networks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LipCDE.",

However, performing video analytics efficiently by exploiting the spatial-temporal redundancy from video data remains challenging. Accordingly, we propose a novel traffic-related framework named CEVAS to achieve efficient object detection using multi-view video data. Briefly, a fine-grained input filtering policy is introduced to produce a reasonable region of interest from the captured images. Also, we design a sharing object manager to manage the information of objects with spatial redundancy and share their results with other vehicles. We further derive a content-aware model selection policy to select detection methods adaptively. Experimental results show that our framework significantly reduces response latency while achieving the same detection accuracy as the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nThe metabolic syndrome induced by obesity is closely associated with cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence is increasing globally, year by year. Obesity is a risk marker for detecting this disease. However, current research on computer-aided detection of adipose distribution is hampered by the lack of open-source large abdominal adipose datasets.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this study, a benchmark Abdominal Adipose Tissue CT Image Dataset (AATCT-IDS) containing 300 subjects is prepared and published. AATCT-IDS publics 13,732 raw CT slices, and the researchers individually annotate the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue regions of 3213 of those slices that have the same slice distance to validate denoising methods, train semantic segmentation models, and study radiomics. For different tasks, this paper compares and analyzes the performance of various methods on AATCT-IDS by combining the visualization results and evaluation data. Thus, verify the research potential of this data set in the above three types of tasks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the comparative study of image denoising, algorithms using a smoothing strategy suppress mixed noise at the expense of image details and obtain better evaluation data. Methods such as BM3D preserve the original image structure better, although the evaluation data are slightly lower. The results show significant differences among them. In the comparative study of semantic segmentation of abdominal adipose tissue, the segmentation results of adipose tissue by each model show different structural characteristics. Among them, BiSeNet obtains segmentation results only slightly inferior to U-Net with the shortest training time and effectively separates small and isolated adipose tissue. In addition, the radiomics study based on AATCT-IDS reveals three adipose distributions in the subject population.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAATCT-IDS contains the ground truth of adipose tissue regions in abdominal CT slices. This open-source dataset can attract researchers to explore the multi-dimensional characteristics of abdominal adipose tissue and thus help physicians and patients in clinical practice. AATCT-IDS is freely published for non-commercial purpose at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/AATTCT-IDS/23807256.",

            "abstract": "Structural MRI and PET imaging play an important role in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), showing the morphological changes and glucose metabolism changes in the brain respectively. The manifestations in the brain image of some cognitive impairment patients are relatively inconspicuous, for example, it still has difficulties in achieving accurate diagnosis through sMRI in clinical practice. With the emergence of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a valuable method in AD-aided diagnosis, but some CNN methods cannot effectively learn the features of brain image, making the diagnosis of AD still presents some challenges. In this work, we propose an end-to-end 3D CNN framework for AD diagnosis based on ResNet, which integrates multi-layer features obtained under the effect of the attention mechanism to better capture subtle differences in brain images. The attention maps showed our model can focus on key brain regions related to the disease diagnosis. Our method was verified in ablation experiments with two modality images on 792 subjects from the ADNI database, where AD diagnostic accuracies of 89.71% and 91.18% were achieved based on sMRI and PET respectively, and also outperformed some state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) has a wide application prospect in transmission systems of automatic production, logistics, and other fields. However, the existing PMLSM has the problems of poor flexibility and large thrust fluctuation adapted to load and stroke variation. In order to solve this problem, a dual-modular PMLSM is proposed. The motor can be flexibly configured with multiple-unit-primary and multiple-unit-secondary, and achieve low thrust fluctuation. The matching criterion of unit-primary (UP) and secondary is established to reveal the relationship between the slot/pole combination and the winding utilization. The rules of the average thrust varying with the different UP and unit-secondary (US) lengths are illustrated. Then, the matching criterion of different UP is proposed, and the optimization method of the spacing between UP (S1) is obtained by establishing the end force model. The design standard of the optimal S1 is obtained by combining the two factors of minimum detent force and maximum thrust. The results are verified by the simulation and experiments on a 3UP-96US dual-modular PMLSM circular transmission line system and its prototype.",
