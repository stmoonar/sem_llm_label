            "abstract": "The epiDAMIK workshop serves as a platform for advancing the utilization of data-driven methods in the fields of epidemiology and public health research. These fields have seen relatively limited exploration of data-driven approaches compared to other disciplines. Therefore, our primary objective is to foster the growth and recognition of the emerging discipline of data-driven and computational epidemiology, providing a valuable avenue for sharing state-of-the-art research and ongoing projects. The workshop also seeks to showcase results that are not typically presented at major computing conferences, including valuable insights gained from practical experiences. Our target audience encompasses researchers in AI, machine learning, and data science from both academia and industry, who have a keen interest in applying their work to epidemiological and public health contexts. Additionally, we welcome practitioners from mathematical epidemiology and public health, as their expertise and contributions greatly enrich the discussions. Homepage: https://epidamik.github.io/",

            "title": "Continually-Adaptive Representation Learning Framework for Time-Sensitive Healthcare Applications",
            "abstract": "Continual learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address the challenges of non-stationary environments, allowing machine learning models to adapt to new data while retaining the previously acquired knowledge. In time-sensitive healthcare applications, where entities such as physicians, hospital rooms, and medications exhibit continuous changes over time, continual learning holds great promise, yet its application remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework, i.e., Continually-Adaptive Representation Learning, designed to adapt representations in response to changing data distributions in evolving healthcare applications. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a continual learning strategy wherein the context information (e.g., interactions) of healthcare entities is exploited to continually identify and retrain the representations of those entities whose context evolved over time. Moreover, different from existing approaches, the proposed approach leverages the valuable patient information present in clinical notes to generate accurate and robust healthcare embeddings. Notably, the proposed continually-adaptive representations have practical benefits in low-resource clinical settings where it is difficult to training machine learning models from scratch to accommodate the newly available data streams. Experimental evaluations on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in time-sensitive healthcare applications such as Clostridioides difficile (C.diff) Infection (CDI) incidence prediction task and medical intensive care unit transfer prediction task.",

            "title": "Detecting Sources of Healthcare Associated Infections",
            "abstract": "Healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) (e.g., Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection) have complex transmission pathways, spreading not just via direct person-to-person contacts, but also via contaminated surfaces. Prior work in mathematical epidemiology has led to a class of models \u2013 which we call load sharing models \u2013 that provide a discrete-time, stochastic formalization of HAI-spread on temporal contact networks. The focus of this paper is the source detection problem for the load sharing model. The source detection problem has been studied extensively in SEIR type models, but this prior work does not apply to load sharing models.\nWe show that a natural formulation of the source detection problem for the load sharing model is computationally hard, even to approximate. We then present two alternate formulations that are much more tractable. The tractability of our problems depends crucially on the submodularity of the expected number of infections as a function of the source set. Prior techniques for showing submodularity, such as the \"live graph\" technique are not applicable for the load sharing model and our key technical contribution is to use a more sophisticated \"coupling\" technique to show the submodularity result. We propose algorithms for our two problem formulations by extending existing algorithmic results from submodular optimization and combining these with an expectation propagation heuristic for the load sharing model that leads to orders-of-magnitude speedup. We present experimental results on temporal contact networks based on fine-grained EMR data from three different hospitals. Our results on synthetic outbreaks on these networks show that our algorithms outperform baselines by up to 5.97 times. Furthermore, case studies based on hospital outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile infection show that our algorithms identify clinically meaningful sources.",

            "abstract": "We introduce EINNs, a framework crafted for epidemic forecasting that builds upon the theoretical grounds provided by mechanistic models as well as the data-driven expressibility afforded by AI models, and their capabilities to ingest heterogeneous information. Although neural forecasting models have been successful in multiple tasks, predictions well-correlated with epidemic trends and long-term predictions remain open challenges. Epidemiological ODE models contain mechanisms that can guide us in these two tasks; however, they have limited capability of ingesting data sources and modeling composite signals. Thus, we propose to leverage work in physics-informed neural networks to learn latent epidemic dynamics and transfer relevant knowledge to another neural network which ingests multiple data sources and has more appropriate inductive bias. In contrast with previous work, we do not assume the observability of complete dynamics and do not need to numerically solve the ODE equations during training. Our thorough experiments on all US states and HHS regions for COVID-19 and influenza forecasting showcase the clear benefits of our approach in both short-term and long-term forecasting as well as in learning the mechanistic dynamics over other non-trivial alternatives.",

            "abstract": "Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) impose a substantial burden, both on patients and on the healthcare system. Designing effective strategies by using interventions such as vaccination, isolation, cleaning, mobility modification, etc., to reduce HAI spread is an important computational challenge. Spectral approaches are quite useful for modeling and solving problems of reducing disease spread over contact networks, but they have not been used for disease-spread models and contact networks that are specific for HAIs. Our main contribution in this paper is to close this gap. We make 3 specific contributions. (i) We present the first epidemic threshold results on temporal bipartite networks, i.e., a time-varying sequence of bipartite people-location network, for the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. (ii) We leverage our epidemic threshold result to pose the HAI mitigation problem as minimizing the spectral radius of the system matrix, while removing few nodes or edges. We present a scalable combinatorial algorithm that provides approximation guarantees. (iii) Through extensive experiments on actual healthcare contact networks derived from operations data from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Carilion Clinic, and several other healthcare facilities, we show that our algorithm consistently outperforms a number of baselines (random, degree, top-k, eigen centrality) both in terms of reducing the spectral radius of the system matrix and in terms of reducing infections.",

            "title": "Finding Needles in Heterogeneous Haystacks",
            "abstract": "Due to intense competition and lack of real estate on the front page of large e-commerce platforms, sellers are sometimes motivated to garner non-genuine signals (clicks, add-to-carts, purchases) on their products, to make them appear more appealing to customers. This hurts customers' trust on the platform, and also hurts genuine sellers who sell their items without looking to game the system. While it is important to find the sellers and the buyers who are colluding to garner these non-genuine signals, doing so is highly nontrivial. Firstly, the set of bad actors in the system is a very small fraction of all the buyers/sellers on the platform. Secondly, bad actors ``hide\" with the good ones, making them hard to detect. In this paper, we develop CONGCN, a context aware heterogeneous graph convolutional network to detect bad actors on a large heterogeneous graph. While our method is motivated by abuse detection in e-commerce, the method is applicable to other areas such as computational biology and finance, where large heterogeneous graphs are pervasive, and the amount of labeled data is very limited. We train CONGCN via novel sampling methods, and context aware message passing in a semi-supervised fashion to predict dishonest buyers and sellers in e-commerce. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective, beating several baselines; generalizable to an inductive setting and highly scalable",

            "title": "Modeling and Evaluation of Clustering Patient Care into Bubbles",
            "abstract": "COVID-19 has caused an enormous burden on healthcare facilities around the world. Cohorting patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) into \u201cbubbles\u201d has been proposed as an infection-control mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel and flexible model for clustering patient care in healthcare facilities into bubbles in order to minimize infection spread. Our model aims to control a variety of costs to patients/residents and HCPs so as to avoid hidden, downstream adverse effects of clustering patient care. This model leads to a discrete optimization problem that we call the BUBBLECLUSTERING problem. This problem takes as input a temporal visit graph, representing HCP mobility, including visits by HCPs to patient/resident rooms. The output of the problem is a rewired visit graph, obtained by partitioning HCPs and patient rooms into bubbles and rewiring HCP visits to patient rooms so that patient-care is largely confined to the constructed bubbles. Even though the BUBBLECLUSTERING problem is intractable in general, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem that can be solved optimally for problem instances that arise from typical hospital units and long-term-care facilities. We call our overall solution approach Cost-aware Rewiring of Networks (CoRN). We evaluate CoRN using fine-grained-movement data from a hospital-medical-intensive-care unit as well as two long-term-care facilities. These data were obtained using sensor systems we built and deployed. The main takeaway from our experimental results is that it is possible to use CoRN to substantially reduce infection spread by cohorting patients and HCPs without sacrificing patient-care, and with minimal excess costs to HCPs in terms of time and distances traveled during a shift.",

            "title": "Risk-aware Temporal Cascade Reconstruction to Detect Asymptomatic Cases : For the CDC MInD Healthcare Network",
            "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of detecting asymptomatic cases in a temporal contact network in which multiple outbreaks have occurred. For many infections, asymptomatic cases present a major obstacle to obtaining a precise understanding of infection-spread. We show that the key to detecting asymptomatic cases well, is taking into account both individual risk as well as the likelihood of disease-flow along edges. Most related research has ignored the interplay between these dual aspects influencing disease-spread. We take both aspects into account by formulating the asymptomatic case detection problem as a Directed Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (DIRECTED PCST) problem. We present an approximation-preserving reduction from this problem to the Directed Steiner Tree problem and use this reduction to obtain scalable algorithms for the DIRECTED PCST problem. Using these algorithms, we solve instances with more than 1.5M edges obtained from both synthetic and actual fine-grained hospital data. On synthetic data, we demonstrate that our detection methods significantly outperform various baselines (with a gain of $3.6 \\times$). As an application of our methods, we use a measure of exposure to detected asymptomatic Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection (CDI) cases as an additional feature for the important task of predicting symptomatic CDI cases. In this application, our method outperforms all baselines, including those that don\u2019t use asymptomatic CDI cases as a feature and those that use other methods for detecting asymptomatic CDI cases. We also demonstrate that the solutions returned by our approach are clinically meaningful by presenting a case study.",
