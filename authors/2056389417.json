            "title": "Communication-Free Distributed GNN Training with Vertex Cut",
            "abstract": "Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on real-world graphs consisting of billions of nodes and edges is quite challenging, primarily due to the substantial memory needed to store the graph and its intermediate node and edge features, and there is a pressing need to speed up the training process. A common approach to achieve speed up is to divide the graph into many smaller subgraphs, which are then distributed across multiple GPUs in one or more machines and processed in parallel. However, existing distributed methods require frequent and substantial cross-GPU communication, leading to significant time overhead and progressively diminishing scalability. Here, we introduce CoFree-GNN, a novel distributed GNN training framework that significantly speeds up the training process by implementing communication-free training. The framework utilizes a Vertex Cut partitioning, i.e., rather than partitioning the graph by cutting the edges between partitions, the Vertex Cut partitions the edges and duplicates the node information to preserve the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework maintains high model accuracy by incorporating a reweighting mechanism to handle a distorted graph distribution that arises from the duplicated nodes. We also propose a modified DropEdge technique to further speed up the training process. Using an extensive set of experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate that CoFree-GNN speeds up the GNN training process by up to 10 times over the existing state-of-the-art GNN training approaches.",

            "title": "A New Method for Overlapping Community Detection based on Complete Subgraph and Label Propagation",
            "abstract": "Overlapping community discovery can help analyze and understand complex network, it has become a hot topic of data mining research. This paper proposes an overlapping community detection algorithm based on complete subgraph and label propagation (OCDSLP). The algorithm first searches for complete subgraph and allocates unique labels for each subgraph to achieve fast label preprocessing. Then it updates each label by observing the adjacent node labels of each node. The concept of contact frequency is also proposed to help Label selection which reduces the random propagation probability of labels, and finally divides the community through the distribution of labels in the network. This paper selects two standard datasets for experiments. The results show that the OCDSLP algorithm has better algorithm stability and time performance while maintaining the same quality of community discovery as the COPRA algorithm.",
