The application of these principles to a new open-architecture user interface system, Views, is then described.",

            "title": "Management of Big Textual Data in Qualitative Research: Organizing the Relationships in a Typology based on Logical Properties",
            "abstract": "In structured indexes, classification systems, thesauri, conceptual structures or semantic networks, relationships are too often vague. For instance, in terminology, the relationships between concepts are often reduced to the distinction established by standard between hierarchical relationships (genus-species relationships and part/whole relationships) and non-hierarchical relationships (\"time, space, causal relationships, etc.\"). The semantics of relationships are vague because the principal users of these relationships are industrial actors (translators of technical handbooks, terminologists, data-processing specialists, etc.). Nevertheless, the consistency of the models built must always be guaranteed... One possible approach to this problem consists in organizing the relationships in a typology based on logical properties. For instance, we typically use only the general relation \"Is-a\". It is too vague. We assume that general relation \"Is-a\" is characterized by asymmetry. This asymmetry is specified in: (1) the belonging of one individualizable entity to a distributive class, (2) Inclusion among distributive classes and (3) relation part of (or \"composition\"). With the view to better designing the knowledge structures underlying the concepts of a field, and more specifically, the indexing of documents and/or information retrieval, we propose a structured set of relationships, based on a linguistic model, the Applicative and Cognitive Grammar (ACG) of Jean-Pierre Descles [7], [8]. This model was extended to terminology by Christophe Jouis [32], and applied by Widad Mustafa and Christophe Jouis, [33], [34], [35] and [36].",
