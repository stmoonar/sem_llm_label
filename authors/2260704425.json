            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Satellite image segmentation is crucial in various fields, but acquiring a large amount of labeled data can be challenging. Often, remote sensing images are unlabeled due to the high cost of manual labeling, which hampers training effectiveness and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a spatially and temporally informed graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for satellite image segmentation based on Poisson learning. The main difference to traditional Poisson learning is that our distance function that we use to compute similarity between pixels considers spectral, spatial, and temporal information. Experimental results on the Sentinel-2 time series demonstrate that our approach outperforms other traditional approaches, achieving robust performance in remote sensing image segmentation, especially at a very low label rate.",

            "title": "Synthetic Geosocial Network Generation",
            "abstract": "Generating synthetic social networks is an important task for many problems that study humans, their behavior, and their interactions. Geosocial networks enrich social networks with location information. Commonly used models to generate synthetic social networks include the classical Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, Barab\u00e1si-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz models. However, these classic social network models do not consider the location of individuals. Real-world geosocial networks do exhibit a strong spatial autocorrelation, thus having a higher likelihood of a social connection between agents that are spatially close. As such, recent variants of the three classical models have been proposed to consider location information. Yet, these existing solutions assume that individuals are located on a uniform lattice and exhibit certain limitations when applied to real-world data that exhibits clusters. In this work, we discuss these limitations and propose new approaches to extend the three classic social network generation models to geosocial networks. Our experiments show that our generated synthetic geosocial networks address the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art models and generate realistic geosocial networks that exhibit high similarity to real-world geosocial networks.",

Using spatial computing for pandemic preparedness has also been highlighted as a major application of mobility data science [16]. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SIGSPATIAL community rapidly published ideas to improve our understanding of the spread of the virus in two SIGSPATIAL Special Newsletter Issues in March and July 2020 [28, 29]. These efforts led to the 1st and 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Spatial Computing for Epidemiology [5, 4] (formerly called Workshop on Modeling and Understanding the Spread of COVID-19 in 2020) which has provided authors of these newsletter articles a forum to present and discuss their solutions. Including both work published at the SIGSPATIAL Special Newsletter and regular peer-reviewed submissions, this workshop included topics such as the collection of large spatiotemporal datasets [20], leveraging data mining and spatial analysis techniques to analyze and visualize such data [2, 12, 25, 21, 11, 9, 8, 3], developing predictive spatial models and simulations [6, 1, 19, 13, 24, 10, 23, 14], and employing novel technologies towards contact tracing and surveillance [17, 26].",

            "title": "Probabilistic Counting in Uncertain Spatial Databases Using Generating Functions",
            "abstract": "Location data is inherently uncertain for many reasons including 1) imprecise location measurements, 2) obsolete observations that are often interpolated, and 3) deliberate obfuscation to preserve location privacy. What makes handling uncertainty data challenging is the exponentially large number of possible worlds, which lies in O(2^N), for a database having N uncertain objects as it has been shown that general query processing in uncertain spatial data is NP-hard. Many applications using spatial data require counting the number of spatial objects within a region. An example is the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query: Asking if an object A is a kNN of another object Q is equivalent to asking whether no more than k-1 objects are located inside the circle centered at Q having a radius equal to the distance between Q and A. For this problem of counting uncertain objects within a region, an efficient solution based on Generating Functions has been proposed and successfully used in many applications, including range-count queries, kNN queries, distance ranking queries, and reverse kNN queries. This spatial gem describes the generating function technique for probabilistic counting and provides examples and implementation details.",
