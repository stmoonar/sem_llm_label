            "title": "Automatic Transformation Search Against Deep Leakage From Gradients",
            "abstract": "Collaborative learning has gained great popularity due to its benefit of data privacy protection: participants can jointly train a Deep Learning model without sharing their training sets. However, recent works discovered that an adversary can fully recover the sensitive training samples from the shared gradients. Such reconstruction attacks pose severe threats to collaborative learning. Hence, effective mitigation solutions are urgently desired. In this paper, we systematically analyze existing reconstruction attacks and propose to leverage data augmentation to defeat these attacks: by preprocessing sensitive images with carefully-selected transformation policies, it becomes infeasible for the adversary to extract training samples from the corresponding gradients. We first design two new metrics to quantify the impacts of transformations on data privacy and model usability. With the two metrics, we design a novel search method to automatically discover qualified policies from a given data augmentation library. Our defense method can be further combined with existing collaborative training systems without modifying the training protocols. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various system settings. Evaluation results demonstrate that the policies discovered by our method can defeat state-of-the-art reconstruction attacks in collaborative learning, with high efficiency and negligible impact on the model performance.",

            "title": "User-Controllable Arbitrary Style Transfer via Entropy Regularization",
            "abstract": "Ensuring the overall end-user experience is a challenging task in arbitrary style transfer (AST) due to the subjective nature of style transfer quality. A good practice is to provide users many instead of one AST result. However, existing approaches require to run multiple AST models or inference a diversified AST (DAST) solution multiple times, and thus they are either slow in speed or limited in diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel solution ensuring both efficiency and diversity for generating multiple user-controllable AST results by systematically modulating AST behavior at run-time. We begin with reformulating three prominent AST methods into a unified assign-and-mix problem and discover that the entropies of their assignment matrices exhibit a large variance. We then solve the unified problem in an optimal transport framework using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm with a user input \u03b5 to control the said entropy and thus modulate stylization. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution, with speed and stylization quality comparable to or better than existing AST and significantly more diverse than previous DAST works.

            "abstract": "Multi-turn textual feedback-based fashion image retrieval focuses on a real-world setting, where users can iteratively provide information to refine retrieval results until they find an item that fits all their requirements. In this work, we present a novel memory-based method, called FashionNTM, for such a multi-turn system. Our framework incorporates a new Cascaded Memory Neural Turing Machine (CM-NTM) approach for implicit state management, thereby learning to integrate information across all past turns to retrieve new images, for a given turn. Unlike vanilla Neural Turing Machine (NTM), our CM-NTM operates on multiple inputs, which interact with their respective memories via individual read and write heads, to learn complex relationships. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithm by 50.5%, on Multi-turn FashionIQ [60] \u2013 the only existing multi-turn fashion dataset currently, in addition to having a relative improvement of 12.6% on Multi-turn Shoes \u2013 an extension of the singleturn Shoes dataset [5] that we created in this work. Further analysis of the model in a real-world interactive setting demonstrates two important capabilities of our model \u2013 memory retention across turns, and agnosticity to turn order for non-contradictory feedback. Finally, user study results show that images retrieved by FashionNTM were favored by 83.1% over other multi-turn models.",
