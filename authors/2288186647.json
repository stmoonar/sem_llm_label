            "abstract": "The previously introduced Modular Ontology Modeling methodology (MOMo) attempts to mimic the human analogical process by using modular patterns to assemble more complex concepts. To support this, MOMo organizes organizes ontology design patterns into design libraries, which are programmatically queryable, to support accelerated ontology development, for both human and automated processes. However, a major bottleneck to large-scale deployment of MOMo is the (to-date) limited availability of ready-to-use ontology design patterns. At the same time, Large Language Models have quickly become a source of common knowledge and, in some cases, replacing search engines for questions. In this paper, we thus present a collection of 104 ontology design patterns representing often occurring nouns, curated from the common-sense knowledge available in LLMs, organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library ready for use with MOMo.",
