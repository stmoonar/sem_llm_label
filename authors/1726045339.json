            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

            "abstract": "Bundle Recommendation (BR) aims at recommending bundled items on online content or e-commerce platform, such as song lists on a music platform or book lists on a reading website. Several graph based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on BR task. But their performance is still sub-optimal, since the data sparsity problem tends to be more severe in real bundle recommendation scenarios, which limits graph-based models from more sufficient learning. In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning paradigm called Counterfactual Learning for Bundle Recommendation (CLBR) to mitigate the impact of data sparsity problem and improve bundle recommendation. Our paradigm consists of two main parts: counterfactual data augmentation and counterfactual constraint. The main idea of our paradigm lies in answering the counterfactual questions:\"What would a user interact with if his/her interaction history changes?\"\"What would a user interact with if the bundle-item affiliation relations change?\"In counterfactual data augmentation, we design a heuristic sampler to generate counterfactual graph views for graph-based models, which has better noise controlling than the stochastic sampler. We further propose counterfactual loss to constrain model learning for mitigating the effects of residual noise in augmented data and achieving more sufficient model optimization. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates the rationality of our design. Extensive experiments of BR models applied with our paradigm on two real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the paradigm.",

Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario, that is for many users who resort to CRS, they might not have a clear idea about what they really like. Specifically, the user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable attribute instances (e.g. black and red) of one attribute type. Therefore, the users could show their preferences over items under multiple combinations of attribute instances rather than a single item with unique combination of all attribute instances. As a result, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with the new CRS learning setting, in this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning (MCMIPL). In order to obtain user preferences more efficiently, the agent generates multiple choice questions rather than binary yes/no ones on specific attribute instance. Furthermore, we propose a union set strategy to select candidate items instead of existing intersection set strategy in order to overcome over-filtering items during the conversation. Finally, we design a Multi-Interest Policy Learning (MIPL) module, which utilizes captured multiple interests of the user to decide next action, either asking attribute instances or recommending items. Extensive experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for the proposed MIMCR setting.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a challenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works rely on item transition patterns, and neglect user historical sessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized recommendation. And existing personalized session-based recommenders are limited to sessions of the current user, and ignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical sessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global Graph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all sessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the current and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions over all sessions from users, our global graph contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global co-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions comprehensively, we propose a graph augmented preference encoder to learn the session representation. Specifically, we design a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on heterogeneous global graph to learn long-term user preference and item representations with rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Personalized Session Encoder to combine the general user preference and temporal interest of the current session to generate the personalized session representation for recommendation.

Specifically, we build a multi-behavior global item transition graph based on all sessions involving all interaction types. Based on the global graph, MGCNet attaches the global interest representation to final item representation based on local contextual intention to address the limitation (iii). In the end, we utilize the next behavior information explicitly to guide the learning of general interest and current intention for SBR.

            "abstract": "Social recommendation based on social network has achieved great success in improving the performance of the recommendation system. Since social network (user-user relations) and user-item interactions are both naturally represented as graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have thus been widely applied for social recommendation. Despite the superior performance of existing GNNs-based methods, there are still several severe limitations: (i) Few existing GNNs-based methods have considered a single heterogeneous global graph which takes into account user-user relations, user-item interactions, and item-item similarities simultaneously. That may lead to a lack of complex semantic information and rich topological information when encoding users and items based on GNN. (ii) Furthermore, previous methods tend to overlook the reliability of the original user-user relations which may be noisy and incomplete. (iii) More importantly, the item-item connections established by a few existing methods merely using initial rating attributes or extra attributes (such as category) of items, may be inaccurate or sub-optimal with respect to social recommendation. In order to address these issues, we propose an end-to-end heterogeneous global graph learning framework, namely Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GL-HGNN) for social recommendation. GL-HGNN aims to learn a heterogeneous global graph that makes full use of user-user relations, user-item interactions and item-item similarities in a unified perspective. To this end, we design a Graph Learner (GL) method to learn and optimize user-user and item-item connections separately. Moreover, we employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to capture the high-order complex semantic relations from our learned heterogeneous global graph. To scale up the computation of graph learning, we further present the Anchor-based Graph Learner (AGL) to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario, that is for many users who resort to CRS, they might not have a clear idea about what they really like. Specifically, the user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. color) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. brand), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable attribute instances (e.g. black and red) of one attribute type. Therefore, the users could show their preferences over items under multiple combinations of attribute instances rather than a single item with unique combination of all attribute instances. As a result, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with the new CRS learning setting, in this paper, we propose a novel learning framework namely, Multi-Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning (MCMIPL). In order to obtain user preferences more efficiently, the agent generates multi-choice questions rather than binary yes/no ones on specific attribute instance. Furthermore, we propose a union set strategy to select candidate items instead of",

            "abstract": "Recently, news recommendation has attracted great attentions as it helps users quickly find news satisfying their preferences. It is important to note that both the interests of users and the news readers change over time. Although existing news recommendation methods have achieved promising performance, they treat the representation of news as static and ignore the dynamic nature of news, i.e. news attracts different users at different times and thus may have different features. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Attentive Convolution Neural Network (DACNN) to solve the above issues. Specifically, we extract features from the clicked history of news as dynamic representations of news and from the browsed history of users as dynamic representations of users. Moreover, we propose to employ a shared CNN with inner-attention to learn user-item interactions from the dynamic representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets and have proved the superiority of our model.",
