            "title": "Iteration of Thought: Leveraging Inner Dialogue for Autonomous Large Language Model Reasoning",
            "abstract": "Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating\"thought\"-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit 2022: A Roadmap Revolution",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

While similarity can be measured using off-the-shelf distance functions, they may fail to capture the inherent meaning of similarity, which tends to depend on the underlying data and task. Moreover, conventional distance functions limit the space of similarity measures to be symmetric and do not directly allow comparing objects from different spaces. We propose using quantum networks (GQSim) for learning task-dependent (a)symmetric similarity between data that need not have the same dimensionality. We analyze the properties of such similarity function analytically (for a simple case) and numerically (for a complex case) and showthat these similarity measures can extract salient features of the data. We also demonstrate that the similarity measure derived using this technique is $(\\epsilon,\\gamma,\\tau)$-good, resulting in theoretically guaranteed performance. Finally, we conclude by applying this technique for three relevant applications - Classification, Graph Completion, Generative modeling.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic data generation has proven to be a promising solution for addressing data availability issues in various domains. Even more challenging is the generation of synthetic time series data, where one has to preserve temporal dynamics, i.e. , the generated time series must respect the original relationships between variables across time. Recently proposed techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and quantum-GANs lack the ability to attend to the time series speci\ufb01c temporal correlations adequately. We propose using the inherent nature of quantum computers to simulate quantum dynamics as a technique to encode such features. We start by assuming that a given time series can be generated by a quantum process, after which we proceed to learn that quantum process using quantum machine learning. We then use the learned model to generate out-of-sample time series and show that it captures unique and complex features of the learned time series. We also study the class of time series that can be modeled using this technique. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum machine.",

Our proposed algorithm involves preparing an initial state, representing the option price, and then evolving it using existing imaginary time simulation algorithms. This way of pricing options boils down to mapping an initial option price to a quantum state and then simulating the time dependence in Wick's imaginary time space. We numerically verify our algorithm for European options using a particular imaginary time evolution algorithm as proof of concept and show how it can be extended to path dependent options like Asian options. As the proposed method uses a hybrid variational algorithm, it is bound to be relevant for near-term quantum computers.",

Introducing constraints in such combinatorial optimization problems poses a major challenge in the extensions of QAOA to support relevant larger scale problems. In this paper, we introduce a quantum machine learning approach to learn the mixer Hamiltonian that is required to hard constrain the search subspace. We show that this method can be used for encoding any general form of constraints. By using a form of an adaptable ansatz, one can directly plug the learnt unitary into the QAOA framework. This procedure gives the flexibility to control the depth of the circuit at the cost of accuracy of enforcing the constraint, thus having immediate application in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We also develop an intuitive metric that uses Wasserstein distance to assess the performance of general approximate optimization algorithms with/without constrains. Finally using this metric, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",
