            "abstract": "Learning to hash is of particular interest in information retrieval for large-scale data due to its high efficiency and effectiveness. Most studies in hashing concentrate on constructing new hashing models, but rarely touch the correlation and redundancy between hash bits derived. In this article, we first introduce a general schema of hash bit reduction to derive compact and informative binary codes for hashing techniques. Further, we take locality sensitive hashing, one of the most widely-used hashing methods, as an example and propose a novel and two-stage binary code refinement method under the reduction schema. Specifically, the proposed method includes two stages, i.e., bit evaluation and bit refinement. The former stage aims to initially extract a small portion of informative hash bits in terms of their importance and quality evaluated by bit balance and similarity preservation. Then, the representation capabilities of the reduced hash bits are strengthened further by refining their binary values. The purpose of refinement is to lessen the correlations and redundancies between the reduced bits, making themselves more discriminative. The experimental results on three widely-used data collections confirm the effectiveness of the proposed bit reduction method and its superiority over the state-of-the-art hashing methods, as well as a bit selection method.",

In this brief, a normalized subband adaptive filtering algorithm based on censored regression (CR-NSAF) is proposed, which is derived by using the conditional expectation of the desired signal. However, as a traditional subband algorithm, the CR-NSAF algorithm still suffers from the problem that the computational complexity increases as the number of subbands increases. Thus, a low-complexity CR-NSAF algorithm (SCR-NSAF) is proposed, which reduces the computational complexity by using the subband selection method. The simulation results and analysis show that the proposed algorithms achieve superior convergence performance in comparison to the traditional algorithm under the censored regression (CR) environment.",

            "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising solution to enhance the computing capability of resource-limited networks. A fundamental problem in MEC is efficiently offloading tasks from user devices to edge servers. However, there still exists a gap to deploy in real-world environments: 1) traditional centralized approaches needs complete information of edge network, ignoring the communication costs generated by synchronization, 2) previous works do not consider concurrent computation on edge servers, which may cause dynamic changes in the environment, and 3) the scheduling algorithm should deliver individualized decisions for different users independently and with high efficiency To solve this mismatch, we studied a multi-user task offloading problem where user devices make offloading decisions independently. We consider the concurrent execution of tasks and formulate a non-divisible and delay-aware task offloading problem to jointly minimize the dropped task ratio and long-term latency. We propose a decentralized task scheduling algorithm based on DRL that makes offloading decisions without knowing the information of other user devices. We employ Double-DQN, Dueling-DQN, Prioritized Replay Memory, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) techniques to improve the algorithm's performance. The results of simulation experiments show that our method can significantly reduce the long-term latency and dropped task ratio compared to the baseline algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Estimating and monitoring the sleep states at home using ubiquitous infrared (IR) visual camera sensors is an essential healthcare problem. Currently, the common challenge of using IoT sensors to predict sleep stages is the \u201csemantic gap\u201d between the IoT sensory signals and the medical signals, where fewer correlations between IoT sensory signals and the sleep stage labels are observed. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel systematic and methodological IoT design (IoT-V2E) to retrieve the most similar electroencephalogram signal representations in a database given an IR visual query for sleep-related analysis. Specifically, we make the following specific contributions: 1) we collect a cross-modal retrieval data set, including the IR sensory signals and the synchronized Polysomnography signals with sleep stage ground-truth annotations; 2) we propose a novel uncertainty-aware hashing retrieval method, presenting superior performances, sufficient interpretability, and high memory efficiency; 3) our method achieves the state-of-the-art sleep stage retrieval results and provides the uncertainty for each query in the inference; and 4) most importantly, our system is evaluated to be able to assist the physicians not only in diagnosing sleep-related diseases but also finding the subjects with the most similar sleep patterns.

More specifically, two primary improvements are implemented compared with the existing GVF methods. The first improvement involves designing a variable property vector deforming the elliptic integral curves to straight lines pointing to the target point, which prevents the robot from detouring. The other improvement is to construct an adjustable parametric function for blending the attractive field and repulsive field so as to refine the obstacle avoidance performance. Meanwhile, a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO) based steering controller and a sliding mode based approaching controller are provided to enhance the capability of disturbance rejection. Furthermore, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient in the multi-obstacle environment in terms of tracking the virtual dynamic target and the dynamic quadruped robot target even in the environment with uncertain disturbances.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive spread of smart mobile devices, Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has been becoming a promising paradigm, by which a platform can coordinate a group of workers to complete large-scale data collection tasks using their mobile devices. In this paper, we investigate the incentive mechanism design in MCS systems, taking the freshness of collected data and social benefits into consideration. First, the Age of Information (AoI) metric is introduced to measure the freshness of data. Then, we model the incentive mechanism design with AoI guarantees as an incomplete information two-stage Stackelberg game with multiple constraints. Next, we consider the scenario that all participants share the public utility function parameters of the Stackelberg game. By deriving the optimal remuneration paid by the platform and the optimal data update frequency for each worker, and proving the existence of a unique Stackelberg equilibrium, we propose an AoI-guaranteed Incentive Mechanism (AIM) that enables the platform and all workers to maximize their utilities simultaneously. Furthermore, we extend AIM to a general scenario where each participant has no prior knowledge of the utility function parameters of the game. By resorting to the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique and modeling the two-stage Stackelberg game as a Markov decision process, we propose a DRL-based Incentive Mechanism (DIM) with AoI guarantees, which makes each participant effectively seek its optimal strategy through trial and error. Meanwhile, the system can guarantee that the AoI values of all data uploaded to the platform are not larger than a given threshold. Finally, numerical experiments on real-world traces are conducted to validate the efficacy and efficiency of AIM and DIM.",

It has competitive search performance when the number of generated hash bits is large, reversely bringing adverse dilemmas for its wide applications. The first purpose of this work is to introduce a novel hash bit reduction schema for hashing techniques to derive shorter binary codes, which has not yet received sufficient concerns. To briefly show how the reduction schema works, the second purpose is to present an effective bit reduction method for LSH under the reduction schema. Specifically, after the hash bits are generated by LSH, they will be put into bit pool as candidates. Then mutual information and data labels are exploited to measure the correlation and structural properties between the hash bits, respectively. Eventually, highly correlated and redundant hash bits can be distinguished and then removed accordingly, without deteriorating the performance greatly. The advantages of our reduction method include that it can not only reduce the number of hash bits effectively but also boost retrieval performance of LSH, making it more appealing and practical in real-world applications. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three public real-world datasets. The experimental results with representative bit selection methods and the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method has encouraging and competitive performance.",

            "abstract": "Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) can eliminate the negative effects of quantum noise, the major obstacle to the execution of quantum algorithms. However, realizing practical quantum error correction (QEC) requires resolving many challenges to implement a high-performance real-time decoding system. Many decoding algorithms have been proposed and optimized in the past few decades, of which neural network (NNs) based solutions have drawn an increasing amount of attention due to their high efficiency. Unfortunately, previous works on neural decoders are still at an early stage and have only relatively simple architectures, which makes them unsuitable for practical QEC. In this work, we propose a scalable, fast, and programmable neural decoding system to meet the requirements of FTQEC for rotated surface codes (RSC). Firstly, we propose a hardware-efficient NN decoding algorithm with relatively low complexity and high accuracy. Secondly, we develop a customized hardware decoder with architectural optimizations to reduce latency. Thirdly, our proposed programmable architecture boosts the scalability and flexibility of the decoder by maximizing parallelism. Fourthly, we build an FPGA-based decoding system with integrated control hardware for evaluation. Our $L=5$ ($L$ is the code distance) decoder achieves an extremely low decoding latency of 197 ns, and the $L=7$ configuration also requires only 1.136 $\\mu$s, both taking $2L$ rounds of syndrome measurements. The accuracy results of our system are close to minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM). Furthermore, our programmable architecture reduces hardware resource consumption by up to $3.0\\times$ with only a small latency loss. We validated our approach in real-world scenarios by conducting a proof-of-concept benchmark with practical noise models, including one derived from experimental data gathered from physical hardware.",

            "abstract": "This study proposes a simple method for multi-object tracking (MOT) of players in a badminton court. We leverage two off-the-shelf cameras, one on the top of the court and the other on the side of the court. The one on the top is to track players' trajectories, while the one on the side is to analyze the pixel features of players. By computing the correlations between adjacent frames and engaging the information of the two cameras, MOT of badminton players is obtained. This two-camera approach addresses the challenge of player occlusion and overlapping in a badminton court, providing player trajectory tracking and multi-angle analysis. The presented system offers insights into the positions and movements of badminton players, thus serving as a coaching or self-training tool for badminton players to improve their gaming strategies.",
