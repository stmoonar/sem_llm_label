            "abstract": "Text similarity measurement is a link between basic research such as text modeling and upper-level application research of text potential information. In order to improve the accuracy of text similarity measurement, this paper proposes a semantic similarity calculation method integrating word2vec model and TF-IDF, and applies it to the density peak clustering of Chinese text data consulted by patients in online medical community. Experimental results show that the proposed similarity measurement method is superior to the traditional method. Furthermore, the study is among the first to apply the density peak clustering algorithm to online medical community, which offers a reference for how to find out user demands from medical text data in the big data environment.",

            "abstract": "Cloud services have been basically popularized in Europe and US, but in China especially in enterprise market the promotion of cloud services is quite difficult, it is necessary to explore the influencing factors of cloud services adoption. Combined with the unique characteristics of cloud storage service, we revised the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to evaluating the adoption of cloud storage service in China. Results of empirical study showed that perceived risk, personal innovativeness, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence had significant effects on adoption intention, and adoption intention and facilitating conditions had significant effects on adoption behavior.",

            "abstract": "In order to find out the key factors affecting the Information Technology (IT) absorptive capability of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), an empirical study is conducted in this paper. Based on the three-dimensional structure and the influence model of IT absorptive capability proposed by Cuiling Yu, and combined with the characteristics of SMEs, this paper proposes a new model of influence factors, and meanwhile makes an empirical study on the SMEs in Jilin province. Empirical results show that IT consulting, IT infrastructure and government support have significantly impacts on the three-dimension of SMEs' IT absorptive capability. On one hand, the paper reveals how the regions and industries as control variables influence the IT absorptive capacity of SMEs, on the other hand, the paper reveals that IT consulting has a special effect on IT absorptive capacity of SMEs.",

A matched-sample comparison group methodology, publicly available ratings and performance data from annual financial reports of listed companies are used to assess IT capability and firm performance. Our results indicate that firms with superior IT capability outperform a control sample of firms on a variety of long-term operational, growth and profitability performance measures. However, for the short-term performance, only operational performance outperforms, growth and profitability performance do not outperform.",
