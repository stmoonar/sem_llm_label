            "abstract": "In order to diagnose sleep problems, it is critical to correctly identify sleep stages which is a labor-intensive task. Due to rising data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computational power and storage, artificial intelligence has been more popular in recent years. Automated sleep staging through cardiac rhythm is one of the active research areas that has gained attention over the last decade. In this study, we review four recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods for automated sleep staging, datasets developed in recent years, and discuss their performance evaluations.",

            "abstract": "Social media platforms can expose influential trends in many aspects of everyday life. However, the movements they represent can be contaminated by disinformation. Social bots are one of the significant sources of disinformation in social media. Social bots can pose serious cyber threats to society and public opinion. This research aims to develop machine learning models to detect bots based on the extracted user's profile from a Tweet's text. Online users' profile shows the user's personal information, such as age, gender, education, and personality. In this work, the user's profile is constructed based on the user's online posts. This work's main contribution is three-fold: First, we aim to improve bot detection through machine learning models based on the user's personal information generated by the user's online comments. When comparing two online posts, the similarity of personal information makes it difficult to differentiate a bot from a human user. However, this research turns personal information similarity among two online posts into an advantage for the new bot detection model. The new proposed model for bot detection creates user profiles based on personal information such as age, personality, gender, education from users' online posts and introduces a machine learning model to detect social bots with high prediction accuracy based on personal information. Second, create a new public data set that shows the user's profile for more than 6900 Twitter accounts in the Cresci 2017 data set.",

These models avoid the drawbacks of using the traditional pipeline method. As contributions of our study to the other related works, we specifically survey JNERE techniques. The reason for not focusing on pipeline methods or other older techniques is the recent advances of JNERE methods in achieving the state-of-art results for most databases. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive report on the embedding techniques and datasets available for this task. Finally, we discuss the approaches and how they imnpoved the results.",

Detection of connected components is one of the analysis of graphs which is utilized as a sub-part in many graph algorithms, such as clustering. The goal of this paper is to propose a parallel preprocess algorithm with MapReduce to decrease graph volume for rapid detection of connected components. Suggested method is able to lessen the volume up to more than 99% quickly by just two rounds of MapReduce. Our evaluation shows that the combination of the preprocess with detection of connected components has a significant impact on: reduction of execution time up to 7 times, decrease in data transmission of processing nodes in network and MapReduce rounds.",

Automatic TBED mechanisms use machine learning approaches to create computational platforms automating the process of extracting emotions. TBED has a wide variety of applications in the area of artificial intelligence: Semantic analysis of documents and public messages related to terrorist attacks (to mitigate risks), automated analysis of historical corpora, and study of product reviews (to assess customer satisfaction).

Social bots are one of the main sources of misinformation in the COVID-19 pandemic but do social bots spread the fake and real news with the same ratio as human accounts on social media platforms? Can bot detection improve fake news detection on social media platforms? Who presents more fake news in the COVID-19 pandemic, Human or social bots? This work provides preliminary research results based on limited data to answer these questions, but it opens a new perspective on fake news detection and bot detection on online platforms. We use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) to create a new model for fake news detection. We use the transfer learning model to detect bot accounts in the COVID-19 data set. Then apply new features to improve the new fake news detection model in the COVID-19 data set.",
