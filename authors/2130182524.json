            "abstract": "Super-resolution semantic segmentation (SRSS) based on Convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot establish long-range dependencies due to limited receptive field, which limits the SRSS to obtain accurate high-resolution (HR) segmentation results from the low-resolution (LR) input images. In this paper, we design a Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS network that consists of two branches: Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS branch and super-resolution guided branch. In the Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS branch, Transformer extracts global context information from the feature map of the CNN, while skip connection is used to retain the local context information extracted from the CNN and combines both features to further improve the segmentation performance. In addition, the super-resolution guided branch is designed to supplement rich structure information and guide the semantic segmentation (SS). We test the proposed method on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark data set, and our network is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Graph convolutional network (GCN) gains increasing attention in the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification by the ability to flexibly capture arbitrarily irregular objects. However, due to expensive computation, the graph construction is usually based on superpixel-wise nodes, which ignore the subtle pixel-wise features. In contrast, the convolution neural network (CNN) can mine pixel-wise spectral-spatial features but is limited to capturing local features in small square windows. In this paper, we design a new CNN and GCN collaborative network to simultaneously introduce pixel- and patch-wise contextual information. Concretely, we use the depthwise separable convolution to perform pixel-wise local feature extraction. To further mine the long-range contextual information between land covers, we concatenate a GCN. Finally, we further fuse the complementary features and decode them to obtain the classification map. Extensive experiments reveal that our method achieves competitive performance.",

            "title": "Focal Cosine Metric and Adaptive Attention Module for Remote Sensing Scene Classification With Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in remote sensing (RS) scene classification tasks due to their remarkable feature representation and inference capability. The complexity of RS images not only brings the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class diversity, but also introduces the problem that category-relevant regions are insufficiently prominent in feature extraction. Siamese CNNs with feature similarity measurement are chosen in some applications to overcome the former issue, but most ignore the randomness of input sample pairs. This makes the Siamese CNNs not focus enough on challenging samples, which limits the training efficiency. We propose the focal cosine metric (FCM) block that combines the cosine similarity metric and the threshold control to achieve sample selection, thereby completing network learning more efficiently. FCM only permits the misclassified focal samples to participate in similarity measurement based on Siamese CNN. It flexibly mitigates the misclassification caused by the high inter-class similarity and large intra-class diversity. Moreover, the adaptive attention (AA) module is designed to stress the pivotal target regions and assist in the similarity measurement of Siamese CNN. This is realized by adaptively assigning high weights to key targets with learnable guided vectors. It enables the model to focus on the details of intra-class similarities or inter-class differences in sample pairs, and thus reduces the difficulty of model optimization. Encouraging experimental results on three public data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel Siamese CNN-based method with FCM and AA and show its superiority compared to other state-of-the-art scene classification methods.",

            "title": "Triplet-Metric-Guided Multi-Scale Attention for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network",
            "abstract": "Remote sensing image scene classification (RSISC) plays a vital role in remote sensing applications. Recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven the development of RSISC. However, these approaches are not adequate considering the contributions of different features to the global decision. In this paper, triplet-metric-guided multi-scale attention (TMGMA) is proposed to enhance task-related salient features and suppress task-unrelated salient and redundant features. Firstly, we design the multi-scale attention module (MAM) guided by multi-scale feature maps to adaptively emphasize salient features and simultaneously fuse multi-scale and contextual information. Secondly, to capture task-related salient features, we use the triplet metric (TM) to optimize the learning of MAM under the constraint that the distance of the negative pair is supposed to be larger than the distance of the positive pair. Notably, the MAM and TM collaboration can enforce learning a more discriminative model. As such, our TMGMA can avoid the classification confusion caused by only using the attention mechanism and the excessive correction of features caused by only using the metric learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TMGMA outperforms the ResNet50 baseline by 0.47% on the UC Merced, 1.46% on the AID, and 1.55% on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, respectively, and achieves performance that is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks for e-commerce search engines. As search becomes more personalized, it is necessary to capture the user interest from rich behavior data. Existing user behavior modeling algorithms develop different attention mechanisms to emphasize query-relevant behaviors and suppress irrelevant ones. Despite being extensively studied, these attentions still suffer from two limitations. First, conventional attentions mostly limit the attention field only to a single user's behaviors, which is not suitable in e-commerce where users often hunt for new demands that are irrelevant to any historical behaviors. Second, these attentions are usually biased towards frequent behaviors, which is unreasonable since high frequency does not necessarily indicate great importance. To tackle the two limitations, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed Kalman Filtering Attention (KFAtt), that considers the weighted pooling in attention as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. By incorporating a priori, KFAtt resorts to global statistics when few user behaviors are relevant. Moreover, a frequency capping mechanism is incorporated to correct the bias towards frequent behaviors. Offline experiments on both benchmark and a 10 billion scale real production dataset, together with an Online A/B test, show that KFAtt outperforms all compared state-of-the-arts. KFAtt has been deployed in the ranking system of a leading e commerce website, serving the main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users everyday.",
