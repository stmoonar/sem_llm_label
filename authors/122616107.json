            "title": "Live Demonstration: An Integrated Computing and Communication Platform for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving",
            "abstract": "Perception, computing and communication are usually decoupled in today\u2019s vehicle-road coordination applications, which significantly adds to the system delay and cost. In contrast, we showcase a platform that integrates perception, communication and computing to provide timely roadside bird-eye-view (BEV) maps to vehicles for vision fusion. A neural processing unit and a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) wireless baseband are both implemented on FPGA.",
