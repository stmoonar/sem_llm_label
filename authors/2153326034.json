            "title": "Normalizing Flow-based Neural Process for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), as a structured form of knowledge representation, have been widely applied in the real world. Recently, few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), which aims to predict missing facts for unseen relations with few-shot associated facts, has attracted increasing attention from practitioners and researchers. However, existing FKGC methods are based on metric learning or meta-learning, which often suffer from the out-of-distribution and overfitting problems. Meanwhile, they are incompetent at estimating uncertainties in predictions, which is critically important as model predictions could be very unreliable in few-shot settings. Furthermore, most of them cannot handle complex relations and ignore path information in KGs, which largely limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a normalizing flow-based neural process for few-shot knowledge graph completion (NP-FKGC). Specifically, we unify normalizing flows and neural processes to model a complex distribution of KG completion functions. This offers a novel way to predict facts for few-shot relations while estimating the uncertainty. Then, we propose a stochastic ManifoldE decoder to incorporate the neural process and handle complex relations in few-shot settings. To further improve performance, we introduce an attentive relation path-based graph neural network to capture path information in KGs. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the existing FKGC methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

            "abstract": "Graph neural architecture search (NAS) has gained popularity in automatically designing powerful graph neural networks (GNNs) with relieving human efforts. However, existing graph NAS methods mainly work under the homophily assumption and overlook another important graph property, i.e., heterophily, which exists widely in various real-world applications. To date, automated heterophilic graph learning with NAS is still a research blank to be filled in. Due to the complexity and variety of heterophilic graphs, the critical challenge of heterophilic graph NAS mainly lies in developing the heterophily-specific search space and strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel automated graph neural network on heterophilic graphs, namely Auto-HeG, to automatically build heterophilic GNN models with expressive learning abilities. Specifically, Auto-HeG incorporates heterophily into all stages of automatic heterophilic graph learning, including search space design, supernet training, and architecture selection. Through the diverse message-passing scheme with joint micro-level and macro-level designs, we first build a comprehensive heterophilic GNN search space, enabling Auto-HeG to integrate complex and various heterophily of graphs. With a progressive supernet training strategy, we dynamically shrink the initial search space according to layer-wise variation of heterophily, resulting in a compact and efficient supernet. Taking a heterophily-aware distance criterion as the guidance, we conduct heterophilic architecture selection in the leave-one-out pattern, so that specialized and expressive heterophilic GNN architectures can be derived. Extensive experiments illustrate the superiority of Auto-HeG in developing excellent heterophilic GNNs to human-designed models and graph NAS models.",

            "abstract": "While graph neural networks (GNNs) dominate the state-of-the-art for exploring graphs in real-world applications, they have been shown to be vulnerable to a growing number of privacy attacks. For instance, link stealing is a well-known membership inference attack (MIA) on edges that infers the presence of an edge in a GNN\u2019s training graph. Recent studies on independent and identically distributed data (e.g., images) have empirically demonstrated that individuals from different groups suffer from different levels of privacy risks to MIAs, i.e., uneven vulnerability. However, theoretical evidence for such uneven vulnerability is missing. In this paper, we first present theoretical evidence of the uneven vulnerability of GNNs to link stealing attacks, which lays the foundation for demystifying such uneven risks among different groups of edges. We further demonstrate a group-based attack paradigm to expose the practical privacy harm to GNN users derived from the uneven vulnerability of edges. Finally, we empirically validate the existence of obvious uneven vulnerability on ten real-world datasets (e.g., about 25% AUC difference between different groups in the Credit graph). Compared with existing methods, the outperformance of our group-based attack paradigm confirms that cus-tomising different strategies for different groups results in more effective privacy attacks.",

            "abstract": "Real-world graphs generally have only one kind of tendency in their connections. These connections are either homophily-prone or heterophily-prone. While graphs with homophily-prone edges tend to connect nodes with the same class (i.e., intra-class nodes), heterophily-prone edges tend to build relationships between nodes with different classes (i.e., inter-class nodes). Existing GNNs only take the original graph during training. The problem with this approach is that it forgets to take into consideration the ``missing-half\"structural information, that is, heterophily-prone topology for homophily-prone graphs and homophily-prone topology for heterophily-prone graphs. In our paper, we introduce Graph cOmplementAry Learning, namely GOAL, which consists of two components: graph complementation and complemented graph convolution. The first component finds the missing-half structural information for a given graph to complement it. The complemented graph has two sets of graphs including both homophily- and heterophily-prone topology. In the latter component, to handle complemented graphs, we design a new graph convolution from the perspective of optimisation. The experiment results show that GOAL consistently outperforms all baselines in eight real-world datasets.",

            "abstract": "Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph GegenConv (TGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Temporal characteristics are prominently evident in a substantial volume of knowledge, which underscores the pivotal role of Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) in both academia and industry. However, TKGs often suffer from incompleteness for three main reasons: the continuous emergence of new knowledge, the weakness of the algorithm for extracting structured information from unstructured data, and the lack of information in the source dataset. Thus, the task of Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) has attracted increasing attention, aiming to predict missing items based on the available information. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGC methods and their details. Specifically, this paper mainly consists of three components, namely, 1)Background, which covers the preliminaries of TKGC methods, loss functions required for training, as well as the dataset and evaluation protocol; 2)Interpolation, that estimates and predicts the missing elements or set of elements through the relevant available information. It further categorizes related TKGC methods based on how to process temporal information; 3)Extrapolation, which typically focuses on continuous TKGs and predicts future events, and then classifies all extrapolation methods based on the algorithms they utilize. We further pinpoint the challenges and discuss future research directions of TKGC.",

However, as people become more dependent on them, recent studies show that recommender systems potentially own unintentional impacts on society and individuals because of their unfairness (e.g., gender discrimination in job recommendations). To develop trustworthy services, it is crucial to devise fairness-aware recommender systems that can mitigate these bias issues. In this survey, we summarise existing methodologies and practices of fairness in recommender systems. Firstly, we present concepts of fairness in different recommendation scenarios, comprehensively categorize current advances, and introduce typical methods to promote fairness in different stages of recommender systems. Next, after introducing datasets and evaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we will delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender systems exert on real-world industrial applications. Subsequently, we highlight the connection between fairness and other principles of trustworthy recommender systems, aiming to consider trustworthiness principles holistically while advocating for fairness. Finally, we summarize this review, spotlighting promising opportunities in comprehending concepts, frameworks, the balance between accuracy and fairness, and the ties with trustworthiness, with the ultimate goal of fostering the development of fairness-aware recommender systems.",

            "abstract": "Graph similarity learning is a significant and fundamental issue in the theory and analysis of graphs, which has been applied in a variety of fields, including object tracking, recommender systems, similarity search, and so on. Recent methods for graph similarity learning that utilize deep learning typically share two deficiencies: (1) they leverage graph neural networks as backbones for learning graph representations but have not well captured the complex information inside data, and (2) they employ a cross-graph attention mechanism for graph similarity learning, which is computationally expensive. Taking these limitations into consideration, a method for graph similarity learning is devised in this study, namely, Contrastive Graph Similarity Network (CGSim). To enhance graph similarity learning, CGSim makes use of the complementary information of two input graphs and captures pairwise relations in a contrastive learning framework. By developing a dual contrastive learning module with a node-graph matching and a graph-graph matching mechanism, our method significantly reduces the quadratic time complexity for cross-graph interaction modeling to linear time complexity. Jointly learning in an end-to-end framework, the graph representation embedding module and the well-designed contrastive learning module can be beneficial to one another. A comprehensive series of experiments indicate that CGSim outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on six datasets and significantly reduces the computational cost, which demonstrates our CGSim model\u2019s superiority over other baselines.",

            "title": "ATTIC is an integrated approach for predicting A-to-I RNA editing sites in three species",
            "abstract": "Abstract A-to-I editing is the most prevalent RNA editing event, which refers to the change of adenosine (A) bases to inosine (I) bases in double-stranded RNAs. Several studies have revealed that A-to-I editing can regulate cellular processes and is associated with various human diseases. Therefore, accurate identification of A-to-I editing sites is crucial for understanding RNA-level (i.e. transcriptional) modifications and their potential roles in molecular functions. To date, various computational approaches for A-to-I editing site identification have been developed; however, their performance is still unsatisfactory and needs further improvement. In this study, we developed a novel stacked-ensemble learning model, ATTIC (A-To-I ediTing predICtor), to accurately identify A-to-I editing sites across three species, including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster. We first comprehensively evaluated 37 RNA sequence-derived features combined with 14 popular machine learning algorithms. Then, we selected the optimal base models to build a series of stacked ensemble models. The final ATTIC framework was developed based on the optimal models improved by the feature selection strategy for specific species. Extensive cross-validation and independent tests illustrate that ATTIC outperforms state-of-the-art tools for predicting A-to-I editing sites. We also developed a web server for ATTIC, which is publicly available at http://web.unimelb-bioinfortools.cloud.edu.au/ATTIC/. We anticipate that ATTIC can be utilized as a useful tool to accelerate the identification of A-to-I RNA editing events and help characterize their roles in post-transcriptional regulation.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are essential to various fields, e.g., e-commerce, e-learning, and streaming media. At present, graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendations normally can only recommend items existing in users\u2019 historical sessions. As a result, these GNNs have difficulty recommending items that users have never interacted with (new items), which leads to a phenomenon of information cocoon. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend new items to users. As there is no interaction between new items and users, we cannot include new items when building session graphs for GNN session-based recommender systems. Thus, it is challenging to recommend new items for users when using GNN-based methods. We regard this challenge as \u201cGNN Session-based New Item Recommendation (GSNIR)\u201d. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-intent enhanced graph neural network for it. Due to the fact that new items are not tied to historical sessions, the users\u2019 intent is difficult to predict. We design a dual-intent network to learn user intent from an attention mechanism and the distribution of historical data respectively, which can simulate users\u2019 decision-making process in interacting with a new item. To solve the challenge that new items cannot be learned by GNNs, inspired by zero-shot learning (ZSL), we infer the new item representation in GNN space by using their attributes. By outputting new item probabilities, which contain recommendation scores of the corresponding items, the new items with higher scores are recommended to users. Experiments on two representative real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method. The case study from the real-world verifies interpretability benefits brought by the dual-intent module and the new item reasoning module.",
