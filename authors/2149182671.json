            "title": "Generative Evolutionary Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Networks",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.",

            "title": "A Unified Bayesian Model for Generalized Community Detection in Attribute Networks",
            "abstract": "Identification of community structures and the underlying semantic characteristics of communities are essential tasks in complex network analysis. However, most methods proposed so far are typically only applicable to assortative community structures, that is, more links within communities and fewer links between different communities, which ignore the rich diversity of community regularities in real networks. In addition, the node attributes that provide rich semantics information of communities and networks can facilitate in-depth community detection of structural information. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Bayesian generative model to detect generalized communities and provide semantic descriptions simultaneously by combining network topology and node attributes. The proposed model is composed of two closely correlated parts by a transition matrix; we first apply the concept of a mixture model to describe network regularities and then adjust the classic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify community semantically. Thus, the model can detect broad types of network structure regularities, including assortative structures, disassortative structures, and mixture structures and provide multiple semantic descriptions for the communities. To optimize the objective function of the model, we use an effective Gibbs sampling algorithm. Experiments on a number of synthetic and real networks show that our model has superior performance compared with some baselines on community detection.",
