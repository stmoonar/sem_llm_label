            "title": "A Novel Method to Design Steerable Differential Beamformer Using Linear Acoustics Vector Sensor Array",
            "abstract": "Differential beamforming techniques have gained significant attention due to their frequency-independent beampatterns, applicability for small apertures, and super-directivity. It is commonly known that the main lobe of a beam pattern based on a linear array is typically aligned with the end-fire direction. However, in some application scenarios, aligning the main lobe in the end-fire direction may not meet the actual requirements. This article focuses on studying the steering problem of differential beamformers based on linear acoustics vector sensor arrays (LAVSs). We propose a steerable differential beamformer for LAVSs, which addresses the problem of non-steerable beam patterns of linear arrays. Our approach involves approximating the beam pattern using a series expansion of the weighted steering vector to achieve frequency-independent differential directivity. The major contributions of this article include, but are not limited to, the following: First, we derive the first-order to third-order differential directivity based on the acoustics vector sensor (AVS) signal model, and obtain the weights of the corresponding channels using the least squares method. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of the steering differential beamformer, demonstrating that the maximum directivity factor (DF) is a function of the steering angle. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a spoo\ufb01ng-aware speaker veri\ufb01cation (SASV) sys-tem that integrates the automatic speaker veri\ufb01cation (ASV) system and countermeasure (CM) system is developed. Firstly, a modi\ufb01ed re-parameterized VGG (ARepVGG) module is utilized to extract high-level representation from the multi-scale feature that learns from the raw waveform though sinc-\ufb01lters, and then a spectra-temporal graph attention network is used to learn the \ufb01nal decision information whether the audio is spoofed or not. Secondly, a new network that is inspired from the Max-Feature-Map (MFM) layers is constructed to \ufb01ne-tune the CM system while keeping the ASV system \ufb01xed. Our proposed SASV system signi\ufb01cantly improves the SASV equal error rate (SASV-EER) from 6.73 % to 1.36 % on the evaluation dataset and 4.85 % to 0.98 % on the development dataset in the 2022 Spoo\ufb01ng-Aware Speaker Veri\ufb01cation Challenge(2022 SASV).",
