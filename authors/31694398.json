            "title": "Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows",
            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

            "abstract": "Redox-active disulfides are capable of being oxidized and reduced under physiological conditions. The enzymatic role of redox-active disulfides in thiol-disulfide reductases is well-known, but redox-active disulfides are also present in non-enzymatic protein structures where they may act as switches of protein function. Here, we examine disulfides linking adjacent beta-strands (cross-strand disulfides), which have been reported to be redox-active. Our previous work has established that these cross-strand disulfides have high torsional energies, a quantity likely to be related to the ease with which the disulfide is reduced. We examine the relationship between conformations of disulfides and their location in protein secondary structures. By identifying the overlap between cross-strand disulfides and various conformations, we wish to address whether the high torsional energy of a cross-strand disulfide is sufficient to confer redox activity or whether other factors, such as the presence of the cross-strand disulfide in a strained beta-sheet, are required.",

            "abstract": "Structural data mining studies attempt to deduce general principles of protein structure from solved structures deposited in the protein data bank (PDB). The entire database is unsuitable for such studies because it is not representative of the ensemble of protein folds. Given that novel folds continue to be unearthed, some folds are currently unrepresented in the PDB while other folds are overrepresented. Overrepresentation can easily be avoided by filtering the dataset. PDB_SELECT is a well\u2010used representative subset of the PDB that has been deduced by sequence comparison. Specifically, structures with sequences that exhibit a pairwise sequence identity above a threshold value are weeded from the dataset. Although length criteria for pairwise alignments have a structural basis, this automated method of pruning is essentially sequence\u2010based and runs into problems in the twilight zone, possibly resulting in some folds being overrepresented. The value\u2010added structure databases SCOP and CATH are also a potential source of a nonredundant dataset. Here we compare the sequence\u2010derived dataset PDB_SELECT with the structural databases SCOP (Structural Classification Of Proteins) and CATH (Class\u2010Architecture\u2010Topology\u2010Homology). We show that some folds remain overrepresented in the PDB_SELECT dataset while other folds are not represented at all. However, SCOP and CATH also have their own problems such as the labor\u2010intensiveness of the update process and the problem of determining whether all folds are equally or sufficiently distant. We discuss areas where further work is required. Proteins 2005. \u00a9 2005 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",
