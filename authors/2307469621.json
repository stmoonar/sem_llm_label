            "title": "Multi-Stage Balanced Distillation: Addressing Long-Tail Challenges in Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation",
            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various natural language processing tasks, but deploying them remains computationally expensive. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution, enabling the transfer of capabilities from larger teacher LLMs to more compact student models. Particularly, sequence-level KD, which distills rationale-based reasoning processes instead of merely final outcomes, shows great potential in enhancing students' reasoning capabilities. However, current methods struggle with sequence level KD under long-tailed data distributions, adversely affecting generalization on sparsely represented domains. We introduce the Multi-Stage Balanced Distillation (BalDistill) framework, which iteratively balances training data within a fixed computational budget. By dynamically selecting representative head domain examples and synthesizing tail domain examples, BalDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse long-tailed datasets, enhancing both the efficiency and efficacy of the distilled models.",

            "title": "Multimodal Graph Benchmark",
            "abstract": "Associating unstructured data with structured information is crucial for real-world tasks that require relevance search. However, existing graph learning benchmarks often overlook the rich semantic information associate with each node. To bridge such gap, we introduce the Multimodal Graph Benchmark (MM-GRAPH), the first comprehensive multi-modal graph benchmark that incorporates both textual and visual information. MM-GRAPH surpasses previous efforts, which have primarily focused on text-attributed graphs with various connectivity patterns. MM-GRAPH consists of five graph learning datasets of various scales that are appropriate for different learning tasks. Their multimodal node features, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of graph learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. To facilitate research on multimodal graph learning, we further provide an extensive study on the performance of various graph neural networks in the presence of features from various modalities. MM-GRAPH aims to foster research on multimodal graph learning and drive the development of more advanced and robust graph learning algorithms. By providing a diverse set of datasets and benchmarks, MM-GRAPH enables researchers to evaluate and compare their models in realistic settings, ultimately leading to improved performance on real-world applications that rely on multimodal graph data.",
