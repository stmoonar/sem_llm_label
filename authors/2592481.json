            "abstract": "Due to the complexity of airborne remote sensing scenes, strong background and noise interference, positive and negative sample imbalance, and multiple ship scales, ship detection is a critical and challenging task in remote sensing. This work proposes an end-to-end anchor-free oriented ship detector (AF-OSD) framework based on a multi-scale dense-point rotation Gaussian heatmap (MDP-RGH) to tackle these aforementioned challenges. First, to solve the sample imbalance problem and suppress the interference of negative samples such as background and noise, the oriented ship is modeled via the proposed MDP-RGH according to its shape and direction to generate ship labels with more accurate information, while the imbalance between positive and negative samples is adaptively learned for the ships with different scales. Then, the AF-OSD based on MDP-RGH is further devised to detect the multi-scale oriented ship, which is the accurate identification and information extraction for multi-scale vessels. Finally, a multi-task object size adaptive loss function is designed to guide the training process, improving its detection quality and performance for multi-scale oriented ships. Simulation results show that extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA ship datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves significantly outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "In existing superpixel-wise saliency detection algorithms, superpixel generation often is an isolated preprocessing step. The performance of saliency maps is determined by the accuracy of superpixels to a certain extent. However, it is still a challenge to develop a stable superpixel generation method. In this article, we attempt to incorporate the superpixel generation and saliency calculation steps into an end-to-end trainable deep network. First, we employ a recently proposed differentiable superpixel generation method to over-segment the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which outputs the possibility that the pixels assigned to neighbor superpixels (soft superpixel). In saliency calculation part, as one of our main contributions, we propose a differentiable and computationally simple saliency model, i.e., lacunarity cue. It is inspired by the fact that generally the backscattering intensity of regions of interest (ROIs) in SAR images irregularly fluctuates, while the areas with consistent pixels are often ignored as the clusters. We improve the pixelwise box differential dimension algorithm to measure the irregularity of scattering points in a superpixel. The superpixel generation and saliency calculation can be implemented under a unified deep network. Hence, the shapes of the superpixels can be iteratively adjusted according to the saliency maps until the ROIs are correctly detected. Experiments on real SAR images with different sizes and scenes show that the saliency maps can effectively highlight the target areas, thus outperforming the state-of-the-art saliency detection models.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of deep learning brings effective solutions for remote sensing image interpretation. Training deep neural network models usually require a large number of manually labeled samples. However, there is a limitation to obtain sufficient labeled samples in remote sensing field to satisfy the data requirement. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct the research on few-shot learning for remote sensing image interpretation. First, this article provides a bibliometric analysis of the existing works for remote sensing interpretation related to few-shot learning. Second, two categories of few-shot learning methods, i.e., the data-augmentation-based and the prior-knowledge-based, are introduced for the interpretation of remote sensing images. Then, three typical remote sensing interpretation applications are listed, including scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, together with the corresponding public datasets and the evaluation criteria. Finally, the research status is summarized, and some possible research directions are provided. This article gives a reference for scholars working on few-shot learning research in the remote sensing field.",

            "abstract": "Distributed optical vibration sensors (DOVS) have attracted much attention recently since it can be used to monitor mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves with long reach and high sensitivity.

Improvement in SNR is normally limited by the properties of light source, photodetector and FUT. But this limitation can also be overcome by post-processing of the received optical signals.

            "abstract": "An adaptive image restoration algorithm based on 2-D bilateral filtering has been proposed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the intrusion location for phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (\u0424-OTDR) system. By converting the spatial and time information of the \u0424-OTDR traces into 2-D image, the proposed 2-D bilateral filtering algorithm can smooth the noise and preserve the useful signal efficiently. To simplify the algorithm, a Lorentz spatial function is adopted to replace the original Gaussian function, which has higher practicability. Furthermore, an adaptive parameter setting method is developed according to the relation between the optimal gray level standard deviation and noise standard deviation, which is much faster and more robust for different types of signals. In the experiment, the SNR of location information has been improved over 14\u00a0dB without spatial resolution loss for a signal with original SNR of 6.43\u00a0dB in 27.6\u00a0km sensing fiber. The proposed method has the potential to precisely extract intrusion location from a harsh environment with strong background noise.",
