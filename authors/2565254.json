            "abstract": "Most current gait recognition methods suffer from poor interpretability and high computational cost. To improve interpretability, we investigate gait features in the embedding space based on Koopman operator theory. The transition matrix in this space captures complex kinematic features of gait cycles, namely the Koopman operator. The diagonal elements of the operator matrix can represent the overall motion trend, providing a physically meaningful descriptor. To reduce the computational cost of our algorithm, we use a reversible autoencoder to reduce the model size and eliminate convolutional layers to compress its depth, resulting in fewer floating-point operations. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method reduces computational cost to 1% compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive recognition accuracy 98% on non-occlusion datasets.",

            "abstract": "Driving risk classification is usually used for evaluating and reducing traffic accidents. It is of great significance to improve urban traffic problems, such as traffic jams and road accidents. Most related works use different representation methods with the data from the advanced driving assistance system and then use statistical approaches or machine learning to analyze the driving risk. However, because of the unbalance of positive and negative samples, the performance is usually not satisfactory. In this article, we propose a driving risk classification method via unbalanced time series samples. It first employs MeanShift with automatic bandwidth to cluster samples and expand its volume according to similarity. Then, it adopts a regional division module to simulate the outside environment and extracts state transition features by the Markov feature module to get more detailed information. By combining the stacking classification module with three convolutional neural networks, the performance is further improved. Finally, a city transfer module is designed with the drivers\u2019 inherent attributes and sample weights to enhance the generalization of the model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and generality of the classification model on driving risk. It can also be transferred to time series analysis in other fields.",

Firstly, the defect features of different pipelines are transferred by transfer component analysis (TCA), to reduce the difference of data probability distribution between them. Then, the post-transfer defect features are used to perform defect inversion with random forest (RF) algorithm. The real data are required from the domestic in-service oil pipelines in experiments.

In this paper, we propose a 2-dimensional logistic-modulated-sine-coupling-logistic chaotic map (LSMCL), where we use the logistic map to modulate Sine map and couple the result of modulation and Sine map together. In terms of chaotic trajectory, Lyapunov exponent, and Kolmogorov entropy, comparing with other existing chaotic maps, we can observe that LSMCL has better chaotic performance. Furthermore, we propose an LSMCL-based image encryption algorithm with two rounds of permutation and diffusion operation. First, we provide a secret key generation procedure to generate the initial values and do permutation operation with the chaotic matrix by LSMCL. Furthermore, in diffusion procedure, we use two different chaotic matrices generated by LSMCL to change the pixel values in row and column. Finally, we provide some theoretical analyses and simulations to confirm the security and the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

In this paper, we establish a chaotic framework based on a Sine\u2013Cosine compound function system by analyzing the existing one-dimensional Sine map and Chebyshev map. The sensitive dependence on initial conditions, topological transitivity and periodic-point density of this chaotic framework is proved, showing that the chaotic framework satisfies Devaney\u2019s chaos definition. In order to illustrate the chaotic behavior of the chaotic framework, we propose three examples, called Cosine\u2013Polynomial (C\u2013P) map, Sine\u2013Tangent (S\u2013T) map and Sine\u2013Exponent (S\u2013E) map, respectively. Then, we evaluate the chaotic behavior with Sine map and Chebyshev map by analyzing bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimensions, Kolmogorov entropy and [Formula: see text] complexity. Experimental results show that the chaotic framework has better unpredictability and more complex chaotic behaviors than the classical Sine map and Chebyshev map.
