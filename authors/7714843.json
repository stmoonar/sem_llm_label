            "title": "A 400-GHz Efficient Radiator and OOK Transceiver for Multi-Gb/s Wireless Communication in Silicon",
            "abstract": "This article introduces an efficient high-power radiator at 400 GHz and a fully integrated transceiver supporting OOK modulation for high-speed wireless communication using 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS. The reverse recovery of silicon p-i-n diodes is used to design a frequency quadrupler that generates high power efficiently at 400 GHz. By mutually interlocking and combining the power from two such quadruplers, we design a 400-GHz radiator. The proposed design achieves a peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of +20.6- and \u22125.8-dBm radiated power at 398 GHz with 0.2% dc-to-THz radiation efficiency. This is the highest reported efficiency, and THz power radiated per element above 320 GHz. Using the p-i-n diode quadruplers as the LO, we design a 400-GHz OOK transmitter and receiver with on-chip antennas. The transmitter uses a multiplier-last approach and has an EIRP of +17 dBm while consuming 84-mW dc power. The receiver uses fundamental-driven passive mixer architecture to achieve a noise figure (NF) of 25 dB while consuming 184 mW of dc power. This is the lowest reported NF above 320 GHz. Over-the-air (OTA) measurements are performed for a 5-cm link with OOK modulation. The stand-alone transmitter supports a data rate of 10 Gb/s (8 pJ/bit), and the transmit\u2013receive system supports a data rate of 5 Gb/s (36.8 pJ/bit for the receiver). This is the first demonstration of a fully integrated multi-Gb/s wireless transceiver above 320 GHz in silicon.",

            "abstract": "This article introduces a silicon-based source that can radiate power from the lower end of the terahertz (THz) spectrum into the far-infrared region. The radiator consists of a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) oscillator that drives a PIN diode multiplier. The p-i-n diodes exhibit reverse recovery when driven strongly, and the diode switches a large amount of current in a short interval. This process is highly non-linear and generates a harmonic-rich waveform, which is utilized here for higher harmonic generation. An on-chip folded dipole antenna is used to radiate the generated THz signal. The harmonic radiation properties of the folded dipole are analyzed and presented here. Wireless harmonic injection locking is also demonstrated in this work in order to synchronize the chip to an external source. Designed in GlobalFoundries 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS process, the chip has an effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 13 dBm and \u221214.2-dBm radiated power at 0.39 THz. The chip is characterized up to 0.8 THz using Virginia Diodes (VDI) mixers, and an EIRP of \u22123.8 dBm is measured at 0.78 THz. In order to measure the radiated tones at higher frequencies, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used with a room-temperature deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector. Measurement results confirm the presence of tones extending from the THz region into the far-infrared region, with an SNR of 18.4, 14, 9.3, and 6.7 dB at 1.17, 2.21, 3.25, and 4.03 THz, respectively. This work is the first demonstration of a silicon source capable of generating detectable tones at far-infrared frequencies.",

            "abstract": "The THz band, ranging from 0.1 - 10 THz, has largely remained untapped due to challenges in the THz generation. This band occupies a unique position in the electromagnetic spectrum between RF and optical frequencies and can enable several applications such as high-speed communication, imaging, radar, and spectroscopy. However, THz frequencies lie beyond the fmax of silicon technologies, making direct THz generation unfeasible. This paper is an overview of approaches for efficient high-power THz generation in silicon by utilizing the reverse recovery of PIN diodes. We review the design of a THz pulse radiator and a Continuous wave (CW) radiator fabricated using GlobalFoundries 90 nm SiGe BiCMOS process. THz applications such as imaging, vibration sensing, gas spectroscopy, and communication, are demonstrated. THz channel characterization using a pulse radiator is also presented.

            "abstract": "Localization has varied applications in biomedicine, such as wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE), detection of cancerous tissue, drug delivery, robotic surgeries, and brain mapping. Currently, most localization systems are battery-powered and suffer from issues regarding battery leakage and limited battery life, resulting in potential health hazards and inconveniences when using them for continuous health monitoring applications. This article proposes an entirely wireless and battery-less 2D localization system consisting of an integrated circuit (IC) that is wirelessly powered at a distance of 4 cm by a 40.68 MHz radio frequency (RF) power of only 2 W. The proposed localization system wirelessly transmits a locked sub-harmonic 13.56 MHz signal generated from the wirelessly received 40.68 MHz RF power signal, eliminating the need for a power-hungry oscillator. Additionally, the system, having a measurement latency of 11.3 ms, has also been verified to sense motion as small as 50 $\\mu \\text{m}$ as well as measure the rate of motion up to 10 beats per minute, therefore extending its application to the detection of physiological motions such as diaphragm motion during breathing.

            "abstract": "Efficient THz generation in silicon technologies has been of great interest over the recent years, as it enables an integrated low-cost solution for sensing, radar, communication, and spectroscopy [1]. Due to the limited $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{T}}/\\mathrm{f}_{\\max}$ of transistors, direct THz generation using a fundamental oscillator is not feasible; therefore, various approaches have been developed based on harmonic extraction and the frequency multiplication of a fundamental oscillator [2]. In these techniques, the nonlinearity of transistors is utilized to generate higher harmonics from a fundamental oscillator or frequency-multiplier cells; however, such systems have a poor efficiency and low radiated power due to device limitations. To compensate for the low generated power, a coherent array scheme is preferred to increase EI RP and radiated power. Adjusting the phase and locking the frequency of elements for coherent operation are important factors in array architectures, which can be performed through central LO distribution [3] and mutual coupling [4]. LO distribution can cause phase mismatch between elements and significantly increases the DC power consumption by adding more blocks. Mutual coupling through injection locking can maintain phase alignment. However, this type of coupling has low tuning range, which makes it challenging to synchronize elements over a broad frequency range. In this work, a technique for THz CW generation is presented, in which, instead of relying on transistor nonlinearity, a PIN diode is used in the reverse recovery mode for strong harmonic generation. A PIN diode, similar to a step recovery diode (SRD), benefits from a sharp reverse recovery and is highly nonlinear in the recovery mode, which enables efficient THz harmonic generation by upconverting the output of a mm-wave oscillator without requiring additional blocks and multipliers. The PIN-based array consists of 2x3 elements, where differential Colpitts oscillators are used as the core to push the PIN diodes into reverse recovery. Array elements are intercoupled using a collective coupling approach that enables wide tuning range and phase match between elements. The PIN-based array achieves a radiated power of 0.31 mW and 18.1dBm EIRP at 425GHz.",

The sensing node utilizes wireless power transfer (WPT) in the ISM band of 40.68MHz enabling battery less operation and a wireless data uplink is performed in the ISM band utilizing short pulses of 915MHz. The sensing IC (integrated circuit) consists of a rectifier, power management unit, clock recovery unit, amplifier, ADC (analog-to-digital converter) and a transmitter. The IC is integrated into the sensing node through a specially designed miniaturized loop antenna for WPT and a co-designed dipole antenna for the uplink transmit. The sensing node is fabricated in the 180nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process and is successfully verified for recording bio-potential signals like ECG, EMG and EOG.",

            "abstract": "This paper reports on a low-power biopotential recording IC (Integrated circuit) for an implantable leadless cardiac monitoring application. The IC is designed to realize fully batteryless operation through wireless energy harvesting. The IC consists of an RF energy harvester, power management unit, biopotential acquisition instrument amplifier, ADC (Analog-to-digital converter), clock recovery unit, receiver, and transmitter. The energy harvester peak conversion efficiency is 26%, and the power management unit provides a 1.2 V stable supply to the system and transmitter. Two ISM bands with 40.68 MHz and 915 MHz center frequencies were utilized for the downlink and uplink. The proposed IC eliminates dependency on the local oscillator, and the downlink baseband signal allows both clock and data for the system's operation. The total power consumption of the IC is 8.8 \u03bcW at the system clock's 100 kHz operation. The chip was implemented in the 180 nm CMOS process and was successfully verified for autonomous, closed-loop control under a batteryless environment.",
