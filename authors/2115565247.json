            "title": "Multi-Interest Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation System with Fuzzy Feedback based User Simulator",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

            "title": "CHAE: Fine-Grained Controllable Story Generation with Characters, Actions and Emotions",
            "abstract": "Story generation has emerged as an interesting yet challenging NLP task in recent years. Some existing studies aim at generating fluent and coherent stories from keywords and outlines; while others attempt to control the global features of the story, such as emotion, style and topic. However, these works focus on coarse-grained control on the story, neglecting control on the details of the story, which is also crucial for the task. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a model for fine-grained control on the story, which allows the generation of customized stories with characters, corresponding actions and emotions arbitrarily assigned. Extensive experimental results on both automatic and human manual evaluations show the superiority of our method. It has strong controllability to generate stories according to the fine-grained personalized guidance, unveiling the effectiveness of our methodology.

            "title": "Data-Augmented Counterfactual Learning for Bundle Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Bundle Recommendation (BR) aims at recommending bundled items on online content or e-commerce platform, such as song lists on a music platform or book lists on a reading website. Several graph based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on BR task. But their performance is still sub-optimal, since the data sparsity problem tends to be more severe in real bundle recommendation scenarios, which limits graph-based models from more sufficient learning. In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning paradigm called Counterfactual Learning for Bundle Recommendation (CLBR) to mitigate the impact of data sparsity problem and improve bundle recommendation. Our paradigm consists of two main parts: counterfactual data augmentation and counterfactual constraint. The main idea of our paradigm lies in answering the counterfactual questions:\"What would a user interact with if his/her interaction history changes?\"\"What would a user interact with if the bundle-item affiliation relations change?\"In counterfactual data augmentation, we design a heuristic sampler to generate counterfactual graph views for graph-based models, which has better noise controlling than the stochastic sampler. We further propose counterfactual loss to constrain model learning for mitigating the effects of residual noise in augmented data and achieving more sufficient model optimization. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates the rationality of our design. Extensive experiments of BR models applied with our paradigm on two real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the paradigm.",

Data mining technology provides information needed by business analytics based on data. But due to the barriers of skill, resource and cost, business analytics is hard to carry out and put into practice for small and even medium sized enterprises. This paper presents a novel concept named Highly Consumable Business Analytics (HCBA) aiming to improve consumability of business analytics. We discuss the ways to simplify the use of data mining algorithms, establish end-to-end integrated lifecycle management of model and ultimately wrap models into web service to provide model-wise services. We propose a general reference architecture of HCBA. And a prototype is designed and implemented based on this architecture.",
