            "abstract": "Heterogeneous data is endemic due to the use of diverse models and settings of devices by hospitals in the field of medical imaging. However, there are few open-source frameworks for federated heterogeneous medical image analysis with personalization and privacy protection without the demand to modify the existing model structures or to share any private data. In this paper, we proposed PPPML-HMI, a novel open-source learning paradigm for personalized and privacy-preserving federated heterogeneous medical image analysis. To our best knowledge, personalization and privacy protection were achieved simultaneously for the first time under the federated scenario by integrating the PerFedAvg algorithm and designing the novel cyclic secure aggregation with the homomorphic encryption algorithm. To show the utility of PPPML-HMI, we applied it to a simulated classification task namely the classification of healthy people and patients from the RAD-ChestCT Dataset, and one real-world segmentation task namely the segmentation of lung infections from COVID-19 CT scans. For the real-world task, PPPML-HMI achieved $sim$5% higher Dice score on average compared to conventional FL under the heterogeneous scenario. Meanwhile, we applied the improved deep leakage from gradients to simulate adversarial attacks and showed the strong privacy-preserving capability of PPPML-HMI. By applying PPPML-HMI to both tasks with different neural networks, a varied number of users, and sample sizes, we further demonstrated the strong generalizability of PPPML-HMI.",

            "abstract": "The accurate annotation of transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage is critical for the mechanistic understanding of gene regulation under different biological contexts. To fulfill this, on one hand, specific high-throughput experimental technologies have been developed to capture TSSs in a genome-wide manner. On the other hand, various computational tools have also been developed for in silico prediction of TSSs solely based on genomic sequences. Most of these computational tools cast the problem as a binary classification task on a balanced dataset and thus result in drastic false positive predictions when applied on the genome-scale. To address these issues, we present DeeReCT-TSS, a deep-learning-based method that is capable of TSSs identification across the whole genome based on both DNA sequences and conventional RNA-seq data. We show that by effectively incorporating these two sources of information, DeeReCT-TSS significantly outperforms other solely sequence-based methods on the precise annotation of TSSs used in different cell types. Furthermore, we develop a meta-learning-based extension for simultaneous transcription start site (TSS) annotation on 10 cell types, which enables the identification of cell-type-specific TSS. Finally, we demonstrate the high precision of DeeReCT-TSS on two independent datasets from the ENCODE project by correlating our predicted TSSs with experimentally defined TSS chromatin states.
