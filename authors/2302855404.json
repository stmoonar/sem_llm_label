            "title": "BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments",
            "abstract": "Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy.",

            "title": "STaRK: Benchmarking LLM Retrieval on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases",
            "abstract": "Answering real-world complex queries, such as complex product search, often requires accurate retrieval from semi-structured knowledge bases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, previous works have mostly studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational K nowledge Bases. Our benchmark covers three domains/datasets: product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, together with their ground-truth answers (items). We conduct rigorous human evaluation to validate the quality of our synthesized queries. We further enhance the benchmark with high-quality human-generated queries to provide an authentic reference. STARK serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that STARK presents significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, indicating the demand for building more capable retrieval systems. The benchmark data and code are available on https://github.com/snap-stanford/stark.",

            "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capability in utilizing external tools and knowledge to boost accuracy and reduce hallucinations. However, developing the prompting techniques that make LLM agents able to effectively use external tools and knowledge is a heuristic and laborious task. Here, we introduce AvaTaR, a novel and automatic framework that optimizes an LLM agent to effectively use the provided tools and improve its performance on a given task/domain. During optimization, we design a comparator module to iteratively provide insightful and holistic prompts to the LLM agent via reasoning between positive and negative examples sampled from training data. We demonstrate AvaTaR on four complex multimodal retrieval datasets featuring textual, visual, and relational information. We find AvaTaR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all four challenging tasks and exhibits strong generalization ability when applied to novel cases, achieving an average relative improvement of 14% on the Hit@1 metric.
