            "abstract": "Due to the limited driving range, inadequate charging facilities, and time-consuming recharging, the process of finding an optimal charging route for electric vehicles (EVs) differs from that of other vehicle types. The time and location of EV charging during a trip impact not only the individual EV's travel time but also the travel time of other EVs, due to the queuing that may arise at the charging station(s). This issue is at large seen as a significant constraint for uplifting EV sales in many countries. In this study, we present a novel Electric Vehicle Route Planning problem, which involves finding the fastest route with recharging for an EV routing request. We model the problem as a new graph problem and present that the problem is NP-hard. We propose a novel two-phase algorithm to traverse the graph to find the best possible charging route for each EV. We also introduce the notion of `influence factor' to propose heuristics to find the best possible route for an EV with the minimum travel time that avoids using charging stations and time to recharge at those stations which can lead to better travel time for other EVs. The results show that our method can decrease total travel time of the EVs by 50\\% in comparison with the state-of-the-art on a real dataset, where the benefit of our approach is more significant as the number of EVs on the road increases.",

            "title": "Spatial-temporal Forecasting for Regions without Observations",
            "abstract": "Spatial-temporal forecasting plays an important role in many real-world applications, such as traffic forecasting, air pollutant forecasting, crowd-flow forecasting, and so on. State-of-the-art spatial-temporal forecasting models take data-driven approaches and rely heavily on data availability. Such models suffer from accuracy issues when data is incomplete, which is common in reality due to the heavy costs of deploying and maintaining sensors for data collection. A few recent studies attempted to address the issue of incomplete data. They typically assume some data availability in a region of interest either for a short period or at a few locations. In this paper, we further study spatial-temporal forecasting for a region of interest without any historical observations, to address scenarios such as unbalanced region development, progressive deployment of sensors or lack of open data. We propose a model named STSM for the task. The model takes a contrastive learning-based approach to learn spatial-temporal patterns from adjacent regions that have recorded data. Our key insight is to learn from the locations that resemble those in the region of interest, and we propose a selective masking strategy to enable the learning. As a result, our model outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models, reducing errors consistently over both traffic and air pollutant forecasting tasks.

            "abstract": "During navigation, people may deviate from an already planned path. Possible reasons include traffic congestion, difficulty in following instructions, or personal preferences, as evidenced by studies in human spatial cognition and transportation. Most path planning methods provide users with a single path, for example the shortest one, while a few give the user a set of paths to choose from. In the latter case, once a path from the given set is chosen, the rest are discarded. If the user were to deviate from the planned path, alternatives may not exist or may cause a significant delay to the user. Services such as Google Maps continuously monitor possible alternatives, but they may offer a path with no alternatives or few and lengthy ones. Taking a proactive approach to finding alternatives, we introduce the most flexible path \u2013 a path that maximises the number of alternatives the user has along a given path. This way, users may choose to take a different path midway and be more likely to have alternative paths available to them. Straightforward approaches to obtaining such a path have a prohibitive computational complexity. We introduce a set of algorithms that yield exact and approximate solutions to this problem. We then showcase the most flexible path\u2019s time-saving reroutes in a traffic congestion scenario.",

            "abstract": "Despite claiming to support external memory access, very few learned indices implement their indices on secondary storage. It is challenging to extend learned models to secondary storage while preserving high levels of index performance. In this paper, we propose a Fast Hybrid Spatial Index with External Memory Support (FHSIE). Its core idea is to learn a model which can group spatial objects in a top-down manner with few parameters. We use a height-balanced hierarchical structure, which recursively uses simple unsupervised models to group (i.e., cluster) spatial objects. We associate the learned structure with a grid for accurate query processing, and we utilize the relationship among clusters and grid cells to estimate the grid layout and optimize grid performance. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets with more than 200 million points show that FHSIE is highly efficient and precise no matter where it works, i.e., in memory or on a disk.",

            "abstract": "Road networks are widely used as a fundamental structure in urban transportation studies. In recent years, with more research leveraging deep learning to solve conventional transportation problems, how to obtain robust road network representations (i.e., embeddings) applicable for a wide range of applications became a fundamental need. Existing studies mainly adopt graph embedding methods. Such methods, however, foremost learn the topological correlations of road networks but ignore the spatial structure (i.e., spatial correlations) which are also important in applications such as querying similar trajectories. Besides, most studies learn task-specific embeddings in a supervised manner such that the embeddings are sub-optimal when being used for new tasks. It is inefficient to store or learn dedicated embeddings for every different task in a large transportation system. To tackle these issues, we propose a model named SARN to learn generic and task-agnostic road network embeddings based on self-supervised contrastive learning. We present (i) a spatial similarity matrix to help learn the spatial correlations of the roads, (ii) a sampling strategy based on the spatial structure of a road network to form self-supervised training samples, and (iii) a two-level loss function to guide SARN to learn embeddings based on both local and global contrasts of similar and dissimilar road segments. Experimental results on three downstream tasks over real-world road networks show that SARN outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised models consistently and achieves comparable (or even better) performance to supervised models.",

            "abstract": "\n Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, trajectory similarity is quantified by means of non-learned measures, e.g., Hausdorff, that operate directly on the trajectories. Recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to\n d\n -dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the non-learned measures. As embedding distance computation is efficient, focus has been on obtaining embeddings of high accuracy.\n \n Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the non-learned and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while non-learned approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest and the most accurate. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.",

The development of intelligent systems and technology provides an opportunity to improve the frequency and scale of dynamic road network optimization.

We present a novel solution that integrates machine learning and road network optimization. Our solution consists of two complementary parts. The first part is an efficient algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to find the best road network configurations at real-time. The second part is a dynamic routing mechanism, which helps connected vehicles adapt to the change of the road network. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the average travel time in a variety of scenarios, whilst being computationally efficient and hence applicable to real-life situations.",
