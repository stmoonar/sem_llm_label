            "title": "Network Alignment With Holistic Embeddings",
            "abstract": "Network alignment is the task of identifying topologically and semantically similar nodes across (two) different networks. It plays an important role in various applications ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatic network interactions. However, existing alignment models either cannot handle large-scale graphs or fail to leverage different types of network information or modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end alignment framework that can leverage different modalities to compare and align network nodes in an efficient way. In order to exploit the richness of the network context, our model constructs multiple embeddings for each node, each of which captures one modality or type of network information. We then design a late-fusion mechanism to combine the learned embeddings based on the importance of the underlying information. Our fusion mechanism allows our model to be adapted to various types of structure of the input network. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, while being robust against various noise factors.",

            "title": "Learning Holistic Interactions in LBSNs With High-Order, Dynamic, and Multi-Role Contexts",
            "abstract": "Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have emerged over the past few years. Their exponential network effects depend on the fact that each user can share her daily digital footprints with different communities, in different places, and at different times (for example in the form of check-in activities). Unlike other types of social networks, activities in an LBSN can potentially be performed by several users in a collaborative way. Existing studies of representation learning for LBSNs often consider them as regular graphs and ignore these high-order, dynamic, and multi-role contexts, since their holistic interactions are quite difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a model in which these holistic interactions can be learned and transferred into node embeddings derived from a hypergraph representation and a persona decomposition process. More specifically, the model learns from friendship edges, check-in hyperedges, and node personas at the same time, and devises multiple presentations for each user that reflects their multiple roles in a social context. The embedding learning process also exploits useful patterns such as user co-location and sequential effects through a carefully designed point-of-interest splitting step. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that our model outperforms alternative state-of-the-art embedding methods on friendship and location prediction tasks by an average margin of 45.7% and 29.46%, respectively. We also demonstrate the robustness of our model against adversarial conditions such as structural noise, attribute noise, and hyperparameter sensitivity.",

            "title": "Joint Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion and Alignment",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) alignment and completion are usually treated as two independent tasks. While recent work has leveraged entity and relation alignments from multiple KGs, such as alignments between multilingual KGs with common entities and relations, a deeper understanding of the ways in which multilingual KG completion (MKGC) can aid the creation of multilingual KG alignments (MKGA) is still limited. Motivated by the observation that structural inconsistencies -- the main challenge for MKGA models -- can be mitigated through KG completion methods, we propose a novel model for jointly completing and aligning knowledge graphs. The proposed model combines two components that jointly accomplish KG completion and alignment. These two components employ relation-aware graph neural networks that we propose to encode multi-hop neighborhood structures into entity and relation representations. Moreover, we also propose (i) a structural inconsistency reduction mechanism to incorporate information from the completion into the alignment component, and (ii) an alignment seed enlargement and triple transferring mechanism to enlarge alignment seeds and transfer triples during KGs alignment. Extensive experiments on a public multilingual benchmark show that our proposed model outperforms existing competitive baselines, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on both MKGC and MKGA tasks. We publicly release the implementation of our model at https://github.com/vinhsuhi/JMAC",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) alignment - the task of recognizing entities referring to the same thing in different KGs - is recognized as one of the most important operations in the field of KG construction and completion. However, existing alignment techniques often assume that the input KGs are complete and isomorphic, which is not true due to the real-world heterogeneity in the domain, size, and sparsity. In this work, we address the problem of aligning incomplete KGs with representation learning. Our KG embedding framework exploits two feature channels: transitivity-based and proximity-based. The former captures the consistency constraints between entities via translation paths, while the latter captures the neighbourhood structure of KGs via attention guided relation-aware graph neural network. The two feature channels are jointly learned to exchange important features between the input KGs while enforcing the output representations of the input KGs in the same embedding space. Also, we develop a missing links detector that discovers and recovers the missing links in the input KGs during the training process, which helps mitigate the incompleteness issue and thus improve the compatibility of the learned representations. The embeddings then are fused to generate the alignment result, and the high-confidence matched node pairs are updated to the pre-aligned supervision data to improve the embeddings gradually. Empirical results show that our model is more accurate than the SOTA and is robust against different levels of incompleteness.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become popular structures for unifying real-world entities by modelling the relationships between them and their attributes. To support multilingual applications, a significant number of language-specific KGs have been built by different parties using various data sources. As a result, these monolingual KGs are often disconnected, causing semantic heterogeneity and detracting from the original purpose of KGs. Entity alignment \u2013 the task of identifying corresponding entities across different KGs \u2013 has attracted a great deal of attention in both academia and industry. However, existing alignment techniques often require large amounts of labelled data, are unable to encode multi-modal data simultaneously, and enforce only a few consistency constraints. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end, unsupervised entity alignment framework for cross-lingual KGs that fuses different types of information in order to fully exploit the richness of KG data. The model captures the relation-based correlation between entities by using a multi-order graph convolutional neural (GCN) model that is designed to satisfy the consistency constraints, while incorporating the attribute-based correlation via a translation machine. We adopt a late-fusion mechanism to combine all the information together, which allows these approaches to complement each other and thus enhances the final alignment result, and makes the model more robust to consistency violations. Empirical results for various scenarios on real-world and synthetic KGs show that our model is up to 22.71 percent more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than existing baselines. We also demonstrate its sensitivity to hyper-parameters, effort saving in terms of labelling, and the robustness against adversarial conditions.",
