            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "title": "Workflows Community Summit: Bringing the Scientific Workflows Community Together",
            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains, and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. These executions must be managed using some software infrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for creating and executing workflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. While these efforts are all worthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, many of which are moribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large, still elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or build upon, existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively impacts workflow users, developers, and researchers. The\"Workflows Community Summit\"was held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to stakeholders in the workflow community (including both developers of WMSs and users of workflows) helped to identify key challenges in this community that were translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them being the object of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community. This report documents and organizes the wealth of information provided by the participants before, during, and after the summit.",

            "abstract": "This report details the work involved in the federation of compute and data resources between the OpenRiskNet e-infrastructure and external resources. The reference environment has been designed to be capable of handling the majority of requirements for users\u2019 wishes to deploy and run services. However specific situations demand solutions where either the computation, the data or both reside outside the OpenRiskNet e-infrastructure. This deliverable is related to Tasks 2.7 (Interconnecting virtual environment with external infrastructures) and Tasks 2.8 (Federation between virtual environments).\n\nResource intensive analyses, such as those performed in toxicogenomics, can have CPU, memory or disk requirements that cannot be assumed to be available across all deployment scenarios. Human sequencing data may have restrictions on where it can be processed and the vast quantity of this data often predicates that it is more efficient to \u201cbring the computation to the data\u201d. In achieving Tasks 2.7 and 2.8, we can demonstrate how the virtual environment can utilise external infrastructure including commercial cloud providers and data stores.",

This impasse has been fueled by the combined reliance on increasingly complex data analysis methods and the exponential growth of biological datasets. When considering the installation, deployment and maintenance of bioinformatic pipelines, an even more challenging picture emerges due to the lack of community standards. The effect of limited standards on reproducibility is amplified by the very diverse range of computational platforms and configurations on which these applications are expected to be applied (workstations, clusters, HPC, clouds, etc.). With no established standard at any level, diversity cannot be taken for granted.",

Homology extension is performed with Position Specific Iterative (PSI) BLAST searches against a choice of redundant and non-redundant databases. The main novelty of this server is to allow databases of reduced complexity to rapidly perform homology extension. This server also gives the possibility to use transmembrane proteins (TMPs) reference databases to allow even faster homology extension on this important category of proteins. Aside from an MSA, the server also outputs topological prediction of TMPs using the HMMTOP algorithm. Previous benchmarking of the method has shown this approach outperforms the most accurate alignment methods such as MSAProbs, Kalign, PROMALS, MAFFT, ProbCons and PRALINE\u2122.

It has been developed to address the relation between structural and functional similarity in proteins, and it allows a fine-grained structural clustering of a given protein family or group of structurally related proteins using distance RMSD (dRMSD) variations. These distances are computed between all pairs of equivalent residues, as defined by the ungapped columns within a given multiple sequence alignment. Using these generated distance matrices (one per equivalent position), T-RMSD produces a structural tree with support values for each cluster node, reminiscent of bootstrap values. These values, associated with the tree topology, allow a quantitative estimate of structural distances between proteins or group of proteins defined by the tree topology. The clusters thus defined have been shown to be structurally and functionally informative.
