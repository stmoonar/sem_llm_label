            "title": "TeKo: Text-Rich Graph Neural Networks With External Knowledge",
            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained great prevalence in tackling various analytical tasks on graph-structured data (i.e., networks). Typical GNNs and their variants adopt a message-passing principle that obtains network representations by the attribute propagates along network topology, which however ignores the rich textual semantics (e.g., local word-sequence) that exist in numerous real-world networks. Existing methods for text-rich networks integrate textual semantics by mainly using internal information such as topics or phrases/words, which often suffer from an inability to comprehensively mine the textual semantics, limiting the reciprocal guidance between network structure and textual semantics. To address these problems, we present a novel text-rich GNN with external knowledge (TeKo), in order to make full use of both structural and textual information within text-rich networks. Specifically, we first present a flexible heterogeneous semantic network that integrates high-quality entities as well as interactions among documents and entities. We then introduce two types of external knowledge, that is, structured triplets and unstructured entity descriptions, to gain a deeper insight into textual semantics. Furthermore, we devise a reciprocal convolutional mechanism for the constructed heterogeneous semantic network, enabling network structure and textual semantics to collaboratively enhance each other and learn high-level network representations. Extensive experiments illustrate that TeKo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of text-rich networks as well as a large-scale e-commerce searching dataset.",

            "title": "Reducing Flipping Errors in Deep Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in various domains in artificial intelligence including computer vision and natural language processing.\n A DNN is typically trained for many epochs and then a validation dataset is used to select the DNN in an epoch (we simply call this epoch ``the last epoch\") as the final model for making predictions on unseen samples, while it usually cannot achieve a perfect accuracy on unseen samples. An interesting question is ``how many test (unseen) samples that a DNN misclassifies in the last epoch were ever correctly classified by the DNN before the last epoch?\". In this paper, we empirically study this question and find on several benchmark datasets that the vast majority of the misclassified samples in the last epoch were ever classified correctly before the last epoch, which means that the predictions for these samples were flipped from ``correct\" to ``wrong\". Motivated by this observation, we propose to restrict the behavior changes of a DNN on the correctly-classified samples so that the correct local boundaries can be maintained and the flipping error on unseen samples can be largely reduced. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets with different modern network architectures demonstrate that the proposed flipping error reduction (FER) approach can substantially improve the generalization, the robustness, and the transferability of DNNs without introducing any additional network parameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead.",

            "abstract": "Product quantization (PQ) coupled with a space rotation, is widely used in modern approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search systems to significantly compress the disk storage for embeddings and speed up the inner product computation. Existing rotation learning methods, however, minimize quantization distortion for fixed embeddings, which are not applicable to an end-to-end training scenario where embeddings are updated constantly. In this paper, based on geometric intuitions from Lie group theory, in particular the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$, we propose a family of block Givens coordinate descent algorithms to learn rotation matrix that are provably convergent on any convex objectives. Compared to the state-of-the-art SVD method, the Givens algorithms are much more parallelizable, reducing runtime by orders of magnitude on modern GPUs, and converge more stably according to experimental studies. They further improve upon vanilla product quantization significantly in an end-to-end training scenario.",

            "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) explicitly solicit users' preferences for improved recommendations on the fly. Most existing CRS solutions count on a single policy trained by reinforcement learning for a population of users. However, for users new to the system, such a global policy becomes ineffective to satisfy them, i.e., the cold-start challenge. In this paper, we study CRS policy learning for cold-start users via meta reinforcement learning. We propose to learn a meta policy and adapt it to new users with only a few trials of conversational recommendations. To facilitate fast policy adaptation, we design three synergetic components. Firstly, we design a meta-exploration policy dedicated to identifying user preferences via a few exploratory conversations, which accelerates personalized policy adaptation from the meta policy. Secondly, we adapt the item recommendation module for each user to maximize the recommendation quality based on the collected conversation states during conversations. Thirdly, we propose a Transformer-based state encoder as the backbone to connect the previous two components. It provides comprehensive state representations by modeling complicated relations between positive and negative feedback during the conversation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the advantage of our solution in serving new users, compared with a rich set of state-of-the-art CRS solutions.",

            "abstract": "Product images are essential for providing desirable user experience in an e-commerce platform. For a platform with billions of products, it is extremely time-costly and labor-expensive to manually pick and organize qualified images. Furthermore, there are the numerous and complicated image rules that a product image needs to comply in order to be generated/selected. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a new learning framework in order to achieve Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence (AGPIS) in e-commerce. To this end, we propose a Multi-modality Unified Image-sequence Classifier (MUIsC), which is able to simultaneously detect all categories of rule violations through learning. MUIsC leverages textual review feedback as the additional training target and utilizes product textual description to provide extra semantic information. %Without using prior knowledge or manually-crafted task, a single MUIsC model is able to learn the holistic knowledge of image reviewing and detect all categories of rule violations simultaneously. Based on offline evaluations, we show that the proposed MUIsC significantly outperforms various baselines. Besides MUIsC, we also integrate some other important modules in the proposed framework, such as primary image selection, non-compliant content detection, and image deduplication. With all these modules, our framework works effectively and efficiently in JD.com recommendation platform. By Dec 2021, our AGPIS framework has generated high-standard images for about 1.5 million products and achieves 13.6% in reject rate.

The development of the system contains two main components: 1) copywriting aspect extraction; 2) weakly supervised aspect labelling; 3) text generation with a prefix-based language model; and 4) copywriting quality control. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EPCCG. In addition, we introduce the deployed architecture which cooperates the EPCCG into the real-time JD.com e-commerce recommendation platform and the significant payoff since deployment.

Pre-training a language model from a general corpus such as Wikipedia or the Common Crawl requires tremendous time and resource commitment, and can be wasteful if the downstream tasks are limited in variety. Our DSGPT is pre-trained on a limited dataset, the Chinese short text summarization dataset (LCSTS). Third, our model does not require product-related human-labeled data. For title summarization task, the state of art explicitly uses additional background knowledge in training and predicting stages. In contrast, our model implicitly captures this knowledge and achieves significant improvement over other methods, after fine-tuning on the public Taobao.com dataset. For review summarization task, we utilize JD.com in-house dataset, and observe similar improvement over standard machine translation methods which lack the flexibility of fine-tuning. Our proposed work can be simply extended to other domains for a wide range of text generation tasks.",

            "abstract": "Person search has drawn increasing attention due to its real-world applications and research significance. Person search aims to find a probe person in a gallery of scene images with a wide range of applications, such as criminals search, multicamera tracking, missing person search, etc. Early person search works focused on image-based person search, which uses person image as the search query. Text-based person search is another major person search category that uses free-form natural language as the search query. Person search is challenging, and corresponding solutions are diverse and complex. Therefore, systematic surveys on this topic are essential. This paper surveyed the recent works on image-based and text-based person search from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide a brief analysis of highly influential person search methods considering the three significant challenges: the discriminative person features, the query-person gap, and the detection-identification inconsistency. We summarise and compare evaluation results. Finally, we discuss open issues and some promising future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Embedding index that enables fast approximate nearest neighbor(ANN) search, serves as an indispensable component for state-of-the-art deep retrieval systems. Traditional approaches, often separating the two steps of embedding learning and index building, incur additional indexing time and decayed retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Poeem, which stands for product quantization based embedding index jointly trained with deep retrieval model, to unify the two separate steps within an end-to-end training, by utilizing a few techniques including the gradient straight-through estimator, warm start strategy, optimal space decomposition and Givens rotation. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method not only improves retrieval accuracy significantly but also reduces the indexing time to almost none. We have open sourced our approach for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.",
