            "abstract": "Since the concern of privacy leakage extremely discourages user participation in sharing data, federated learning has gradually become a promising technique for both academia and industry for achieving collaborative learning without leaking information about the local data. Unfortunately, most federated learning solutions cannot efficiently verify the execution of each participant's local machine learning model and protect the privacy of user data, simultaneously. In this article, we first propose a Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Federated Learning (ZKP-FL) scheme on blockchain. It leverages zero-knowledge proof for both the computation of local data and the aggregation of local model parameters, aiming to verify the computation process without requiring the plaintext of the local data. We further propose a Practical ZKP-FL (PZKP-FL) scheme to support fraction and non-linear operations. Specifically, we explore a Fraction-Integer mapping function, and use Taylor expansion to efficiently handle non-linear operations while maintaining the accuracy of the federated learning model. We also analyze the security of PZKP-FL. Performance analysis demonstrates that the whole running time of the PZKP-FL scheme is approximately less than one minute in parallel execution.",

            "abstract": "Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) forms the frontline defence against network attacks that compromise the security of the data, systems, and networks. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been increasingly used in NIDS to detect malicious traffic due to their high detection accuracy. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that modify an input example with imperceivable perturbation, which causes a misclassification by the DNN. In security-sensitive domains, such as NIDS, adversarial attacks pose a severe threat to network security. However, existing studies in adversarial learning against NIDS directly implement adversarial attacks designed for Computer Vision (CV) tasks, ignoring the fundamental differences in the detection pipeline and feature spaces between CV and NIDS. It remains a major research challenge to launch and detect adversarial attacks against NIDS. This article surveys the recent literature on NIDS, adversarial attacks, and network defences since 2015 to examine the differences in adversarial learning against deep neural networks in CV and NIDS. It provides the reader with a thorough understanding of DL-based NIDS, adversarial attacks and defences, and research trends in this field. We first present a taxonomy of DL-based NIDS and discuss the impact of taxonomy on adversarial learning. Next, we review existing white-box and black-box adversarial attacks on DNNs and their applicability in the NIDS domain. Finally, we review existing defence mechanisms against adversarial examples and their characteristics.",

            "title": "A large-scale analysis of HTTPS deployments: Challenges, solutions, and recommendations",
            "abstract": "HTTPS refers to an application-specific implementation that runs HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on top of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). HTTPS is used to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of web servers and clients, for different purposes such as online banking and e-commerce. However, many HTTPS vulnerabilities have been disclosed in recent years. Although many studies have pointed out that these vulnerabilities can lead to serious consequences, domain administrators seem to ignore them. In this study, we evaluate the HTTPS security level of Alexa\u2019s top 1 million domains from two perspectives. First, we explore which popular sites are still affected by those well-known security issues. Our results show that less than 0.1% of HTTPS-enabled servers in the measured domains are still vulnerable to known attacks including Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4), Compression Ratio Info-Leak Mass Exploitation (CRIME), Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE), Factoring RSA Export Keys (FREAK), Logjam, and Decrypting Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA) using Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN). Second, we assess the security level of the digital certificates used by each measured HTTPS domain. Our results highlight that less than 0.52% domains use the expired certificate, 0.42% HTTPS certificates contain different hostnames, and 2.59% HTTPS domains use a self-signed certificate. The domains we investigate in our study cover 5 regions (including ARIN, RIPE NCC, APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC) and 61 different categories such as online shopping websites, banking websites, educational websites, and government websites. Although our results show that the problem still exists, we find that changes have been taking place when HTTPS vulnerabilities were discovered. Through this three-year study, we found that more attention has been paid to the use and configuration of HTTPS. For example, more and more domains begin to enable the HTTPS protocol to ensure a secure communication channel between users and websites. From the first measurement, we observed that many domains are still using TLS 1.0 and 1.1, SSL 2.0, and SSL 3.0 protocols to support user clients that use outdated systems. As the previous studies revealed security risks of using these protocols, in the subsequent studies, we found that the majority of domains updated their TLS protocol on time. Our 2020 results suggest that most HTTPS domains use the TLS 1.2 protocol and show that some HTTPS domains are still vulnerable to the existing known attacks. As academics and industry professionals continue to disclose attacks against HTTPS and recommend the secure configuration of HTTPS, we found that the number of vulnerable domain is gradually decreasing every year.",

            "abstract": "Providing high\u2010speed Internet to connect anything in the globe anywhere at any time is becoming the need of future societies, which are built on the smart city concepts. As a pragmatic approach, an integration of terrestrial and satellite networks is proposed for leveraging the combined benefits of both complementary technologies. In addition, with the quest of exploring deep space and connecting solar system planets with the Earth, the traditional satellite network has gone beyond the geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) wherein interplanetary Internet will play a key role. To this end, futuristic satellite networks will be an integration of inter\u2010satellite and deep space network (ISDSN), which on the one hand will connect thousands of entities on the Earth together and on the other hand will connect deep space satellites with the Earth and solar planets. This chapter demystifies such dynamic networks and classifies them into different tiers. Most importantly, for each tier, we discuss the key requirements, research challenges, and potential security threats. Finally, we present open issues and new research directions in this emerging area of futuristic satellite networks.",

            "abstract": "Advances in computing and compression technology, coupled with high\u2010speed networks, has beaconed an era of video streaming on the Internet. This has led to a need to enhance the security of communications transporting data without degrading its performance. The transport layer security (TLS) protocol negotiates configurations for securing communication channels. Such conversations adversely impact latency, thereby presenting a fundamental tradeoff between security and efficiency. In this work, we present a conceptual framework, called SEC\u2010QUIC (Secure and Efficient Configurations for QUIC), that focuses on optimizing this tradeoff specifically for video transmissions by investigating various factors in Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC). Transport\u2010layer\u2010related elements, such as maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes, cipher suites, and ACK timer, are examined to evaluate the impact on the security\u2010efficiency tradeoff in QUIC\u2010based video transmissions using platform\u2010based experiments. Subsequently, we develop a conceptual framework to leverage QUIC's dynamics based on the context of a connection to optimize the security\u2010efficiency tradeoff. Our findings demonstrate the need to alter default configurations based on the contextual factors of a connection (eg, resource constraints and network conditions) in QUIC\u2010based video transmissions to balance the tradeoff. Experiments reveal an MTU of 1400 bytes is found to have 60% better throughput compared to an MTU of 1200 bytes while also 4% less CPU usage on average for the transmission of 100\u2009MB video files. Overall, our experiments suggest that fine\u2010tuning performance and security related configurations is an effective approach to optimizing the security\u2010efficiency tradeoff in video transmissions.",

            "abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Internet of Things (IoT) are the trends of network evolution. SDN mainly focuses on the upper level control and management of networks, while IoT aims to bring devices together to enable sharing and monitoring of real-time behaviours through network connectivity. On the one hand, IoT enables us to gather status of devices and networks and to control them remotely. On the other hand, the rapidly growing number of devices challenges the management at the access and backbone layer and raises security concerns of network attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The combination of SDN and IoT leads to a promising approach that could alleviate the management issue. Indeed, the flexibility and programmability of SDN could help in simplifying the network setup. However, there is a need to make a security enhancement in the SDN-based IoT network for mitigating attacks involving IoT devices. In this article, we discuss and analyse state-of-the-art DDoS attacks under SDN-based IoT scenarios. Furthermore, we verify our SDN sEcure COntrol and Data plane (SECOD) algorithm to resist DDoS attacks on the real SDN-based IoT testbed. Our results demonstrate that DDoS attacks in the SDN-based IoT network are easier to detect than in the traditional network due to IoT traffic predictability. We observed that random traffic (UDP or TCP) is more affected during DDoS attacks. Our results also show that the probability of a controller becoming halt is 10%, while the probability of a switch getting unresponsive is 40%.",

            "abstract": "Searchable Encryption (SE) is a technique that allows Cloud Service Providers to search over encrypted datasets without learning the content of queries and records. In recent years, many SE schemes have been proposed to protect outsourced data. However, most of them leak sensitive information, from which attackers could still infer the content of queries and records by mounting leakage-based inference attacks, such as the count attack and file-injection attack. In this work, first we define the leakage in searchable encrypted databases and analyse how the leakage is leveraged in existing leakage-based attacks. Second, we propose a Privacy-preserving Multi-cloud based dynamic symmetric SE scheme for relational Database (P-McDb). P-McDb has minimal leakage, which not only ensures confidentiality of queries and records but also protects the search, intersection, and size patterns. Moreover, P-McDb ensures both forward and backward privacy of the database. Thus, P-McDb could resist existing leakage-based attacks, e.g., active file/record-injection attacks. We give security definition and analysis to show how P-McDb hides the aforementioned patterns. Finally, we implemented a prototype of P-McDb and tested it using the TPC-H benchmark dataset. Our evaluation results show that users can get the required records in 2.16 s when searching over 4.1 million records.",

In this study, we will start by de\ufb01ning a conceptual ontology that integrates concepts that model all of cybersecurity entities.

            "abstract": "A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed system composed of a large number of nodes that allows users to request objects from nearby nodes. CDN not only reduces end-to-end latency on the user side but also offloads Content Providers (CPs), providing resilience against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. However, by caching objects and processing user requests, CDN providers could infer user preferences and the popularity of objects, thus resulting in information leakage. Unfortunately, such information leakage may result in loss of user privacy and reveal business-specific information to untrusted or compromised CDN providers. State-of-the-art solutions can protect the content of sensitive objects but cannot prevent CDN providers from inferring user preferences and the popularity of objects. In this work, we present a privacy-preserving encrypted CDN system to hide not only the content of objects and user requests, but also protect user preferences and the popularity of objects from curious CDN providers. We employ encryption to protect the objects and user requests in a way that both the CDNs and CPs can perform the search operations without accessing objects and requests in cleartext. Our proposed system is based on a scalable key management approach for multi-user access, where no key regeneration and data re-encryption are needed for user revocation. We have implemented a prototype of the system and show its practical efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development in the field of low power circuits and biosensors has created a new area in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), called Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). Medical implants are an integral part of a WBAN to measure, monitor, and control various medical conditions. These implants are generally injected inside the human body through an invasive surgical procedure with very limited energy resources available. In case the battery is depleted, the patient potentially needs to go for another surgery to replace the implant. Subsequently, it becomes imperative to propose energy efficient protocols to save energy in the implants. This work proposes a clustering mechanism in medical implants wherein the implants in the immediate proximity form clusters. In particular, the performance of the customized version of Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), modified for the implants' network, is analyzed. The results are compared with the contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocol such as pure ALOHA. In addition, a mathematical model to capture the energy consumption details of an implant network is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that a significant amount of energy can be saved using the proposed model. More precisely, the customized LEACH protocol consumes around 10 times less energy as compared to pure ALOHA.",

            "abstract": "Most recent theoretical literature on program obfuscation is based on notions like virtual black box (VBB) obfuscation and indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). These notions are very strong and are hard to satisfy. Further, they offer far more protection than is typically required in practical applications. On the other hand, the security notions introduced by software security researchers are suitable for practical designs but are not formal or precise enough to enable researchers to provide a quantitative security assurance. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a new formalism for practical program obfuscation that still allows rigorous security proofs. We believe our formalism will make it easier to analyse the security of obfuscation schemes. To show the flexibility and power of our formalism, we give a number of examples. Moreover, we explain the close relationship between our formalism and the task of providing obfuscation challenges.",

            "abstract": "The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has changed the way people socially interact with each other. A huge increase in the usage of social media applications has been observed due to quarantine strategies enforced by many governments across the globe. This has put a great burden on already overloaded cellular networks. It is believed that direct Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can offload a significant amount of traffic from cellular networks, especially during scenarios when residents in a locality aim to share information among them. WiFi Direct is one of the enabling technologies of D2D communications, having a great potential to facilitate various proximity-based applications. In this work, we propose power saving schemes that aim at minimizing energy consumption of user devices across D2D based multi-hop networks. Further, we provide an analytical model to formulate energy consumption of such a network. The simulation results demonstrate that a small modification in the network configuration, such as group size and transmit power can provide considerable energy gains. The observed energy consumption is reduced by 5 times for a throughput loss of 12%. Additionally, we measure the energy per transmitted bit for different configurations of the network. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the network, in terms of its energy consumption and throughput, for different file sizes.",

On the other hand, the convergence of these stakeholders to a common platform possesses many technical and business challenges. In this article, we identify the issues and challenges faced by V2X communications, while focusing on the business models. We propose different solutions to potentially resolve the identified challenges in the framework of 5G networks and propose a high-level hierarchy of a potential business model for a 5G-based V2X ecosystem.

            "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of modernday society. With increasingly digital societies, individuals have become more familiar and comfortable in using Online Social Networks (OSNs) for just about every aspect of their lives. This higher level of comfort leads to users spilling their emotions on OSNs and eventually their private information. In this work, we aim to investigate the relationship between users' emotions and private information in their tweets. Our research question is whether users' emotions, expressed in their tweets, affect their likelihood to reveal their own private information (privacy leakage) in subsequent tweets. In contrast to existing survey-based approaches, we use an inductive, data-driven approach to answer our research question. We use state-of-the-art techniques to classify users' emotions, and privacy scoring and employ a new technique involving BERT for binary detection of sensitive data. We use two parallel classification frameworks: one that takes the user's emotional state into account and the other for the detection of sensitive data in tweets. Consecutively, we identify individual cases of correlation between the two. We bring the two classifiers together to interpret the changes in both factors over time during a conversation between individuals. Variations were found with respect to the kinds of private information revealed in different states. Our results show that being in negative emotional states, such as sadness, anger or fear, leads to higher privacy leakage than otherwise.",

In this paper, we propose RevBloc to provide a customer review system with a high level of security, efficiency, and usability.

            "abstract": "Recently, real-world attacks against the web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) have arisen more frequently. The current PKI that use Registration Authorities/Certificate Authorities (RAs/CAs) model suffer from notorious security vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities are due to compromises of RAs, which lead to impersonation attacks resulting in CAs misbehaving to issue bogus certificates. To counter this problem, many approaches, such as Certificate Transparency (CT), ARPKI, and PoliCert, have been proposed. Nonetheless, no solution has yet gained widespread acceptance as a result of complexity and deployability issues. Moreover, existing approaches still require to satisfy complicated interactions and synchronisation among the entities that are involved during certificate issuance, updates, and revocations. In this paper, we propose a new Blockchain-Based PKI (BB-PKI) to address these vulnerabilities of CA misbehaviour caused by impersonation attacks against RAs. Certificate Issuance Request (CIR) should be vouched by manifold RAs. Multiple CAs shall sign and issue the certificate using an out-of-band secure communication channel. Any RA that contributes to the verification process of a user\u2019s request can publish the certificate in the blockchain by creating a smart contract certificate transaction. BB-PKI offers strong security guarantees, compromising $n - 1$ of the RAs or CAs is not enough to launch impersonation attacks, meaning that attackers cannot compromise more than the threshold of the latter signatures to launch an attack.",

            "abstract": "Satellite communication is becoming a complementary technology in future 5G and beyond networks due to its wider coverage. Similar to any terrestrial network, security has become a major concern in satellite networks. Due to a long distance between ground stations (GS) and satellite transponders and due to its inherited broadcast nature, satellite communication encounters certain limitations such as high bit error rate, high link delays, power control, and large round trip delays. The aforementioned limitations make security techniques proposed for terrestrial networks more challenging in satellite settings. Denial\u2010of\u2010service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks have become one of the most popular security threats in both the terrestrial and satellite networks. In this article, we present a DDoS mitigation technique that can be employed at the GS end in satellite networks. In particular, we simulate Internet Control Message Protocol echo request (ping) flooding across a satellite network and propose a proactive mitigation technique by restricting the number of echo requests a network entity can generate. The simulation results demonstrate that DDoS attacks can be mitigated in satellite networks without affecting the quality of experience of legitimate users.",

            "title": "Finding Rats in Cats: Detecting Stealthy Attacks using Group Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "Advanced attack campaigns span across multiple stages and stay stealthy for long time periods. There is a growing trend of attackers using off-the-shelf tools and pre-installed system applications (such as powershell and wmic) to evade the detection because the same tools are also used by system administrators and security analysts for legitimate purposes for their routine tasks. Such a dual nature of using these tools makes the analyst's task harder when it comes to spotting the difference between attack and benign activities. To start investigations, event logs can be collected from operational systems; however, these logs are generic enough and it often becomes impossible to attribute a potential attack to a specific attack group. Recent approaches in the literature have used anomaly detection techniques, which aim at distinguishing between malicious and normal behavior of computers or network systems. Unfortunately, anomaly detection systems based on point anomalies are too rigid in a sense that they could miss the malicious activity and classify the attack, not an outlier. Therefore, there is a research challenge to make better detection of malicious activities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we leverage Group Anomaly Detection (GAD), which detects anomalous collections of individual data points. Our approach is to build a neural network model utilizing Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE-alpha) in order to detect the activity of an attacker who leverages off-the-shelf tools and system applications. In addition, we also build Behavior2Vec and Command2Vec sentence embedding deep learning models specific for feature extraction tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our models on real-world datasets collected for a period of two months. Our method discovered 2 new attack tools used by targeted attack groups and multiple instances of malicious activity. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust in discovering targeted attacks, pen-tests, and attack campaigns leveraging custom tools.",

            "abstract": "Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise-based source camera attribution is a popular digital forensic method. In this method, a camera fingerprint computed from a set of known images of the camera is matched against the extracted noise of an anonymous questionable image to find out if the camera had taken the anonymous image. The possibility of privacy leak, however, is one of the main concerns of the PRNU-based method. Using the camera fingerprint (or the extracted noise), an adversary can identify the owner of the camera by matching the fingerprint with the noise of an image (or with the fingerprint computed from a set of images) crawled from a social media account. In this article, we address this privacy concern by encrypting both the fingerprint and the noise using the Boneh-Goh-Nissim (BGN) encryption scheme, and performing the matching in encrypted domain. To overcome leakage of privacy from the content of an image that is used in the fingerprint calculation, we compute the fingerprint within a trusted environment, such as ARM TrustZone. We present e-PRNU that aims at minimizing privacy loss and allows authorized forensic experts to perform camera attribution. The security analysis shows that the proposed approach is semantically secure. Experimental results show that the run-time computational overhead is 10.26 seconds when a cluster of 64 computing nodes are used.",

MedBloc captures a longitudinal view of the patient's health story and enables patients to give or withdraw consent for regulating access to their records.

            "abstract": "The process of identifying the true anomalies from a given set of data instances is known as anomaly detection. It has been applied to address a diverse set of problems in multiple application domains including cybersecurity. Deep learning has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on key anomaly detection applications, such as intrusion detection, Denial of Service (DoS) attack detection, security log analysis, and malware detection. Despite the great successes achieved by neural network architectures, models with very low test error have been shown to be consistently vulnerable to small, adversarially chosen perturbations of the input. The existence of evasion attacks during the test phase of machine learning algorithms represents a significant challenge to both their deployment and understanding. Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) generating adversarial examples in supervised machine learning in multiple domains; (b) countering the attacks with various defenses; (c) theoretical guarantees on the robustness of machine learning models by understanding their security properties. However, they have not covered, from the perspective of the anomaly detection task in a black box setting. The exploration of black box attack strategies, which reduce the number of queries for finding adversarial examples with high probability, is an important problem. In this paper, we study the security of black box deep anomaly detectors with a realistic threat model. We propose a novel black box attack in query constraint settings. First, we run manifold approximation on samples collected at attacker end for query reduction and understanding various thresholds set by underlying anomaly detector, and use spherical adversarial subspaces to generate attack samples. This method is well suited for attacking anomaly detectors where decision boundaries of nominal and abnormal classes are not very well defined and decision process is done with a set of thresholds on anomaly scores. We validate our attack on state-of-the-art deep anomaly detectors and show that the attacker goal is achieved under constraint settings. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and demonstrates that our strategy can be successfully used against other anomaly detectors.",

However, sensitive data could be exposed to malicious entities if brokers get compromised or hacked; or even worse, if brokers themselves are curious to learn about the data. A viable mechanism to protect sensitive publications and subscriptions is to encrypt the data before it is disseminated through the brokers. State-of-the-art approaches allow brokers to perform encrypted matching without revealing publications and subscriptions. However, if malicious brokers collude with malicious subscribers or publishers, they can learn the interests of innocent subscribers, even when the interests are encrypted. In this article, we present a pub/sub system that ensures confidentiality of publications and subscriptions in the presence of untrusted brokers. Furthermore, our solution resists collusion attacks between untrusted brokers and malicious subscribers (or publishers).

In recent years, many SE schemes have been proposed to protect outsourced data from CSPs. Unfortunately, most of them leak sensitive information, from which the CSPs could still infer the content of queries and records by mounting leakage-based inference attacks, such as the count attack and file injection attack. \nIn this work, first we define the leakage in searchable encrypted databases and analyse how the leakage is leveraged in existing leakage-based attacks. Second, we propose a Privacy-preserving Multi-cloud based dynamic symmetric SE (SSE) scheme for relational Database (P-McDb). P-McDb has minimal leakage, which not only ensures confidentiality of queries and records, but also protects the search, access, and size patterns from CSPs. Moreover, P-McDb ensures both forward and backward privacy of the database. Thus, P-McDb could resist existing leakage-based attacks, e.g., active file/record-injection attacks. We give security definition and analysis to show how P-McDb hides the aforementioned patterns. Finally, we implemented a prototype of P-McDb and test it using the TPC-H benchmark dataset. Our evaluation results show the feasibility and practical efficiency of P-McDb.",

Basically, a NIDS monitors network flows and compares them with a set of pre-defined suspicious patterns. To be effective, different intrusion detection algorithms and packet capturing methods have been implemented. With rapidly increasing network speeds, NIDSs face a challenging problem of monitoring large and diverse traffic volumes; in particular, high packet drop rates can have a significant impact on detection accuracy. In this work, we investigate three popular open-source NIDSs: Snort, Suricata, and Bro along with their comparative performance benchmarks. We investigate key factors (including system resource usage, packet processing speed and packet drop rate) that limit the applicability of NIDSs to large-scale networks. Moreover, we also analyse and compare the performance of NIDSs when configurations and traffic volumes are changed.",

            "abstract": "Typical smart city applications generally require two different communications infrastructures, a wide area cellular network to provide connectivity and long-range communications and efficient communication strategies for transmitting short data packets, particularly in case of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The cellular infrastructure is optimized for high data rates and large data sizes while IoT devices mostly exchange small data packets with high energy efficiency and low data rates. To fully exploit both communication infrastructures together, different strategies related to 5G and Device-to-Device (D2D) communications are proposed in literature. In this paper, we survey these strategies and provide useful considerations for seamless integration of smart city applications in 5G networks. Moreover, we present smart city scenarios, their communication requirements and the potential impact on the life of citizens. Finally, we elaborate big data impact on smart cities with possible security and privacy concerns.",

            "abstract": "Although the popularity of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is increasing, it is also vulnerable to security attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Since in SDN, the control plane is isolated from the data plane, DoS attackers can easily target the control plane to impair the network infrastructure in addition to the data plane to degrade the user's Quality of Service (QoS). In our previous work, we introduced SECO, an SDN Secure Controller algorithm to detect and defend SDN against DoS attacks. Simulation results showed that SECO successfully defends SDN networks from DoS attacks. In this paper, we present SDN sEcure COntrol and Data Plane (SECOD), which is an improved version of SECO. Basically, SECOD introduces new triggers to detect and prevent DoS attacks in both control and data planes. Moreover, SECOD is implemented and tested using SDN-based hardware testbed, OpenFlow-based switch, and RYU controller to capture the dynamics of realistic hardware and software. The results show that SECOD successfully detects and effectively mitigates DoS attacks on SDN networks keeping data plane performance at 99.72% compared to a network not under attack.",

            "abstract": "Outsourcing sensitive data and operations to untrusted cloud providers is considered a challenging issue. To perform a search operation, even if both the data and the query are encrypted, attackers still can learn which data locations match the query and what results are returned to the user. This kind of leakage is referred to as data access pattern. Indeed, using access pattern leakage, attackers can easily infer the content of the data and the query. Oblivious RAM (ORAM), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and secure Multi- Party Computation (MPC) offer a higher level of security but incur high computation and communication overheads. One promising practical approach to process the outsourced data efficiently and securely is leveraging trusted hardware like Intel SGX. Recently, several SGX- based solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, those solutions suffer from side channel attacks, high overheads of context switching, or limited SGX memory. In this paper, we present an SGX-assisted scheme for performing search over encrypted data. Our solution protects access pattern against side channel attacks while ensuring search efficiency. It can process large databases without requiring any long-term storage on SGX. We have implemented a prototype of the scheme and evaluated its performance using a dataset of 1 million records. The equality query and range query can be completed in 11 and 40 milliseconds, respectively. Comparing with ORAM- based solutions, such as ObliDB, our scheme is more than 10x faster.",

            "abstract": "Information security has been an area of research and teaching within various computing disciplines in higher education almost since the beginnings of modern computers. The need for security in computing curricula has steadily grown over this period. Recently, with an emerging global crisis, because of the limitations of security within the nascent information technology infrastructure, the field of \"cybersecurity\" is emerging with international interest and support. Recent evolution of cybersecurity shows that it has begun to take shape as a true academic perspective, as opposed to simply being a training domain for certain specialized jobs. This report starts from the premise that cybersecurity is a \"meta-discipline.\" That is, cybersecurity is used as an aggregate label for a wide variety of similar disciplines, much in the same way that the terms \"engineering\" and \"computing\" are commonly used. Thus, cybersecurity should be formally interpreted as a meta-discipline with a variety of disciplinary variants, also characterized through a generic competency model. The intention is that this simple organizational concept will improve the clarity with which the field matures, resulting in improved standards and goals for many different types of cybersecurity programs.",

            "abstract": "Traditional address scanning attacks mainly rely on the naive 'brute forcing' approach, where the entire IPv4 address space is exhaustively searched by enumerating different possibilities. However, such an approach is inefficient for IPv6 due to its vast subnet size (i.e., 2^64). As a result, it is widely assumed that address scanning attacks are less feasible in IPv6 networks. In this paper, we evaluate new IPv6 reconnaissance techniques in real IPv6 networks and expose how to leverage the Domain Name System (DNS) for IPv6 network reconnaissance. We collected IPv6 addresses from 5 regions and 100,000 domains by exploiting DNS reverse zone and DNSSEC records. We propose a DNS Guard (DNSG) to efficiently detect DNS reconnaissance attacks in IPv6 networks. DNSG is a plug and play component that could be added to the existing infrastructure. We implement DNSG using Bro and Suricata. Our results demonstrate that DNSG could effectively block DNS reconnaissance attacks.",

            "abstract": "Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise-based source camera attribution is a popular digital forensic method. In this method, a camera fingerprint computed from a set of known images of the camera is matched against the extracted noise of an anonymous questionable image to find if the camera had taken the anonymous image. The possibility of privacy leak, however, is one of the main concerns of the PRNU-based method. Using the camera fingerprint (or the extracted noise), an adversary can identify the owner of the camera by matching the fingerprint with the noise of an image (or with the fingerprint computed from a set of images) crawled from a social media account. In this paper, we address this privacy concern by encrypting both the fingerprint and the noise using the Boneh-Goh-Nissim (BGN) encryption scheme, and performing the matching in encrypted domain. To overcome leakage of privacy from the content of an image that is used in the fingerprint calculation, we compute the fingerprint within a trusted environment, such as ARM TrustZone. We present PANDORA that aims at minimizing privacy loss and allows authorized forensic experts to perform camera attribution.",

            "abstract": "User revocation is one of the main security issues in publish and subscribe (pub/sub) systems. Indeed, to ensure data confidentiality, the system should be able to remove malicious subscribers without affecting the functionalities and decoupling of authorised subscribers and publishers. To revoke a user, there are solutions, but existing schemes inevitably introduce high computation and communication overheads, which can ultimately affect the system capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel revocation technique for pub/sub systems that can efficiently remove compromised subscribers without requiring regeneration and redistribution of new keys as well as re-encryption of existing data with those keys. Our proposed solution is such that a subscriber's interest is not revealed to curious brokers and published data can only be accessed by the authorised subscribers. Finally, the proposed protocol is secure against the collusion attacks between brokers and revoked subscribers.",

            "abstract": "Although the popularity of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is increasing, it is also vulnerable to security attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Since in SDN, the control plane is isolated from the data plane, DoS attackers can easily target the control plane to impair the network infrastructure in addition to the data plane to degrade the user's Quality of Service (QoS). In our previous work, we introduced SECO, an SDN Secure Controller algorithm to detect and defend SDN against DoS attacks. Simulation results showed that SECO successfully defends SDN networks from DoS attacks. In this paper, we present SDN sEcure COntrol and Data Plane (SECOD), which is an improved version of SECO. Basically, SECOD introduces new triggers to detect and prevent DoS attacks in both control and data planes. Moreover, SECOD is implemented and tested using SDN-based hardware testbed, OpenFlow-based switch, and RYU controller to capture the dynamics of realistic hardware and software. The results show that SECOD successfully detects and effectively mitigates DoS attacks on SDN networks keeping data plane performance at 99.72% compared to a network not under attack.",

Moreover, the need to efficiently access Internet data is also increasing across 5G networks. Caching contents at the network edge is considered as a promising approach to reduce the delivery time. In this paper, we propose a marketplace for providing a number of caching options for a broad range of applications. In addition, we propose a security scheme to secure the caching contents with a simultaneous potential of reducing the duplicate contents from the caching server by dividing a file into smaller chunks. We model different caching scenarios in NS-3 and present the performance evaluation of our proposal in terms of latency and throughput gains for various chunk sizes.",

LBS rely on location of a device, where proximity estimation remains at its core. The applications of LBS range from social networking and marketing to vehicle-to-everything communications. In many of these applications, there is an increasing need and trend to learn the physical distance between nearby devices. This paper elaborates upon the current needs of proximity estimation in LBS and compares them against the available Localization and Proximity (LP) finding technologies (LP technologies in short). These technologies are compared for their accuracies and performance based on various different parameters, including latency, energy consumption, security, complexity, and throughput. Hereafter, a classification of these technologies, based on various different smart city applications, is presented. Finally, we discuss some emerging LP technologies that enable proximity estimation in LBS and present some future research areas.",

In this paper, we first propose a novel four-tier architecture of remote health monitoring system and then identify the security requirements and challenges at each tier. We provide a concise survey of the literature aimed at improving the security and privacy of WBANs and then present a comprehensive overview of the problem.

To this end, we elaborate on security threats and concerns in nano-networks and medical implants as well as we emphasize on presenting a holistic framework of an overall ecosystem for WBANs, which is essential to ensure end-to-end security.

This new technology enables various proximity-based services such as social networking, multimedia content distribution, cellular traffic offloading, Internet of Things (IoT), and mission critical communications. However, energy consumption of battery-constrained devices remains a major concern in all the aforementioned applications. In this paper, we model energy consumption of the WiFi direct protocol, starting from device discovery to actual data transmissions for intra group D2D communications. We simulate a content distribution scenario in Matlab and analyze our model for the energy consumption of the devices. We argue that the energy spent in device discovery becomes significant in the case of small data sizes. In particular, we find that smaller data sizes, such as 100KB, cause the equal amount of energy to spend in both device discovery and data transmission phases, even when the device discovery time is very small.",

We present a novel approach to teaching cyber security in a graduate course using an innovative assessment task that engages students in both software obfuscation and reverse engineering of obfuscated code. Students involved in the activities gain an appreciation of the challenges in defending against attacks.

Besides cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has recently been used for other applications, such as file storage. However, most of existing blockchain- based file storage systems can not revoke a user efficiently when multiple users have access to the same file that is encrypted. Actually, they need to update file encryption keys and distribute new keys to remaining users, which significantly increases computation and bandwidth overheads. In this work, we propose a blockchain and proxy re-encryption based design for encrypted file sharing that brings a distributed access control and data management. By combining blockchain with proxy re-encryption, our approach not only ensures confidentiality and integrity of files, but also provides a scalable key management mechanism for file sharing among multiple users. Moreover, by storing encrypted files and related keys in a distributed way, our method can resist collusion attacks between revoked users and distributed proxies.",

Basically, an NIDS monitors network flows and compares it with the pre-defined suspicious patterns. To be effective, different intrusion detection algorithms and packet capturing methods have been implemented. With rapidly increasing network speeds, NIDSs face a challenging problem of monitoring large and diverse traffic volumes; in particular, the high packet drop rate has a significant impact on detection accuracy. In this work, we investigate three popular open-source NIDSs: Snort, Suricata, and Bro along with their comparative performance benchmarks. We investigate key factors (including system resource usage, packet processing speed and packet drop rate) that limit applicability of NIDSs to large-scale networks. Moreover, we also analyse and compare the performance of NIDSs when configurations and traffic volumes are changed.",

This technology has a great potential to enable various proximity-based applications such as multimedia content distribution, social networking, cellular traffic offloading, mission critical communications, and Internet of Things (IoT). However, in such applications, energy consumption of battery-constrained devices is a major concern. In this paper, we propose a novel power saving protocol that aims at optimizing energy consumption and throughput of user devices by controlling the WiFi Direct group size and transmit power of the devices. We model a content distribution scenario in NS-3 and present the performance evaluation. Our simulation results demonstrate that even a small modification in the network configuration can provide a considerable energy gain with a minor effect on throughput. The observed energy saving can be as high as 1000% for a throughput loss of 12%.",

            "abstract": "With the evolution of cloud computing, organizations are outsourcing the storage and rendering of volume (i.e., 3D data) to cloud servers. Data confidentiality at the third-party cloud provider, however, is one of the main challenges. Although state-of-the-art non-homomorphic encryption schemes can protect confidentiality by encrypting the volume, they do not allow rendering operations on the encrypted volumes. In this chapter, we address this challenge by proposing 3DCrypt-a modified Paillier cryptosystem scheme for multiuser settings that allows cloud datacenters to render the encrypted volume. The rendering technique we consider in this work is the pre-classification volume ray-casting. 3DCrypt is such that multiple users can render volumes without sharing any encryption keys. 3DCrypt's storage and computational overheads are approximately 66.3 MB and 27 s, respectively, when rendering is performed on a 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 256 volume for a 256 \u00d7 256 image space. We have also proved that 3DCrypt is INDistinguishable under Chosen Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) secure.",

CDN not only reduces the end-to-end latency on the user side but also offloads Content Providers (CPs) providing resilience against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. However, by caching objects and processing users' requests, CDN service providers could infer user preferences and the popularity of objects, thus resulting in information leakage. Unfortunately, such information leakage may result in compromising users' privacy and reveal business-specific information to untrusted or potentially malicious CDN providers. State-of-the-art Searchable Encryption (SE) schemescan protect the content of sensitive objects but cannot preventthe CDN providers from inferring users' preferences and thepopularity of objects.,,,,In this work, we present a privacy-preserving encrypted CDN system not only to hide the content of objects and users' requests, but also to protect users' preferences and the popularity of objects from curious CDN providers. We encrypt the objects and user requests in a way that both the CDNs and CPs can perform the search operations without accessing those objects and requests in cleartext. Our proposed system is based on a scalable key management approach for multi-user access, where no key regeneration and data re-encryption are needed for user revocation.",

            "abstract": "Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has emerged as a new technology, which minimizes data transmission in radio access networks by leveraging direct interaction between nearby mobile devices. D2D communication has a great potential in solving the capacity bottleneck problem of cellular networks by offloading cellular traffic of proximity-based applications to D2D links. This provides several benefits including, but are not limited to, lower transfer delays, higher data rates, and better energy efficiency. However, security in D2D communication, which is equally essential for the success of D2D communication in future networks, is a less investigated topic in literature. In this paper, we propose the combination of the PGP and reputation-based model to bootstrap trust in D2D environments. Our proposal aims at minimizing any suspicious connection with selfish users. Offloading cellular traffic to trusted D2D links provides significant throughput gain over the conventional cellular network. Our results show that the capacity gain can be as high as 133%.",

            "abstract": "Automated and smart meters are devices that are able to monitor the energy consumption of electricity consumers in near real-time. They are considered key technological enablers of the smart grid, as the real-time consumption data that they can collect could enable new sophisticated billing schemes, could facilitate more efficient power distribution system operation and could give rise to a variety of value-added services. At the same time, the energy consumption data that the meters collect are sensitive consumer information; thus, privacy is a key concern and is a major inhibitor of real-time data collection in practice. In this paper, we review the different uses of metering data in the smart grid and the related privacy legislation. We then provide a structured overview, shortcomings, recommendations, and research directions of security solutions that are needed for privacy-preserving meter data delivery and management. We finally survey recent work on privacy-preserving technologies for meter data collection for the three application areas: 1) billing; 2) operations; and 3) value-added services including demand response.",

            "abstract": "With the surge of data breaches, practitioner ignorance and unprotected hardware, secure information management in healthcare environments is becoming a challenging problem. In the context of healthcare systems, confidentiality of patient data is of particular sensitivity. For economic reasons, cloud services are spreading, but there is still no clear solution to the problem of truly secure data storage at a remote location. To tackle this issue, we first examine if it is possible to have a secure storage of healthcare data without fully relying on trusted third-parties, and without impeding system usability on the side of the caregivers. The novelty of this approach is that it offers a standard-based deployable solution tailored for healthcare scenarios, using cloud services, but where trust is shifted from the cloud provider to the healthcare institution. This approach is unlike state-of-the-art solutions: there are secure cloud storage solutions that insist on having no knowledge of the stored data, but we discovered that they still require too much trust to manage user credentials, these credentials actually give them access to confidential data. In the paper, we present SPARER as a solution to the secure cloud storage problem and discuss the trade-offs of our approach. Moreover, we look at performance benchmarks that can hint to the feasibility and cost of using off-the-shelf cryptographic tools as building blocks in SPARER.",

Recent work by Danezis et al. [1] presents an approach for calculating DS in a privacy-preserving manner. However, the proposed solution has two drawbacks. First, it does not provide a mechanism to check the integrity of genomic data that is used to calculate the susceptibility and more importantly the computed result. Second, it lacks a mechanism to check the correctness of the performed DS test. In this paper, we present iGenoPri that aims at addressing both problems by employing the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and verifiable computing.",

            "abstract": "The management of identities on the Internet has evolved from the traditional approach (where each service provider stores and manages identities) to a federated identity management system (where identity management is delegated to a set of identity providers). On one hand, federated identity ensures usability and provides economic benefits to service providers. On the other hand, it poses serious privacy threats to users as well as service providers. The current technology, which is prevalently deployed on the Internet, allows identity providers to track the user's behavior across a broad range of services. In this work, we propose PRIMA, a universal credential-based authentication system for supporting federated identity management in a privacy-preserving manner. Basically, PRIMA does not require any interaction between service providers and identity providers during the authentication process, thus preventing identity providers to profile users' behavior. Moreover, throughout the authentication process, PRIMA provides a mechanism for controlled disclosure of the users' private information. We have conducted comprehensive evaluations of the system to show the feasibility of our approach. Our performance analysis shows that an identity provider can process 1,426 to 3,332 requests per second when the key size is varied from 1024 to 2048-bit, respectively.",

Communicating parties exchange and validate these certificates, the validation fails if a certificate has been revoked. In this paper we propose the Certificate Revocation Guard (CRG) to efficiently check certificate revocation while minimising bandwidth, latency and storage overheads. CRG is based on OCSP, which caches the status of certificates locally. CRG could be installed on the user's machine, at the organisational proxy or even at the ISP level. Compared to a naive approach (where a client checks the revocation status of all certificates in the chain on every request), CRG decreases the bandwidth overheads and network latencies by 95%. Using CRG incurs 69% lower storage overheads compared to the CRL method. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to improve certificate revocation.",

Although this outsourcing has many advantages, ensuring data confidentiality in the cloud is one of the main concerns. There are state-of-the-art encryption schemes for ensuring confidentiality in the cloud. However, such schemes do not allow cloud datacenters to perform operations over encrypted images. In this paper, we address this concern by proposing 2DCrypt, a modified Paillier cryptosystem-based image scaling and cropping scheme for multi-user settings that allows cloud datacenters to scale and crop an image in the encrypted domain. To anticipate a high storage overhead resulted from the naive per-pixel encryption, we propose a space-efficient tiling scheme that allows tile-level image scaling and cropping operations. Basically, instead of encrypting each pixel individually, we are able to encrypt a tile of pixels. 2DCrypt is such that multiple users can view or process the images without sharing any encryption keys-a requirement desirable for practical deployments in real organizations. Our analysis and results show that 2DCrypt is INDistinguishable under Chosen Plaintext Attack secure and incurs an acceptable overhead. When scaling a 512\u00d7512 image by a factor of two, 2DCrypt requires an image user to download approximately 5.3 times more data than the un-encrypted scaling and need to work approximately 2.3 s more for obtaining the scaled image in a plaintext.",

            "title": "E-GRANT: Enforcing Encrypted Dynamic Security Constraints in the Cloud",
            "abstract": "Cloud computing is an established paradigm that attracts enterprises for offsetting the cost to more competitive outsource data centres. Considering economic benefits offered by this paradigm, organisations could outsource data storage and computational services. However, data in the cloud environment is within easy reach of service providers. One of the strong obstacles in widespread adoption of the cloud is to preserve confidentiality of the data. Generally, confidentiality of the data could be guaranteed by employing existing encryption schemes. For regulating access to the data, organisations require access control mechanisms. Unfortunately, access policies in clear text might leak information about the data they aim to protect. The major research challenge is to enforce dynamic access policies at runtime, i.e., Enforcement of dynamic security constraints (including dynamic separation of duties and Chinese wall) in the cloud. The main challenge lies in the fact that dynamic security constraints require notion of sessions for managing access histories that might leak information about the sensitive data if they are available as clear text in the cloud. In this paper, we present E-GRANT: an architecture able to enforce dynamic security constraints without relying on a trusted infrastructure, which can be deployed as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). In E-GRANT, sessions' access histories are encrypted in such a way that enforcement of constraints is still possible. As a proof-of-concept, we have implemented a prototype and provide a preliminary performance analysis showing a limited overhead, thus confirming the feasibility of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Opportunistic networks have recently received considerable attention from both industry and researchers. These networks can be used for many applications without the need for a dedicated IT infrastructure. In the context of opportunistic networks, content sharing in particular has attracted significant attention. To support content sharing, opportunistic networks often implement a publish-subscribe system in which users may publish their own content and indicate interest in other content through subscriptions. Using a smartphone, any user can act as a broker by opportunistically forwarding both published content and interests within the network. Unfortunately, opportunistic networks are faced with serious privacy and security issues. Untrusted brokers can not only compromise the privacy of subscribers by learning their interests but also can gain unauthorised access to the disseminated content. This paper addresses the research challenges inherent to the exchange of content and interests without: (i) compromising the privacy of subscribers, and (ii) providing unauthorised access to untrusted brokers. Specifically, this paper presents an interest and content sharing solution that addresses these security challenges and preserves privacy in opportunistic networks. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the solution by implementing a prototype and analysing its performance on smart phones.",

            "abstract": "The enforcement of sensitive policies in untrusted environments is still an open challenge for policy-based systems. On the one hand, taking any appropriate security decision requires access to these policies. On the other hand, if such access is allowed in an untrusted environment then confidential information might be leaked by the policies. The key challenge is how to enforce sensitive policies and protect content in untrusted environments. In the context of untrusted environments, we mainly distinguish between outsourced and distributed environments. The most attractive paradigms concerning outsourced and distributed environments are cloud computing and opportunistic networks, respectively. \nIn this dissertation, we present the design, technical and implementation details of our proposed policy-based access control mechanisms for untrusted environments. First of all, we provide full confidentiality of access policies in outsourced environments, where service providers do not learn private information about policies. We support expressive policies and take into account contextual information. The system entities do not share any encryption keys. For complex user management, we offer the full-fledged Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. \nIn opportunistic networks, we protect content by specifying expressive policies. In our proposed approach, brokers match subscriptions against policies associated with content without compromising privacy of subscribers. As a result, unauthorised brokers neither gain access to content nor learn policies and authorised nodes gain access only if they satisfy policies specified by publishers. Our proposed system provides scalable key management in which loosely-coupled publishers and subscribers communicate without any prior contact. Finally, we have developed a prototype of the system that runs on real smartphones and analysed its performance.",

            "abstract": "Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm offering companies (virtually) unlimited data storage and computation at attractive costs. It is a cost-effective model because it does not require deployment and maintenance of any dedicated IT infrastructure. Despite its benefits, it introduces new challenges for protecting the confidentiality of the data. Sensitive data like medical records, business or governmental data cannot be stored unencrypted on the cloud. Companies need new mechanisms to control access to the outsourced data and allow users to query the encrypted data without revealing sensitive information to the cloud provider. State-of-the-art schemes do not allow complex encrypted queries over encrypted data in a multi-user setting. Instead, those are limited to keyword searches or conjunctions of keywords. This paper extends work on multi-user encrypted search schemes by supporting SQL-like encrypted queries on encrypted databases. Furthermore, we introduce access control on the data stored in the cloud, where any administrative actions (such as updating access rights or adding/deleting users) do not require re-distributing keys or re-encryption of data. Finally, we implemented our scheme and presented its performance, thus showing feasibility of our approach.",

The period types are: pre-incident (messages talking about prevention, mitigation, and preparedness), during-incident (messages sent while the incident is taking place), and post-incident (messages related to the response, recovery, and reconstruction). We show that our detection method can effectively identify incident-related messages with high precision and recall, and that our incident-period classification method outperforms standard machine learning classification methods.",

            "abstract": "The notion of patient's consent plays a major role in granting access to medical data. In typical healthcare systems, consent is captured by a form that the patient has to fill in and sign. In e-Health systems, the paper-form consent is being replaced by the integration of the notion of consent in the mechanisms that regulate the access to the medical data. This helps in empowering the patient with the capability of granting and revoking consent in a more effective manner. However, the process of granting and revoking consent greatly varies according to the situation in which the patient is. Our main argument is that such a level of detail is very difficult and error-prone to capture as a set of authorisation policies. In this paper, we present ACTORS, a goal-driven approach to manage consent. The main idea behind ACTORS is to leverage the goal-driven approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming for managing consent that takes into account changes regarding the domains and contexts in which the patient is providing her consent.",

            "abstract": "The vision of the multimedia world is that digital content can be freely shared and moved between all kinds of devices. This would be possible for both, unprotected and protected contents. Currently, various Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems are used to control access on the protected content. The most famous examples include Apple Fairplay, Windows Media DRM, Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM, and Marlin DRM. The protected content format, license management, and trust management differs from one DRM system to another. Therefore, it is necessary to mediate those differences to make DRM systems interoperable. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the approaches for DRM interoperability. Each DRM system has its own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) domain to manage the trust between different entities like devices and license servers. However, if the entities belong to two similar DRM systems but each having different trust anchor then there is a need of trust establishment that can be achieved through Interoperability in PKI. After analysis of the requirements and studying existing solutions like OMArlin and Coral, a new concept of Generic Interoperability Solution is proposed to achieve the interoperability between different DRM systems. The proposed solution does not require changes to the implementations at the device end. Instead, it introduces a new entity named Content Format Translation (CFT) that communicates with license servers in both DRM systems. A CFT may be a Web service or a device in the home environment to transfer the translated content from one device to another. Moreover, the proposed solution also requires the interaction between both license servers to move the rights from one DRM system to another. This interaction is accomplished through interoperability in PKI. Dedicated to My parents and brothers for their utmost care, endless love, and support throughout the course of my studies.",
