            "abstract": "We develop stochastic dynamical reduced-order models of wind farm turbulence that capture the effects of yaw misalignment due to control or atmospheric variability on turbine wakes and their interactions. Our models are based on the stochastically forced linearized Navier-Stokes equations around analytical descriptions of the wake velocity provided by low-fidelity engineering wake models. The power-spectral density of the source of additive stochastic excitation is identified via convex optimization to ensure statistical consistency with high-fidelity models while preserving model parsimony. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in capturing turbulence intensity variations in accordance with large-eddy simulations of the flow over a cascade of wind turbines. While our models are developed to match velocity correlations from sensors that are placed directly behind perfectly aligned wind turbine rotors, their predictions maintain a desirable level of accuracy even when the turbines are yawed.",

Our main contribution is a complete characterization, up to logarithmic factors, of the minimax regret in terms of the auction\u2019s transparency, which controls the amount of information on competing bids disclosed by the auctioneer at the end of each auction. Our results hold under different assumptions (stochastic, adversarial, and their smoothed variants) on the environment generating the bidder\u2019s valuations and competing bids. These minimax rates reveal how the interplay between transparency and the nature of the environment affects how fast one can learn to bid optimally in first-price auctions.",

            "abstract": "Fair allocation of indivisible goods has attracted extensive attention over the last two decades, yielding numerous elegant algorithmic results and producing challenging open questions. The problem becomes much harder in the presence of strategic agents. Ideally, one would want to design truthful mechanisms that produce allocations with fairness guarantees. However, in the standard setting without monetary transfers, it is generally impossible to have truthful mechanisms that provide non-trivial fairness guarantees. Recently, Amanatidis et al. [2021] suggested the study of mechanisms that produce fair allocations in their equilibria. Specifically, when the agents have additive valuation functions, the simple Round-Robin algorithm always has pure Nash equilibria and the corresponding allocations are envy-free up to one good (EF1) with respect to the agents' true valuation functions. Following this agenda, we show that this outstanding property of the Round-Robin mechanism extends much beyond the above default assumption of additivity. In particular, we prove that for agents with cancelable valuation functions (a natural class that contains, e.g., additive and budget-additive functions), this simple mechanism always has equilibria and even its approximate equilibria correspond to approximately EF1 allocations with respect to the agents' true valuation functions. Further, we show that the approximate EF1 fairness of approximate equilibria surprisingly holds for the important class of submodular valuation functions as well, even though exact equilibria fail to exist!",

We provide a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms under different feedback models in the two cases where the learner can post either the same or different prices to buyers and sellers. We begin by showing that the minimax regret after $T$ rounds is of order $\\sqrt{T}$ in the full-feedback scenario. Under partial feedback, any algorithm that has to post the same price to buyers and sellers suffers worst-case linear regret. However, when the learner can post two different prices at each round, we design an algorithm enjoying regret of order $T^{3/4}$ ignoring log factors. We prove that this rate is optimal by presenting a surprising $T^{3/4}$ lower bound, which is the main technical contribution of the paper.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the study of designing allocation mechanisms for fairly allocating indivisible goods in settings with interdependent valuation functions. In our setting, there is a set of goods that needs to be allocated to a set of agents (without disposal). Each agent is given a private signal, and his valuation function depends on the signals of all agents. Without the use of payments, there are strong impossibility results for designing strategyproof allocation mechanisms even in settings without interdependent values. Therefore, we turn to design mechanisms that always admit equilibria that are fair with respect to their true signals, despite their potentially distorted perception. To do so, we first extend the definitions of pure Nash equilibrium and well-studied fairness notions in literature to the interdependent setting. We devise simple allocation mechanisms that always admit a fair equilibrium with respect to the true signals. We complement this result by showing that, even for very simple cases with binary additive interdependent valuation functions, no allocation mechanism that always admits an equilibrium, can guarantee that all equilibria are fair with respect to the true signals.",

            "abstract": "We study fully dynamic online selection problems in an adversarial/stochastic setting that includes Bayesian online selection, prophet inequalities, posted price mechanisms, and stochastic probing problems subject to combinatorial constraints. In the classical ``incremental'' version of the problem, selected elements remain active until the end of the input sequence. On the other hand, in the fully dynamic version of the problem, elements stay active for a limited time interval, and then leave. This models, for example, the online matching of tasks to workers with task/worker-dependent working times, and sequential posted pricing of perishable goods. A successful approach to online selection problems in the adversarial setting is given by the notion of Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS), that uses a priori information to formulate a linear relaxation of the underlying optimization problem, whose optimal fractional solution is rounded online for any adversarial order of the input sequence. Our main contribution is providing a general method for constructing an OCRS for fully dynamic online selection problems. Then, we show how to employ such OCRS to construct no-regret algorithms in a partial information model with semi-bandit feedback and adversarial inputs.",

            "abstract": "According to recent research, geometric deep learning allows to reach unprecedented accuracy for online misinformation detection. By fully leveraging the news social context, URL propagation paths in social networks are first represented as graphs and then classified using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Despite these remarkable efforts, researchers are still hampered by the scarcity of high-quality benchmark datasets, and as a result, the efficacy of state-of-the-art approaches could be overestimated. So far, in order to obtain a decent number of third-party fact-checked URLs, researchers have either sampled news from notoriously reliable and unreliable sources using distant supervision, or they have gathered pre-labeled URLs from third-party fact-checking websites. In the former case, resulting datasets can be quite large, but also noisy and biased since pieces of news are labeled as true or false according to their source label, and not individually fact-checked. In the latter case, assigned labels are more reliable, but the included news articles are usually in a single language and they may reflect unknown editorial decisions. As a result, datasets of the latter type are typically small, homogeneous, and thus unrealistically easy for automatic fake news detection models. In this work, we present FbMultiLingMisinfo, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, aimed at a more realistic evaluation of state-of-the-art misinformation detection models. URLs in our dataset come from the Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Data Set, which we augmented with their propagation paths on Twitter. Our experimental results show that, when GNN-based models are tested on FbMultiLingMisinfo, recent misinformation detection results are only partially confirmed. We further show that a sharp reduction in the training size significantly reduces the model accuracy on FbMultiLingMisinfo, but not on two other widely used benchmark datasets for fake news detection.",

            "abstract": "We study truthful mechanisms for welfare maximization in online bipartite matching. In our (multi-parameter) setting, every buyer is associated with a (possibly private) desired set of items, and has a private value for being assigned an item in her desired set. Unlike most online matching settings, where agents arrive online, in our setting the items arrive one by one in an adversarial order while the buyers are present for the entire duration of the process. This poses a significant challenge to the design of truthful mechanisms, due to the ability of buyers to strategize over future rounds. We provide an almost full picture of the competitive ratios in different scenarios, including myopic vs. non-myopic agents, tardy vs. prompt payments, and private vs. public desired sets. Among other results, we identify the frontier up to which the celebrated $$e/(e-1)$$\n \n e\n /\n (\n e\n -\n 1\n )\n \n competitive ratio for the vertex-weighted online matching of Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani extends to truthful agents and online items.\n",
