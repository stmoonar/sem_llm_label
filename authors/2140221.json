            "title": "Host-Centric Social Connectedness of Migrants in Europe on Facebook",
            "abstract": "Extant literature has explored the social integration process of migrants settling in host communities. However, this literature typically takes a migrant-centric view, implicitly putting the burden of a successful integration on the migrant, and trying to identify the factors that lead to integration along various dimensions. In this paper, we flip this point of view by studying the attributes of natives that govern their propensity to form social ties with migrants.We do so by using anonymous and aggregate social network data provided by Facebook\u2019s advertising platform. More specifically, we look at factors that influence the propensity for a likely-to-be non-Muslim Facebook user to have at least one social connection to a Facebook user who celebrates Ramadan. Given that, in the European context, following Islam is predominantly tied to a migration background, this gives us a lens into cross-cultural native-migrant connectivity. Our study considers demographic attributes of the host population, such as age, gender, and education level, as well as spatial variation across 30 European cities. Our findings suggest that young, educated, and male Facebook users are relatively more likely to build cross-cultural ties, compared to older, less educated, and female Facebook users. We also observe heterogeneity across the analyzed cities.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the factors that explain why people move \u2013 or stay \u2013 and where they go, is a central goal of migration research. This article improves our understanding of migration aspirations of professionals in Europe by leveraging a previously untapped data source: aggregate-level information on LinkedIn users open to work-related international relocation, accessed through the LinkedIn Recruiter platform. We collected data at regular intervals from Oct. 2020 to Sept. 2021. First, we offer descriptive statistics of proxies for migration aspirations (or lack thereof) for millions of Linkedin users in Europe. Then we approach our questions using a standardization technique, based on gravity models of migration, in order to account for a number of biases in the data, including uneven use of LinkedIn across countries. We found that, in absolute terms, countries in Northern and Western Europe are the most attractive ones when considering LinkedIn users open to work-related relocation (about 60%), followed by Southern Europe (about 40%) and Eastern Europe (30%). We also observed substantial heterogeneity in directionality of aspirations: for example, roughly 20% of LinkedIn users would relocate from Western to Northern Europe, while less than 10% would relocate from Northern to Western Europe. After accounting for differences in population density, geographic and linguistic distances, as well as internet and LinkedIn penetration, we observed that, in relative terms, Southern Europe appears to be a highly desired destination for professionals, indicating that there is potential for changing patterns in actual flows, should more opportunities for professionals arise in Southern Europe.",

We investigate the association between the threat perception of COVID-19 and the use of face masks, and its stratification along the lines of vulnerability. We leverage data from a large cross-national online survey, the \u201cCOVID-19 Health Behavior Survey\u201d (CHBS), that we conducted on Facebook via targeted advertisements. Specifically, we analysed a sample of 91,376 completed questionnaires collected from March 13 to May 7, 2020 in seven European countries and in the United States. We found evidence that both the adoption of face masks and the threat perception to oneself were higher among the vulnerable segments of the populations, especially for those with a comorbidity, those who had been vaccinated for influenza, and older adults. Overall, we estimated that individuals who perceived a high threat of COVID-19 to themselves were 2.25 times (95% CI: 1.94\u20132.60) more likely to wear a face mask than those with lower threat perception. Our results also show how vulnerabilities can accumulate, leading to higher levels of threat perception and protective behavior against the virus.",

            "abstract": "Germany has become a major country of immigration, as well as a research powerhouse in Europe. As Germany spends a higher fraction of its GDP on research and development than most countries with advanced economies, there is an expectation that Germany should be able to attract and retain international scholars who have high citation performance. Using an exhaustive set of over eight million Scopus publications, we analyze the trends in international migration to and from Germany among published researchers over the past 24 years. We assess changes in institutional affiliations for over one million researchers who have published with a German affiliation address at some point during the 1996-2020 period. We show that while Germany has been highly integrated into the global movement of researchers, with particularly strong ties to the US, the UK, and Switzerland, the country has been sending more published researchers abroad than it has attracted. While the balance has been largely negative over time, analyses disaggregated by gender, citation performance, and field of research show that compositional differences in migrant flows may help to alleviate persistent gender inequalities in selected fields.",

            "abstract": "Censuses and representative sampling surveys around the world are key sources of data to guide government investments and public policies. However, these sources are very expensive to obtain and are collected relatively infrequently. Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in the use of data from social media to complement more traditional data sources. However, social media users are not representative of the general population. Thus, analyses based on social media data require statistical adjustments, like post-stratification, in order to remove the bias and make solid statistical claims. These adjustments are possible only when we have information about the frequency of demographic groups using social media. These data, when compared with official statistics, enable researchers to produce appropriate statistical correction factors. In this paper, we leverage the Facebook advertising platform to compile the equivalent of an aggregate-level census of Facebook users. Our compilation includes the population distribution for seven demographic attributes such as gender, political leaning, and educational attainment at different geographic levels for the U.S. (country, state, and city). By comparing the Facebook counts with official reports provided by the U.S. Census and Gallup, we found very high correlations, especially for political leaning and race. We also identified instances where official statistics may be underestimating population counts as in the case of immigration. We use the information collected to calculate bias correction factors for all computed attributes in order to evaluate the extent to which different demographic groups are more or less represented on Facebook, and to derive the actual distributions for specific audiences of interest. We provide the first comprehensive analysis for assessing biases in Facebook users across several dimensions. This information can be used to generate bias-adjusted population estimates and demographic counts in a timely way and at fine geographic granularity in between data releases of official statistics.",

            "abstract": "Measuring the affinity to a particular culture has been an active area of research. Countries and their residents can be characterized by many cultural aspects, such as clothing, music, art and food. As one of the central aspects, the cuisine of a country can reflect one of the dominant aspects of its culture. As such, the number of people interested in a typical national dish can be used to estimate the prevalence of that culture inside the host region. In this study, we measure the global spread of Brazilian culture across countries by exploring Facebook user\u2019s preferences for typical Brazilian dishes through the Facebook Advertising Platform. To decide which dish will be considered typical from Brazil, we made use of spatial analysis to understand the distribution of interests around the world and to quantify how typical the dish is in Brazil and among Brazilian immigrants. This methodology can be generalized to other countries to infer cultural elements that emigrants usually take to and preserve in the countries they migrate to. Also, the interest in Brazilian typical dishes can be used to characterize countries in terms of Brazilian cultural exposition. While evaluating the cultural distance between Brazil and the countries with more Brazilian immigrants, we explore several measures of distance to compare these in the context of affinity to Brazilian cuisine. Our results revealed that these cultural distance measures can complement other metrics of distance applied to gravity-type models, for example, in order to explain flows of people between countries.",

            "abstract": "Reliable and timely estimates of migration flows are needed to guide our policy decisions and to improve our understanding of migration processes. However, obtaining timely and fine-grained estimates remains an elusive goal. Digital data provide granular information on time and space based on large sample sizes, but because these samples are often not representative of the general population, the estimates obtained by analyzing these data are biased. We propose a generic method for combining digital and survey data for the purposes of migration estimation by accounting for the bias structure of digital data. Specifically, we show that if the bias has a structure over time and space that can be statistically modeled, we can combine different sources of data for the purposes of prediction. We illustrate our approach by combining geo-located Twitter data for more than two million users (2010-2016) with data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to estimate state-level emigration in the United States. We propose a joint model that draws from both ACS and Twitter data by modeling the spatial and temporal correlation structure of Twitter biases. We show that while Twitter-based estimates are upwardly biased, when these estimates are combined with ACS estimates, the resulting predictions of internal migration flows are more accurate than predictions based on ACS data only. Our method can be used to forecast future migration flows or to fill in missing time periods for which survey estimates are not available. Finally, our model is flexible and can be extended to incorporate multiple sources of data, such as Twitter data, cellphone records, administrative reports, and survey estimates.",

            "title": "Modelling International Migration Flows by Integrating Multiple Data Sources",
            "abstract": "Migration has become a significant source of population change at the global level, with broad societal implications. Although understanding the drivers of migration is critical to enacting effective policies, theoretical advances in the study of migration processes have been limited by the lack of data on flows of migrants, or by the fragmented nature of these flows. In this paper, we build on existing Bayesian modeling strategies to develop a statistical framework for integrating different types of data on migration flows. We offer estimates, as well as associated measures of uncertainty, for immigration, emigration, and net migration flows among 31 European countries, by combining administrative and household survey data from 2002 to 2015. Substantively, we document the historical impact of the EU enlargement and the free movement of workers in Europe on migration flows. Methodologically, our approach improves on the Integrated Modeling of European Migration (IMEM) framework by providing a robust statistical framework for evaluating recent migration trends that is flexible enough to be further extended to incorporate new data sources, like social media.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are assimilating culturally has been widely debated. To examine this question, we focus on musical taste, a key symbolic resource that signals the social positions of individuals. We adapt an assimilation metric from earlier work to analyze self-reported musical interests among immigrants in Facebook. We use the relative levels of interest in musical genres, where a similarity to the host population in musical preferences is treated as evidence of cultural assimilation. Contrary to skeptics of Mexican assimilation, we find significant cultural convergence even among first-generation immigrants, which problematizes their use as assimilative \u201cbenchmarks\u201d in the literature. Further, 2nd generation Mexican Americans show high cultural convergence vis-\u00e0-vis both Anglos and African-Americans, with the exception of those who speak Spanish. Rather than conforming to a single assimilation path, our findings reveal how Mexican immigrants defy simple unilinear theoretical expectations and illuminate their uniquely heterogeneous character.",
