            "title": "Reconstructing physiological signals from fMRI across the adult lifespan",
            "abstract": "Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph1, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.",

            "abstract": "A prominent goal of neuroimaging studies is mapping the human brain, in order to identify and delineate functionally-meaningful regions and elucidate their roles in cognitive behaviors. These brain regions are typically represented by atlases that capture general trends over large populations. Despite being indispensable to neuroimaging experts, population-level atlases do not capture individual differences in functional organization. In this work, we present an interactive visualization method, PRAGMA, that allows domain experts to derive scan-specific parcellations from established atlases. PRAGMA features a user-driven, hierarchical clustering scheme for defining temporally correlated parcels in varying granularity. The visualization design supports the user in making decisions on how to perform clustering, namely when to expand, collapse, or merge parcels. This is accomplished through a set of linked and coordinated views for understanding the user\u2019s current hierarchy, assessing intra-cluster variation, and relating parcellations to an established atlas. We assess the effectiveness of PRAGMA through a user study with four neuroimaging domain experts, where our results show that PRAGMA shows the potential to enable exploration of individualized and state-specific brain parcellations and to offer interesting insights into functional brain networks.",

            "title": "Learning 3D White Matter Microstructure from 2D Histology",
            "abstract": "Histological analysis is typically the gold standard for validating measures of tissue microstructure derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts. However, most histological investigations are inherently 2-dimensional (2D), due to increased field-of-view, higher in-plane resolutions, ease of acquisition, decreased costs, and a large number of available contrasts compared to 3-dimensional (3D) analysis. Because of this, it would be of great interest to be able to learn the 3D tissue microstructure from 2D histology. In this study, we use diffusion MRI (dMRI) of a squirrel monkey brain and corresponding myelin stained sections in combination with a convolution neural network to learn the relationship between the 3D diffusion estimated axonal fiber orientation distributions and the 2D myelin stain. We find that we are able to estimate the 3D fiber distribution with moderate to high angular agreement with the ground truth (median angular correlation coefficients of 0.48 across the unseen slices). This network could be used to validate dMRI neuronal structural measurements in 3D, even if only 2D histology is available for validation. Generalization is possible to transfer this network to human stained sections to infer the 3D fiber distribution at resolutions currently unachievable with dMRI, which would allow diffusion fiber tractography at unprecedented resolutions. We envision the use of similar networks to learn other 3D microstructural measures from an array of potential common 2D histology contrasts.",

            "title": "Harmonizing 1.5T/3T diffusion weighted MRI through development of deep learning stabilized microarchitecture estimators",
            "abstract": "Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is interpreted as a quantitative method that is sensitive to tissue microarchitecture at a millimeter scale. However, the sensitization is dependent on acquisition sequences (e.g., diffusion time, gradient strength, etc.) and susceptible to imaging artifacts. Hence, comparison of quantitative DW-MRI biomarkers across field strengths (including different scanners, hardware performance, and sequence design considerations) is a challenging area of research. We propose a novel method to estimate microstructure using DW-MRI that is robust to scanner difference between 1.5T and 3T imaging. We propose to use a null space deep network (NSDN) architecture to model DW-MRI signal as fiber orientation distributions (FOD) to represent tissue microstructure. The NSDN approach is consistent with histologically observed microstructure (on previously acquired ex vivo squirrel monkey dataset) and scan-rescan data. The contribution of this work is that we incorporate identical dual networks (IDN) to minimize the influence of scanner effects via scan-rescan data. Briefly, our estimator is trained on two datasets. First, a histology dataset was acquired on three squirrel monkeys with corresponding DW-MRI and confocal histology (512 independent voxels). Second, 37 control subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (67-95 y/o) were identified who had been scanned at 1.5T and 3T scanners (b-value of 700 s/mm2, voxel resolution at 2.2mm, 30-32 gradient volumes) with an average interval of 4 years (standard deviation 1.3 years). After image registration, we used paired white matter (WM) voxels for 17 subjects and 440 histology voxels for training and 20 subjects and 72 histology voxels for testing. We compare the proposed estimator with super-resolved constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and a previously presented regression deep neural network (DNN). NSDN outperformed CSD and DNN in angular correlation coefficient (ACC) 0.81 versus 0.28 and 0.46, mean squared error (MSE) 0.001 versus 0.003 and 0.03, and general fractional anisotropy (GFA) 0.05 versus 0.05 and 0.09. Further validation and evaluation with contemporaneous imaging are necessary, but the NSDN is promising avenue for building understanding of microarchitecture in a consistent and device-independent manner.",

            "abstract": "Reproducible identification of white matter tracts across subjects is essential for the study of structural connectivity of the human brain. One of the key challenges is anatomical differences between subjects. Labeling white matter regions of interest presents many challenges due to the need to integrate both local and global information. Clearly communicating the human/manual processes to capture this information is cumbersome, and the state-of-the-art for white matter atlas is the population-averaged Johns Hopkins Eve atlas. A critical bottleneck with the Eve atlas framework is that manual labeling time is extensive and peripheral white matter regions are conservatively labeled. In this work, we developed and tested a protocol for a simpler and flexible approach based on modern tractography definitions. The TractEM protocols for whole brain tractography take less than 6 hours for one subject. We tested the protocols on 61 unique tracts for 20 subjects manually labeled at least twice per subject. We analyzed reproducibility of the fiber bundles using volumetric overlap metrics, Dice correlation coefficient, continuous Dice correlation coefficient; distance metric, root mean squared error; and probabilistic intraclass correlation (ICC). Raters with minimal neuroanatomical expertise attained good and high reproducibility for typical 3T research resolution and high-resolution Human Connectome Project datasets, respectively. While the existing tractography methods tend to cover larger tracts and target only a limited number of tracts, the TractEM manual labeling protocols allow for reconstruction of reproducible region-specific fiber bundles across the brain. The protocols and sample results have been made available in open source.",
