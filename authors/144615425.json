            "abstract": "The year 2023 marks the thirty-second anniversary of the World Wide Web being announced. In the intervening years, the web has become an essential part of the fabric of society. Part of that is that huge amounts of information that used to be available (only) on paper is now available (only) electronically. One of the dangers of this is that owners of information often treat the data as ephemeral, and delete old information once it becomes out of date. As a result society is at risk of losing large parts of its history. So it is time to assess how we use the web, how it has been designed, and what we should do to ensure that in one hundred years time (and beyond) we will still be able to access, and read, what we are now producing. We can still read 100 year-old books; that should not be any different for the web. This paper takes a historical view of the web, and discusses the web from its early days: why it was successful compared with other similar systems emerging at the time, the things it did right, the mistakes that were made, and how it has developed to the web we know today, to what extent it meets the requirements needed for such an essential part of society's infrastructure, and what still needs to be done.",

            "abstract": "XForms 1.0 and 1.1 both had test suites that consisted largely of static XForms documents. To run the tests you had to manually activate them one by one, and then visually con\ue004\ue005rm that the output matched the description of what should have been produced. If you wanted to add more cases to a test, it involved adding to the set of documents, or editing the individual documents. The test suite for XForms 2.0 now being constructed takes a di\ue003ferent approach, the idea being that the tests should check themselves that they have passed; most tests have a similar structure so that only the data used needs to be altered to check new cases. Of course, for a language designed for user-interaction, some tests have to be based on physical interaction. But once you have con\ue004\ue005rmed that clicking on a button does indeed generate the activation event, all subsequent tests can generate the activation event without user intervention. The introspection needed for tests to check the workings of the processor doing the testing can raise some challenging problems, such as how to test that the initial start-up event has been sent when the facilities for recording that fact have not yet been initialised. This paper considers the techniques used to create a self-testing XForms test suite, some of the problems encountered, and gives examples of how some of them were solved.",

Traditionally, applications have to be a mash up of accesses to devices and formats. To use the data in a cohesive application, the data has to be collected and integrated; this allows very low demands to be put on the devices themselves. The architecture described places a thin layer around a diverse collection of Internet of Things devices, hiding the data-format and data-access differences, unifying the actual data in a single XML repository, and updating the devices automatically as needed; this then allows a REST-style declarative interface to access and control the devices without having to worry about the variety of device-interfaces and formats.",

            "abstract": "htmlabstractXForms is a language for describing interfaces to data, designed at W3C by researchers from industry and academia. It is a declarative language, meaning it describes what has to be done, but largely not how. The interface it describes does not have to run locally on the machine producing the data, but can be run remotely over the network. Since Internet of Things (IoT) computers typically have little memory and are low-powered, this makes XForms ideally suited for the task. \n \nOne of the unexpected successes of HTML was its adoption for controlling devices with embedded computers, such as home Wi-Fi routers. To make an adjustment to such a device, the user directs the browser to the IP address from which it is running and a small web server on the device serves up web pages that allow the user to fill in and submit values to change the working of the device. \n \nHowever, the tiny embedded computers that form part of the IoT typically have memory in kilobytes, not megabytes, and lack the power to run a web server that can serve and interpret web pages. This calls for a different approach. \n \nOne approach is for the devices to serve up only the data of the parameters, so that those values can then be injected into an interface served from elsewhere. XForms [1], a standard that we have helped develop at W3C, is designed for exactly this type of scenario: although it is a technology originally designed for improving the handling of forms on the web, it has since been generalised to more general applications; version 2.0 is currently in preparation [2].",
