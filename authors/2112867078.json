            "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding by Normalizing Flows",
            "abstract": "A key to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to choose a proper representation space, e.g., point-wise Euclidean space and complex vector space. In this paper, we propose a unified perspective of embedding and introduce uncertainty into KGE from the view of group theory. Our model can incorporate existing models (i.e., generality), ensure the computation is tractable (i.e., efficiency) and enjoy the expressive power of complex random variables (i.e., expressiveness). The core idea is that we embed entities/relations as elements of a symmetric group, i.e., permutations of a set. Permutations of different sets can reflect different properties of embedding. And the group operation of symmetric groups is easy to compute. In specific, we show that the embedding of many existing models, point vectors, can be seen as elements of a symmetric group. To reflect uncertainty, we first embed entities/relations as permutations of a set of random variables. A permutation can transform a simple random variable into a complex random variable for greater expressiveness, called a normalizing flow. We then define scoring functions by measuring the similarity of two normalizing flows, namely NFE. We construct several instantiating models and prove that they are able to learn logical rules. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing uncertainty and our model. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/NFE.",

            "abstract": "Privacy concerns have long been a nuisance for users when using online social networks (OSNs), and most OSNs require users to configure the privacy settings themselves. Researchers are paying attention to the recommendation of privacy settings for OSN users, as some studies have found it difficult for users to understand and to use. This paper addresses the problem of recommending user-level privacy settings by leveraging the user-generated content (UGC) sequences and account information. We first analyze the differences of users with different privacy settings using the crawled Twitter dataset. Further, we formalize the privacy settings recommendation problem as a multi-label classification task and propose a deep learning-based privacy settings recommendation approach, PrivacyRec. It adopts Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for the UGC sequences modeling to extract deep representations of users' semantic preferences and interaction behavior. In addition, it fuses the above representations with processed account portrait feature through attention mechanism and infers the privacy settings. We evaluate PrivacyRec using two real-world datasets and compare it with several baseline methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PrivacyRec's ability to recommend privacy settings.",

            "abstract": "With the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, research on the adoption, deployment, and prediction of IPv6 networks becomes more and more significant. This paper analyzes the IPv6 traffic of two campus networks in Shanghai, China. We first conduct a series of analyses for the traffic patterns and uncover weekday/weekend patterns, the self-similarity phenomenon, and the correlation between IPv6 and IPv4 traffic. On weekends, traffic usage is smaller than on weekdays, but the distribution does not change much. We find that the self-similarity of IPv4 traffic is close to that of IPv6 traffic, and there is a strong positive correlation between IPv6 traffic and IPv4 traffic. Based on our findings on traffic patterns, we propose a new IPv6 traffic prediction model by combining the advantages of the statistical and deep learning models. In addition, our model would extract useful information from the corresponding IPv4 traffic to enhance the prediction. Based on two real-world datasets, it is shown that the proposed model outperforms eight baselines with a lower prediction error. In conclusion, our approach is helpful for network resource allocation and network management.",

            "abstract": "We present a framework of Training Free Graph Matching (TFGM) to boost the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based graph matching, providing a fast promising solution without training (training-free). TFGM provides four widely applicable principles for designing training-free GNNs and is generalizable to supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised graph matching. The keys are to handcraft the matching priors, which used to be learned by training, into GNN's architecture and discard the components inessential under the training-free setting. Further analysis shows that TFGM is a linear relaxation to the quadratic assignment formulation of graph matching and generalizes TFGM to a broad set of GNNs. Extensive experiments show that GNNs with TFGM achieve comparable (if not better) performances to their fully trained counterparts, and demonstrate TFGM's superiority in the unsupervised setting.

First, each testing sample is predictable with supportive data in the training set. To ensure it, we propose to utilize rule-guided train/test generation, instead of conventional random split. Second, InferWiki initiates the evaluation following the open-world assumption and improves the inferential difficulty of the closed-world assumption, by providing manually annotated negative and unknown triples. Third, we include various inference patterns (e.g., reasoning path length and types) for comprehensive evaluation. In experiments, we curate two settings of InferWiki varying in sizes and structures, and apply the construction process on CoDEx as comparative datasets. The results and empirical analyses demonstrate the necessity and high-quality of InferWiki. Nevertheless, the performance gap among various inferential assumptions and patterns presents the difficulty and inspires future research direction.

Pro- totypical network shows superior performance on few-shot NER.

To address the issue, we propose a novel model, Mining Undefined Classes from Other-class (MUCO), that can automatically induce different unde- fined classes from the other class to improve few-shot NER. With these extra-labeled unde- fined classes, our method will improve the dis- criminative ability of NER classifier and en- hance the understanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge. Experi- mental results demonstrate that our model out- performs five state-of-the-art models in both 1- shot and 5-shots settings on four NER bench- marks. We will release the code upon accep- tance.

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) and attention mechanism have been demonstrated effective in introducing and selecting useful information for weakly supervised methods. However, only qualitative analysis and ablation study are provided as evidence. In this paper, we contribute a dataset and propose a paradigm to quantitatively evaluate the effect of attention and KG on bag-level relation extraction (RE). We find that (1) higher attention accuracy may lead to worse performance as it may harm the model\u2019s ability to extract entity mention features; (2) the performance of attention is largely influenced by various noise distribution patterns, which is closely related to real-world datasets; (3) KG-enhanced attention indeed improves RE performance, while not through enhanced attention but by incorporating entity prior; and (4) attention mechanism may exacerbate the issue of insufficient training data. Based on these findings, we show that a straightforward variant of RE model can achieve significant improvements (6% AUC on average) on two real-world datasets as compared with three state-of-the-art baselines.

            "abstract": "Properly handling missing data is a fundamental challenge in recommendation. Most present works perform negative sampling from unobserved data to supply the training of recommender models with negative signals. Nevertheless, existing negative sampling strategies, either static or adaptive ones, are insufficient to yield high-quality negative samples \u2014 both informative to model training and reflective of user real needs. In this work, we hypothesize that item knowledge graph (KG), which provides rich relations among items and KG entities, could be useful to infer informative and factual negative samples. Towards this end, we develop a new negative sampling model, Knowledge Graph Policy Network (KGPolicy), which works as a reinforcement learning agent to explore high-quality negatives. Specifically, by conducting our designed exploration operations, it navigates from the target positive interaction, adaptively receives knowledge-aware negative signals, and ultimately yields a potential negative item to train the recommender. We tested on a matrix factorization (MF) model equipped with KGPolicy, and it achieves significant improvements over both state-of-the-art sampling methods like DNS [39] and IRGAN [30], and KG-enhanced recommender models like KGAT [32]. Further analyses from different angles provide insights of knowledge-aware sampling. We release the codes and datasets at https://github.com/xiangwang1223/kgpolicy.",

We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases. Solving this task not only simplifies the professional language, but also improves the accuracy and expertise level of laymen descriptions using simple words. This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five state-of-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance. We also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation, to provide insights into future research directions. The dataset is publicly available at https://srhthu.github.io/expertise-style-transfer/.",

            "title": "KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "To provide more accurate, diverse, and explainable recommendation, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take side information into account. Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items, or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and RippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for high-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the attention mechanism. We release the codes and datasets at https://github.com/xiangwang1223/knowledge_graph_attention_network.",
