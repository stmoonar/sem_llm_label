            "title": "Detecting Anomalies in Dynamic Graphs via Memory enhanced Normality",
            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs presents a significant challenge due to the temporal evolution of graph structures and attributes. The conventional approaches that tackle this problem typically employ an unsupervised learning framework, capturing normality patterns with exclusive normal data during training and identifying deviations as anomalies during testing. However, these methods face critical drawbacks: they either only depend on proxy tasks for representation without directly pinpointing normal patterns, or they neglect to differentiate between spatial and temporal normality patterns. More recent methods that use contrastive learning with negative sampling also face high computational costs, limiting their scalability to large graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal memories-enhanced graph autoencoder (STRIPE). Initially, STRIPE employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and gated temporal convolution layers to extract spatial and temporal features. Then STRIPE incorporates separate spatial and temporal memory networks to capture and store prototypes of normal patterns, respectively. These stored patterns are retrieved and integrated with encoded graph embeddings through a mutual attention mechanism. Finally, the integrated features are fed into the decoder to reconstruct the graph streams which serve as the proxy task for anomaly detection. This comprehensive approach not only minimizes reconstruction errors but also emphasizes the compactness and distinctiveness of the embeddings w.r.t. the nearest memory prototypes. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of STRIPE, where STRIPE significantly outperforms existing methods with 5.8% improvement in AUC scores and 4.62X faster in training time.",

            "abstract": "Given a directed graph G, the directed densest subgraph (DDS) problem refers to finding a subgraph from G, whose density is the highest among all subgraphs of G. The DDS problem is fundamental to a wide range of applications, such as fake follower detection and community mining. Theoretically, the DDS problem closely connects to other essential graph problems, such as network flow and bipartite matching. However, existing DDS solutions suffer from efficiency and scalability issues. In this paper, we develop a convex-programming-based solution by transforming the DDS problem into a set of linear programs. Based on the duality of linear programs, we develop efficient exact and approximation algorithms. Especially, our approximation algorithm can support flexible parameterized approximation guarantees. We have performed an extensive empirical evaluation of our approaches on eight real large datasets. The results show that our proposed algorithms are up to five orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "\n Finding the densest subgraph (DS) from a graph is a fundamental problem in graph databases. The DS obtained, which reveals closely related entities, has been found to be useful in various application domains such as e-commerce, social science, and biology. However, in a big graph that contains billions of edges, it is desirable to find more than one subgraph cluster that are not necessarily the densest, yet they reveal closely-related vertices. In this paper, we study the locally densest subgraph (LDS), a recently-proposed variant of DS. An LDS is a subgraph which is the densest among the \"local neighbors\". Given a graph\n G\n , a number of LDS's can be returned, which reflect different dense regions of\n G\n and thus give more information than DS. The existing LDS solution suffers from low efficiency. We thus develop a convex-programming-based solution that enables powerful pruning. Extensive experiments on seven real large graph datasets show that our proposed algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.\n",

            "abstract": "A subgraph is constructed by using a subset of vertices and edges of a given graph. There exist many graph properties that are hereditary for subgraphs. Hence, researchers from different communities have paid a great deal of attention in studying numerous subgraph problems, on top of the ordinary graph problems. Many algorithms are proposed in studying subgraph problems, where one common approach is by extracting the patterns and structures of a given graph. Due to the complex structures of certain types of graphs and to improve overall performances of the existing frameworks, machine learning techniques have recently been employed in dealing with various subgraph problems. In this article, we present a comprehensive review on five well known subgraph problems that have been tackled by using machine learning methods. They are subgraph isomorphism (both counting and matching), maximum common subgraph, community detection and community search problems. We provide an outline of each proposed method, and examine its designs and performances. We also explore non-learning-based algorithms for each problem and a brief discussion is given. We then suggest some promising research directions in this area, hoping that relevant subgraph problems can be tackled by using a similar strategy. Since there is a huge growth in employing machine learning techniques in recent years, we believe that this survey will serve as a good reference point to relevant research communities.",

            "abstract": "Incident detection (ID), or the automatic discovery of anomalies from road traffic data (e.g., road sensor and GPS data), enables emergency actions (e.g., rescuing injured people) to be carried out in a timely fashion. Existing ID solutions based on data mining or machine learning often rely on dense traffic data; for instance, sensors installed in highways provide frequent updates of road information. In this paper, we ask the question: Can ID be performed on sparse traffic data (e.g., location data obtained from GPS devices equipped on vehicles)\u0192 As these data may not be enough to describe the state of the roads involved, they can undermine the effectiveness of existing ID solutions. To tackle this challenge, we borrow an important insight from the transportation area, which uses trajectories (i.e., moving histories of vehicles) to derive incident patterns. We study how to obtain incident patterns from trajectories and devise a new solution (called Filter-Discovery-Match (FDM)) to detect anomalies in sparse traffic data. Experiments on a taxi dataset in Hong Kong and a simulated dataset show that FDM is more effective than state-of-the-art ID solutions on sparse traffic data.",

However, all of them fail to consider the full spatial-temporal correlation on traffic data. In addition, the periodicity in traffic data is not well utilized. Traffic data in the same workday usually follows a similar pattern. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework, which captures both full spatial-temporal correlation and periodicity, to detect incidents on freeways. Experiments show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art.",
