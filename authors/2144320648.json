            "abstract": "Satellite-to-ground communication systems typically operate in environments with high-interference levels, complex topologies, and stringent platform constraints. Therefore, intelligent, anti-interference, and low-power systems are required to achieve the desired transmission performance. This article proposes a system for optimizing high-frequency satellite-to-ground communications using computer vision (CV) technology, like millimeter-wave (mmWave) satellite communication systems. The system uniquely combines CV-based target localization with adaptive beamforming and power control to optimize communication links with ground targets, such as base stations, ships, and aircraft. This approach significantly outperforms traditional radio frequency-based methods in accuracy and efficiency, particularly in dynamic mmWave scenarios. Simulation results confirm the superiority of our system in terms of sum rate and energy efficiency, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize high-frequency satellite communications by providing reliable, high-quality service to terrestrial targets. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.",

            "abstract": "Due to the complexity of airborne remote sensing scenes, strong background and noise interference, positive and negative sample imbalance, and multiple ship scales, ship detection is a critical and challenging task in remote sensing. This work proposes an end-to-end anchor-free oriented ship detector (AF-OSD) framework based on a multi-scale dense-point rotation Gaussian heatmap (MDP-RGH) to tackle these aforementioned challenges. First, to solve the sample imbalance problem and suppress the interference of negative samples such as background and noise, the oriented ship is modeled via the proposed MDP-RGH according to its shape and direction to generate ship labels with more accurate information, while the imbalance between positive and negative samples is adaptively learned for the ships with different scales. Then, the AF-OSD based on MDP-RGH is further devised to detect the multi-scale oriented ship, which is the accurate identification and information extraction for multi-scale vessels. Finally, a multi-task object size adaptive loss function is designed to guide the training process, improving its detection quality and performance for multi-scale oriented ships. Simulation results show that extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA ship datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves significantly outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems usually operate in harsh scenarios, which require accurate information about the topology and wireless channel to achieve the desired transmission performance. Therefore, when millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication with its intrinsic Line-of-Sight (LoS) condition is adopted, accurate target localization is essential to determine the spatial relationship between the UAV and the grounded receivers (Rxs). In this article, a computer-vision (CV)-aided jointly optimization scheme of flight trajectory and power allocation is designed for mmWave UAV communication systems by utilizing the visual information captured via cameras equipped at the UAV. Compared with traditional schemes, the implementation cost and overhead can be greatly saved as no radio frequency transmissions are required in the proposed localization scheme. In addition, the transmit power at the UAV is jointly optimized with its flight trajectory in two different cases. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.",

            "title": "An edge detection method with boundary reserved based on non-subsampled contourlet transform for remote sensing imagery",
            "abstract": "During space reconnaissance applications, edge detection from remote sensing imagery plays an important role in the target recognition processing. However, traditional edge detection methods usually only utilize the high-frequency information in one image. Since low-frequency elements may be aliasing with high-frequency parts, the edges extracted may be unconnected under complex topography, different objects and imaging conditions. This paper proposes a novel image edge detection method based on Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) to keep the object boundary continuously. It transforms the image into Contourlet domain in both high-frequency and low-frequency sub-bands respectively. Depending on the feature of flexible directivity reservation of an image during NSCT, the further edge extraction consists of 3 steps: firstly, the elements of the high-frequency coefficient matrix in Contourlet domain are filtered with high values left using adaptive thresholds. Then the low-frequency edge information is extracted via Canny operator from the low-frequency sub-band information. Finally, to achieve a more consistent edge image, the low-frequency edge image is achieved according to the low-frequency matrix and adopted to compensate the high-frequency image with the isolated noise points eliminated as well. The numerical simulation and practical test results show the higher effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm when comparing with the classical edge detectors, such as Sobel operator, Canny operator, Log operator and Prewitt operator, etc.",
