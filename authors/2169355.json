            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network-based model to detect fraudulent users on e-commerce platforms without relying on rating scores. Utilizing user-product bipartite graphs and timestamp data, we capture temporal patterns and neighborhood information, creating a graph with multidimensional edge vectors. Our model demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively identifying fraudulent users under data-insufficient conditions and enhancing the overall reliability of online platforms.",

            "title": "GraphFC: Customs Fraud Detection with Label Scarcity",
            "abstract": "Customs officials across the world encounter huge volumes of transactions. Associated with customs transactions is customs fraud-the intentional manipulation of goods declarations to avoid taxes and duties. Due to limited manpower, the customs offices can only manually inspect a small number of declarations, necessitating the automation of customs fraud detection by machine learning techniques. The limited availability of manually inspected ground truth data makes it essential for the ML approach to generalize well on unseen data. However, current customs fraud detection models are not well suited or designed for this setting. In this work, we propose GraphFC (Graph Neural networks for Customs Fraud), a model-agnostic, domain-specific, graph neural network based customs fraud detection model that is designed to work in a real-world setting with limited ground truth data. Extensive experimentation using real customs data from two countries demonstrates that GraphFC generalizes well over unseen data and outperforms various baselines and other models by a large margin.",

In this paper, we propose to enable automatic privacy control for social media posts through two tasks, predicting privacy settings and predicting privacy categories. The former is to recommend the proper settings of privacy levels, including family, close, casual, and outside, for a post. The latter is to predict the categories of privacy concerns for a post. We propose a multi-task learning-based approach, along with learning feature representation of each post, for such two tasks. Experiments conducted on a real dataset with tweet posts exhibit promising performance of our model, and thus encourage further investigation of privacy-related tasks for privacy control on social media. We also provide a series of extensive analysis with insights that reveal the hidden correlation between privacy settings/categories and post texts.",

            "abstract": "As the urban population rises, so does the pressure on the city\u2019s transportation system. Most of the existing methods for passenger destination selection focus on processing the historical behaviors and travel trajectories of passengers. However, the existing methods face the generalization issue, the trained model cannot be applied to predict destinations in new metropolitan areas as the destination information is totally unseen and different from the training sets. To deal with the issue faced in IEEE BigData Cup 2022 \u2013 Trip Destination Prediction, in this work, we present a hybrid method. The main idea of our method is four-fold. The first is to implement the gravity model to capture human mobility between zones. The second contains two novel features to depict zones, including human traffic flow and feature class ratio. The third is to initialize the destinations in the new metropolitan area using the origin zones of multi-trip individuals. The last is to perform the nearest-neighbor search on both individuals and trips. The final destination prediction is produced by combining the gravity model and the nearest-neighbor search. Performance comparison reported by the competition leaderboard exhibits the superiority of our hybrid method, which also brings us to the fifth place in the competition.",

Given a source message, our goal is to determine whether it is fake without using labeled data and without requiring user interacted with the given message. We present a novel learning framework, Recommendation-aware Message Representation (RecMR), to achieve the goal. The key idea is to learn user preferences and have them encoded into the representation of the source message through jointly training the tasks of user recommendation and binary detection. Experiments conducted on two real Twitter datasets exhibit the promising performance of RecMR, and show the effectiveness of recommended users in unsupervised detection.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) learns from the temporal dynamics of user-item interactions to predict the next ones. Fairness-aware recommendation mitigates a variety of algorithmic biases in the learning of user preferences. This article aims at bringing a marriage between SR and algorithmic fairness. We propose a novel fairness-aware sequential recommendation task, in which a new metric, interaction fairness, is defined to estimate how recommended items are fairly interacted by users with different protected attribute groups. We propose a multi-task learning-based deep end-to-end model, FairSR, which consists of two parts. One is to learn and distill personalized sequential features from the given user and her item sequence for SR. The other is fairness-aware preference graph embedding (FPGE). The aim of FPGE is two-fold: incorporating the knowledge of users\u2019 and items\u2019 attributes and their correlation into entity representations, and alleviating the unfair distributions of user attributes on items. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets show FairSR can outperform state-of-the-art SR models in recommendation performance. In addition, the recommended items by FairSR also exhibit promising interaction fairness.",

Given trips containing travel information, personal attributes, origin zones, and their features in the training metropolitan areas, the task is to predict the destination of every trip in a targeted metropolitan area whose destinations are not given at all at the training stage. We highlight the challenges in this destination prediction task \u2013 having no knowledge of the destinations in the targeted metropolitan area. We provide insights from the datasets, in which revisiting behaviors and the relationships between origins and destinations play a crucial role in individuals\u2019 trips. Hence, we design a simple but comprehensive method, rule-based visiting circulation, which directly utilizes the origin information and individuals\u2019 trip behaviors to determine the destinations in the targeted metropolitan area, i.e., requiring no learning from the four training areas. Experimental results on both offline evaluation and leaderboard submission consistently exhibit the proposed RVC can significantly outperform supervised learning methods and other heuristics. The RVC method eventually brings us to second place in the competition leaderboard.",
