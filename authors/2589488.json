The communities behind these graphs strive to gather, clean, and integrate scholarly metadata from various sources to produce clean and easy-to-process knowledge graphs. In this context, a very important task of the respective cleaning and integration workflows is deduplication. In this paper, we briefly describe and evaluate the accuracy of the deduplication algorithm used for the OpenAIRE Research Graph. Our experiments show that the algorithm has an adequate performance producing a small number of false positives and an even smaller number of false negatives.",

Since 2012, the \u201cOpen Researcher and Contributor Identi\ufb01cation Initiative\u201d (ORCID) has been successfully running a worldwide registry, with the aim of unequivocally pinpoint researchers and the body of knowledge they contributed to. In practice, ORCID clients, e.g., publishers, repositories, and CRIS systems, make sure their metadata can refer to iDs in the ORCID registry to associate authors and their work unambiguously. However, the ORCID infrastructure still su\ufb00ers from several \u201cservice misuses\u201d, which put at risk its very mission and should be therefore identi\ufb01ed and tackled. In this paper, we classify and qualitatively document such misuses, occurring from both users (researchers and organisations) of the ORCID registry and the ORCID clients. We conclude providing an outlook and a few recommendations aiming at improving the exploitation of the ORCID infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "PurposeSeveral online services offer functionalities to access information from \u201cbig research graphs\u201d (e.g. Google Scholar, OpenAIRE, Microsoft Academic Graph), which correlate scholarly/scientific communication entities such as publications, authors, datasets, organizations, projects, funders, etc. Depending on the target users, access can vary from search and browse content to the consumption of statistics for monitoring and provision of feedback. Such graphs are populated over time as aggregations of multiple sources and therefore suffer from major entity-duplication problems. Although deduplication of graphs is a known and actual problem, existing solutions are dedicated to specific scenarios, operate on flat collections, local topology-drive challenges and cannot therefore be re-used in other contexts.Design/methodology/approachThis work presents GDup, an integrated, scalable, general-purpose system that can be customized to address deduplication over arbitrary large information graphs. The paper presents its high-level architecture, its implementation as a service used within the OpenAIRE infrastructure system and reports numbers of real-case experiments.FindingsGDup provides the functionalities required to deliver a fully-fledged entity deduplication workflow over a generic input graph. The system offers out-of-the-box Ground Truth management, acquisition of feedback from data curators and algorithms for identifying and merging duplicates, to obtain an output disambiguated graph.Originality/valueTo our knowledge GDup is the only system in the literature that offers an integrated and general-purpose solution for the deduplication graphs, while targeting big data scalability issues. GDup is today one of the key modules of the OpenAIRE infrastructure production system, which monitors Open Science trends on behalf of the European Commission, National funders and institutions.",

To this aim it offers dissemination and training on Open Access and Open Science, facilitates exchange of knowledge, and operates the technical services required to facilitate and monitor Open Science publishing trends and research impact across geographic and discipline boundaries. OpenAIRE services populate a research graph whose objects are scientific results, organizations, funders, communities, organizations, and data sources.

The OpenAIRE Content Provider Dashboard is a one-stop-shop web service where content providers (repository, data archive, journal, aggregator, CRIS systems) interact with OpenAIRE. In the context of the global information space, content providers are facing new challenges to manage their collections, namely the interoperability with other interfaces, the metadata exposition and the impact measure of their collections. The OpenAIRE Dashboard for Content Providers provides the front-end access to many of OpenAIRE's backend services to support content providers facing this challenges, such as the validation service to see how to apply the OpenAIRE Guidelines to expose contents using global standards, the registration in OpenAIRE to reach a wider audience around the world, the Catch-all Broker service to enrich metadata and get connections between different content typologies, and the Usage Statistics service to measure the impact through the usage activity. Beyond of the service presentation, it is aimed to highlight the user value of the service, which is mainly: enhance repository collections and content for more visibility and access; improve institution memory; better institution research assessment and compliance with funder rules.

            "title": "GDup: De-Duplication of Scholarly Communication Big Graphs",
            "abstract": "Today, several online services offer functionalities to access information from big scholarly communication graphs, which interlink entities such as publications, authors, datasets, organizations, etc. Such graphs are often populated over time as aggregations of multiple sources and therefore suffer from entity duplication problems. Although deduplication of graphs is a known and actual problem, solutions tend to be dedicated and address a few of the underlying challenges. In this paper, we propose the GDup system, an integrated, scalable, general-purpose system for entity deduplication over big information graphs. GDup supports practitioners with the functionalities needed to realize a fully-fledged entity deduplication workflow over a generic input graph, inclusive of Ground Truth support, end-user feedback, and strategies for identifying and merging duplicates to obtain an output disambiguated graph. GDup is today one of the core components of the OpenAIRE infrastructure production system, monitoring Open Science trends on behalf of the European Commission.",
