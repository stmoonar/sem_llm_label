            "title": "Data-Driven Insight Synthesis for Multi-Dimensional Data",
            "abstract": "Exploratory data analysis can uncover interesting data insights from data. Current methods utilize \"interestingness measures\" designed based on system designers' perspectives, thus inherently restricting the insights to their defined scope. These systems, consequently, may not adequately represent a broader range of user interests. Furthermore, most existing approaches that formulate \"interestingness measure\" are rule-based, which makes them inevitably brittle and often requires holistic re-design when new user needs are discovered.\n This paper presents a data-driven technique for deriving an \"interestingness measure\" that learns from annotated data. We further develop an innovative annotation algorithm that significantly reduces the annotation cost, and an insight synthesis algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for efficient discovery of interesting insights. We consolidate these ideas into a system. Our experimental outcomes and user studies demonstrate that DAISY can effectively discover a broad range of interesting insights, thereby substantially advancing the current state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "Potential harms from the under-representation of minorities in data, particularly in multi-modal settings, is a well-recognized concern. While there has been extensive effort in detecting such under-representation, resolution has remained a challenge.\n With recent generative AI advancements, large language and foundation models have emerged as versatile tools across various domains. In this paper, we propose Chameleon, a system that efficiently utilizes these tools to augment a dataset with minimal addition of synthetically generated tuples to enhance the coverage of the under-represented groups. Our system applies quality and outlier-detection tests to ensure the quality and semantic integrity of the generated tuples. In order to minimize the rejection chance of the generated tuples, we propose multiple strategies to provide a guide for the foundation model. Our experiment results, in addition to confirming the efficiency of our proposed algorithms, illustrate our approach's effectiveness, as the model's unfairness in a downstream task significantly dropped after data repair using Chameleon.",

            "abstract": "Diversity, group representation, and similar needs often apply to query results, which in turn require constraints on the sizes of various subgroups in the result set. Traditional relational queries only specify conditions as part of the query predicate(s), and do not support such restrictions on the output. In this paper, we study the problem of modifying queries to have the result satisfy constraints on the sizes of multiple subgroups in it. This problem, in the worst case, cannot be solved in polynomial time. Yet, with the help of provenance annotation, we are able to develop a query refinement method that works quite efficiently, as we demonstrate through extensive experiments.",
