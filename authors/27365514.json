            "abstract": "We present a novel technique for modulating the appearance frequency of a few tokens within a dataset for encoding an invisible watermark that can be used to protect ownership rights upon data. We develop optimal as well as fast heuristic algorithms for creating and verifying such watermarks. We also demonstrate the robustness of our technique against various attacks and derive analytical bounds for the false positive probability of erroneously \u201cdetecting\u201d a watermark on a dataset that does not carry it. Our technique is applicable to both single dimensional and multidimensional datasets, is independent of token type, allows for a fine control of the introduced distortion, and can be used in a variety of use cases that involve buying and selling data in contemporary data marketplaces.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Puppy, the first formally defined framework for converting any symmetric watermarking into a publicly verifiable one. Puppy allows anyone to verify a watermark any number of times with the help of an untrusted third party, without requiring owner presence during detection. We formally define and prove security of Puppy using the ideal/real-world simulation paradigm and construct two practical and secure instances: (1) Puppy-TEE that uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and (2) Puppy-2PC that relies on two-party computation (2PC) based on garbled circuits. We then convert four current symmetric watermarking schemes into publicly verifiable ones and run extensive experiments using Puppy-TEE and Puppy-2PC. Evaluation results show that, while Puppy-TEE incurs some overhead, its total latency is on the order of milliseconds for three out of four watermarking schemes. Although the overhead of Puppy-2PC is higher (on the order of seconds), it is viable for settings that lack a TEE or where strong trust assumptions about a TEE need to be avoided. We further optimize the solution to increase its scalability and resilience to denial of service attacks via memoization.",

            "title": "Image Watermarking for Machine Learning Datasets",
            "abstract": "Machine learning has received increasing attention for the last decade due to its significant success in classification problems in almost every application domain. For its success, the amount of available data for training plays a crucial role in the creation of a machine-learning model. However, the data-gathering process for machine learning algorithms is a tedious and time-consuming task. In many cases, the developers rely on publicly available datasets, which are not always of high quality. Recently, we are witnessing a data market paradigm where valuable datasets are sold. Thus, once the dataset is created or bought, protecting the dataset against illegal use or (re)sale and establishing intellectual property rights is necessary. In this paper, we investigate the question of deploying well-studied image watermarking techniques to be applied to classification algorithm datasets, without degrading the quality of the dataset. We investigate whether Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based techniques from image watermarking could be deployed on machine learning datasets or not. To this end, we chose the watermarking technique described in [8] and applied it to a machine-learning dataset. We provide experimental results on the robustness of the scheme. Our results show that the watermark embedding scheme provides decent imperceptibility and robustness against update, zero-out, and insertion attacks but, it is not successful against deletion attacks. We believe our work can inspire researchers who might want to consider applying well-studied image watermarking techniques to machine learning datasets.",

            "abstract": "Watermarking is used as proof of ownership for various data types such as images, videos, software, machine learning models, and databases. Datasets are crucial for data driven decision making using Machine Learning for tasks like prediction, recommendation, classification, and anomaly detection. Hence, it is not surprising that entire databases are being sold in data marketplaces. Protecting ownership rights upon such databases is, therefore, becoming increasingly important. Watermarking for relational databases has been an active field of research since 2002. However, how to watermark non-relational databases involving complex data types has largely remained understudied. In this paper we revise previously proposed techniques for non-relational database watermarking and introduce an improved technique for graph database watermarking inspired by Zhuang et al. [28]. Our technique employs randomization to generate a watermark in an efficient manner that avoids the computational complex genetic algorithm optimization of Zhuang et al. We evaluated our technique in terms of performance, usability, security, and robustness by implementing it as a proof-of-concept. Our results showed that our technique is efficient, secure and robust against guessing and deletion attacks.",

            "title": "User Study on Single Password Authentication",
            "abstract": "Single password authentication (SPA) schemes are introduced to overcome the challenges of traditional password authentications, which are vulnerable to offline dictionary, phishing, honeypot, and man-in-themiddle attacks. Unlike classical password-based authentication systems, in SPA schemes the user is required to remember only a single password (and a username) for all her accounts, while the password is protected against offline dictionary attacks in a provably secure manner. Several cryptographic SPA solutions were proposed in this decade, some based on cloud storage, and some employing a trusted personal mobile device. However, studies on usability of these novel SPA systems are rare, hardening their deployment and the validation of their practicality. In this paper, we implement two very different SPA systems and assess their usability with the following two comparative experiments: one comparing the state-of-the-art cloud-based browser-extension SPA solution against traditional password-based authentication (where in both cases the user experience is simply entering a username and password), and another comparing the first mobile-application-based SPA solution against two-factor authentication (where, in both cases, in addition to the password, the user needs access to her mobile device). We obtain that the cloud-based SPA system is easier to use than the traditional approach, making it suitable for daily use deployment, and the mobile-based SPA system is as easy as, but less intimidating and more secure than twofactor authentication, making it a better alternative for online banking type deployments. Hence, SPA systems overall constitute a usable alternative to the existing solutions, while providing offline dictionary attack protection.",

            "abstract": "Passwords are the most widely used factor in various areas such as secret sharing, key establishment, and user authentication. Single password protocols are proposed (starting with Belenkiy et. al [4]) to overcome the challenges of traditional password protocols and provide provable security against offline dictionary, man-in-the-middle, phishing, and honeypot attacks. While they ensure provable security, they allow a user securely to use a single low-entropy human memorable password for all her accounts. They achieve this with the help of a cloud or mobile storage device. However, an attacker corrupting both the login server and storage can mount an offline dictionary attack on user\u2019s single password. In this work, we introduce a framework for distributed single password protocols (DiSPP) that analyzes existing protocols, improves upon them regarding novel constructions and distributed schemes, and allows exploiting alternative cryptographic primitives to obtain secure distributed single password protocols with various trade-offs. Previous single password solutions can be instantiated as part of our framework. We further introduce a secure DiSPP instantiation derived from our framework enforcing the adversary to corrupt several cloud and mobile storage devices in addition to the login server in order to perform a successful offline dictionary attack. We also provide a comparative analysis of different solutions derived from our framework.",
