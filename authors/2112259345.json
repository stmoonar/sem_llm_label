            "title": "Image Reconstruction Using Variable Exponential Function Regularization for Wide-Field Polarization Modulation Imaging",
            "abstract": "Polarization modulation imaging technology plays an important role in microscopic super-resolution imaging. However, the specimen medium contains retardancy, while charge-coupled devices may provide discrete under-sampling, and the coupled wavefronts consisting of the polarization state of the light and the anisotropic distribution of the specimen can lead to vectorial phase fitting degradation. Considering that the point spread function (PSF) of the main degradation parts can be regarded as an asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution with uncertain parameters, an adaptive image reconstruction method is proposed based on variable exponential function regularization. The proposed method concentrates on the diversity of the PSF and uses a variable exponent regularization to improve flexibility of the kernel. Moreover, it can balance image edge preservation and provide staircase artifact suppression, which reduces the over- and under-reconstruction of the microscopic images effectively. By optimizing the Split\u2013Bregman algorithm, we create an efficient method that minimizes the iterative loss function under the premise of achieving high estimation accuracy. Compared with other methods, the experimental results reveal better effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, with improvements of 18% in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, 21% in the structural similarity index measurement, and 337% in the mean structural similarity index measurement.",

            "title": "Single-Image Dehazing Using Extreme Reflectance Channel Prior",
            "abstract": "Image dehazing algorithms based on dark channel prior principle have achieved good results for most scenes. However, the popular dark channel prior tends to underestimate transmissions of bright areas or objects, such as the skies, white areas and self-luminous bodies, which may cause color distortions during dehazing. A complementary prior called the extreme reflectance channel prior (ERC), which combines the dark channel prior with the bright channel prior, is proposed to estimate the transmission map. The extreme reflectance channel is the union of dark and bright channel\u2019s pixels which satisfy the corresponding channel. Based on the scattering analysis results that the intensities of pixels in ERC are often close to 0 or 1 for the natural haze-free images or close to global atmospheric light if hazes occur in the air, the pixels in a hazy image can be recovered according to ERC to calculate the transmission map and then solve the haze imaging mode. Experiments show that ERC method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SSIM and visual perception effects.",
