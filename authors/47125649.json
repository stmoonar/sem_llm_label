            "abstract": "For many use-cases, it is often important to explain the prediction of a black-box model by identifying the most influential training data samples. Existing approaches lack customization for user intent and often provide a homogeneous set of explanation samples, failing to reveal the model's reasoning from different angles. In this paper, we propose AIDE, an approach for providing antithetical (i.e., contrastive), intent-based, diverse explanations for opaque and complex models. AIDE distinguishes three types of explainability intents: interpreting a correct, investigating a wrong, and clarifying an ambiguous prediction. For each intent, AIDE selects an appropriate set of influential training samples that support or oppose the prediction either directly or by contrast. To provide a succinct summary, AIDE uses diversity-aware sampling to avoid redundancy and increase coverage of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AIDE on image and text classification tasks, in three ways: quantitatively, assessing correctness and continuity; qualitatively, comparing anecdotal evidence from AIDE and other example-based approaches; and via a user study, evaluating multiple aspects of AIDE. The results show that AIDE addresses the limitations of existing methods and exhibits desirable traits for an explainability method.",

We reformulate existing explainability evaluation metrics, such as correctness and relevance, specifically for example-based methods, and introduce a new metric, distinguishability. Using these metrics, we highlight the shortcomings of current example-based explainability methods, including those who attempt to suppress class outliers. We conduct experiments on two datasets, a text classification dataset and an image classification dataset, and evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art explainability methods.

Experimental results show that M-BERT can achieve high accuracy on a variety of LOS problems and outperforms traditional nonsequence-based machine learning approaches.",

We propose a method that uses conversational interactions with an LLM to analyze clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and detect the relationships among the new medical concepts that are not present in SNOMED-CT.

            "abstract": "Scientific data collected in the oceanographic domain is invaluable to researchers when performing meta-analyses and examining changes over time in oceanic environments. However, many of the data samples and subsequent analyses published by researchers are not uploaded to a repository leaving the scientific paper as the only available source. Automated extraction of scientific data is, therefore, a valuable tool for such researchers. Specifically, much of the most valuable data in scientific papers are structured as tables, making these a prime target for information extraction research. Using the data relies on an additional step where the concepts mentioned in the tables, such as names of measures, units, and biological species, are identified within a domain ontology. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art table extraction leaves much to be desired and has not been attempted on a large scale on oceanographic papers. Furthermore, while entity linking in the context of a full paragraph of text has been heavily researched, it is still lacking in this harder task of linking single concepts. In this work, we present an annotated benchmark dataset of data tables from oceanographic papers. We further present the result of an evaluation on the extraction of these tables and the linking of the contained entities to the domain and general-purpose knowledge bases using the current state of the art. We highlight the challenges and quantify the performance of current tools for table extraction and table-concept linking.",

            "abstract": "A variety of hierarchical domain taxonomies exist in the medical domain for describing medical concepts such as laboratory tests, medications, and procedures. The structural information contained within domain taxonomies contains rich semantic information pertaining to the described concepts and their relationships to each other. As AI models are successfully applied in many medical areas, it is only natural to explore integrating AI models with medical domain taxonomies. However, only a few, nascent attempts have been made. In this work, we investigate how the structure of hierarchical medical taxonomies can be used to improve the performance of a diagnosis prediction task. Specifically, we suggest a method titled TreeEmb to pre-initialize the node embeddings of a patient graph derived from electronic health records using information from the taxonomy. We expect this method to improve the performance of graph convolution network models over the enriched patient graph. We evaluate our method over a patient graph created from the MIMIC-IV electronic health record dataset enriched by initializing node embeddings using hierarchical medical taxonomies. We use type-specific domain knowledge from hierarchical medical taxonomies such as the ICD-9 procedures, ATC medication, and LOINC laboratory test taxonomies. Experimental results from a multi-label diagnosis prediction task over this graph demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Ontologies conceptualize domains and are a crucial part of web semantics and information systems. However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology\u2019s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology\u2019s relations. We demonstrate our automated approach on several large ontologies from the oceanographic domain and show its agreement with a manual evaluation by domain experts and its superiority over the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "Because of the flexibility and expressiveness of their model, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have received increasing interest. These resources are usually represented in RDF and stored in specialized data management systems called triplestores. Yet, while there exists a multitude of such systems, exploiting varying data representation and indexing schemes, it is unclear which of the many design choices are the most effective for a given database and query workload. Thus, first, we introduce a set of 20 access patterns, which we identify within 6 categories, adopted to analyze the needs of a given query workload. Then, we identify a novel three-dimensional design space for RDF data representations built on the dimensions of subdivision, redundancy, and compression of data. This design space maps the trade-offs between different RDF data representations employed to store RDF data within a triplestore. Thus, each of the required access patterns is compared against its compatibility with a given data representation. As we show, this approach allows identifying both the most effective RDF data representation for a given query workload as well as unexplored design solutions.",

However, most tools have been either developed for modern English or trained over English language documents and are limited over historical Arabic text. Even Arabic NER tools are often trained on modern web-sourced text, making their fit for a historical task questionable. To mitigate historic Arabic NER resource scarcity, we propose a dynamic ensemble model utilizing several learners. The dynamic aspect is achieved by utilizing predictors and features over NER algorithm results that identify which have performed better on a specific task in real-time. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art Arabic NER and static ensemble methods over a novel historical Arabic NER task we have created. Our results show that our approach improves upon the state-of-the-art and reaches a 0.8 F-score on this challenging task.",
