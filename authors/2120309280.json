            "abstract": "Key-value (KV) store, which regards data as key-value pairs, has been widely deployed in the cloud while demanding highly responsive query operations. A novel persistent memory device, Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM), provides the opportunity for boosting the performance. In this paper, we propose a KV store based on LSM tree, called PMDB, which is tailor-made for a hybrid memory architecture, namely the traditional DRAM device alongside the DCPMM. PMDB stores data on DCPMM for persistence and establishes an auxiliary index in the DRAM for improving the read performance. To improve write amplification which is caused by the physical characteristic of DCPMM, PMDB performs both the operations of flush and compaction at a performance-friendly granularity (256Bytes). In addition, by using the local thread of the CPU node, PMDB is able to improve the NUMA latency of DCPMM effectively. We implement PMDB in a realistic DCPMM environment. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-art LSM-based KV stores, PMDB improves the throughput of random read by up to 2.72\u00d7.",

            "title": "IObrain: An Intelligent Lightweight I/O Recommendation System based on Decision Tree",
            "abstract": "The basic I/O operations of a system can be categorized as two distinct modes: synchronous (sync) I/O and asynchronous (async) I/O, whose performance varies on the system statues, workloads and storage devices. Appropriately applying I/O modes is critical to the system performance. However, the I/O access of diverse applications in a server, especially in a cloud, is volatile and irregular. As a result, this can lack a flexible and adaptive I/O modes, leading to the sub-optimal I/O performance. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose IObrain, an intelligent I/O mode recommendation system, which can adopt the appropriate I/O mode in a dynamic and self-adaptive manner according to both application needs and system statuses. IObrain first trains a lightweight recommendation model with decision tree. Then, a query hook is interposed into the storage engine to intercept the read/write operations from upper application. In this way, IObrain queries the recommendation model first before executing a read/write operation to find the right I/O mode. In addition, two techniques, called inference cache and gRPC bridge, are proposed to reduce the inherent query latency. We practically implement IObrain and verify the advantage of IObrain based on the prototype system. The experimental results show that, compared to existing approach, IObrain improves the I/O performance by up to 1.33\u00d7 with mild running costs.",

            "title": "Vmemcpy: Parallelizing Memory Copy with Multi-core in the Cloud",
            "abstract": "Memory copying is one of the common operations in modern operating systems and servers. It is simple but synchronous and deterministic. However, with the coming of big data era, the size of memory data to be copied is increased rapidly in the cloud servers, resulting in blocking the copying thread/process and eventually hurting the responsiveness of a system. In this paper, we propose Vmemcpy, a method for parallelizing memory copy with multi-core CPU, which is the standard hardware equipment among current cloud infrastructures. Vmemcpy mainly improves memcpy function in user space, dividing the copying data into several sub-blocks. Then each of them is executed by a separated thread running on the dedicated CPU core, forming parallel copying and thus reaping performance improvement. Due to the necessary split procedure, Vmemcpy manifests its own cost on copying small data. To deal with this issue, Vmemcpy intelligently determines the copying threshold on different servers, then uses the original copying routine to copy the small data while employing multi-thread to handle with the large one. We implement Vmemcopy on both servers of Linux and Windows. The experimental results show that Vmemcpy brings up to 38.9% reduction on the latency of memory copying. At the same time, moderate overhead is generated when dealing with the small data.",

Our infrastructure aims at facilitating behavior modeling, discovery, and exploitation, leading to two major outcomes: a behavior data management back-end and a high-level behavior specification API that supports mining, indexing and search, and AI-powered algorithms that provide the ability to extract insights on human behavior and to leverage data to advance human capital. We discuss the role of ML in populating and maintaining the back-end, and in exploiting it for human interest.",
