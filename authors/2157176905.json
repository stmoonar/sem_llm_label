            "title": "From Netlist to Manufacturable Layout: An Auto-Layout Algorithm Optimized for Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits",
            "abstract": "Layout stitching is a repetitive and tedious task of the radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) design process. While academic research on layout splicing algorithms mainly focuses on analog and digital circuits, there is still a lack of well-developed algorithms for RFICs. An RFIC system usually has a symmetrical layout, such as transmitter and receiver components, low-noise amplifier (LNA), an SPDT switch, etc. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an automated procedure for the layout of RFICs by relying on the basic device/PCell structure based on the interconnection among circuit topologies. This approach makes the in-series generation of layouts and automatic splicing based on circuit logic possible, resulting in superior stitching performance compared with related modules in Advanced Design System. To demonstrate the physical application possibilities, we implemented our algorithm on an LNA and a switch circuit.",

            "abstract": "Compared with conventional analog circuit topology synthesis methods, the deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based method features much higher synthesis efficiency while possessing the merit of strong generalization capability. However, this method cannot synthesize operational amplifiers that involve signal division. To address this critical limitation, this article presents new synthesis rules to guide the DRL-based synthesis process. In addition, to meet various design specifications requested by users, we further develop a smart circuit synthesis system, which can robustly return a solution (i.e., a feasible circuit topology with detailed device sizes) right away as long as the input design specifications are reasonable. A transfer learning (TL) scheme is proposed to reduce the computation overhead of training this system. The experimental results show the efficacy of our smart circuit synthesis system and TL scheme, confirming an advancement over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) displacement sensor based on the diagonal symmetry complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) structure is proposed. The one-dimensional (1D) displacement sensor is initially developed by etching a ring on the ground plane, and a triangle metal patch is used as the mover. When the mover is attached, a CSRR is formed, thereby inducing a resonant frequency. The displacement of the mover can be retrieved by the variation in the resonant frequency. Then, the structure is extended for designing a 2D displacement sensor. To further reduce the error caused by the lateral displacement, the shape of the sensor is further optimized using the particle swarm algorithm. Finally, the structure of the CSRR displacement sensor is simulated and analyzed, and a physical prototype is made. The measured results are consistent with the theoretical analysis, and its sensitivity is 160 MHz/mm.",
