            "abstract": "Social media has been a paramount arena for election campaigns for political actors. While many studies have been paying attention to the political campaigns related to partisanship, politicians also can conduct different campaigns according to their chances of winning. Leading candidates, for example, do not behave the same as fringe candidates in their elections, and vice versa. We, however, know little about this difference in social media political campaign strategies according to their odds in elections. We tackle this problem by analyzing candidates' tweets in terms of users, topics, and sentiment of replies. Our study finds that, as their chances of winning increase, candidates narrow the targets they communicate with, from people in general to the electrical districts and specific persons (verified accounts or accounts with many followers). Our study brings new insights into the candidates' campaign strategies through the analysis based on the novel perspective of the candidate's electoral situation.",

            "abstract": "With the recent development of technology, data on de- tailed human temporal behaviors has become available. Many methods have been proposed to mine those human dynamic behavior data and revealed valuable insights for research and businesses. However, most methods analyze only sequence of actions and do not study the inter-temporal information such as the time intervals between actions in a holistic manner. While actions and action time intervals are interdependent, it is challenging to integrate them because they have differ- ent natures: time and action. To overcome this challenge, we propose a uni\ufb01ed method that analyzes user actions with in- tertemporal information (time interval). We simultaneously embed the user\u2019s action sequence and its time intervals to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the action along with intertemporal information. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method enables us to characterize user actions in terms of temporal context, using three real-world data sets. This paper demonstrates that explicit modeling of action sequences and inter-temporal user behavior information enable successful interpretable analysis.",

From such advances in machine learning research, not only computer scientists but also social scientists have benefited and advanced their research because human behavior or social phenomena lies in complex data. However, this emerging trend is not well documented because different social science fields rarely cover each other's work, resulting in fragmented knowledge in the literature. To document this emerging trend, we survey recent studies that apply word embedding techniques to human behavior mining. We built a taxonomy to illustrate the methods and procedures used in the surveyed papers, aiding social science researchers in contextualizing their research within the literature on word embedding applications. This survey also conducts a simple experiment to warn that common similarity measurements used in the literature could yield different results even if they return consistent results at an aggregate level.",

            "abstract": "New leaders in democratic countries typically enjoy high approval ratings immediately after taking office. This phenomenon is called the honeymoon effect and is regarded as a significant political phenomenon; however, its mechanism remains underexplored. Therefore, this study examines how social media users respond to changes in political leadership in order to better understand the honeymoon effect in politics. In particular, we constructed a 15-year Twitter dataset on eight change timings of Japanese prime ministers consisting of 6.6M tweets and analyzed them in terms of sentiments, topics, and users. We found that, while not always, social media tend to show a honeymoon effect at the change timings of prime minister. The study also revealed that sentiment about prime ministers differed by topic, indicating that public expectations vary from one prime minister to another. Furthermore, the user base was largely replaced before and after the change in the prime minister, and their sentiment was also significantly different. The implications of this study would be beneficial for administrative management.",

A visual noise measurement method is specified in Annex B of ISO 15739, which has been used as a useful measurement metric over the\n years since its introduction. As several issues have been questioned recently, it is now being investigated for revision involving changes to the CSF, color space used for rms noise value measurements, and visual noise formula combining rms values in three color channels. To derive visual\n noise formula involving color noise weighting coefficients representing HVS sensitivity to noise, subjective experiments using simulated luminance and color noise images were done. The improvement of calculation stability and HVS correspondence was verified using simulation and real camera\n images under various conditions. Finally, subjective experiments using real camera images were performed to validate the revised method and update the color noise coefficients considering practical measurement cases.\n",

Over the years the algorithm has proven to be useful and reliable for the judgement of the visibility of noise in images captured by digital cameras. Nevertheless a few aspects of the measurement procedures were questioned by some experts like e.g. the relation of the contrast sensitivity function (csf) for the luminance and the two chrominance channels. And the resulting weighting factors for the three channels also depend on the csf relation. In addition, some experts would like to use the more common CIELAB space instead of CIELUV. For these reasons the responsible ISO technical committee 42 working group 18 is looking into a revision of the visual noise section of the standard. This paper describes the procedure the group is undertaking to solve the remaining issues in the upcoming revision.",

We hypothesized that streaming can act as a form of implicit incentive to boost players\u2019 performance and engagement. To test this hypothesis, we continuously collected data about all Twitch streams related to a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, League of Legends (LoL), and data of all LoL matches played during the same time frame, and cross-mapped the two data sets. We found that, counterintuitively, streaming significantly deteriorates players\u2019 in-game performance: This may be due to the burden of carrying out two cognitively intensive activities at the same time, namely, playing the game and producing its commentary for streaming purposes. On the other hand, streaming increases engagement keeping players in significantly longer game sessions. We investigate these two effects further, to characterize how they vary upon individual characteristics.",

            "title": "Social Bots for Online Public Health Interventions",
            "abstract": "According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, hundreds of thousands initiate smoking each year, and millions live with smoking-related diseases in the United States. Many tobacco users discuss their opinions, habits and preferences on social media. This work conceptualizes a framework for targeted health interventions to inform tobacco users about the consequences of tobacco use. We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting protobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets. Algorithmic matching, leveraging the power of peer influence, allows for the systematic delivery of personalized interventions based on real anti-tobacco tweets from former smokers. Experimental evaluation suggested that our system would perform well if deployed.",
