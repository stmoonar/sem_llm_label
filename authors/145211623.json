            "abstract": "Abstract Dynamic changes in protein glycosylation impact human health and disease progression. However, current resources that capture disease and phenotype information focus primarily on the macromolecules within the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA, RNA, proteins). To gain a better understanding of organisms, there is a need to capture the functional impact of glycans and glycosylation on biological processes. A workshop titled \u201cFunctional impact of glycans and their curation\u201d was held in conjunction with the 16th Annual International Biocuration Conference to discuss ongoing worldwide activities related to glycan function curation. This workshop brought together subject matter experts, tool developers, and biocurators from over 20 projects and bioinformatics resources. Participants discussed four key topics for each of their resources: (i) how they curate glycan function-related data from publications and other sources, (ii) what type of data they would like to acquire, (iii) what data they currently have, and (iv) what standards they use. Their answers contributed input that provided a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art glycan function curation and annotations. This report summarizes the outcome of discussions, including potential solutions and areas where curators, data wranglers, and text mining experts can collaborate to address current gaps in glycan and glycosylation annotations, leveraging each other\u2019s work to improve their respective resources and encourage impactful data sharing among resources.

The specific molecular targets of adaptive T cell and B cell immune responses are referred to as epitopes. Epitopes derived from cancer antigens are of high relevance as they are recognized by anti-cancer immune cells. Detailed knowledge of the molecular characteristic of cancer epitopes and associated metadata is relevant to understanding and planning prophylactic and therapeutic applications and accurately characterizing naturally occurring immune responses and cancer immunopathology. CEDAR provides a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature and serves as a companion site to the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), which is focused on infectious, autoimmune, and allergic diseases. CEDAR is freely accessible at https://cedar.iedb.org/.",

            "abstract": "In-silico methods for the prediction of epitopes can support and improve workflows for vaccine design, antibody production, and disease therapy. So far, the scope of B cell and T cell epitope prediction has been directed exclusively towards peptidic antigens. Nevertheless, various non-peptidic molecular classes can be recognized by immune cells. These compounds have not been systematically studied yet, and prediction approaches are lacking. The ability to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds could have vast implications; for example, for immunogenic risk assessment of the vast number of drugs and other xenobiotics. Here we present the first general attempt to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) as a source for positive samples. The molecules stored in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database were chosen as background samples. The molecules were clustered into eight homogeneous molecular groups, and classifiers were built for each cluster with the aim of separating the epitopes from the background. Different molecular feature encoding schemes and machine learning models were compared against each other. For those models where a high performance could be achieved based on simple decision rules, the molecular features were then further investigated. Additionally, the findings were used to build a web server that allows for the immunogenic investigation of non-peptidic molecules (http://tools-staging.iedb.org/np_epitope_predictor). The prediction quality was tested with samples from independent evaluation datasets, and the implemented method received noteworthy Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) values, ranging from 0.69-0.96 depending on the molecule cluster.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) freely provides experimental data regarding immune epitopes to the scientific public. The main users of the IEDB are immunologists who can easily use our web interface to search for peptidic epitopes via their simple single-letter codes. For example, \u2018A\u2019 stands for \u2018alanine\u2019. Similarly, users can easily navigate the IEDB\u2019s simplified NCBI taxonomy hierarchy to locate proteins from specific organisms. However, some epitopes are non-peptidic, such as carbohydrates, lipids, chemicals and drugs, and it is more challenging to consistently name them and search upon, making access to their data more problematic for immunologists. Therefore, we set out to improve access to non-peptidic epitope data in the IEDB through the simplification of the non-peptidic hierarchy used in our search interfaces. Here, we present these efforts and their outcomes. Database URL: http://www.iedb.org/",

            "abstract": "Biological ontologies are used to organize, curate, and interpret the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments. While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application, and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology\u2019s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data FAIR.",

            "abstract": "Human immunology studies typically examine how immune exposures associated with vaccinations, infectious, allergic or autoimmune diseases, or transplantations perturb the immune system with the goal to develop diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions. While there are established approaches to formally represent the experimental data generated in such studies, which often comprises gene expression data, flow cytometry data, or serology data, the description of the immune exposures themselves is not well standardized. We here present a formal approach to represent immune exposures at a high level of granularity. We capture the exposure process (e.g. \u2018vaccination\u2019 or \u2018occurrence of allergic disease\u2019), exposure material (e.g. \u2018Tdap vaccine\u2019 or \u2018House dust mite\u2019), and the associated disease name and stage (e.g. \u2018allergic rhinitis\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019). This representation scheme has been used successfully in the IEDB and an extended version has been adopted by HIPC to capture studies in ImmPort. We are reporting here on this scheme, our ongoing attempts to map the terms used to existing ontologies, and the challenges encountered. Keywords\u2014immune exposure; modeling; HIPC; ontology",

The scope of the IEDB extends across immune epitope data related to all species studied and includes antibody, T cell, and MHC binding contexts associated with infectious, allergic, autoimmune, and transplant related diseases. Having been publicly accessible for >10 years, the recent focus of the IEDB has been improved query and reporting functionality to meet the needs of our users to access and summarize data that continues to grow in quantity and complexity. Here we present an update on our current efforts and future goals.",
