            "title": "GOODAT: Towards Test-time Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection",
            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have found widespread application in modeling graph data across diverse domains. While GNNs excel in scenarios where the testing data shares the distribution of their training counterparts (in distribution, ID), they often exhibit incorrect predictions when confronted with samples from an unfamiliar distribution (out-of-distribution, OOD). To identify and reject OOD samples with GNNs, recent studies have explored graph OOD detection, often focusing on training a specific model or modifying the data on top of a well-trained GNN. Despite their effectiveness, these methods come with heavy training resources and costs, as they need to optimize the GNN-based models on training data. Moreover, their reliance on modifying the original GNNs and accessing training data further restricts their universality. To this end, this paper introduces a method to detect Graph Out-of-Distribution At Test-time (namely GOODAT), a data-centric, unsupervised, and plug-and-play solution that operates independently of training data and modifications of GNN architecture. With a lightweight graph masker, GOODAT can learn informative subgraphs from test samples, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns between OOD and ID samples. To optimize the graph masker, we meticulously design three unsupervised objective functions based on the graph information bottleneck principle, motivating the masker to capture compact yet informative subgraphs for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our GOODAT method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks across a variety of real-world datasets.",

            "title": "Unveiling Implicit Deceptive Patterns in Multi-Modal Fake News via Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning",
            "abstract": "In the current Internet landscape, the rampant spread of fake news, particularly in the form of multi-modal content, poses a great social threat. While automatic multi-modal fake news detection methods have shown promising results, the lack of explainability remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches provide superficial explainability by displaying learned important components or views from well-trained networks, but they often fail to uncover the implicit deceptive patterns that reveal how fake news is fabricated. To address this limitation, we begin by predefining three typical deceptive patterns, namely image manipulation, cross-modal inconsistency, and image repurposing, which shed light on the mechanisms underlying fake news fabrication. Then, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Latent Model called NSLM, that not only derives accurate judgments on the veracity of news but also uncovers the implicit deceptive patterns as explanations. Specifically, the existence of each deceptive pattern is expressed as a two-valued learnable latent variable, which is acquired through amortized variational inference and weak supervision based on symbolic logic rules. Additionally, we devise pseudo-siamese networks to capture distinct deceptive patterns effectively. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our NSLM achieves the best performance in fake news detection while providing insightful explanations of deceptive patterns.",

While current research primarily emphasizes contextual modeling, there exists a dearth of investigation into effective multimodal fusion methods. We propose a novel framework called AIMDiT to solve the problem of multimodal fusion of deep features. Specifically, we design a Modality Augmentation Network which performs rich representation learning through dimension transformation of different modalities and parameter-efficient inception block. On the other hand, the Modality Interaction Network performs interaction fusion of extracted inter-modal features and intra-modal features. Experiments conducted using our AIMDiT framework on the public benchmark dataset MELD reveal 2.34% and 2.87% improvements in terms of the Acc-7 and w-F1 metrics compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.",

            "title": "Graph Neural Networks without Propagation",
            "abstract": "Due to the simplicity, intuition and explanation, most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed by following the pipeline of message passing. Although they achieve superior performances in many tasks, propagation-based GNNs possess three essential drawbacks. Firstly, the propagation tends to produce smooth effect, which meets the inductive bias of homophily, and causes two serious issues: over-smoothing issue and performance drop on networks with heterophily. Secondly, the propagations to each node are irrelevant, which prevents GNNs from modeling high-order relation, and cause the GNNs fragile to the attributes noises. Thirdly, propagation-based GNNs may be fragile to topology noise, since they heavily relay on propagation over the topology. Therefore, the propagation, as the key component of most GNNs, may be the essence of some serious issues in GNNs. To get to the root of these issue, this paper attempts to replace the propagation with a novel local operation. Quantitative experimental analysis reveals: 1) the existence of low-rank characteristic in the node attributes from ego-networks and 2) the performance improvement by reducing its rank. Motivated by this finding, this paper propose the Low-Rank GNNs, whose key component is the low-rank attribute matrix approximation in ego-network. The graph topology is employed to construct the ego-networks instead of message propagation, which is sensitive to topology noises. The proposed Low-Rank GNNs posses some attractive characteristics, including robust to topology and attribute noises, parameter-free and parallelizable. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance, robustness to noises and universality of the proposed Low-Rank GNNs.",

            "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently enjoyed great success as an efficient self-supervised representation learning approach. However, the existing methods have focused on designing of contrastive modes and used data augmentation with a rigid and inefficient one-to-one sampling strategy. We adopted node neighborhoods to extend positive samplings and made avoided resorting to data augmentation to create different views. We also considered the homophily problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between the inter-class node pairs. The key novelty of our method hinged upon analyzing this GNNs problem and integrating the GCL sampling strategy with homophily discrimination, where we solved these two significant problems using one approach. We introduced a new parameterized neighbor sampling component to replace the conventional sub-optimal samplings. By keeping and updating the neighbor sets, both the positive sampling of GCL and the message passing of GNNs can be optimized. Moreover, we theoretically proved that the new method provided a lower bound of mutual information for unsupervised semantic learning, and it can also keep the lower bound with downstream tasks. In essence, our method is a new self-supervised approach, which we refer to as group discrimination, and it can make the downstream fine-tuning efficient. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the new method can significantly outperform the existing GCL methods because the former can solve the homophily problem in a self-supervised",

            "abstract": "Recently, the wanton dissemination of fake news on social media has adversely affected our lives, rendering automatic fake news detection a pressing issue. Current methods are often fully supervised and typically employ deep neural networks (DNN) to learn implicit relevance from labeled data, ignoring explicitly shared properties (e.g., inflammatory expressions) across fake news. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-theoretic framework, called Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework (GDMRFF), that inherits the capability of deep learning while at the same time exploiting the correlations among the news articles (including labeled and unlabeled data). Specifically, we first leverage a DNN-based module to learn implicit relations, which we then reveal as the unary function of MRF. Pairwise functions with refining effects to encapsulate human insights are designed to capture the explicit association among all samples. Meanwhile, an event removal module is introduced to remove event impact on pairwise functions. Note that we train GDMRFF with the semi-supervised setting, which decreases the reliance on labeled data while maximizing the potential of unlabeled data. We further develop an Ambiguity Learning Guided MRF (ALGM) model as a concretization of GDMRFF. Experiments show that ALGM outperforms the compared methods significantly on two datasets, especially when labeled data is limited.",

            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) has become a popular tool to analyze the graph data. Existing GNNs only focus on networks with first-order dependency, that is, conventional networks following the Markov property. However, many networks in real life own the higher-order dependency, such as click-stream data where the choice of the next page depends not only on the current page but also on previous pages. This kind of sequential data from complex systems (including natural dependencies) are often ignored by existing GNNs which makes them ineffective. To address this problem, we propose for the first time new GNN approaches for higher-order networks in this paper. First, we form sequence fragments by the current node and its predecessor nodes of different orders as candidate higher-order dependencies. When the fragment significantly affects the probability distribution of different successor nodes of the current node, we include it in the higher-order dependency set. We formulize the network with higher-order dependency as an augmented conventional first-order network, and then feed it into GNNs to derive network embeddings. Moreover, we further propose a new end-to-end GNN framework for dealing with higher-order networks directly in the model. Specifically, the higher-order dependency is used as the neighbor aggregation controller when the node is embedded and updated. In the graph convolutional layer, in addition to the first-order neighbor information, we also aggregate the middle node information from the higher-order dependency segment. We finally test the new approaches on three real networks with higher-order dependency, and compare with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show significant improvements of the new approaches which consider higher-order dependency.",

            "title": "Self-Supervised Graph Neural Networks via Diverse and Interactive Message Passing",
            "abstract": "By interpreting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the message passing from the spatial perspective, their success is attributed to Laplacian smoothing. However, it also leads to serious over-smoothing issue by stacking many layers. Recently, many efforts have been paid to overcome this issue in semi-supervised learning. Unfortunately, it is more serious in unsupervised node representation learning task due to the lack of supervision information. Thus, most of the unsupervised or self-supervised GNNs often employ \\textit{one-layer GCN} as the encoder. Essentially, the over-smoothing issue is caused by the over-simplification of the existing message passing, which possesses two intrinsic limits: blind message and uniform passing. In this paper, a novel Diverse and Interactive Message Passing (DIMP) is proposed for self-supervised learning by overcoming these limits. Firstly, to prevent the message from blindness and make it interactive between two connected nodes, the message is determined by both the two connected nodes instead of the attributes of one node. Secondly, to prevent the passing from uniformness and make it diverse over different attribute channels, different propagation weights are assigned to different elements in the message. To this end, a natural implementation of the message in DIMP is the element-wise product of the representations of two connected nodes. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the proposed DIMP is equivalent to performing an overlapping community detection via expectation-maximization (EM). Both the objective function of the community detection and the convergence of EM algorithm guarantee that DMIP can prevent from over-smoothing issue. Extensive evaluations on node-level and graph-level tasks demonstrate the superiority of DIMP on improving performance and overcoming over-smoothing issue.",

            "title": "Amer: A New Attribute-Missing Network Embedding Approach",
            "abstract": "Network embedding which aims to learn a low dimensional representation of nodes is a powerful technique for network analysis. While network embedding for networks with complete attributes has been widely investigated, in many real-world applications the attributes of partial nodes are unobserved (i.e., missing) due to privacy concern or resource limit. Very recently, several network embedding methods have been proposed for attribute-missing networks. They first complete the missing attributes and then use the complemented network to learn network embedding. The parameters of these two processes cannot be adjusted by each other, resulting in compromised results. To address this problem, we propose a unified model in which the process of completing missing attributes and the process of learning embedding are not separated but closely intertwined. Being specific, completing missing attributes is under the guidance of learning network representation via mutual information maximization, and the complemented attributes directly enter network representation module which will generate further feedback for completing missing attributes. We further impose attribute-structure relationship constraint for completing missing attributes by designing a new generative adversarial networks (GANs) model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified model for attribute-missing network embedding. Empirical results on real-world datasets show the superiority of our new method over other state-of-the-art methods on four network analysis tasks, including node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and network visualization.",
