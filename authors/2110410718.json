            "title": "Blockchain-Based Decentralized Cloud Storage With Reliable Deduplication and Storage Balancing",
            "abstract": "Data deduplication schemes have been widely used in cloud storage systems to save storage space by eliminating duplicate outsourced data. However, the reduction of redundancy leads to decreased data availability and unbalanced data distribution. This paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized storage system with reliable deduplication and storage balance strategy to provide reliability for deduplicated outsourced data. Encrypted data is split into chunks by a ramp secret sharing scheme, and it is distributed to multiple independent cloud servers. States of the chunks are recorded on the tamper-proofed blockchain and they can be used to recover the raw data or support the verification of user identity. To balance the distribution of data among storage servers, a heuristic matching algorithm is designed to efficiently allocate the available storage space. The allocation services are published by autonomous smart contracts and other participants gain rewards by giving the best matching results of data chunks and storage servers. Formulation analysis demonstrates the correctness of the proposed scheme in terms of data consistency, integrity, and reliability. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme preserves the confidentiality of outsourced data with acceptable computational consumption.",

            "abstract": "In Internet of Vehicles (IoV), it is critical to collect sufficient data for model training, to support vehicular intelligent applications. However, the environment of IoV is highly dynamic due to the mobility of vehicles, making it challenging to efficiently allocate resources for data collection. Additionally, timely training of machine learning models with collected data is important for accurate representation in a constantly changing environment. This article aims to improve the performance of model training by collecting sufficient data from vehicles in IoV. A system throughput maximization problem is formulated under the limited bandwidth, storage, and computing resources, which is an NP-hard problem. To solve the problem, an iterative algorithm, namely, the iterative algorithm based on approaching minimum bandwidth (IAMB), is proposed to preferentially collect data from the vehicles with sufficient data and reliable communication quality. Besides, a genetic algorithm, namely, the genetic algorithm based on approaching minimum bandwidth (GAMB), is proposed to further improve the probability of superior individual by replacing operation. We also customize three greedy strategy-based algorithms as the baselines. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform the baseline algorithms for all cases. Specifically, IAMB and GAMB can improve the throughput by up to 5% and 8%, respectively, compared with baseline algorithms. In addition, the customized genetic algorithm is also superior to the iterative algorithm on performance of system throughput. Moreover, the customized genetic algorithm is more stable than the proposed iterative algorithm in terms of system throughput for model training in the dynamic network environment.",

            "abstract": "This article is focused on bibliographic analysis and collaboration pattern analysis of the textpapers published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) from January 2019 to January 2023. We have identified the authors, institutions, and countries/regions that are the most productive and have the highest impact. It is found that research on intelligent vehicles is dominated by researchers and institutions from China. Researchers from the US are the second largest contributor to the transaction, whilst those from Germany rank the third. It is also found that, Fei-Yue Wang, Mohan Manubhai Trivedi, and J. Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.",

            "abstract": "\n Ridesharing is an effective approach to alleviate traffic congestion. In most existing works, drivers and passengers are assigned prices without considering the constraints of desired benefits. This paper investigates ridesharing by formulating a matching and pricing problem to maximize the total payoff of drivers, with the constraints of desired benefit and quality of experience. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem based on coalitional double auction. Secondary pricing based strategy and sacrificed minimum bid based strategy are proposed to support the algorithm. This paper also proves that the proposed algorithm can achieve a Nash-stable coalition partition in finite steps, and the proposed two strategies guarantee truthfulness, individually rational and budget balance. Extensive simulation results on the real-world dataset of taxi trajectory in Beijing city show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing ones, in terms of average total payoff of drivers while meeting the benefits of passengers.",

            "abstract": "The space robot has been used widely in the aerospace industry. Because of the special working environment and limited fuel, an appropriate path is necessary for space robots to work. This paper investigates the path planning for multiple space robots to execute exploration tasks. To reduce the completion latency of exploration tasks, we model the joint problem of path planning and task assignment. Then we propose a combination algorithm named Branch addition path planning and Task Assignment (BTA). Finally, we implement a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the Random path planning and Task Assignment algorithm (RTA) constructed also in this paper. Specifically, BTA performs better than RTA in terms of completion latency and BTA can save more fuel than RTA. Furthermore, the path planning algorithms forward search branch addition of BTA performs more stably than the random path planning of RTA in terms of running time.",
