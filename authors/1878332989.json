            "abstract": "The identification of disease-associated microbial characteristics is crucial for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, the heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and large amounts of microbial data present tremendous challenges for the discovery of key microbial features. In this paper, we present IDAM, a novel computational method for disease-associated gene module inference from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. This method integrates gene context conservation (uber-operon) and regulatory mechanisms (gene co-expression patterns) to explore gene modules associated with specific phenotypes using a mathematical graph model, without relying on prior meta-data. We applied IDAM to publicly available datasets from inflammatory bowel disease, melanoma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and irritable bowel syndrome and demonstrated the superior performance of IDAM in disease-associated characteristics inference compared to popular tools. We also showed high reproducibility of the inferred gene modules of IDAM using independent cohorts with inflammatory bowel disease. We believe that IDAM can be a highly advantageous method for exploring disease-associated microbial characteristics. The source code of IDAM is freely available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/IDAM.",

            "abstract": "Alternative transcription units (ATUs) are dynamically encoded under different conditions and display overlapping patterns (sharing one or more genes) under a specific condition in bacterial genomes. Genome-scale identification of ATUs is essential for studying the emergence of human diseases caused by bacterial organisms. However, it is unrealistic to identify all ATUs using experimental techniques because of the complexity and dynamic nature of ATUs. Here, we present the first-of-its-kind computational framework, named SeqATU, for genome-scale ATU prediction based on next-generation RNA-Seq data. The framework utilizes a convex quadratic programming model to seek an optimum expression combination of all of the to-be-identified ATUs. The predicted ATUs in Escherichia coli reached a precision of 0.77/0.74 and a recall of 0.75/0.76 in the two RNA-Sequencing datasets compared with the benchmarked ATUs from third-generation RNA-Seq data. In addition, the proportion of 5'- or 3'-end genes of the predicted ATUs, having documented transcription factor binding sites and transcription termination sites, was three times greater than that of no 5'- or 3'-end genes. We further evaluated the predicted ATUs by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analyses. The results suggested that gene pairs frequently encoded in the same ATUs are more functionally related than those that can belong to two distinct ATUs. Overall, these results demonstrated the high reliability of predicted ATUs. We expect that the new insights derived by SeqATU will not only improve the understanding of the transcription mechanism of bacteria but also guide the reconstruction of a genome-scale transcriptional regulatory network.",

            "abstract": "Together with various hosts and environments, ubiquitous microbes interact closely with each other forming an intertwined system or community. Of interest, shifts of the relationships between microbes and their hosts or environments are associated with critical diseases and ecological changes. While advances in high-throughput Omics technologies offer a great opportunity for understanding the structures and functions of microbiome, it is still challenging to analyse and interpret the omics data. Specifically, the heterogeneity and diversity of microbial communities, compounded with the large size of the datasets, impose a tremendous challenge to mechanistically elucidate the complex communities. Fortunately, network analyses provide an efficient way to tackle this problem, and several network approaches have been proposed to improve this understanding recently. Here, we systemically illustrate these network theories that have been used in biological and biomedical research. Then, we review existing network modelling methods of microbial studies at multiple layers from metagenomics to metabolomics and further to multi-omics. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of present studies and provide a perspective for further directions in support of the understanding of microbial communities.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple biological processes. However, only a few ncRNAs\u2019 functions have been well studied. Given the significance of ncRNAs classification for understanding ncRNAs\u2019 functions, more and more computational methods have been introduced to improve the classification automatically and accurately. In this paper, based on a convolutional neural network and a deep forest algorithm, multi-grained cascade forest (GcForest), we propose a novel deep fusion learning framework, GcForest fusion method (GCFM), to classify alignments of ncRNA sequences for accurate clustering of ncRNAs. GCFM integrates a multi-view structure feature representation including sequence-structure alignment encoding, structure image representation and shape alignment encoding of structural subunits, enabling us to capture the potential specificity between ncRNAs. For the classification of pairwise alignment of two ncRNA sequences, the F-value of GCFM improves 6% than an existing alignment-based method. Furthermore, the clustering of ncRNA families is carried out based on the classification matrix generated from GCFM. Results suggest better performance (with 20% accuracy improved) than existing ncRNA clustering methods (RNAclust, Ensembleclust and CNNclust). Additionally, we apply GCFM to construct a phylogenetic tree of ncRNA and predict the probability of interactions between RNAs. Most ncRNAs are located correctly in the phylogenetic tree, and the prediction accuracy of RNA interaction is 90.63%. A web server (http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/gcfm/) is developed to maximize its availability, and the source code and related data are available at the same URL.",

Uncovering organizational mechanisms of bacterial genomes has been a primary focus of researchers to reveal the potential cellular activities. The advances in both experimental techniques and computational models provide a tremendous opportunity for understanding these mechanisms, and various studies have been proposed to explore the organization rules of bacterial genomes associated with functions recently. This review focuses mainly on the principles that shape the organization of bacterial genomes, both locally and globally. We first illustrate local structures as operons/transcription units for facilitating co-transcription and horizontal transfer of genes. We then clarify the constraints that globally shape bacterial genomes, such as metabolism, transcription and replication. Finally, we highlight challenges and opportunities to advance bacterial genomic studies and provide application perspectives of genome organization, including pathway hole assignment and genome assembly and understanding disease mechanisms.",
