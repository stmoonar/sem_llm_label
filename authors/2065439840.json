            "title": "Protecting Intellectual Property With Reliable Availability of Learning Models in AI-Based Cybersecurity Services",
            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity services offer significant promise in many scenarios, including malware detection, content supervision, and so on. Meanwhile, many commercial and government applications have raised the need for intellectual property protection of using deep neural network (DNN). Existing studies (e.g., watermarking techniques) on intellectual property protection only aim at inserting secret information into DNNs, allowing producers to detect whether the given DNN infringes on their own copyrights. However, since the availability protection of learning models is rarely considered, the piracy model can still work with high accuracy. In this paper, a novel model locking (M-LOCK) scheme for the DNN is proposed to enhance its availability protection, where the DNN produces poor accuracy if a specific token is absent, while it maps only the tokenized inputs into correct predictions. The proposed scheme performs the verification process during the DNN inference operation, actively protecting models\u2019 intellectual property copyright at each query. Specifically, to train the token-sensitive decision-making boundaries of DNNs, a data poisoning-based model manipulation (DPMM) method is also proposed, which minimizes the correlation between the dummy outputs and correct predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed scheme could achieve high reliability and effectiveness across various benchmark datasets as well as typical model protection methods.",

            "abstract": "As electric vehicle (EV) ownership becomes more commonplace, partly due to government incentives, there is a need also to design solutions such as energy allocation strategies to more effectively support sustainable vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications. Therefore, this work proposes an energy allocation strategy, designed to minimize the electricity cost while improving the operating revenue. Specifically, V2G is abstracted as a three-domain network architecture to facilitate flexible, intelligent, and scalable energy allocation decision-making. Furthermore, this work combines virtual network embedding (VNE) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, where a DRL-based agent model is proposed, to adaptively perceives environmental features and extracts the feature matrix as input. In particular, the agent consists of a four-layer architecture for node and link embedding, and jointly optimizes the decision-making through a reward mechanism and gradient back-propagation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through simulation case studies. Specifically, compared to the used benchmarks, it improves the VNR acceptance ratio, Long-term average revenue, and Long-term average revenue-cost ratio indicators by an average of 3.17%, 191.36, and 2.04%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts combining VNE and DRL to provide an energy allocation strategy for V2G.",

However, in the existing SIS schemes, the shadow images will be easily tampered and corrupted during the communication, which will pose serious security issues. Recently, blockchain has emerged as a promising paradigm in the field of data communication and information security. To securely communicate and effectively protect the secret image data in wireless networks, we propose a Blockchain-based Secure and Efficient Secret Image Sharing (BC-SESIS) scheme with outsourcing computation in wireless networks. In the proposed BC-SESIS scheme, the shadow images are encrypted and stored in the blockchain to prevent them from being tampered and corrupted. The identity authentication-enabled smart contract is deployed to achieve the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(k,n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> threshold for secret image restoring. Furthermore, to reduce the computational burden of smart contract and users, an efficient outsourcing computation method is designed to outsource the restoring task, which is securely implemented by agent miners in the encryption domain. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that the BC-SESIS scheme can achieve desirable communication security and high computational efficiency in the wireless networks.",

            "abstract": "In the collaborative intelligent transportation system, providing precise positioning services is costly. Reducing resource consumption and improving revenue are crucial to the development of positioning services. Therefore, a practical algorithm that combines cloud and edge network environments is necessary to improve the positioning services. Integrating network function virtualization and edge computing can provide users with more flexible and efficient services. Based on the above issues, we use the service function chain (SFC) to improve the positioning services provided in cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative networks (CEVCN). We propose a deep reinforcement learning-assisted SFC embedding algorithm and improve its performance through training. We construct a five-layer policy network to sense the environment of CEVCN and derive the optimal node selection strategy. Finally, we use the breadth-first search algorithm to solve the embedding scheme for virtual links. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has excellent performance. The long-term average revenue is improved by 21%, the long-term average revenue-cost ratio is improved by 13%, and the embedding rate is improved by 8%.",

As a decentralized application deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts help the blockchain realize safe and efficient information storage, asset management, and value transfer. Therefore, smart contracts play a vital role in the security of the blockchain. In recent years, security threats against smart contracts have increased, not only causing huge economic losses but also impacting the credit system of the blockchain. Therefore, many researchers have carried out corresponding research on the security threats of smart contracts. Common threat detection methods include formal verification, symbolic execution, fuzzing, etc. Most of these methods are only for known threats, while there is not much work on detecting unknown threats. In order to better deal with unknown threats, we present a review of the typical smart contract security events in recent years, analyze the security threats from contract coding, Ethereum virtual machine, and blockchain characteristics. Further, we compare and summarize the latest unknown threat detection methods. Then, to address the problem that very few unknown threat samples are available, a detection method based on a few-shot learning is proposed.",

            "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), multiaccess edge computing (MEC) technology places computing resources closer to users at edge nodes, enabling faster, more reliable, and secure computing services. In the MEC-enabled IoV networks, task offloading scheduling, as an effective method to alleviate the computational burden on vehicles, is gaining increasing attention. However, with the intelligent and networked development of vehicles, the complex data dependency between in-vehicle tasks brings challenges to offloading scheduling. In contrast to many existing methods that solely address individual tasks, there is a growing need to tackle interrelated tasks within the IoV framework. This includes tasks like processing vehicle sensor data, gathering and analyzing road condition information, facilitating collaborative decision making among vehicles, and optimizing traffic signal systems. Our objective is to address the broader challenge of offloading dependent tasks, as this closely aligns with real-world scenes and requirements. In this article, we propose a priority-based task scheduling algorithm (PBTSA) to minimize processing delay when the tasks are interdependent. PBTSA proposes a method that can better measure the data transmission and calculation delay of the IoV networks. We first model dependent tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then use the reverse breadth-first search (RBFS) algorithm to generate the priority of each subtask, and finally according to the priority with low complexity to offload subtasks greedily to minimize task processing delay. We compare the PBTSA with the other two existing algorithms through simulations. The results show that the PBTSA can effectively reduce the task processing delay and can reach close to 10%.",

            "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of IoT and mobile devices in the different applications, their computing power, memory, and battery life are still limited. Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) has recently emerged to address the drawbacks of these limitations. With MEC on the network's edge, mobile and IoT devices can offload their computing operations to adjacent edge servers or remote cloud servers. However, task offloading is still a challenging research issue, and it is necessary to improve the overall Quality of Service (QoS) and attain optimized performance and resource utilization. Another crucial issue that is usually overlooked while handling this matter is offloading an application that consists of dependent tasks. In this study, we suggest a Refined Whale Optimization Algorithm (RWOA) for solving the multiuser dependent tasks offloading problem in the Edge-Cloud computing environment with three objectives: 1- minimizing the application execution latency, 2- minimizing the energy consumption of end devices, and 3- the charging cost for used resources. We also avoid the traditional binary planning mechanisms by allowing each task to be partially processed simultaneously at three processing locations (local device, MEC, cloud). We compare RWOA with other Optimizers, and the results demonstrate that the RWOA has optimized the fitness by 52.7% relative to the second best comparison optimizer.",

            "abstract": "The integrated backscatter communication (BackCom) and active communication (AC) scheme can improve wireless-powered mobile edge computing (WPMEC) system performance in general single-user and multi-user scenarios. However, there is little research in the cooperation-assisted WPMEC scenario. In this article, we consider a cooperation-assisted WPMEC system consisting of a source node (SN), a helper and a hybrid access point (HAP) integrated with MEC servers. An innovative user cooperation (UC) scheme with the integrated BackCom and AC is proposed to enhance the system performance. As a relay, the helper can help the SN to transmit its computing tasks due to the poor communication link between the SN and the HAP. To be specific, we aim at maximizing the user energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the backscatter reflection coefficient for BackCom, the transmission power for AC, the system time and task optimization allocation while considering the minimum computation bits requirement, the channel capacity and energy constraints. Based on a fractional program, we first transform the EE maximization problem into an equivalent one (non-convex problem) and then transform this non-convex problem into a convex problem by exploiting variable substitution and convex optimization. In addition, semi-closed form expressions of the optimal solution are deduced. An energy efficiency maximization algorithm is proposed to solve this convex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the user EE than the existing schemes.",

            "abstract": "Historical patients\u2019 medical data has an important impact on the healthcare industry for providing the best care to patients through intelligent health diagnosis and prediction of diseases. The existing intelligent health diagnosis systems collect data from medical institutions or laboratories and then use machine learning algorithms to predict diseases. But, in most cases, the medical institutions have incomplete medical data of the patients since a patient may consult different specialists (from various hospitals) during the treatment process. To overcome this problem, we build a smart and secure federated learning framework for intelligent health diagnosis with a blockchain-based incentive mechanism and nonfungible tokens (NFTs)-based marketplace. We make use of NFTs to develop clear demarkations on the ownership and accessibility of the data of patients. We create an NFT marketplace that manages access to the historical medical data of patients. A comprehensive incentive mechanism based on several factors, including the quality and relevance of the data, the frequency, regularity of data uploading, etc., is incorporated to encourage and penalize the patients based on their contributions to the global model. We used the Polyak-averaging technique for aggregating local models to form a global model. The extensive analysis shows that the proposed model achieves comparable performance with the centralized machine learning models while affording better security and access to better data. The results also show the efficacy of the proposed blockchain-based incentive mechanism.",

            "abstract": "With the development of low-cost computer chips and wireless networks, any object or thing can become a component of the Internet of Things (IoT). As a result, these disparate things will gain digital intelligence, enabling them to connect with real-time data and be used for a wide range of valuable and practical IoT applications. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication and the presence of eavesdroppers, the IoT systems pose serious threats to privacy and message integrity, particularly with mobile sensors. Recently, physical-layer security (PLS) has been proposed as a cost-effective solution that mitigates the impact of growing security threats. In this article, we propose a PLS-based hybrid nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)/power division multiplexing (PDM) IoT system that provides a high probability of secured transmission, a low computational complexity, and a low-power consumption. 3-D stochastic geometry tools have been used to introduce and evaluate our proposed scheme in a variety of practical scenarios where users are randomly located in a 3-D space. Furthermore, we derive the new scheme\u2019s key agreement ratio (KAR) expression, the probability expressions of using NOMA and PDM modes. Moreover, we derive the associated secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the average ergodic capacity (AEC) expressions for the proposed scheme as well as for the pure NOMA and pure PDM schemes. In addition, we introduce and investigate the security power efficiency (SPE) metric, that serves as a new key agreement optimization metric. Numerical results are performed to validate the obtained analytical expressions and to assess the proposed scheme performances in terms of KAR, SOP, and AEC, when compared to pure NOMA and pure PDM schemes.",
