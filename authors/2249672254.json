            "abstract": "Names carry important information about our identities and demographics such as gender, nationality, ethnicity, etc. We investigate the use of individual\u2019s name, in both Arabic and English, to predict important attributes, namely country, region, gender, and language. We extract data from Wikidata, and normalize it, to build a comprehensive dataset consisting of more than 1 million entities and their normalized attributes. We experiment with a Linear SVM approach, as well as two Transformers approaches consisting of BERT model fine-tuning and Transformers pipeline. Our results indicate that we can predict the gender, language and region using the name only with a confidence over 0.65. The country attribute can be predicted with less accuracy. The Linear SVM approach outperforms the other approaches for all the attributes. The best performing approach was also evaluated on another dataset that consists of 1,500 names from 15 countries (covering different regions) extracted from Twitter, and yields similar results.",

            "title": "Detecting and identifying the reasons for deleted tweets before they are posted",
            "abstract": "Social media platforms empower us in several ways, from information dissemination to consumption. While these platforms are useful in promoting citizen journalism, public awareness, etc., they have misuse potential. Malicious users use them to disseminate hate speech, offensive content, rumor, etc. to promote social and political agendas or to harm individuals, entities, and organizations. Oftentimes, general users unconsciously share information without verifying it or unintentionally post harmful messages. Some of such content often gets deleted either by the platform due to the violation of terms and policies or by users themselves for different reasons, e.g., regret. There is a wide range of studies in characterizing, understanding, and predicting deleted content. However, studies that aim to identify the fine-grained reasons (e.g., posts are offensive, hate speech, or no identifiable reason) behind deleted content are limited. In this study, we address an existing gap by identifying and categorizing deleted tweets, especially within the Arabic context. We label them based on fine-grained disinformation categories. We have curated a dataset of 40K tweets, annotated with both coarse and fine-grained labels. Following this, we designed models to predict the likelihood of tweets being deleted and to identify the potential reasons for their deletion. Our experiments, conducted using a variety of classic and transformer models, indicate that performance surpasses the majority baseline (e.g., 25% absolute improvement for fine-grained labels). We believe that such models can assist in moderating social media posts even before they are published.",

            "abstract": "The abundance of social media data in the Arab world, specifically on Twitter, enabled companies and entities to exploit such rich and beneficial data that could be mined and used to extract important information, including sentiments and opinions of people towards a topic or a merchandise. However, with this plenitude comes the issue of producing models that are able to deliver consistent outcomes when tested within various contexts. Although model generalization has been thoroughly investigated in many fields, it has not been heavily investigated in the Arabic context. To address this gap, we investigate the generalization of models and data in Arabic with application to sentiment analysis, by performing a battery of experiments and building different models that are tested on five independent test sets to understand their performance when presented with unseen data. In doing so, we detail different techniques that improve the generalization of machine learning models in Arabic sentiment analysis, and share a large versatile dataset consisting of approximately 1.64M Arabic tweets and their corresponding sentiment to be used for future research. Our experiments concluded that the most consistent model is trained using a dataset labelled by a cascaded approach of two models, one that labels neutral tweets and another that identifies positive/negative tweets based on the Arabic emoji lexicon after class balancing. Both the BERT and the SVM models trained using the refined data achieve an average F-1 score of 0.62 and 0.60, and standard deviation of 0.06 and 0.04 respectively, when evaluated on five diverse test sets, outperforming other models by at least 17% relative gain in F-1. Based on our experiments, we share recommendations to improve model generalization for classification tasks.",

            "abstract": "We present an overview of the ArAIEval shared task, organized as part of the first ArabicNLP 2023 conference co-located with EMNLP 2023. ArAIEval offers two tasks over Arabic text: (1) persuasion technique detection, focusing on identifying persuasion techniques in tweets and news articles, and (2) disinformation detection in binary and multiclass setups over tweets. A total of 20 teams participated in the final evaluation phase, with 14 and 16 teams participating in Task 1 and Task 2, respectively. Across both tasks, we observe that fine-tuning transformer models such as AraBERT is the core of majority of participating systems. We provide a description of the task setup, including description of datasets construction and the evaluation setup. We also provide a brief overview of the participating systems. All datasets and evaluation scripts from the shared task are released to the research community. We hope this will enable further research on such important tasks within the Arabic NLP community.",

            "abstract": "The recent development and success of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitate an evaluation of their performance across diverse NLP tasks in different languages. Although several frameworks have been developed and made publicly available, their customization capabilities for specific tasks and datasets are often complex for different users. In this study, we introduce the LLMeBench framework, which can be seamlessly customized to evaluate LLMs for any NLP task, regardless of language. The framework features generic dataset loaders, several model providers, and pre-implements most standard evaluation metrics. It supports in-context learning with zero- and few-shot settings. A specific dataset and task can be evaluated for a given LLM in less than 20 lines of code while allowing full flexibility to extend the framework for custom datasets, models, or tasks. The framework has been tested on 31 unique NLP tasks using 53 publicly available datasets within 90 experimental setups, involving approximately 296K data points. We open-sourced LLMeBench for the community (https://github.com/qcri/LLMeBench/) and a video demonstrating the framework is available online (https://youtu.be/9cC2m_abk3A).",
