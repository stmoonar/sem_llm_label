            "abstract": "To address rapid fluctuations in non-stationary channel environments, adaptive pilot patterns are commonly used. However, frequent pilot pattern changes require an interactive mechanism for terminal communication. In this letter, we introduce a time-domain pilot muting mechanism (TDPMM) based on the densest pilot pattern, combined with power optimization using deep reinforcement learning. This approach aims to mitigate issues associated with frequent pilot pattern adjustments in non-stationary channel fading environments. We first formulate an energy efficiency (EE) optimization model that balances normalized mean square error (NMSE) and energy consumption (EC) for large-scale continuous resource blocks (RBs) using TDPMM. Then, we propose a deep Q-network (DQN) based learning strategy tailored to optimize TDPMM selection and the power ratio between pilot and data signals. Simulation experiments confirm the superior EE performance of the proposed TDPMM. Furthermore, our DQN-based approach demonstrates lower complexity and only slightly inferior performance compared to the exhaustive search strategy.",

            "abstract": "Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) beamforming has been recognized as a key element to support challenging requirements in the vehicular communication environment. In order to provide accurate beam alignment and tracking results in the high mobility scenario, the mobility induced channel prediction mechanism has been proposed in the line-of-sight (LOS) fading environment, while the application to the practical mixed LOS and non-LOS fading environment is still open. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility and channel prediction combined beamforming (MCPCB) scheme to deal with this issue. Specifically, we rely on per-cluster angular based information and non-linear tracking scheme for angular-delay profile to obtain reliable single input multiple output (SIMO) channel prediction. By linking the estimated mobility parameters and the per-cluster beam directions, our proposed MCPCB scheme is able to provide a higher receiving energy with reduced prediction errors, and achieve more robust prediction performance when the cluster level channel blocking happens. Through analytical and numerical results, we show that the proposed MCPCB scheme can achieve about \u221250.6 dB and \u221287.7 dB of average received power gain in the LOS and NLOS scenarios, respectively, and outperform many conventional channel prediction methods.",

            "abstract": "Pre-distortion is a key technique to compensate for the nonlinear distortions caused by the transmitter in wireless communication systems. Generally, pre-distortion can be classified into digital pre-distortion (DPD) and analog pre-distortion (APD), which focus on optimizing and assessing the nonlinearity in their own areas. In this paper, we propose a new DPD approach to optimize the performance metric of the analog RF-domain (i.e., inter-modulation distortion (IMD) or adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)) and that of the digital IF-domain (i.e., mean square error (MSE)) simultaneously. To make the joint design feasible, we derive a new hybrid performance metric, where the analog preferred metric is defined in the form of digital signals to bridge the gap between digital and analog signal processing. On top of that, an effective DPD scheme is developed based on a new dual time-delayed neural network (TDNN) learning architecture. The coefficients of the TDNN for power amplifier (PA) modeling can be trained offline with a PA dataset, while those of the TDNN for pre-distortion are obtained adaptively by optimizing the proposed joint design metric. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is able to significantly improve the IMD/ACPR performance without compromising the MSE, compared to conventional DPD schemes.",

            "abstract": "As a core performance metric for green communications, the conventional energy efficiency (EE) definition has successfully resolved many issues in the energy-efficient wireless network design. In the past several generations of wireless communication networks, the traditional EE measure plays an important role to guide many energy-saving techniques for slow varying traffic profiles. However, for the next-generation wireless networks, the traditional EE fails to capture the traffic and capacity variations of wireless networks in temporal or spatial domains, which is shown to be quite popular, especially with ultrascale multiple antennas and space\u2013air\u2013ground integrated network (SAGIN). In this article, we present a novel EE metric named integrated relative EE (IREE), which is able to jointly measure the traffic profiles and the network capacities from the EE perspective. On top of that, the IREE-based green tradeoffs have been investigated and compared with the conventional energy-efficient design. Moreover, we apply the IREE-based green tradeoffs to evaluate several candidate technologies for 6G networks, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and SAGIN. Through some analytical and numerical results, we show that the proposed IREE metric is able to capture the wireless traffic and capacity mismatch property, which is significantly different from the conventional EE metric. Since the IREE-oriented design or deployment strategy is able to consider the network capacity improvement and the wireless traffic matching simultaneously, it can be regarded as a useful guidance for future energy-efficient network design.",

Firstly, we consider scenarios of continuous Artificial Intelligence (AI) task arrivals, like the object detection for video streams, and utilize a serial queuing model for the accurate evaluation of End-to-End (E2E) delay in cooperative edge inference. Secondly, to enhance the long-term performance of inference systems, we formulate a multi-slot stochastic E2E delay optimization problem that jointly considers model partitioning and multi-dimensional resource allocation. Finally, to solve this problem, we introduce a Lyapunov-guided Multi-Dimensional Optimization algorithm (LyMDO) that decouples the original problem into per-slot deterministic problems, where Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and convex optimization are used for joint optimization of partitioning decisions and complementary resource allocation. Simulation results show that our approach effectively improves E2E delay while balancing long-term resource constraints.",

Such WPT-powered MEC systems have yet to be optimized for long-term efficiency, due to random and changing task demands and wireless channel states of the devices. This paper presents an augmented two-staged deep Q-network (DQN), referred to as \u201cTS-DQN,\u201d for online optimization of WPT-powered MEC systems, where the WPT, offloading schedule, channel allocation, and the CPU configurations of the edge server and devices are jointly optimized to minimize the long-term average energy requirement of the systems. The key idea is to design a DQN for learning the channel allocation and task admission, while the WPT, offloading time and CPU configurations are efficiently optimized to precisely evaluate the reward of the DQN and substantially reduce its action space. Another important aspect is that a new action generation method is developed to expand and diversify the actions of the DQN, further accelerating its convergence. As validated by simulations, the proposed TS-DQN is much more energy efficient and converges much faster, than its potential alternative directly using the state-of-the-art Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to learn all decision variables.",

However, mobile edge computing (MEC) makes it possible to solve this problem. This paper considers the scene of completing video-based AI inference tasks in the MEC system. We formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) to reduce inference delays, energy consumption and to improve recognition accuracy. We give a simplified expression of the inference complexity model and accuracy model through derivation and experimentation. The problem is then solved iteratively by using alternating optimization. Specifically, by assuming that the offloading decision is given, the problem is decoupled into two sub-problems, i.e., the resource allocation problem for the devices set that completes the inference tasks locally, and that for the devices set that offloads tasks. For the problem of offloading decision optimization, we propose a Channel-Aware heuristic algorithm. To further reduce the complexity, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based distributed algorithm. The ADMM-based algorithm has a low computational complexity that grows linearly with the number of devices. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms. The trade-off relationship between delay, energy consumption, and accuracy is also analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Smartphone based indoor localization has been widely explored for meeting the demand of high-precision low-cost indoor localization. Previous methods focus mainly on improving the localization accuracy of single sensor based localization, which may hinder their applications. In this article, we propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture for high-precision low-cost indoor localization. We first leverage two modal-specific encoders for feature extraction. Then, we propose two feature-level fusion strategies for feature fusion. Finally, we leverage two task-specific decoders for both position and orientation prediction. During training, we adopt WiFi-aided learning to provide a more reliable label. We test the proposed method in the corridor environment of a typical building. Experiments results show that our method can achieve less than a half meter localization accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys the run-time efficiency.",

            "title": "A Novel Mobility Induced Channel Prediction Mechanism for Vehicular Communications",
            "abstract": "The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a vital and challenging task in wireless communications, especially for high mobility scenarios with rapidly varying channels. Channel prediction, as an effective approach to acquire CSI, is considered a promising approach to improve the communication performance. However, most of the current prediction methods with the assumption of slowly varying channel components cannot cope with rapid variation. In this paper, we propose a novel channel prediction scheme to incorporate the mobility of both transceivers and scatterers. Based on the estimated mobility parameters, the component-wise channel extraction results are derived and then the channel frequency response is predicted. In addition, the prediction performance and the computational complexity of the proposed scheme are analyzed and evaluated, and the relationship between the mobility parameter estimation error and the channel component prediction accuracy is revealed as well. Through predicted results based on the simulated and measured data, the performance of the proposed scheme surpasses the conventional schemes with genie-aided information.",
