            "title": "Concept2Box: Joint Geometric Embeddings for Learning Two-View Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been extensively studied to embed large-scale relational data for many real-world applications. Existing methods have long ignored the fact many KGs contain two fundamentally different views: high-level ontology-view concepts and fine-grained instance-view entities. They usually embed all nodes as vectors in one latent space. However, a single geometric representation fails to capture the structural differences between two views and lacks probabilistic semantics towards concepts' granularity. We propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG using dual geometric representations. We model concepts with box embeddings, which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and disjoint among them. Box volumes can be interpreted as concepts' granularity. Different from concepts, we model entities as vectors. To bridge the gap between concept box embeddings and entity vector embeddings, we propose a novel vector-to-box distance metric and learn both embeddings jointly. Experiments on both the public DBpedia KG and a newly-created industrial KG showed the effectiveness of Concept2Box.",

            "abstract": "Video multi-label classification is one of the most important fields in Computer Vision, which leads to further study of video understanding. The existing effective research methods are mostly based on 2D CNN model, which has a good performance on spatial feature extraction. In this paper, motivated by the emerging studies on objectness in videos, such as Object Detection, and Object Recognition, we proposed an improved 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) model for the video multi-label classification based on the potential objects in videos. Consider the characteristics of time dimension at the same time, objects, representing condensed and significant video contents, are characterized by our proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiment on YouTube Dataset, and this method precedes other conventional methods on video multi-label classification.",

How to get the accurate parameters of the vehicle in real-time, especially in complicated background situation is very critical. In this paper an improved detection algorithm of moving vehicle is proposed. According to the characteristics of some present detection algorithms, the paper makes improvement to background subtraction and symmetric difference method respectively, and combines both of them. In the method of background difference, the selective statistics background updating algorithm is proposed.
