            "title": "A Blockchain-Based Scheme for Secure Data Offloading in Healthcare With Deep Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "With the widespread popularity of the Internet of Things and various intelligent medical devices, the amount of medical data is rising sharply, and thus medical data processing has become increasingly challenging. Mobile edge computing technology allows computing power to be allocated at the edge closer to users, which enables efficient data offloading for healthcare systems. However, existing studies on medical data offloading seldom guarantee effective data privacy and security. Moreover, the research equipping data offloading architectures with Blockchain neglect the delay and energy consumption costs incurred in using Blockchain technology for medical data offloading. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data offloading scheme for healthcare based on Blockchain technology, which achieves optimal medical resource allocation and simultaneously minimizes the cost of offloading tasks. Specifically, we design a smart contract to ensure secure data offloading. And, we formulate the cost problem as a Markov Decision Process, solved by a policy search-based deep reinforcement learning (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) scheme, where we jointly consider offloading decisions, allocation of computing resources and radio transmission bandwidth, and Blockchain data security audits. The security of our smart-contract-based mechanism is theoretically and empirically proved, while extensive experimental results also show that our solution can obtain superior performance gains with lower cost than other baselines.",

            "abstract": "Generating realistic images based on text descriptions remains challenging in computer vision. Existing multi-stage generation methods are sufficient to generate high-resolution images. However, these methods mainly use one sentence to synthesize images, which are difficult to extract adequate semantic features, resulting in the generated images being far apart from ground-truth images. In this article, we propose a Multi-Sentence Complementary Generative Adversarial Network (MSCGAN), which assists in generating accurate images by fusing the same semantics from different sentences and preserving their unique semantics. More specifically, the latest BERT model is employed to identify semantic features and a multi-semantic fusion module (MSFM) is designed to fuse the semantic features of different sentences. Besides, a pre-trained cross-modal contrast similarity model (CCSM) is developed to explore fine-grained loss on generated images. Moreover, a multi-sentence joint discriminator is designed to ensure that the generated images match all sentences. Experiments and ablation studies on CUB and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "In medical data sharing, the data access control authorities of the sharing entities and computing capabilities of the sharing platforms are asymmetric. This asymmetry leads to poor patient control over their data, privacy disclosure, and difficulties in tracking data sharing. This aarticle proposes a cooperation model of cloud and chain (CMCC) for the secure sharing of medical data. In the CMCC, the power equivalence of blockchain nodes limits the control authority asymmetry between doctors and patients in medical data sharing. Moreover, a cloud server is used to store medical data, and some of the node-side computations are handed over to the cloud, which addresses the asymmetric computing capability asymmetry between the cloud and ordinary nodes. Based on the CMCC, a secure medical data sharing scheme based on proxy re-encryption mechanism is proposed. This scheme realizes secure medical data sharing, especially the patient's complete control of the data. The security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing ones.",

The mixed connectivity-maintained/broken attack containing both connectivity-maintained and connectivity-broken attacks is considered, which results that the MASs are with switching topologies. Also, characteristics of DoS attacks, such as durations and frequencies of attacks, make it more difficult to design fault-tolerant controllers and analyze the stability for MASs with node faults. A novel FTC strategy is presented to compensate for node faults. Then, by using the Lyapunov stability analysis, an average dwell-time condition is presented for the bounded synchronization of MASs under DoS attacks. An example of nonlinear forced pendulum systems is proposed to verify the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Graph transformation that predicts graph transition from one mode to another is an important and common problem. Despite much progress in developing advanced graph transformation techniques in recent years, the fundamental assumption typically required in machine-learning models that the testing and training data preserve the same distribution does not always hold. As a result, domain generalization graph transformation that predicts graphs not available in the training data is under-explored, with multiple key challenges to be addressed including (1) the extreme space complexity when training on all input-output mode combinations, (2) difference of graph topologies between the input and the output modes, and (3) how to generalize the model to (unseen) target domains that are not in the training data. To fill the gap, we propose a multi-input, multi-output, hypernetwork-based graph neural network (MultiHyperGNN) that employs a encoder and a decoder to encode topologies of both input and output modes and semi-supervised link prediction to enhance the graph transformation task. Instead of training on all mode combinations, MultiHyperGNN preserves a constant space complexity with the encoder and the decoder produced by two novel hypernetworks. Comprehensive experiments show that MultiHyperGNN has a superior performance than competing models in both prediction and domain generalization tasks.",

            "abstract": "Explanation supervision is a technique in which the model is guided by human-generated explanations during training. This technique aims to improve both the interpretability and predictability of the model by incorporating human understanding into the training process. Since explanation supervision requires a large scale of training data, the data augmentation technique is necessary to be applied to increase the size and diversity of the original dataset. However, data augmentation on sophisticated data like medical images is particularly challenging due to the following: 1) scarcity of data in training the learning-based data augmenter, 2) difficulty in generating realistic and sophisticated images, and 3) difficulty in ensuring the augmented data indeed boosts the performance of explanation-guided learning. To solve these challenges, we propose an Explanation Iterative Supervision via Saliency-guided Data Augmentation (ESSA) framework for conducting explanation supervision and adversarial-trained image data augmentation via a synergized iterative loop that handles the translation from annotation to sophisticated images and the generation of synthetic image-annotation pairs with an alternating training strategy. Extensive experiments on two datasets from the medical imaging domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in improving both the predictability and explainability of the model.",

            "abstract": "Online health communities (OHCs) are forums where patients with similar conditions communicate their experiences and provide moral support. Social support in OHCs plays a crucial role in easing and rehabilitating patients. However, many time-sensitive questions from patients often remain unanswered due to the multitude of threads and the random nature of patient visits in OHCs. To address this issue, it is imperative to propose a recommender system that assists solution seekers in finding appropriate problem helpers. Nevertheless, developing a recommendation algorithm to enhance social support in OHCs remains an under-explored area. Traditional recommender systems cannot be directly adapted due to the following obstacles. First, unlike user-item links in traditional recommender systems, it is hard to model the social support behind helper-seeker links in OHCs since they are formed based on various heterogeneous reasons. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of historical activities in characterizing patients. Third, it is significantly challenging to ensure that the recommended helpers possess sufficient expertise to assist the seekers. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a Monotonically regularIzed diseNTangled Variational Autoencoders (MINT) model to strengthen social support in OHCs.",

Researchers have made great progress in designing various traditional methods, and their theoretical design and performance gain are close to a limit. In the past few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of DeepIM.

            "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks can provide low-latency services for vehicles. However, it is a great challenge for edge nodes to satisfy the computing tasks of all vehicles during vehicle peak hours. This paper studies the joint optimization problem of offloading strategy and resource allocation in a VEC network composed of road side units (RSUs) with computing resources, vehicle users and vehicle workers. In order to alleviate the computing pressure of the RSU, we use contract theory to encourage vehicle workers to execute computing tasks. At the same time, we propose a novel algorithm based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to solve the system cost minimization problem considering vehicle users' satisfaction, RSUs' cost and vehicle workers' reward. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations in different scenarios, the simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has higher performance in reducing system cost compared with other benchmark methods.",

            "abstract": "The field of graph neural networks (GNNs) has seen rapid and incredible strides over the recent years. Graph neural networks, also known as deep learning on graphs, graph representation learning, or geometric deep learning, have become one of the fastest-growing research topics in machine learning, especially deep learning. However, as the field rapidly grows, it has been extremely challenging to gain a global perspective of the developments of GNNs. Therefore, we feel the urgency to bridge the above gap and have a comprehensive tutorial on this fast-growing yet challenging topic. This tutorial of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Foundation, Frontiers and Applications will cover a broad range of topics in graph neural networks, by reviewing and introducing the fundamental concepts and algorithms of GNNs, new research frontiers of GNNs, and broad and emerging applications with GNNs. In addition, rich tutorial materials will be included and introduced to help the audience gain a systematic understanding by using our recently published book - Graph Neural Networks (GNN): Foundation, Frontiers and Applications, one of the most comprehensive book for researchers and practitioners for reading and studying in GNNs.",
