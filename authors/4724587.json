            "abstract": "Sequence-to-Sequence (S2S) models have achieved remarkable success on various text generation tasks. However, learning complex structures with S2S models remains challenging as external neural modules and additional lexicons are often supplemented to predict non-textual outputs. We present a systematic study of S2S modeling using contained decoding on four core tasks: part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, constituency, and dependency parsing, to develop efficient exploitation methods costing zero extra parameters. In particular, 3 lexically diverse linearization schemas and corresponding constrained decoding methods are designed and evaluated. Experiments show that although more lexicalized schemas yield longer output sequences that require heavier training, their sequences being closer to natural language makes them easier to learn. Moreover, S2S models using our constrained decoding outperform other S2S approaches using external resources. Our best models perform better than or comparably to the state-of-the-art for all 4 tasks, lighting a promise for S2S models to generate non-sequential structures.",

            "abstract": "We present a new task setting for attribute mining on e-commerce products, serving as a practical solution to extract open-world attributes without extensive human intervention. Our supervision comes from a high-quality seed attribute set bootstrapped from existing resources, and we aim to expand the attribute vocabulary of existing seed types, and also to discover any new attribute types automatically. A new dataset is created to support our setting, and our approach Amacer is proposed specifically to tackle the limited supervision. Especially, given that no direct supervision is available for those unseen new attributes, our novel formulation exploits self-supervised heuristic and unsupervised latent attributes, which attains implicit semantic signals as additional supervision by leveraging product context. Experiments suggest that our approach surpasses various baselines by 12 F1, expanding attributes of existing types significantly by up to 12 times, and discovering values from 39% new types.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes new framework of communication system leveraging promising generation capabilities of multimodal generative models. Regarding nowadays\u2019 smart applications, successful communication can be made by conveying the perceptual meaning, which we set as text prompt. Text serves as a suitable semantic representation of image data as it has evolved to instruct an image or generate image through mutli-modal techniques, by being interpreted in a manner similar to human cogitation. Utilizing text can also reduce the overload compared to transmitting the intact data itself. The transmitter converts objective image to text through multi-model generation process and the receiver reconstructs the image using reverse process. Each word in the text sentence has each syntactic role, responsible for particular piece of information the text contains. For further efficiency in communication load, the transmitter sequentially sends words in priority of carrying the most information until reaches successful communication. Therefore, our primary focus is on the promising design of a communication system based on image-to-text transformation and the proposed schemes for sequentially transmitting word tokens. Our work is expected to pave a new road of utilizing state-of-the-art generative models to real communication systems.",

To build a neural-based end-to-end dialogue model, 7361 audio recordings of human-to-human interviews are automatically transcribed, where 440 are manually corrected for finetuning and evaluation. To overcome the input/output size limit of a transformer-based encoder\u2013decoder model, two new methods are proposed, context attention and topic storing, allowing the model to make relevant and consistent interactions. Our final model is tested both statistically by comparing its responses to the interview data and dynamically by inviting professional interviewers and various students to interact with it in real-time, finding it highly satisfactory in fluency and context awareness.",

            "abstract": "Response ranking in dialogues plays a crucial role in retrieval-based conversational systems. In a multi-turn dialogue, to capture the gist of a conversation, contextual information serves as essential knowledge to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present a flexible neural framework that can integrate contextual information from multiple channels. Specifically for the current task, our approach is to provide two information channels in parallel, Fusing Conversation history and domain knowledge extracted from Candidate provenance (FCC), where candidate responses are curated, as contextual information to improve the performance of multi-turn dialogue response ranking. The proposed approach can be generalized as a module to incorporate miscellaneous contextual features for other context-oriented tasks. We evaluate our model on the MSDialog dataset widely used for evaluating conversational response ranking tasks. Our experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models, improving Recall@1 by 7% and MAP by 4%. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of each information channel, and of the framework components, to the overall ranking performance, providing additional insights and directions for further improvements.",

            "abstract": "Developing high-performing dialogue systems benefits from the automatic identification of undesirable behaviors in system responses. However, detecting such behaviors remains challenging, as it draws on a breadth of general knowledge and understanding of conversational practices. Although recent research has focused on building specialized classifiers for detecting specific dialogue behaviors, the behavior coverage is still incomplete and there is a lack of testing on real-world human-bot interactions. This paper investigates the ability of a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), ChatGPT-3.5, to perform dialogue behavior detection for nine categories in real human-bot dialogues. We aim to assess whether ChatGPT can match specialized models and approximate human performance, thereby reducing the cost of behavior detection tasks. Our findings reveal that neither specialized models nor ChatGPT have yet achieved satisfactory results for this task, falling short of human performance. Nevertheless, ChatGPT shows promising potential and often outperforms specialized detection models. We conclude with an in-depth examination of the prevalent shortcomings of ChatGPT, offering guidance for future research to enhance LLM capabilities.",

However, there is a significant variation in previous work regarding who gets recruited as evaluators. Evaluator groups such as domain experts, university students, and crowdworkers have been used to assess and compare dialogue systems, although it is unclear to what extent the choice of an evaluator group can affect results. This paper analyzes the evaluator group impact on dialogue system evaluation by testing 4 state-of-the-art dialogue systems using 4 distinct evaluator groups. Our analysis reveals a robustness towards evaluator groups for Likert evaluations that is not seen for Pairwise, with only minor differences observed when changing evaluator groups. Furthermore, two notable limitations to this robustness are observed, which reveal discrepancies between evaluators with different levels of chatbot expertise and indicate that evaluator objectivity is beneficial for certain dialogue metrics.",

In LSC, machines communicate using human language messages that can be interpreted and manipulated via natural language processing (NLP) techniques for SC efficiency. To demonstrate LSC\u2019s potential, we introduce three innovative algorithms: 1) semantic source coding (SSC) which compresses a text prompt into its key head words capturing the prompt\u2019s syntactic essence while maintaining their appearance order to keep the prompt\u2019s context; 2) semantic channel coding (SCC) that improves robustness against errors by substituting head words with their lenghthier synonyms; and 3) semantic knowledge distillation (SKD) that produces listener-customized prompts via in-context learning the listener\u2019s language style. In a communication task for progressive text-to-image generation, the proposed methods achieve higher perceptual similarities with fewer transmissions while enhancing robustness in noisy communication channels.",

Our metrics encompass more types of errors compared to existing ones, allowing us to make a more comprehensive analysis in SD. To align tokens, a multiple sequence alignment algorithm is introduced that supports multiple sequences in the reference while handling high-dimensional alignment to the hypothesis using dynamic programming. Our work is packaged into two tools, align4d providing an API for our alignment algorithm and TranscribeView for visualizing and evaluating SD errors, which can greatly aid in the creation of high-quality data, fostering the advancement of dialogue systems.",

Although generative users help reduce downlink transmission energy at the BS, they consume additional energy for image generation and for uploading their generator state information (GSI). We formulate the problem of minimizing the total energy consumption of the BS and the users, and devise a generative user selection algorithm. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed algorithm reduces total energy by up to 54% compared to a baseline with all non-generative users.",
