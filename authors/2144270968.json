            "title": "Ag/ AgCl-Covered Flexible Microneedle Array Dry Electrode for Electrocardiography Recording",
            "abstract": "This paper reports a novel Ag/AgCl-covered flexible microneedle array dry electrode (Ag/AgCl-MNAE). The Ag/AgCl layer with rough and porous microstructure can uniformly cover the microneedle array substrate to enhance charge injection capability at the electrode\u2013skin interface and the microneedle array can pierce the high-impedance stratum corneum to contact the epidermis layer directly. Therefore, the Ag/AgCl-MNAE has extremely low electrode\u2013skin interface impedance (EII). Besides, the fabrication process is simple and low-cost without using expensive photolithography or physical vapor deposition equipment. The Ag/AgCl-MNAE and customized printed circuit board are integrated to realize the recording and wireless transmission of high-quality electrophysiological signals. Bio-signal recordings of electrocardiography (ECG) are successfully demonstrated with superior accuracy, demonstrating the great potential of this system in wearable health monitoring.",

            "title": "A Hybrid Two-Axis Force Sensor for the Mesoscopic Structural Superlubricity Studies",
            "abstract": "Structural superlubricity (SSL) is a state of nearly zero friction and zero wear between two directly contacted solid surfaces. Recently, SSL was achieved in mesoscale and thus opened the SSL technology which promises great applications in Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS), sensors, storage technologies, etc. However, load issues in current mesoscale SSL studies are still not clear. The great challenge is to simultaneously measure both the ultralow shear forces and the much larger normal forces, although the widely used frictional force microscopes (FFM) and micro tribometers can satisfy the shear forces and normal forces requirements, respectively. Here we propose a hybrid two-axis force sensor that can well fill the blank between the capabilities of FFM and micro tribometers for the mesoscopic SSL studies. The proposed sensor can afford 1mN normal load with 10 nN lateral resolution. Moreover, the probe of the sensor is designed at the edge of the structure for the convenience of real-time optical observation. Calibrations and preliminary experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the design.",
