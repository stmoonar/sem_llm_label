            "abstract": "The availability of trajectory data combined with various real-life practical applications has sparked the interest of the research community to design a plethora of algorithms for various trajectory analysis techniques. However, there is an apparent lack of full-fledged systems that provide the infrastructure support for trajectory analysis techniques, which hinders the applicability of most of the designed algorithms. Inspired by the tremendous success of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) deep learning model in solving various Natural Language Processing tasks, our vision is to have a BERT-like system for trajectory analysis tasks. We envision that in a few years, we will have such system where no one needs to worry again about each specific trajectory analysis operation. Whether it is trajectory imputation, similarity, clustering, or whatever, it would be one system that researchers, developers, and practitioners can deploy to get high accuracy for their trajectory operations. Our vision stands on a solid ground that trajectories in a space are highly analogous to statements in a language. We outline the challenges and the road to our vision. Exploratory results confirm the promise and possibility of our vision.",

            "title": "A Framework for Continuous kNN Ranking of EV Chargers with Estimated Components",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we present an innovative framework whose objective is to allow drivers to recharge their Electric Vehicles (EVs) from the most environmentally friendly chargers using an intelligent hoarding approach. These chargers maximize renewable (e.g., solar) self-consumption, minimizing this way CO2 production and also the need for expensive stationary batteries on the electricity grid to store renewable energy that cannot be used otherwise. We model our problem as a Continuous k-Nearest Neighbor query, where the distance function is computed using Estimated Components (ECs), i.e., a query we term CkNN-EC. An EC defines a function that can have a fuzzy value based on some estimates. Specific ECs used in this work are: (i) the (available clean) power at the charger, which depends on the estimated weather; (ii) the charger availability, which depends on the estimated busy timetables that show when the charger is crowded; and (iii) the derouting cost, which is the time to reach the charger depending on estimated traffic. We devise the EcoCharge framework that combines these multiple non-conflicting objectives into an optimization task providing user-defined ranking means through an intuitive mobile GIS application. Particularly, our core algorithm uses lower and upper values derived from the ECs to recommend the top ranked EV chargers and present them through an intuitive map user interface to users. Our experimental evaluation with extensive synthetic and real traces from Germany, China, and USA along with EV charger data from Plugshare shows that EcoCharge meets the objective functions in an efficient manner, allowing continuous recomputation on the edge devices (e.g., Android Automotive OS, Android Auto or Apple Carplay).",

For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

Yet, unfortunately, trajectory datasets are typically sparse with large spatial and temporal gaps between each two points, which is a major hurdle for their accuracy. This paper presents Kamel; a scalable trajectory imputation system that inserts additional realistic trajectory points, boosting the accuracy of trajectory applications. Kamel maps the trajectory imputation problem to\n finding the missing word\n problem; a classical problem in the natural language processing (NLP) community. This allows employing the widely used BERT model for trajectory imputation. However, BERT, as is, does not lend itself to the special characteristics of trajectories. Hence, Kamel starts from BERT, but then adds spatial-awareness to its operations, adjusts trajectory data to be closer to the nature of language data, and adds multipoint imputation ability to it; all encapsulated in one system. Experimental results based on real datasets show that Kamel significantly outperforms its competitors and is applicable to city-scale trajectories, large gaps, and tight accuracy thresholds.\n",

            "abstract": "\n Though data cleaning systems have earned great success and wide spread in both academia and industry, they fall short when trying to clean spatial data. The main reason is that state-of-the-art data cleaning systems mainly rely on functional dependency rules where there is sufficient co-occurrence of value pairs to learn that a certain value of an attribute leads to a corresponding value of another attribute. However, for spatial attributes that represent locations, there is very little chance that two records would have the same exact coordinates, and hence co-occurrence is unlikely to exist. This paper presents Sparcle (SPatially-AwaRe CLEaning); a novel framework that injects spatial awareness into the core engine of rule-based data cleaning systems through two main concepts: (1)\n Spatial Neighborhood\n , where co-occurrence is relaxed to be within a certain spatial proximity rather than same exact value, and (2)\n Distance Weighting\n , where records are given different weights of whether they satisfy a dependency rule, based on their relative distance. Experimental results using a real deployment of Sparcle inside a state-of-the-art data cleaning system, and real and synthetic datasets, show that Sparcle significantly boosts the accuracy of data cleaning systems when dealing with spatial data.\n",

            "abstract": "The ability to collect large numbers of trajectory data through GPS-enabled devices have enabled a myriad of very important applications that are widely used on a daily basis. This includes urban computing, transportation, and map APIs for routing and navigation. Unfortunately, a major hinder for all these applications is the accuracy of collected trajectories. Due to low sampling rates, trajectories are usually sparse in terms of the large spatial and temporal distances between each two consecutive collected points. This paper presents TrImpute; a novel framework for trajectory imputation that inserts artificial GPS points between the real ones in a way that the imputed trajectories end up to be very similar to the case if such trajectories were collected with a much higher sampling rate. Unlike all prior trajectory imputation techniques, TrImpute does not assume the knowledge of the underlying road network. This makes it more practical when the underlying road network is not available or inaccurate. Experimental results on real datasets and a real deployment of TrImpute show that it is highly scalable, accurate, and can significantly boost the performance of trajectory applications by feeding them highly accurate trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Contact Tracing refers to the process of tracking persons who may have come into spatial contact with an infected person and subsequently collecting further information about these contacts. The feature-rich interaction, processing, and localization/communication modalities of smartphone devices have brought these to the technological forefront to battle and curb the fast spread of pandemics, e.g., COVID-19, introducing the notion of \u201cdigital vaccines\u201d to custodians aiming at fast prevention rather than slow intervention. The community has to this date proposed a wide range of approaches, ranging from opportunistic to participatory approaches, privacy-sensitive to no-privacy approaches, handheld-based (distributed) to cloud-based (centralized) approaches, and proximity-based (e.g., BLE, sound) to location-based approaches (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPS) for only outdoor settings to indoor settings, using closed-source to open-source counterparts. However, a wide range of challenges remain unanswered, including methodologies to improve the penetration and adoption rates, alleviating privacy or expectation skepticism, the ubiquitous availability on low-end terminals as well as technological/psychological adoption barriers, achieving cross-country interoperability with standard formations beyond recommendations, scalability/reliability and accuracy verification of engaged spatial technologies, and lessons about the effectiveness from real large-scale deployments. This special issue brings together transdisciplinary researchers and practitioners working in topics relevant to the special issue. This issue of ACM TSAS includes the five accepted papers to the Special Issue on Contact Tracing. The articles are not listed in any particular order of preference. In the first article, titled \u201cA Survey on Contact Tracing: The Latest Advancements and Challenges,\u201d Jiang et al. provide a comprehensive survey on contact tracing, covering both the traditional and the recent digital contact tracing technologies. The fundamental approach and models of contact tracing are covered, and then the authors survey the latest digital contact tracing technologies, detailing a variety of contact tracing mobile applications currently being used in many different countries together with the associated positioning technologies. At the end of the survey, the authors reflect on the current challenges and highlight several future trends. The given work provides a good introduction to readers before moving on to the subsequent technical articles. In the second article, titled \u201cTowards Accurate Spatiotemporal COVID-19 Risk Scores Using High-Resolution Real-world Mobility Data,\u201d Rambhatla et al. present risk scores based on location density and mobility behavior that model the propensity of the disease, going beyond contact tracing that aims to track past activities of infected users. The article presents a Hawkes process-based technique to assign fine-grained spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone-originated location signals.
