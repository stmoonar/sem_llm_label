            "abstract": "Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems leverage vast amounts of behavioral user data, which poses severe privacy risks. Thus, often, random noise is added to the data to ensure Differential Privacy (DP). However, to date, it is not well understood, in which ways this impacts personalized recommendations. In this work, we study how DP impacts recommendation accuracy and popularity bias, when applied to the training data of state-of-the-art recommendation models. Our findings are three-fold: First, we find that nearly all users' recommendations change when DP is applied. Second, recommendation accuracy drops substantially while recommended item popularity experiences a sharp increase, suggesting that popularity bias worsens. Third, we find that DP exacerbates popularity bias more severely for users who prefer unpopular items than for users that prefer popular items.",

            "abstract": "Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.",

To do that, we present Uptrendz, a multi-domain recommendation platform that can be customized to provide real-time recommendations in an API-centric way. We demonstrate (i) how to set up a real-time movie recommender using the popular MovieLens-100k dataset, and (ii) how to simultaneously support multiple application domains based on the use-case of recommendations in entrepreneurial start-up founding. For that, we differentiate between domains on the item- and system-level. We believe that our demonstration shows a convenient way to adapt, deploy and evaluate a recommender system in an API-centric way. The source-code and documentation that demonstrates how to utilize the configured Uptrendz API is available on GitHub.",

            "abstract": "State-of-the-art recommender systems produce high-quality recommendations to support users in finding relevant content. However, through the utilization of users' data for generating recommendations, recommender systems threaten users' privacy. To alleviate this threat, often, differential privacy is used to protect users' data via adding random noise. This, however, leads to a substantial drop in recommendation quality. Therefore, several approaches aim to improve this trade-off between accuracy and user privacy. In this work, we first overview threats to user privacy in recommender systems, followed by a brief introduction to the differential privacy framework that can protect users' privacy. Subsequently, we review recommendation approaches that apply differential privacy, and we highlight research that improves the trade-off between recommendation quality and user privacy. Finally, we discuss open issues, e.g., considering the relation between privacy and fairness, and the users' different needs for privacy. With this review, we hope to provide other researchers an overview of the ways in which differential privacy has been applied to state-of-the-art collaborative filtering recommender systems.",

This has recently been challenged, and methods have been proposed to include external constraints in the machine learning models. These methods usually come from application-specific fields, such as de-biasing algorithms in the field of fairness in ML or physical constraints in the fields of physics and engineering. In this paper, we present and discuss a conceptual high-level model that unifies these approaches in a common language. We hope that this will enable and foster exchange between the different fields and their different methods for including external constraints into ML models, and thus leaving purely data-centric approaches.",

            "abstract": "By providing personalized suggestions to users, recommender systems have become essential to numerous online platforms. Collaborative filtering, particularly graph-based approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have demonstrated great results in terms of recommendation accuracy. However, accuracy may not always be the most important criterion for evaluating recommender systems' performance, since beyond-accuracy aspects such as recommendation diversity, serendipity, and fairness can strongly influence user engagement and satisfaction. This review paper focuses on addressing these dimensions in GNN-based recommender systems, going beyond the conventional accuracy-centric perspective. We begin by reviewing recent developments in approaches that improve not only the accuracy-diversity trade-off but also promote serendipity, and fairness in GNN-based recommender systems. We discuss different stages of model development including data preprocessing, graph construction, embedding initialization, propagation layers, embedding fusion, score computation, and training methodologies. Furthermore, we present a look into the practical difficulties encountered in assuring diversity, serendipity, and fairness, while retaining high accuracy. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for developing more robust GNN-based recommender systems that go beyond the unidimensional perspective of focusing solely on accuracy. This review aims to provide researchers and practitioners with an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted issues that arise when designing GNN-based recommender systems, setting our work apart by offering a comprehensive exploration of beyond-accuracy dimensions.",

However, a study that relates miscalibration and popularity lift to recommendation accuracy across different user groups is still missing. Additionally, it is unclear if particular genres contribute to the emergence of inconsistency in recommendation performance across user groups. In this paper, we present an analysis of these three aspects of five well-known recommendation algorithms for user groups that differ in their preference for popular content. Additionally, we study how different genres affect the inconsistency of recommendation performance, and how this is aligned with the popularity of the genres. Using data from LastFm, MovieLens, and MyAnimeList, we present two key findings. First, we find that users with little interest in popular content receive the worst recommendation accuracy, and that this is aligned with miscalibration and popularity lift. Second, our experiments show that particular genres contribute to a different extent to the inconsistency of recommendation performance, especially in terms of miscalibration in the case of the MyAnimeList dataset.",

Although different solutions to address this issue are discussed in the research community such as using ML platforms, the level of reproducibility in ML-driven research is not increasing substantially. Therefore, in this mini survey, we review the literature on reproducibility in ML-driven research with three main aims: (i) reflect on the current situation of ML reproducibility in various research fields, (ii) identify reproducibility issues and barriers that exist in these research fields applying ML, and (iii) identify potential drivers such as tools, practices, and interventions that support ML reproducibility. With this, we hope to contribute to decisions on the viability of different solutions for supporting ML reproducibility.",

            "title": "ReuseKNN: Neighborhood Reuse for Privacy-Aware Recommendations",
            "abstract": "User-based KNN recommender systems ( UserKNN ) utilize the rating data of a target user\u2019s \ud835\udc58 nearest neighbors in the recommendation process. This, however, increases the privacy risk of the neighbors since their rating data might be exposed to other users or malicious parties. To reduce this risk, existing work applies differential privacy by adding randomness to the neighbors\u2019 ratings, which reduces the accuracy of UserKNN . In this work, we introduce ReuseKNN , a novel privacy-aware recommender system. The main idea is to identify small but highly reusable neighborhoods so that (i) only a minimal set of users requires protection with differential privacy, and (ii) most users do not need to be protected with differential privacy, since they are only rarely exploited as neighbors. In our experiments on five diverse datasets, we make two key observations: Firstly, ReuseKNN requires significantly smaller neighborhoods, and thus, fewer neighbors need to be protected with differential privacy compared to traditional UserKNN . Secondly, despite the small neighborhoods, ReuseKNN outperforms UserKNN and a fully differentially private approach in terms of accuracy. Overall, ReuseKNN \u2019s recommendation process leads to significantly less privacy risk for users than in the case of UserKNN .",
