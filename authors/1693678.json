            "title": "Feasibility Study on Active Learning of Smart Surrogates for Scientific Simulations",
            "abstract": "High-performance scientific simulations, important for comprehension of complex systems, encounter computational challenges especially when exploring extensive parameter spaces. There has been an increasing interest in developing deep neural networks (DNNs) as surrogate models capable of accelerating the simulations. However, existing approaches for training these DNN surrogates rely on extensive simulation data which are heuristically selected and generated with expensive computation -- a challenge under-explored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the potential of incorporating active learning into DNN surrogate training. This allows intelligent and objective selection of training simulations, reducing the need to generate extensive simulation data as well as the dependency of the performance of DNN surrogates on pre-defined training simulations. In the problem context of constructing DNN surrogates for diffusion equations with sources, we examine the efficacy of diversity- and uncertainty-based strategies for selecting training simulations, considering two different DNN architecture. The results set the groundwork for developing the high-performance computing infrastructure for Smart Surrogates that supports on-the-fly generation of simulation data steered by active learning strategies to potentially improve the efficiency of scientific simulations.",

            "abstract": "Scientific discovery increasingly requires executing heterogeneous scientific workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. Heterogeneous workflows contain different types of tasks (e.g., simulation, analysis, and learning) that need to be mapped, scheduled, and launched on different computing. That requires a software stack that enables users to code their workflows and automate resource management and workflow execution. Currently, there are many workflow technologies with diverse levels of robustness and capabilities, and users face difficult choices of software that can effectively and efficiently support their use cases on HPC machines, especially when considering the latest exascale platforms. We contributed to addressing this issue by developing the ExaWorks Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK is a curated collection of workflow technologies engineered following current best practices and specifically designed to work on HPC platforms. We present our experience with (1) curating those technologies, (2) integrating them to provide users with new capabilities, (3) developing a continuous integration platform to test the SDK on DOE HPC platforms, (4) designing a dashboard to publish the results of those tests, and (5) devising an innovative documentation platform to help users to use those technologies. Our experience details the requirements and the best practices needed to curate workflow technologies, and it also serves as a blueprint for the capabilities and services that DOE will have to offer to support a variety of scientific heterogeneous workflows on the newly available exascale HPC platforms.",

This perception has spurred a growing interest in investigating the potential risks associated with low-dose radiation exposure across various scenarios. To comprehensively explore the health consequences of low-dose radiation, our study employs a robust statistical framework that examines whether specific groups of genes, belonging to known pathways, exhibit coordinated expression patterns that align with the radiation levels. Notably, our findings reveal the existence of intricate yet consistent signatures that reflect the molecular response to radiation exposure, distinguishing between low-dose and high-dose radiation. Moreover, we leverage a pathway-constrained variational autoencoder to capture the nonlinear interactions within gene expression data. By comparing these two analytical approaches, our study aims to gain valuable insights into the impact of low-dose radiation on gene expression patterns, identify pathways that are differentially affected, and harness the potential of machine learning to uncover hidden activity within biological networks. This comparative analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular consequences of low-dose radiation exposure.",

This requires a better understanding of interaction, coupling, and common execution patterns between quantum and classical workload tasks and components. This paper identifies six quantum-HPC execution motifs - recurring execution patterns characterized by distinct coupling and interaction modes. These motifs provide the basis for a suite of quantum mini-apps - simplified application prototypes that encapsulate essential characteristics of production systems. To support these developments, we introduce a mini-app framework that offers the necessary abstractions for creating and executing mini-apps across heterogeneous quantum-HPC infrastructure, making it a valuable tool for performance characterizations and middleware development.",

            "abstract": "Workflows are critical for scientific discovery. However, the sophistication, heterogeneity, and scale of workflows make building, testing, and optimizing them increasingly challenging. Furthermore, their complexity and heterogeneity make performance reproducibility hard. In this paper, we propose workflow mini-apps as a tool to address the challenges in building and testing workflows while controlling the fidelity of representing real-world workflows. Workflow mini-apps are deployed and run on various HPC systems and architectures without workflow-specific constraints. We offer insight into their design and implementation, providing an analysis of their performance and reproducibility. Workflow mini-apps thus advance the science of workflows by providing simple, portable, and managed (fidelity) representations of otherwise complex and difficult-to-control real workflows.",

            "abstract": "Managing and preparing complex data for deep learning, a prevalent approach in large-scale data science can be challenging. Data transfer for model training also presents difficulties, impacting scientific fields like genomics, climate modeling, and astronomy. A large-scale solution like Google Pathways with a distributed execution environment for deep learning models exists but is proprietary. Integrating existing open-source, scalable runtime tools and data frameworks on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms is crucial to address these challenges. Our objective is to establish a smooth and unified method of combining data engineering and deep learning frameworks with diverse execution capabilities that can be deployed on various high-performance computing platforms, including cloud and supercomputers. We aim to support heterogeneous systems with accelerators, where Cylon and other data engineering and deep learning frameworks can utilize heterogeneous execution. To achieve this, we propose Radical-Cylon, a heterogeneous runtime system with a parallel and distributed data framework to execute Cylon as a task of Radical Pilot. We thoroughly explain Radical-Cylon's design and development and the execution process of Cylon tasks using Radical Pilot. This approach enables the use of heterogeneous MPI-communicators across multiple nodes. Radical-Cylon achieves better performance than Bare-Metal Cylon with minimal and constant overhead. Radical-Cylon achieves (4~15)% faster execution time than batch execution while performing similar join and sort operations with 35 million and 3.5 billion rows with the same resources. The approach aims to excel in both scientific and engineering research HPC systems while demonstrating robust performance on cloud infrastructures. This dual capability fosters collaboration and innovation within the open-source scientific research community.",

This paper summarizes the lightning talks at the 2023 edition of WORKS, covering five topics: leveraging large language models to build and execute workflows; developing a common workflow scheduler interface; scaling uncertainty workflow applications on exascale computing systems; evaluating a transcriptomics workflow for cloud vs. HPC systems; and best practices in migrating legacy workflows to workflow management systems.",
