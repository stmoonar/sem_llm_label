            "title": "Edgeformers: Graph-Empowered Transformers for Representation Learning on Textual-Edge Networks",
            "abstract": "Edges in many real-world social/information networks are associated with rich text information (e.g., user-user communications or user-product reviews). However, mainstream network representation learning models focus on propagating and aggregating node attributes, lacking specific designs to utilize text semantics on edges. While there exist edge-aware graph neural networks, they directly initialize edge attributes as a feature vector, which cannot fully capture the contextualized text semantics of edges. In this paper, we propose Edgeformers, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way. Specifically, in edge representation learning, we inject network information into each Transformer layer when encoding edge texts; in node representation learning, we aggregate edge representations through an attention mechanism within each node's ego-graph. On five public datasets from three different domains, Edgeformers consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in edge classification and link prediction, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and node representations, respectively.",

            "abstract": "A real-world text corpus sometimes comprises not only text documents, but also semantic links between them (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic network are linked by citations and co-authorships).Text documents and semantic connections form a text-rich network, which empowers a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification and retrieval.However, pretraining methods for such structures are still lacking, making it difficult to build one generic model that can be adapted to various tasks on text-rich networks.Current pretraining objectives, such as masked language modeling, purely model texts and do not take inter-document structure information into consideration.To this end, we propose our PretrAining on TexT-Rich NetwOrk framework Patton.Patton includes two pretraining strategies: network-contextualized masked language modeling and masked node prediction, to capture the inherent dependency between textual attributes and network structure.We conduct experiments on four downstream tasks in five datasets from both academic and e-commerce domains, where Patton outperforms baselines significantly and consistently.",

            "abstract": "The retrieval model is an indispensable component for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks, e.g., open-domain question answering (ODQA). As separate retrieval skills are annotated for different datasets, recent work focuses on customized methods, limiting the model transfer- ability and scalability. In this work, we propose a modular retriever where individual modules correspond to key skills that can be reused across datasets. Our approach supports flexible skill configurations based on the target domain to boost performance. To mitigate task interference, we design a novel modularization parameterization inspired by sparse Transformer. We demonstrate that our model can benefit from self-supervised pretraining on Wikipedia and fine-tuning using multiple ODQA datasets, both in a multi-task fashion. Our approach outperforms recent self-supervised retrievers in zero-shot evaluations and achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuned retrieval performance on NQ, HotpotQA and OTT-QA.",

            "abstract": "Technologies for handling massive structured or semi-structured data have been researched extensively in database communities. However, the real-world data are largely in the form of unstructured text, posing a great challenge to their management and analysis as well as their integration with semi-structured databases. Recent developments of deep learning methods and large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized text mining and processing and shed new light on structuring massive text data and building a framework for integrated (i.e., structured and unstructured) data management and analysis. In this tutorial, we will focus on the recently developed text mining approaches empowered by PLMs that can work without relying on heavy human annotations. We will present an organized picture of how a set of weakly supervised methods explore the power of PLMs to structure text data, with the following out-line: (1) an introduction to pre-trained language models that serve as new tools for our tasks, (2) mining topic structures : unsupervised and seed-guided methods for topic discovery from massive text corpora, (3) mining document structures : weakly supervised methods for text classification, (4) mining entity structures : distantly supervised and weakly supervised methods for phrase mining, named entity recognition, taxonomy construction, and structured knowledge graph construction, and (5) towards an integrated information processing paradigm.",

            "abstract": "Few-shot question answering (QA) aims at precisely discovering answers to a set of questions from context passages while only a few training samples are available. Although existing studies have made some progress and can usually achieve proper results, they suffer from understanding deep semantics for reasoning out the questions. In this paper, we develop Gotta, a Generative prOmpT-based daTa Augmentation framework to mitigate the challenge above. Inspired by the human reasoning process, we propose to integrate the cloze task to enhance few-shot QA learning. Following the recent success of prompt-tuning, we present the cloze task in the same format as the main QA task, allowing the model to learn both tasks seamlessly together to fully take advantage of the power of prompt-tuning. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that Gotta consistently outperforms competitive baselines, validating the effectiveness of our proposed prompt-tuning-based cloze task, which not only fine-tunes language models but also learns to guide reasoning in QA tasks. Further analysis shows that the prompt-based loss incorporates the auxiliary task better than the multi-task loss, highlighting the strength of prompt-tuning on the few-shot QA task.",

            "abstract": "Weakly-supervised text classification trains a classifier using the label name of each target class as the only supervision, which largely reduces human annotation efforts. Most existing methods first use the label names as static keyword-based features to generate pseudo labels, which are then used for final classifier training. While reasonable, such a commonly adopted framework suffers from two limitations: (1) keywords can have different meanings in different contexts and some text may not have any keyword, so keyword matching can induce noisy and inadequate pseudo labels; (2) the errors made in the pseudo label generation stage will directly propagate to the classifier training stage without a chance of being corrected. In this paper, we propose a new method, PIEClass, consisting of two modules: (1) a pseudo label acquisition module that uses zero-shot prompting of pre-trained language models (PLM) to get pseudo labels based on contextualized text understanding beyond static keyword matching, and (2) a noise-robust iterative ensemble training module that iteratively trains classifiers and updates pseudo labels by utilizing two PLM fine-tuning methods that regularize each other. Extensive experiments show that PIEClass achieves overall better performance than existing strong baselines on seven benchmark datasets and even achieves similar performance to fully-supervised classifiers on sentiment classification tasks.",

            "title": "Learning Multiplex Representations on Text-Attributed Graphs with One Language Model Encoder",
            "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, texts in a graph are often linked by multiple semantic relations (e.g., papers in an academic graph are referenced by other publications, written by the same author, or published in the same venue), where text documents and their relations form a multiplex text-attributed graph. Mainstream text representation learning methods use pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate one embedding for each text unit, expecting that all types of relations between texts can be captured by these single-view embeddings. However, this presumption does not hold particularly in multiplex text-attributed graphs. Along another line of work, multiplex graph neural networks (GNNs) directly initialize node attributes as a feature vector for node representation learning, but they cannot fully capture the semantics of the nodes' associated texts. To bridge these gaps, we propose METAG, a new framework for learning Multiplex rEpresentations on Text-Attributed Graphs. In contrast to existing methods, METAG uses one text encoder to model the shared knowledge across relations and leverages a small number of parameters per relation to derive relation-specific representations. This allows the encoder to effectively capture the multiplex structures in the graph while also preserving parameter efficiency. We conduct experiments on nine downstream tasks in five graphs from both academic and e-commerce domains, where METAG outperforms baselines significantly and consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/METAG.",

            "title": "Pre-training Multi-task Contrastive Learning Models for Scientific Literature Understanding",
            "abstract": "Scientific literature understanding tasks have gained significant attention due to their potential to accelerate scientific discovery. Pre-trained language models (LMs) have shown effectiveness in these tasks, especially when tuned via contrastive learning. However, jointly utilizing pre-training data across multiple heterogeneous tasks (e.g., extreme multi-label paper classification, citation prediction, and literature search) remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-task contrastive learning framework, SciMult, with a focus on facilitating common knowledge sharing across different scientific literature understanding tasks while preventing task-specific skills from interfering with each other. To be specific, we explore two techniques -- task-aware specialization and instruction tuning. The former adopts a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture with task-aware sub-layers; the latter prepends task-specific instructions to the input text so as to produce task-aware outputs. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive collection of benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our task-aware specialization strategy, where we outperform state-of-the-art scientific pre-trained LMs. Code, datasets, and pre-trained models can be found at https://scimult.github.io/.",

            "title": "Pretrained Language Representations for Text Understanding: A Weakly-Supervised Perspective",
            "abstract": "Language representations pretrained on general-domain corpora and adapted to downstream task data have achieved enormous success in building natural language understanding (NLU) systems. While the standard supervised fine-tuning of pretrained language models (PLMs) has proven an effective approach for superior NLU performance, it often necessitates a large quantity of costly human-annotated training data. For example, the enormous success of ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be largely credited to their supervised fine-tuning with massive manually-labeled prompt-response training pairs. Unfortunately, obtaining large-scale human annotations is in general infeasible for most practitioners. To broaden the applicability of PLMs to various tasks and settings, weakly-supervised learning offers a promising direction to minimize the annotation requirements for PLM adaptions. In this tutorial, we cover the recent advancements in pretraining language models and adaptation methods for a wide range of NLU tasks. Our tutorial has a particular focus on weakly-supervised approaches that do not require massive human annotations. We will introduce the following topics in this tutorial: (1) pretraining language representation models that serve as the fundamentals for various NLU tasks, (2) extracting entities and hierarchical relations from unlabeled texts, (3) discovering topical structures from massive text corpora for text organization, and (4) understanding documents and sentences with weakly-supervised techniques.",
