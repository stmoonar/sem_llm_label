            "title": "Predicting Opioid Use Outcomes in Minoritized Communities",
            "abstract": "Within the healthcare space, machine learning algorithms can sometimes exacerbate racial, ethnic, and gender disparities, among others. Many machine learning algorithms are trained on data from majority populations, thereby generating less accurate or reliable results for minoritized groups [3]. For example, in a widely used algorithm, at a given risk score, the technique falsely concludes that Black individuals are healthier than equally sick White individuals [6]. Thus, such large-scale algorithms can often perpetuate biases. There has been limited work at exploring potential biases in algorithms deployed within minoritized communities. In particular, minimal research has detailed how biases may manifest in algorithms developed by insurance companies to predict opioid use outcomes, or opioid overdoses among people who use opioids in urban areas. An algorithm trained on data from white individuals may provide incorrect estimates for Hispanic/Latino individuals, perhaps resulting in adverse health outcomes. Since predicting opioid use outcomes is important to improving health in populations often neglected by larger health systems [4], our goal is to examine how machine learning algorithms perform at determining opioid use outcomes within minoritized communities. As a case study, we used data from a sample of 539 young adults who engaged in nonmedical use of prescription opioids and/or heroin [5]. The prevalence and incidence of opioid use has increased rapidly in the US in the past two decades, which is related to concomitant increases in opioid dependence, accidental overdose and death. We addressed the indicated issues through the following contributions: 1) Using machine learning techniques, we predicted opioid use outcomes for participants in our dataset; 2) We assessed if an algorithm trained on a majority sub-sample e.g., Non-Hispanic/Latino, male, could accurately predict opioid use outcomes for a minoritized subsample e.g., Latino, female. Our analysis was conducted to replicate possible real-world scenarios, and provide insight on how to improve broad health outcomes via predictive modeling. For example, if an insurance company primarily caters to Non-Hispanic/Latino individuals, models trained on data from Non-Hispanic/Latino individuals may not predict life insurance costing accurately for Hispanic individuals seeking treatment, and our analysis can provide understanding into such scenarios. Results indicated that models were able to predict recent injection drug use and participation in drug treatment. The presence of peers who also engaged in opioid use appeared to play a role in predicting drug treatment and injection drug use. However, the available data lacked comprehensive information on other facets of opioid use, such as harm reduction. We noted a decrease in precision when we trained our models on only data from a majority sub-sample, and tested these models on a minoritized sub-sample. Overall, machine learning approaches are only as precise and useful as the data they are trained on, and to make valid and accurate predictions they must be trained on data from people who are similar in terms of key sociodemographic characteristics as the populations about whom predictions will be made. Key to mitigating biases in models to predict health outcomes within minoritized communities, is the inclusion of stakeholders at every stage of the machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline. For example, methadone patients need to be involved in the development of models to predict methadone dropout risk [1, 2]. Similarly, a committee of ethnic minority individuals can be involved in auditing algorithms used to detect cardiovascular risk. Insurance companies and other stakeholders who use machine learning to predict opioid use outcomes need to be aware that models can exacerbate biases, and seek to improve their predictive modelling capabilities. Insurance companies that have primarily white individuals in their datasets should seek to augment their datasets with individuals from minoritized backgrounds. Such practices can aid providers in making accurate predictions if their client demographics shift, or if nonwhite individuals seek treatment. There increasingly exist independent corporations that audit large scale machine learning models, and such corporations need to ensure that minoritized communities are adequately represented within the audit committee.",

Sound and holistic policy around fatherhood in Singapore may reduce stigma and apprehension around being a parent, critical to improving the nations flagging birth rate. We analyzed 15,705 articles and 56,221 posts to study how fatherhood is framed in Singapore across a range of online platforms (news outlets, parenting forums, Twitter). We used NLP techniques to understand these differences. While fatherhood was framed in a range of ways on the Singaporean online environment, it did not seem that fathers were framed as central to the Singaporean family unit. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other.",

Our polarization and question answering results indicated that left-leaning media tended to represent refugees as child victims, welcome in the US, and right-leaning media cast refugees as Islamic terrorists. We noted similar results with our sentiment and offensive speech scores over time, which detail possibly unfavorable representations of refugees in right-leaning media.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how vaping is framed differently (2008-2021) between US news and social media. We analyze 15,711 news articles and 1,231,379 Facebook posts about vaping to study the differences in framing between media varieties. We use word embeddings to provide two-dimensional visualizations of the semantic changes around vaping for news and for social media. We detail that news media framing of vaping shifted over time in line with emergent regulatory trends, such as; flavored vaping bans, with little discussion around vaping as a smoking cessation tool. We found that social media discussions were far more varied, with transitions toward vaping both as a public health harm and as a smoking cessation tool. Our cloze test, dynamic topic model, and question answering showed similar patterns, where social media, but not news media, characterizes vaping as combustible cigarette substitute. We use n-grams to detail that social media data first centered on vaping as a smoking cessation tool, and in 2019 moved toward narratives around vaping regulation, similar to news media frames. Overall, social media tracks the evolution of vaping as a social practice, while news media reflects more risk based concerns. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to intervene around the framing of vaping, and may design communications campaigns that improve the way society sees vaping, thus possibly aiding smoking cessation; and reducing youth vaping.",

            "abstract": "An estimated 63 million people suffer from significant hearing loss in India According to a study by the World Health Organization, five million Indian children were suffering from hearing and speech impairment in 2016. In India, \u201chearing handicapped\u201d as defined by the Rehabilitation Council of India Act., 1992, is \u2013 hearing impairment of 70 dB and above, in better ear or total loss of hearing in both ears. This law is applicable to only those persons with severe hearing impairment whose hearing loss is 70 dB and above.Hearing aids have advanced significantly over the past decade, primarily due to the maturing of digital technology. The next decade should see an even greater number of innovations to hearing aid technology, and this article attempts to predict in which areas the new developments will occur. Both incremental and radical innovations in digital hearing aids will be driven by research advances in the following fields: (1) wireless technology, (2) digital chip technology, (3) hearing science, and (4) cognitive science. The automatic estimation of DOA is very important for many practical applications such as in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speaker Tracking, Teleconferencing, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in particular and Human Machine Interface (HCI) in general, Robotic Audition or Active Audition, Blind Signal Separation (BSS) etc. For a human being it is very easy to infer position of active sound source due to a pair of spaced ear, but when it comes to design a system for the performance of similar task by a computer or a machine it becomes very difficult. The two ears, eyes in biological system like us represent a natural array of sensors. Following the same, concept of using array of sensors, in place of single sensors, developed in the engineering applications to exploit spatial diversities of the signal being captured. The poor performance of the conventional hearing aids in background noise motivated the use of microphone array to create directional sensitive hearing aids that amplify the signal arriving in a particular direction. Microphone array is used to improve desired speech signal when the interference arises from different directions. The microphone array is considered as a preprocessor, followed by conventional hearing aid processing [2]. It is used to improve the SNR value and speech intelligibility. Microphone array is used in various applications such as audio, teleconference, voice recognition applications. Common Methods of Hearing Enhancement Hearing aid manufacturers typically improve microphone directivity in one of two ways. The first strategy uses a single microphone with two openings (pressure-gradient microphones) designed to enhance sounds coming from a particular direction. The second strategy is to electronically combine the outputs of two separate microphones, to get the same effect as with the two openings. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. In laboratory situations, hearing aids with these simple directional microphones improve directivity gains by factors of two to four (or 3-6 dB (\"decibels\")), greatly improving speech intelligibility in noisy surroundings. By combining the outputs of even more microphones, further improvements are in principle possible. However, practical issues have largely confined three-microphone systems to the laboratory. A standard multi-microphone system works well only when the microphones are exquisitely matched; even a few percent difference in the volume level from each microphone \u00a9 2019 JETIR May 2019, Volume 6, Issue 5 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIRCJ06158 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 758 (such as naturally occurs due to changes in temperature, humidity, or accumulation of dirt or ear wax) can wipe out most of the directivity benefit. A pressure-gradient microphone shares the same hardware between the two openings, and is therefore always naturally matched. However, it is limited to two openings and it cannot be adjusted to the head's effects on the incoming sounds. Proposed Algorithm Research work on DOA estimation has also been done from the separation matrix learned by the BSS algorithms. ICA based sound signal separation is an unsupervised statistical learning process. The learned separation matrix does not form null direction in the exact direction of the sources to be jammed. Fig-1 Experimental Setup This trend becomes more prominent in the case of increasing noise and reverberation time. BSS algorithms reject the unwanted sound source by forming directional null, one can help BSS algorithms using DOA information to learn better sound separation system, however, this will be not purely blind setup but can be done under semiblind BSS process. Thus under the semi-blind setup will try to develop new BSS algorithm by using DOA information. This algorithm will be of great functional use in mobile communication (smart antenna array processing), radar application. This will enable to design super efficient hearing aid devices and will prove to be boon for millions hearing impaired peoples. BSS Algorithms for Speech Separation The class of DOA algorithms based on use of BSS are recent development in the area of array processing BSS refers to estimation of hidden sources from the observed mixed signal at microphone of the array .The topic of BSS in the area of signal processing is itself result of development in the last two decades. In the BSS process nothing is known about the mixing process. The BSS algorithm is inputted with only mixed signal and produced outputs are individual signals. The application area of BSS is very wide due to which researches from almost areas such as such signal processing, image processing, machine vision, neuroinformatics, bioinformatics etc. have contributed [50] . The blind separation process of speech signal is shown in Figure 2 . \u00a9 2019 JETIR May 2019, Volume 6, Issue 5 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIRCJ06158 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 759 Figure 2. Functioning of ICA based BSS algorithm for speech signal separation. In Figure 2 the blind separation of acoustic signal has been demonstrated. The microphone array, which is a ULA of 3-elements, captures mixture of speech signals from two speakers. The captured three channel mixed signals are fed into BSS algorithms which fitter out individual signal. In recovery of individual signal the mixing process is not utilized, as it is unknown, hence the process is known as blind. The problem of BSS in general has been tackled from many angles and accordingly one can find many algorithms for general and specific purposes, developed using different principles ,Similarly for the speech signal separation too, many algorithms such as based on beamforming CASA, ICA etc. have been purposed. However, ICA based algorithms are better and numerous. ICA is a statistical technique which assumes each source of acoustic signal as independent and during mixing process independency of each such sound signal is lost. Therefore, any methods that can restore/ extract independent sources from mixed signal by restoring statistical independency can be termed as Independent Component Analysis in the loose sense.",
