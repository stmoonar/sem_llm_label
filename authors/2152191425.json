            "title": "Plug-in Diffusion Model for Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Pioneering efforts have verified the effectiveness of the diffusion models in exploring the informative uncertainty for recommendation. Considering the difference between recommendation and image synthesis tasks, existing methods have undertaken tailored refinements to the diffusion and reverse process. However, these approaches typically use the highest-score item in corpus for user interest prediction, leading to the ignorance of the user's generalized preference contained within other items, thereby remaining constrained by the data sparsity issue. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel Plug-in Diffusion Model for Recommendation (PDRec) framework, which employs the diffusion model as a flexible plugin to jointly take full advantage of the diffusion-generating user preferences on all items. Specifically, PDRec first infers the users' dynamic preferences on all items via a time-interval diffusion model and proposes a Historical Behavior Reweighting (HBR) mechanism to identify the high-quality behaviors and suppress noisy behaviors. In addition to the observed items, PDRec proposes a Diffusion-based Positive Augmentation (DPA) strategy to leverage the top-ranked unobserved items as the potential positive samples, bringing in informative and diverse soft signals to alleviate data sparsity. To alleviate the false negative sampling issue, PDRec employs Noise-free Negative Sampling (NNS) to select stable negative samples for ensuring effective model optimization. Extensive experiments and analyses on four datasets have verified the superiority of the proposed PDRec over the state-of-the-art baselines and showcased the universality of PDRec as a flexible plugin for commonly-used sequential encoders in different recommendation scenarios.

            "title": "Multimodal Conditioned Diffusion Model for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Multimodal recommendation aims at to modeling the feature distributions of items by using their multi-modal information. Prior efforts typically focus on the denoising of the user-item graph with a degree-sensitive strategy, which may not well-handle the users' consistent preference across modalities. More importantly, it has been observed that existing methods may learn ill-posed item embeddings due to their focus on a specific auxiliary optimization task for multimodal representations rather than explicitly modeling them. This paper therefore presents a solution that takes the advantages of the explicit uncertainty injection ability of Diffusion Model (DM) for the modeling and fusion of multi-modal information. Specifically, we propose a novel Multimodal Conditioned Diffusion Model for Recommendation (MCDRec), which tailors DM with two technical modules to model the high-order multimodal knowledge. The first module is multimodal-conditioned representation diffusion (MRD), which integrates pre-extracted multimodal knowledge into the item representation modeling via a tailored DM. This smoothly bridges the insurmountable gap between the multi-modal content features and the collaborative signals. Secondly, with the diffusion-guided graph denoising (DGD) module, MCDRec may effectively denoise the user-item graph by filtering the occasional interactions in user historical behaviors. This is achieved with the power of DM in aligning the users' collaborative preferences with their shared items' content information. Extensive experiments compared to several SOTA baselines on two real-word datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDRec. The specific visualization also reveals the potential of MRD to precisely handling the high-order representation correlations among the user embeddings and the multi-modal heterogeneous representations of items.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to capture users' personalized preferences from the cast amount of user behaviors, making them pivotal in the era of information explosion. However, the presence of the dynamic preference, the\"information cocoons\", and the inherent feedback loops in recommendation make users interact with a limited number of items. Conventional recommendation algorithms typically focus on the positive historical behaviors, while neglecting the essential role of negative feedback in user interest understanding. As a promising but easy-to-ignored area, negative sampling is proficients in revealing the genuine negative aspect inherent in user behaviors, emerging as an inescapable procedure in recommendation. In this survey, we first discuss the role of negative sampling in recommendation and thoroughly analyze challenges that consistently impede its progress. Then, we conduct an extensive literature review on the existing negative sampling strategies in recommendation and classify them into five categories with their discrepant techniques. Finally, we detail the insights of the tailored negative sampling strategies in diverse recommendation scenarios and outline an overview of the prospective research directions toward which the community may engage and benefit.",

            "abstract": "Multimedia recommendation aims to fuse the multi-modal information of items for feature enrichment to improve the recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically introduce multi-modal information based on collaborative information to improve the overall recommendation precision, while failing to explore its cold-start recommendation performance. Meanwhile, these above methods are only applicable when such multi-modal data is available. To address this problem, this paper proposes a recommendation framework, named Cross-modal Content Inference and Feature Enrichment Recommendation (CIERec), which exploits the multi-modal information to improve its cold-start recommendation performance. Specifically, CIERec first introduces image annotation as the privileged information to help guide the mapping of unified features from the visual space to the semantic space in the training phase. And then CIERec enriches the content representation with the fusion of collaborative, visual, and cross-modal inferred representations, so as to improve its cold-start recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the content representations learned by CIERec are able to achieve superior cold-start recommendation performance over existing visually-aware recommendation algorithms. More importantly, CIERec can consistently achieve significant improvements with different conventional visually-aware backbones, which verifies its universality and effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "Negative Sampling in recommendation aims to capture informative negative instances for the sparse user-item interactions to improve the performance. Conventional negative sampling methods tend to select informative hard negative samples (HNS) besides the default random samples. However, these hard negative sampling methods usually struggle with false hard negative samples (FHNS), which happens when a user-item interaction has not been observed yet and is picked as a negative sample, while the user will actually interact with this item once exposed to it. Such FHNS issues may seriously confuse the model training, while most conventional hard negative sampling methods do not systematically explore and distinguish FHNS from HNS. To address this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic Real Hard Negative Sampling (RealHNS) framework specially for cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which aims to discover the false and refine the real from all HNS via both general and cross-domain real hard negative sample selectors. For the general part, we conduct the coarse- and fine-grained real HNS selectors sequentially, armed with a dynamic item-based FHNS filter to find high-quality HNS. For the cross-domain part, we further design a new cross-domain HNS for alleviating negative transfer in CDR and discover its corresponding FHNS via a dynamic user-based FHNS filter to keep its power. We conduct experiments on four datasets based on three representative hard negative sampling methods, along with extensive model analyses, ablation studies, and universality analyses. The consistent improvements indicate the effectiveness, robustness, and universality of RealHNS, which is also easy-to-deploy in real-world systems as a plug-and-play strategy.

            "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims at leveraging the correlation of users\u2019 behaviors in both the source and target domains to improve the user preference modeling in the target domain. Conventional CDR methods typically explore the dual-relations between the source and target domains\u2019 behaviors. However, this may ignore the informative mixed behaviors that naturally reflect the user\u2019s global preference. To address this issue, we present a novel framework, termed triple sequence learning for cross-domain recommendation (Tri-CDR), which jointly models the source, target, and mixed behavior sequences to highlight the global and target preference and precisely model the triple correlation in CDR. Specifically, Tri-CDR independently models the hidden representations for the triple behavior sequences and proposes a triple cross-domain attention (TCA) method to emphasize the informative knowledge related to both user\u2019s global and target-domain preference. To comprehensively explore the cross-domain correlations, we design a triple contrastive learning (TCL) strategy that simultaneously considers the coarse-grained similarities and fine-grained distinctions among the triple sequences, ensuring the alignment while preserving information diversity in multi-domain. We conduct extensive experiments and analyses on six cross-domain settings. The significant improvements of Tri-CDR with different sequential encoders verify its effectiveness and universality.

            "abstract": "Haze classification has gained much attention recently as a cost-effective solution for air quality monitoring. Different from conventional image classification tasks, it requires the classifier to capture the haze patterns of different severity degrees. Existing efforts typically focus on the extraction of effective haze features, such as the dark channel and deep features. However, it is observed that the light-haze images are often mis-classified due to the presence of diverse background scenes. To address this issue, this paper presents an unsupervised contrastive masking (UCM) algorithm to segment the haze regions without any supervision, and develops a dual-channel model-agnostic framework, termed magnifier neural network (MagNet), to effectively use the segmented haze regions to enhance the learning of haze features by conventional deep learning models. Specifically, MagNet employs the haze regions to provide the pixel- and feature-level visual information via three strategies, including Input Augmentation, Network Constraint, and Feature Enhancement, which work as a soft-attention regularizer to alleviates the trade-off between capturing the global scene information and the local information in the haze regions. Experiments were conducted on two datasets in terms of performance comparison, parameter estimation, ablation studies, and case studies, and the results verified that UCM can accurately and rapidly segment the haze regions, and the proposed three strategies of MagNet consistently improve the performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning backbones.",

            "abstract": "Adversarial training in recommendation is originated to improve the robustness of recommenders to attack signals and has recently shown promising results to alleviate cold-start recommendation. However, existing methods usually should make a trade-off between model robustness and performance, and the underlying reasons why using adversarial samples for training works has not been sufficiently verified. To address this issue, this paper identifies the key components of existing adversarial training methods and presents a taxonomy that defines these methods using three levels of components for perturbation generation, perturbation incorporation, and model optimization. Based on this taxonomy, different variants of existing methods are created, and a comparative study is conducted to verify the influence of each component in cold-start recommendation. Experimental results on two benchmarking datasets show that existing state-of-the-art algorithms can be further improved by a proper pairing of the key components as listed in the taxonomy. Moreover, using case studies and visualization, the influence of the content information of items on cold-start recommendation has been analyzed, and the explanations for the working mechanism of different components as proposed in the taxonomy have been offered. These verify the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy as a design paradigm for adversarial training.",

            "abstract": "Adversarial training is originated in image classification to address the problem of adversarial attacks, where an invisible perturbation in an image leads to a significant change in model decision. It recently has been observed to be effective in alleviating the long-tailed classification problem, where an imbalanced size of classes makes the model has much lower performance on small classes. However, existing methods typically focus on the methods to generate perturbations for data, while the contributions of different perturbations to long-tailed classification have not been well analyzed. To this end, this paper presents an investigation on the perturbation generation and incorporation components of existing adversarial training methods and proposes a taxonomy that defines these methods using three levels of components, in terms of information, methodology, and optimization. This taxonomy may serve as a design paradigm where an adversarial training algorithm can be created by combining different components in the taxonomy. A comparative study is conducted to verify the influence of each component in long-tailed classification. Experimental results on two benchmarking datasets show that a combination of statistical perturbations and hybrid optimization achieves a promising performance, and the gradient-based method typically improves the performance of both the head and tail classes. More importantly, it is verified that a reasonable combination of the components in our taxonomy may create an algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art.",
