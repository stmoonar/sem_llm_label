            "title": "Personalized Food Recommendation as Constrained Question Answering over a Large-scale Food Knowledge Graph",
            "abstract": "Food recommendation has become an important means to help guide users to adopt healthy dietary habits. Previous works on food recommendation either i) fail to consider users' explicit requirements, ii) ignore crucial health factors (e.g., allergies and nutrition needs), or iii) do not utilize the rich food knowledge for recommending healthy recipes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel problem formulation for food recommendation, modeling this task as constrained question answering over a large-scale food knowledge base/graph (KBQA). Besides the requirements from the user query, personalized requirements from the user's dietary preferences and health guidelines are handled in a unified way as additional constraints to the QA system. To validate this idea, we create a QA style dataset for personalized food recommendation based on a large-scale food knowledge graph and health guidelines. Furthermore, we propose a KBQA-based personalized food recommendation framework which is equipped with novel techniques for handling negations and numerical comparisons in the queries. Experimental results on the benchmark show that our approach significantly outperforms non-personalized counterparts (average 59.7% absolute improvement across various evaluation metrics), and is able to recommend more relevant and healthier recipes.",

            "abstract": ". We demonstrate the use of a health coach platform that recommends personalized selections of food recipes to diabetic patients. On our platform, we implement a question-answering service that allows questions such as \u201csuggest a good breakfast\u201d to be queried; a response with a list of recipes that is applicable to the patient vis-a`-vis their health condition and food preferences is generated. Our research is intended to support the personalization and explainability of recommended food options using a novel application of guideline recommendations encoded in a semantic format. Our platform includes a repository of over half a million recipes and their nutritional content, where each recipe is also represented as a vector-based embedding that has been derived from the recipe\u2019s ingredient list and preparation instructions [4].",

            "abstract": "Most of the current cross-lingual transfer learning methods for Information Extraction (IE) have been only applied to name tagging. To tackle more complex tasks such as event extraction we need to transfer graph structures (event trigger linked to multiple arguments with various roles) across languages. We develop a novel share-and-transfer framework to reach this goal with three steps: (1) Convert each sentence in any language to language-universal graph structures; in this paper we explore two approaches based on universal dependency parses and complete graphs, respectively. (2) Represent each node in the graph structure with a cross-lingual word embedding so that all sentences in multiple languages can be represented with one shared semantic space. (3) Using this common semantic space, train event extractors from English training data and apply them to languages that do not have any event annotations. Experimental results on three languages (Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian) without any annotations show this framework achieves comparable performance to a state-of-the-art supervised model trained from more than 1,500 manually annotated event mentions.",

            "abstract": "The identification of complex semantic structures such as events and entity relations, already a challenging Information Extraction task, is doubly difficult from sources written in under-resourced and under-annotated languages. We investigate the suitability of cross-lingual structure transfer techniques for these tasks. We exploit relation- and event-relevant language-universal features, leveraging both symbolic (including part-of-speech and dependency path) and distributional (including type representation and contextualized representation) information. By representing all entity mentions, event triggers, and contexts into this complex and structured multilingual common space, using graph convolutional networks, we can train a relation or event extractor from source language annotations and apply it to the target language. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual relation and event transfer among English, Chinese, and Arabic demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised models trained on up to 3,000 manually annotated mentions: up to 62.6% F-score for Relation Extraction, and 63.1% F-score for Event Argument Role Labeling. The event argument role labeling model transferred from English to Chinese achieves similar performance as the model trained from Chinese. We thus find that language-universal symbolic and distributional representations are complementary for cross-lingual structure transfer.",

In this paper, we derive properties of such a system which we call an $LM$-system. We show, in particular, that the rewrite rules in an $LM$-system have no left- or right-overlaps. We also show that despite the restricted nature of an $LM$-system, there are important undecidable problems, such as the deduction problem in cryptographic protocol analysis (also called the the cap problem) that remain undecidable for $LM$-systems.",
