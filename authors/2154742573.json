            "title": "Compressed Imaging Reconstruction Based on Block Compressed Sensing with Conjugate Gradient Smoothed l0 Norm",
            "abstract": "Compressed imaging reconstruction technology can reconstruct high-resolution images with a small number of observations by applying the theory of block compressed sensing to traditional optical imaging systems, and the reconstruction algorithm mainly determines its reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we design a reconstruction algorithm based on block compressed sensing with a conjugate gradient smoothed l0 norm termed BCS-CGSL0. The algorithm is divided into two parts. The first part, CGSL0, optimizes the SL0 algorithm by constructing a new inverse triangular fraction function to approximate the l0 norm and uses the modified conjugate gradient method to solve the optimization problem. The second part combines the BCS-SPL method under the framework of block compressed sensing to remove the block effect. Research shows that the algorithm can reduce the block effect while improving the accuracy and efficiency of reconstruction. Simulation results also verify that the BCS-CGSL0 algorithm has significant advantages in reconstruction accuracy and efficiency.",

            "title": "Transformer and CNN Hybrid Network for Super-Resolution Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery",
            "abstract": "Super-resolution semantic segmentation (SRSS) based on Convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot establish long-range dependencies due to limited receptive field, which limits the SRSS to obtain accurate high-resolution (HR) segmentation results from the low-resolution (LR) input images. In this paper, we design a Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS network that consists of two branches: Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS branch and super-resolution guided branch. In the Transformer and CNN hybrid SRSS branch, Transformer extracts global context information from the feature map of the CNN, while skip connection is used to retain the local context information extracted from the CNN and combines both features to further improve the segmentation performance. In addition, the super-resolution guided branch is designed to supplement rich structure information and guide the semantic segmentation (SS). We test the proposed method on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark data set, and our network is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.",
