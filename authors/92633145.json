            "title": "ERASE: Benchmarking Feature Selection Methods for Deep Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "Deep Recommender Systems (DRS) are increasingly dependent on a large number of feature fields for more precise recommendations. Effective feature selection methods are consequently becoming critical for further enhancing the accuracy and optimizing storage efficiencies to align with the deployment demands. This research area, particularly in the context of DRS, is nascent and faces three core challenges. Firstly, variant experimental setups across research papers often yield unfair comparisons, obscuring practical insights. Secondly, the existing literature's lack of detailed analysis on selection attributes, based on large-scale datasets and a thorough comparison among selection techniques and DRS backbones, restricts the generalizability of findings and impedes deployment on DRS. Lastly, research often focuses on comparing the peak performance achievable by feature selection methods, an approach that is typically computationally infeasible for identifying the optimal hyperparameters and overlooks evaluating the robustness and stability of these methods. To bridge these gaps, this paper presents ERASE, a comprehensive bEnchmaRk for feAture SElection for DRS. ERASE comprises a thorough evaluation of eleven feature selection methods, covering both traditional and deep learning approaches, across four public datasets, private industrial datasets, and a real-world commercial platform, achieving significant enhancement. Our code is available online for ease of reproduction.",

            "abstract": "Multi-types of user behavior data (e.g., clicking, adding to cart, and purchasing) are recorded in most real-world recommendation scenarios, which can help to learn users\u2019 multi-faceted preferences. However, it is challenging to explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas features\u201d and gradient conflict in multi-task learning when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d. In this paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict when treating multi-behavior data \u201cas labels\u201d, we propose a Multi-Expert with Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for multi-task learning. Comprehensive experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CIGF.",

            "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in NLP domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM).",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become increasingly important in our daily lives since they play an important role in mitigating the information overload problem, especially in many user-oriented online services. Recommender systems aim to identify a set of items that best match users' explicit or implicit preferences, by utilizing the user and item interactions to improve the accuracy. With the fast advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the past few decades, recommendation techniques have achieved promising performance. However, we still meet three inherent challenges to design deep recommender systems (DRS): 1) the majority of existing DRS are developed based on hand-crafted components, which requires ample expert knowledge recommender systems; 2) human error and bias can lead to suboptimal components, which reduces the recommendation effectiveness; 3) non-trivial time and engineering efforts are usually required to design the task-specific components in different recommendation scenarios. In this tutorial, we aim to give a comprehensive survey on the recent progress of advanced Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques for solving the above problems in deep recommender systems. More specifically, we will present feature selection, feature embedding search, feature interaction search, and whole DRS pipeline model training and comprehensive search for deep recommender systems. In this way, we expect academic researchers and industrial practitioners in related fields can get deep understanding and accurate insight into the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of technologies in recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Multi-task Recommender Systems (MTRSs) has become increasingly prevalent in a variety of real-world applications due to their exceptional training efficiency and recommendation quality. However, conventional MTRSs often input all relevant feature fields without distinguishing their contributions to different tasks, which can lead to confusion and a decline in performance. Existing feature selection methods may neglect task relations or require significant computation during model training in multi-task setting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Single-shot Feature Selection framework for MTRSs, referred to as MultiSFS, which is capable of selecting feature fields for each task while considering task relations in a single-shot manner. Specifically, MultiSFS first efficiently obtains task-specific feature importance through a single forward-backward pass. Then, a data-task bipartite graph is constructed to learn field-level task relations. Subsequently, MultiSFS merges the feature importance according to task relations and selects feature fields for different tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness and properties of MultiSFS, we integrate it with representative MTRS models and evaluate on three real-world datasets. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "Traditional click-through rate (CTR) prediction models convert the tabular data into one-hot vectors and leverage the collaborative relations among features for inferring the user's preference over items. This modeling paradigm discards essential semantic information. Though some works like P5 and CTR-BERT have explored the potential of using Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to extract semantic signals for CTR prediction, they are computationally expensive and suffer from low efficiency. Besides, the beneficial collaborative relations are not considered, hindering the recommendation performance. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel framework \\textbf{CTRL}, which is industrial-friendly and model-agnostic with superior inference efficiency. Specifically, the original tabular data is first converted into textual data. Both tabular data and converted textual data are regarded as two different modalities and are separately fed into the collaborative CTR model and pre-trained language model. A cross-modal knowledge alignment procedure is performed to fine-grained align and integrate the collaborative and semantic signals, and the lightweight collaborative model can be deployed online for efficient serving after fine-tuned with supervised signals. Experimental results on three public datasets show that CTRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CTR models significantly. Moreover, we further verify its effectiveness on a large-scale industrial recommender system.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive growth of commercial applications of recommender systems, multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted considerable attention, which utilizes data from multiple domains to improve their recommendation performance simultaneously. However, training a unified deep recommender system (DRS) may not explicitly comprehend the commonality and difference among domains, whereas training an individual model for each domain neglects the global information and incurs high computation costs. Likewise, fine-tuning on each domain is inefficient, and recent advances that apply the prompt tuning technique to improve fine-tuning efficiency rely solely on large-sized transformers. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-enhanced paradigm for multi-scenario recommendation. Specifically, a unified DRS backbone model is first pre-trained using data from all the domains in order to capture the commonality across domains. Then, we conduct prompt tuning with two novel prompt modules, capturing the distinctions among various domains and users. Our experiments on Douban, Amazon, and Ali-CCP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm with two noticeable strengths: (i) its great compatibility with various DRS backbone models, and (ii) its high computation and storage efficiency with only 6% trainable parameters in prompt tuning phase. The implementation code is available for easy reproduction.",

            "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims at learning related tasks in a unified model to achieve mutual improvement among tasks considering their shared knowledge. It is an important topic in recommendation due to the demand for multi-task prediction considering performance and efficiency. Although MTL has been well studied and developed, there is still a lack of systematic review in the recommendation community. To fill the gap, we provide a comprehensive review of existing multi-task deep recommender systems (MTDRS) in this survey. To be specific, the problem definition of MTDRS is first given, and it is compared with other related areas. Next, the development of MTDRS is depicted and the taxonomy is introduced from the task relation and methodology aspects. Specifically, the task relation is categorized into parallel, cascaded, and auxiliary with main, while the methodology is grouped into parameter sharing, optimization, and training mechanism. The survey concludes by summarizing the application and public datasets of MTDRS and highlighting the challenges and future directions of the field.",

            "abstract": "Real-Time Bidding (RTB) has shown remarkable success in display advertising and has been employed in other advertising scenarios, e.g., sponsored search advertising with multiple ad slots. Many current RTB techniques built for single-slot display advertising are thus no longer applicable, especially in the bid landscape forecasting. Landscape forecasting predicts market competition, including the highest bid price and winning probability, which is preliminary and crucial for the subsequent bidding strategy design. In the multi-slot advertising, predicting the winning prices for each position requires a more precise differentiation of bids among top advertisers. Furthermore, defining the winning probability and addressing censorship issues are not as straightforward as in the case of a single slot. In view of these challenges, how to forecast the bidding landscape in the multi-slot environment remains open. In this work, we are the first to study the landscape forecasting problem in multi-slot RTB, considering the correlation between ad slots in the same pageview. Specifically, we formulate the research topic into two subproblems: predicting the distribution of the winning price and predicting the winning probability of the bid price for each position. Based on the observation from the production data and survival analysis techniques, we propose a deep recurrent model to predict the distribution of the winning price as well as the winning probability for each position. A comprehensive loss function is proposed to learn from the censoring data. Experiments on two public semi-synthetic datasets and one private industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Considering the balance between revenue and resource consumption for industrial recommender systems, intelligent recommendation computing has been emerging recently. Existing solutions deploy the same recommendation model to serve users indiscriminately, which is sub-optimal for total revenue maximization. We propose a multi-model service solution by deploying different-complexity models to serve different-valued users. An automated dynamic model generation framework AutoGen is elaborated to efficiently derive multiple parameter-sharing models with diverse complexities and adequate predictive capabilities. A mixed search space is designed and an importance-aware progressive training scheme is proposed to prevent interference between different architectures, which avoids the model retraining and improves the search efficiency, thereby efficiently deriving multiple models. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoGen.",
