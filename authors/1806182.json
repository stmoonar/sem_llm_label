            "abstract": "Ontology-based data access (OBDA) is a well-established approach to information management which facilitates the access to a (single) relational data source through the mediation of a high-level ontology, and the use of a declarative mapping linking the data layer to the ontology. We formally introduce here the notion of ontology-based data federation (OBDF) to denote a framework that combines OBDA with a data federation layer where multiple, possibly heterogeneous sources are virtually exposed as a single relational database. We discuss opportunities and challenges of OBDF, and provide techniques to deliver efficient query answering in an OBDF setting. Such techniques are validated through an extensive experimental evaluation based on the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been gaining momentum recently in both academia and industry, due to the flexibility of their data model, allowing one to access and integrate collections of data of different forms. Virtual Knowledge Graphs (VKGs), a variant of KGs originating from the field of Ontology-based Data Access (OBDA), are a promising paradigm for integrating and accessing legacy data sources. The main idea of VKGs is that the KG remains virtual: the end-user interacts with a KG, but queries are reformulated on-the-fly as queries over the data source(s). To enable the paradigm, one needs to define declarative mappings specifying the link between the data sources and the elements in the VKG. In this work, we try to investigate common patterns that arise when specifying such mappings, building on well-established methodologies from the area of conceptual modeling and database design.",

            "abstract": "Data federation addresses the problem of uniformly accessing multiple, possibly heterogeneous data sources, by mapping them into a unified schema, such as an RDF(S)/OWL ontology or a relational schema, and by supporting the execution of queries, like SPARQL or SQL queries, over that unified schema. Data explosion in volume and variety has made data federation increasingly popular in many application domains. Hence, many data federation systems have been developed in industry and academia, and it has become challenging for users to select suitable systems to achieve their objectives. In order to systematically analyze and compare these systems, we propose an evaluation framework comprising four dimensions: (i) federation capabilities, i.e., query language, data source, and federation techniques; (ii) data security, i.e., authentication, authorization, auditing, encryption, and data masking; (iii) interface, i.e., graphical interface, command line interface, and application programming interface; and (iv) development, i.e., main development language, deployment, commercial support, open source, and release. Using this framework, we thoroughly studied 51 data federation systems from the Semantic Web and Database communities. This paper shares the results of our investigation and aims to provide reference material and insights for users, developers and researchers selecting or further developing data federation systems.",

In this setting, the SQL queries generated by the OBDA component by translating user SPARQL queries are further transformed by the data federation layer so as to be efficiently executed over the data sources. The structure of these SQL queries directly affects their execution time in the data federation layer and their optimization is crucial for performance. We propose here novel optimizations specific for OBDF, which are based on \u201chints\u201d about existing data redundancies in the sources, empty join operations, and the need for materialized views. Such hints can be systematically inferred by analyzing the OBDA mappings and ontology and exploited to simplify the query structure. We also carry out an experimental evaluation in which we show the effectiveness of our optimizations.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework, which we call VKG-UI, for realizing ontology-based reusable user interfaces (UIs) for data access via virtual knowledge graphs (VKGs). The VKG approach uses an ontology to model the domain of interest and to hide the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources. Reusable UIs can be built by relying on queries that are issued to the VKG system and that use the high level vocabulary from the ontology layer. This use of VKGs allows for decoupling the data from the UIs, and brings great reusability in designing the latter. To illustrate our approach, we introduce significant use cases with various types of UIs, including programming, graphic, natural language, and voice interfaces.",

We introduce INODE - an end-to-end data exploration system - that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Research, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public.

In UNiCS, each query gets transformed in a set of optimised queries to different data sources. Moreover, the OBDA approach makes the semantics of the data explicit, thus offering an intuitive way to access, explore, visualise, analyse, and post-process them.",

This paper introduces a web-based platform to ease the access of scholars to historical and cultural data distributed across different data sources. The approach relies on the Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) paradigm, where the different datasets are virtually integrated by a conceptual layer (an ontology).

This interest has recently resulted in approving the standard for specifying Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules SBVR. Despite the existence of formally grounded notations, up to now SBVR still lacks a sound and consistent logical formalization which would allow developing automated solutions able to check the consistency of a set of business rules. This work reports on the attempt to provide logical foundations for SBVR by the means of defining a specific first-order deontic-alethic logic FODAL. The connections of FODAL with the modal logic QK and the description logic ALCQI have been investigated and, on top of the obtained theoretical results, a special tool providing automated support for consistency checks of a set of ALCQI-expressible deontic and alethic business rules has been implemented.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, the amount of data of all kinds available electronically has increased dramatically. Data are accessible through a range of interfaces including Web browsers, database query languages, application-specific interfaces, built on top of a number of different data exchange formats. All these data span from un-structured to highly structured data. Very often, some of them have structure even if the structure is implicit, and not as rigid or regular as that found in standard database systems. Spreadsheet documents are prototypical in this respect. Spreadsheets are the lightweight technology able to supply companies with easy to build business management and business intelligence applications, and business people largely adopt spreadsheets as smart vehicles for data files generation and sharing. Actually, the more spreadsheets grow in complexity (e.g., their use in product development plans and quoting), the more their arrangement, maintenance, and analysis appear as a knowledge-driven activity. The algorithmic approach to the problem of automatic data structure extraction from spreadsheet documents (i.e., grid-structured and free topological-related data) emerges from the WIA project: Worksheets Intelligent Analyser. The WIA-algorithm shows how to provide a description of spreadsheet contents in terms of higher level of abstractions or conceptualisations. In particular, the WIA-algorithm target is about the extraction of i) the calculus work-flow implemented in the spreadsheets formulas and ii) the logical role played by the data which take part into the calculus. The aim of the resulting conceptualisations is to provide spreadsheets with abstract representations useful for further model refinements and optimizations through evolutionary algorithms computations.",

Reasoning about such context can be interpreted as spatial reasoning, which means not only to be able to carry out inferences about the space itself, but also inferences about spatially related information according a given background knowledge. Past works have shown that hybrid modal logics are a powerful and rich formalism to model qualitative spatial reasoning and reasoning on information spread into graph-like structures. In this paper we present the preliminary results we obtained in designing and implementing HyLMoC, a model checking system for hybrid modal logics. The functionalities of the model checker are based on backend module that accepts as inputs a list of hybrid modal formulas and the specification of a labeled graph structure that is compliant with the characteristics of a Kripke model. The current implementation of the backend allows to perform different reasoning tasks with respect to those inputs: Local and Global model checking, and All-worlds model checking.",

            "abstract": "The Multilayered Multi-agent Situated System (MMASS) has been proposed as a general framework to build multiagent systems in which agents are situated in an environment whose characterization can be multifaceted (each facet of the environment is named a layer, hence the name of this framework). Agents in the MMASS can be purely reactive and computationally lightweight, or deliberative and employ highly sophisticated reasoning mechanisms. As a consequence, the MMASS has proven to be useful to build massively multi-agent systems (in which typically each agent is computationally simple) as well as systems comprised by complex agents (in which typically we have few agents interacting with each other and with the environment). In the present article we combine a simplified version of MMASS with a specific logical system, which we suggest that can be particularly suitable to solve problems based on simulations. The proposed logical system is a variation of classical FOPL, in which logical statements are tagged with probability values so that one can reason with probabilities as opposed of reasoning about probabilities.",

The core of the architectural solution proposed is completely based on ontologies rather than on more traditional forms of persistent data storage facilities, such as relational databases. This approach provides a flexible support to the design and implementation of web portals in which navigation schemes are not entirely predetermined but are instead influenced by actual relationships among the contents of the ontology, that are used to generate web pages as well as hyperlinks. A wiki technology is integrated with this approach in order to create pages not directly derived by elements of the ontology, but also to enrich the textual contents with suitable formatting, images and hyperlinks. The application of this approach to the realization of a web portal is also described; the portal is devoted to enable a number of scientific communities to share archaeological knowledge about the Silk Road domain.",

In order to reduce the complexity of the search space the paper presents an approach based on: (i) the representation of the ontological constraints on the compounds\u2019 structure in a TBox, and the representation of compound formulations as ABoxes. (ii) The representation of the transitions of a LTS as a set of actions producing updates on ABoxes; (iii) the definition of an algorithm to check ABox consistency with respect to a specific axiom schema in order to prune inconsistent branches of the search space.",

This article focuses on the notions of \u201cplace\u201d and \u201cconceptual spatial relation\u201d to present a formal model of space supporting common-sense spatial reasoning. The model can be viewed as the semantic specification for a hybrid logic, whose formulas represent spatially qualified information. Interesting classes of common-sense spatial models are identified according to the properties of their characteristic relations and an axiomatization of the associated hybrid language is given; a sound and complete tableau-based calculus for these classes of models is provided.",

Although a lot of sophisticated technologies have been developed over the last years, the proper detection and management of critical situations that can arise in traffic flow is still a problem. A possible solution to this problem is to provide systems for monitoring and control of traffic situation with a correlation function that creates a dynamic view of traffic situation over the space and time. In order to do this, a first order logic-based language has been developed and applied to the development of the alarm correlation module (MCA) within the context of the system for automatic monitoring of traffic (SAMOT).",

High-level correlation of information in such context can be defined, exploiting a formal model arising from the spatial disposition of information sources, as a form of commonsense spatial reasoning. With respect to this model, a Hybrid Logic to formalize commonsense spatial reasoning in these context has been defined. Here, on the basis of relevant analogies among Pervasive Computing and human practice in handling spatial knowledge, we suggest to provide the term \u201ccommonsense\u201d with a positive meaning, showing that our logical framework captures some features of non-mathematical reasoning when spatially qualified information is concerned. The focus on such features and the analogies mentioned above suggest to qualify our approach to (commonsense) spatial reasoning as an informational approach.",
