            "abstract": "Despite being a heavily researched topic, Adversarial Training (AT) is rarely, if ever, deployed in practical AI systems for two primary reasons: (i) the gained robustness is frequently accompanied by a drop in generalization and (ii) generating adversarial examples (AEs) is computationally prohibitively expensive. To address these limitations, we propose SMAAT, a new AT algorithm that leverages the manifold conjecture, stating that off-manifold AEs lead to better robustness while on-manifold AEs result in better generalization. Specifically, SMAAT aims at generating a higher proportion of off-manifold AEs by perturbing the intermediate deepnet layer with the lowest intrinsic dimension. This systematically results in better scalability compared to classical AT as it reduces the PGD chains length required for generating the AEs. Additionally, our study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first explanation for the difference in the generalization and robustness trends between vision and language models, ie., AT results in a drop in generalization in vision models whereas, in encoder-based language models, generalization either improves or remains unchanged. We show that vision transformers and decoder-based models tend to have low intrinsic dimensionality in the earlier layers of the network (more off-manifold AEs), while encoder-based models have low intrinsic dimensionality in the later layers. We demonstrate the efficacy of SMAAT; on several tasks, including robustifying (i) sentiment classifiers, (ii) safety filters in decoder-based models, and (iii) retrievers in RAG setups. SMAAT requires only 25-33% of the GPU time compared to standard AT, while significantly improving robustness across all applications and maintaining comparable generalization.",

Our method leverages a multi-stage ranking architecture to efficiently rank the most related techniques based on their semantic relevance to the input text. Each ranker in our pipeline uses a distinct design for text representation. To enhance relevance modeling, we leverage pretrained language models, which we fine-tune for the technique annotation task. While generic large language models are not yet capable of fully addressing this challenge, we obtain very promising results. We achieve a recall rate improvement of +35% compared to the previous state-of-the-art results. We further create new public benchmark datasets for training and validating methods in this domain, which we release to the research community aiming to promote future research in this important direction.",

            "abstract": "We present ProvG-Searcher, a novel approach for detecting known APT behaviors within system security logs. Our approach leverages provenance graphs, a comprehensive graph representation of event logs, to capture and depict data provenance relations by mapping system entities as nodes and their interactions as edges. We formulate the task of searching provenance graphs as a subgraph matching problem and employ a graph representation learning method. The central component of our search methodology involves embedding of subgraphs in a vector space where subgraph relationships can be directly evaluated. We achieve this through the use of order embeddings that simplify subgraph matching to straightforward comparisons between a query and precomputed subgraph representations. To address challenges posed by the size and complexity of provenance graphs, we propose a graph partitioning scheme and a behavior-preserving graph reduction method. Overall, our technique offers significant computational efficiency, allowing most of the search computation to be performed offline while incorporating a lightweight comparison step during query execution. Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate that ProvG-Searcher achieves superior performance, with an accuracy exceeding 99% in detecting query behaviors and a false positive rate of approximately 0.02%, outperforming other approaches.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the use of video coding settings for source identification and propose a new approach that incorporates encoding and encapsulation aspects of a video. To this end, a joint representation of the overall file metadata is developed and used in conjunction with a two-level hierarchical classification method. At the first level, our method groups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent high-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more nuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is evaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video datasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91% is achieved in correctly identifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to an improvement of 6.5% over the conventional approach based on video file encapsulation characteristics. Analysis performed on a large, unlabeled video set also confirmed the aptness of our approach. To further demonstrate the versatility of encoding parameters, we consider attribution of partial video files where file metadata is not available. Our results show that, even in this limited setting that is intrinsic to forensic file recovery, an identification accuracy of 57% can be achieved through the use of a subset of encoding parameters estimated from coded video data.",

            "abstract": "Adversarial training is widely acknowledged as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. However, it is also well established that achieving both robustness and generalization in adversarially trained models involves a trade-off. The goal of this work is to provide an in depth comparison of different approaches for adversarial training in language models. Specifically, we study the effect of pre-training data augmentation as well as training time input perturbations vs. embedding space perturbations on the robustness and generalization of transformer-based language models. Our findings suggest that better robustness can be achieved by pre-training data augmentation or by training with input space perturbation. However, training with embedding space perturbation significantly improves generalization. A linguistic correlation analysis of neurons of the learned models reveals that the improved generalization is due to 'more specialized' neurons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to carry out a deep qualitative analysis of different methods of generating adversarial examples in adversarial training of language models.",

            "abstract": "We study the problem of profiling news media on the Web with respect to their factuality of reporting and bias. This is an important but under-studied problem related to disinformation and \u201cfake news\u201d detection, but it addresses the issue at a coarser granularity compared to looking at an individual article or an individual claim. This is useful as it allows to profile entire media outlets in advance. Unlike previous work, which has focused primarily on text (e.g., on the text of the articles published by the target website, or on the textual description in their social media profiles or in Wikipedia), here our main focus is on modeling the similarity between media outlets based on the overlap of their audience. This is motivated by homophily considerations, i.e., the tendency of people to have connections to people with similar interests, which we extend to media, hypothesizing that similar types of media would be read by similar kinds of users. In particular, we propose GREENER (GRaph nEural nEtwork for News mEdia pRofiling), a model that builds a graph of inter-media connections based on their audience overlap, and then uses graph neural networks to represent each medium. We find that such representations are quite useful for predicting the factuality and the bias of news media outlets, yielding improvements over state-of-the-art results reported on two datasets. When augmented with conventionally used representations obtained from news articles, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Wikipedia, prediction accuracy is found to improve by 2.5-27 macro-F1 points for the two tasks.",

            "abstract": "Enterprise networks are one of the major targets for cyber attacks due to the vast amount of sensitive and valuable data they contain. A common approach to detecting attacks in the enterprise environment relies on modeling the behavior of users and systems to identify unexpected deviations. The feasibility of this approach crucially depends on how well attack-related events can be isolated from benign and mundane system activities. Despite the signi\ufb01cant focus on end-user systems, the background behavior of servers running critical services for the enterprise is less studied. To guide the design of detection methods tailored for servers, in this work, we examine system event records from 46 servers in a large enterprise obtained over a duration of ten weeks. We analyze the rareness characteristics and the similarity of the provenance relations in the event log data. Our \ufb01ndings show that server activity, in general, is highly variant over time and dissimilar across di\ufb00erent types of servers. However, careful consideration of pro\ufb01ling window of historical events and service level grouping of servers improve rareness measurements by 24.5%. Further, utilizing better contextual representations, the similarity in provenance relationships could be improved. An important implication of our \ufb01ndings is that detection techniques developed considering experimental setups with non-representative characteristics may perform poorly in practice.",

The rise of attention networks, self-supervised learning, generative modeling, and graph neural networks has widened the application space of AI. Deep Learning has also propelled the return of reinforcement learning as a core building block of autonomous decision making systems. The possible harms made possible by new AI technologies have raised socio-technical issues such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. The dominance of AI by Big-Tech who control talent, computing resources, and most importantly, data may lead to an extreme AI divide.

            "abstract": "Image stabilization performed during imaging and/or post-processing poses one of the most significant challenges to photo-response non-uniformity based source camera attribution from videos. When performed digitally, stabilization involves cropping, warping, and inpainting of video frames to eliminate unwanted camera motion. Hence, successful attribution requires inversion of these transformations in a blind manner. To address this challenge, we introduce a source camera verification method for videos that takes into account spatially variant nature of stabilization transformations and assumes a larger degree of freedom in their search. Our method identifies transformations at a sub-frame level, incorporates a number of constraints to validate their correctness, and offers computational flexibility in the search for the correct transformation. The method also adopts a holistic approach in countering disruptive effects of other video generation steps, such as video coding and downsizing, for more reliable attribution. Tests performed on one public and two custom datasets show that the proposed method is able to verify the source of 23-30% of all videos that underwent stronger stabilization, depending on computation load, without a significant impact on false attribution.",

            "title": "A Survey on Predicting the Factuality and the Bias of News Media",
            "abstract": "The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim or article, either manually or automatically. Thus, many researchers are shifting their attention to higher granularity, aiming to profile entire news outlets, which makes it possible to detect likely\"fake news\"the moment it is published, by simply checking the reliability of its source. Source factuality is also an important element of systems for automatic fact-checking and\"fake news\"detection, as they need to assess the reliability of the evidence they retrieve online. Political bias detection, which in the Western political landscape is about predicting left-center-right bias, is an equally important topic, which has experienced a similar shift towards profiling entire news outlets. Moreover, there is a clear connection between the two, as highly biased media are less likely to be factual; yet, the two problems have been addressed separately. In this survey, we review the state of the art on media profiling for factuality and bias, arguing for the need to model them jointly. We further discuss interesting recent advances in using different information sources and modalities, which go beyond the text of the articles the target news outlet has published. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline future research directions.",
