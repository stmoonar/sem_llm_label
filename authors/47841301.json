            "abstract": "In existing secret medical-image sharing (SMIS) schemes, to protect and manage secret medical-images (SMIs), the sharing and recovery of each SMI are implemented by local servers of medical institutions. However, since a lot of SMIs are produced by personal smart terminal devices in Internet of Things (IoT) environment, directly implementing the sharing and recovery processes will cause excessive communication and computing burden for those local servers, which makes the existing SMIS schemes not suitable for IoT environment. To address the above issue, we propose an encrypted domain SMIS (Enc-SMIS) scheme with secure outsourcing computation for protecting and managing medical images in IoT environment. In the proposed scheme, the medical images are first encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and then outsourced to a cloud server for generating a set of image shares. Subsequently, these shares are stored separately in different local servers of medical institutions. Furthermore, the recovery process is also outsourced to the cloud server when doctors need to observe the patients\u2019 medical images. Compared with the existing SMIS schemes, the proposed Enc-SMIS scheme alleviates the computing and communication burden on local servers significantly with secure outsourcing computation in the semi-honest model, and thus supports the storage and management of medical images well in IoT environment.",

            "abstract": "Secret Image Sharing (SIS) is the technology that shares any given secret image by generating and distributing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> shadow images in the way that any subset of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> shadow images can restore the secret image. However, in the existing SIS schemes, the shadow images will be easily tampered and corrupted during the communication, which will pose serious security issues. Recently, blockchain has emerged as a promising paradigm in the field of data communication and information security. To securely communicate and effectively protect the secret image data in wireless networks, we propose a Blockchain-based Secure and Efficient Secret Image Sharing (BC-SESIS) scheme with outsourcing computation in wireless networks. In the proposed BC-SESIS scheme, the shadow images are encrypted and stored in the blockchain to prevent them from being tampered and corrupted. The identity authentication-enabled smart contract is deployed to achieve the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(k,n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> threshold for secret image restoring. Furthermore, to reduce the computational burden of smart contract and users, an efficient outsourcing computation method is designed to outsource the restoring task, which is securely implemented by agent miners in the encryption domain. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that the BC-SESIS scheme can achieve desirable communication security and high computational efficiency in the wireless networks.",

            "abstract": "The finance-level Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is going to become a novel media in the 6G-driven digital society. Inside the financial AIoT environment, large-scale crowd credit assessment with the guarantee of low latency has been a general demand. Facing limited computational resources, there is still a lack of effective computation offloading methods for this purpose to ensure low latency. In order to deal with such an issue, this article introduces edge computing mode and proposes a low-latency edge computation offloading scheme for trust evaluation in financial AIoT. With different elements involved in the assessment process being denoted via mathematical description, a multiobjective optimization problem with constraints is formulated. Then, the aforementioned optimization problem is solved by a specific search algorithm, so that optimal task offloading schemes can be found. To assess the performance of the proposal, some simulation experiments are conducted to verify the proposed task offloading method. And it can be reflected from numerical results that latency can be well reduced compared with baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "In industrial cyber\u2013physical systems (ICPS), real-time condition monitoring of wear-prone components of steel rolling production equipment is a key scenario for predictive maintenance. Machine vision-based crack detection can quickly identify critical damage and prevent unplanned downtime. However, the harsh working environment poses difficulties for data collection, a large amount of noise tends to contaminate surface crack images, and complex surface crack morphology affects the recognition accuracy. The real-time and accuracy performance of traditional crack detection algorithms are hard to meet the requirement of industrial applications. To tackle this challenge, a high-precision surface crack detection architecture for rolling steel production equipment based on image semantic segmentation is proposed. First, a coordinate attention-deep convolution generative adversarial networks (CA-DCGANs)-based data augmentation method is proposed to augment the original data set with high quality. Second, a crack detection model based on multiscale learning efficient spatial pyramid network (MLESPNetV2) is proposed. It effectively improves detection accuracy to obtain semantic information strongly correlated with crack using multiscale modeling and attention mechanism. Third, A semi-supervised learning method based on multiscale learning efficient spatial pyramid-generative adversarial network (MLESP-GAN) is proposed to solve the problem of insufficient labeled data and unstable training process. Finally, extensive experimental results on KolektorSDD and CAS-Crack data sets demonstrate that the proposed MLESPNetV2 significantly improves accuracy and real-time performance compared with the benchmark model. It is therefore suitable for deployment in industrial sites for real-time health monitoring of industrial equipment.",

            "abstract": "Text steganography has received a lot of attention in the application of covert communication. How to ensure desirable capacity and imperceptibility has become a key issue in text steganography. There are two typical approaches, i.e., text-selection-based steganography and text-generation-based steganography. However, the text-selection-based approaches generally have the very low hidden capacity and are not applicable in practical scenarios. Although the text-generation-based approaches can embed secret messages with higher capacity during text generation, they are prone to semantic incoherence and semantic errors when generating long texts. To address the abovementioned issues, this article proposes a novel text steganography based on long readable text generation. It first determines the topic of the stego-text according to the scenarios of the communication parties. Then, the plug and play language model (PPLM) is explored to generate the long readable stego-text conforming to the topic with semantic coherency. A given secret message is hidden during text generation by selecting proper words in an established embeddable candidate word pool (ECWP). Establishing the ECWP prevents the language model (LM) from selecting words with low probability in the text generation, thereby avoiding the generation of low-quality or even grammatically incorrect stego-text. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly increases hidden capacity while maintaining good imperceptibility compared with the existing approaches.",

            "abstract": "With the widespread popularity of the Internet of Things and various intelligent medical devices, the amount of medical data is rising sharply, and thus medical data processing has become increasingly challenging. Mobile edge computing technology allows computing power to be allocated at the edge closer to users, which enables efficient data offloading for healthcare systems. However, existing studies on medical data offloading seldom guarantee effective data privacy and security. Moreover, the research equipping data offloading architectures with Blockchain neglect the delay and energy consumption costs incurred in using Blockchain technology for medical data offloading. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data offloading scheme for healthcare based on Blockchain technology, which achieves optimal medical resource allocation and simultaneously minimizes the cost of offloading tasks. Specifically, we design a smart contract to ensure secure data offloading. And, we formulate the cost problem as a Markov Decision Process, solved by a policy search-based deep reinforcement learning (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) scheme, where we jointly consider offloading decisions, allocation of computing resources and radio transmission bandwidth, and Blockchain data security audits. The security of our smart-contract-based mechanism is theoretically and empirically proved, while extensive experimental results also show that our solution can obtain superior performance gains with lower cost than other baselines.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted HAP-UAV secure multi-user mixed radio frequency (RF)/free space optical (FSO) system is proposed. Specifically, the Gamma-Gamma distribution is utilized to characterize the atmospheric turbulence effect for the FSO link from UAV to HAP, while the Rayleigh and Nakagami- $m$ distribution fading are applied to simulate the legitimate and wiretap RF links, respectively. We present the closed-form expressions for the probability density functions, the cumulative distribution functions, and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terms of Meijer\u2019s G-function. To gain more insight into secrecy performance, we further obtain the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic SOP, the asymptotic probability of positive secrecy capacity (PPSC), the diversity gain, and the coding gain at high SNR regions. We can observe that the secrecy performance depends on the weaker channel between the RF and FSO, and is closely related to the number of RIS elements, the number of terrestrial users, the atmospheric turbulence factor, pointing error parameters, and the fading parameter of Nakagami- $m$ distributed wiretap link. Finally, numerical results validate the derived results and demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior secrecy performance over the benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been advancing and gaining tremendous interests from both academia and industry. With the development of wireless technologies, a huge amount of data generated at the network edge provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop GANs applications. However, due to the constraints such as bandwidth, privacy, and legal issues, it is inappropriate to collect and send all data to the cloud or servers for analysis, training, and mining. Thus, deploying and training GANs at the edge becomes a promising alternative solution. The instability of GANs introduced by non-independent and identical data (Non-IID) poses significant challenges to training GANs. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel federated learning framework for GANs, namely, Collaborated gAme Parallel Learning (CAP). CAP supports parallel training of data and models for GANs, breaking the isolated training among generators that exists in the previous distributed algorithms, and achieving collaborative learning among cloud, edge servers, and devices. Then, to further enhance the ability of CAP-GAN for addressing Non-IID issues, we propose a Mix-Generator module (Mix-G) which divides a generator into the sharing layer and personalizing layer. The Mix-G module extracts the generic and personalization features and improves the performance of CAP-GAN on extremely personalizing datasets. Experimental results and analysis substantiate the usefulness and superiority of our proposed CAP-GAN scheme which can achieve better results in the Non-IID scenarios compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and intelligent vehicular networks has led to the widespread deployment of massive long-range (LoRa) nodes. These nodes play a crucial role in facilitating the sharing of critical information towards various vehicles. However, a significant challenge that persists is the secure authentication of LoRa. Recently, radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) emerges as a robust potential solution, offering both rapid and scalable identification capabilities. By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, the inherent hardware-level, unique, and resilient features of RFF can be thoroughly explored. Given the inherent non-identical (heterogeneity) of LoRa networks and the non-stationary characteristics of chirp signals, conventional approaches prove inadequate in effectively capturing the RFF features. To surmount these challenges, a novel scheme termed as \u201cdeep federated learning network (DFLNet)\u201d is proposed. DFLNet facilitates distributed RFF learning while ensuring privacy preservation within diverse LoRa networks. Addressing the heterogeneity of datasets, we incorporate an adaptive optimizer that contributes to the efficient convergence improvement. The DFLNet adaptively manages computational demands and privacy concerns through the utilization of mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, thus enabling distributed learning. Empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of DFLNet, attaining an impressive identification accuracy of up to approximately 96.7% utilizing merely around 5000 samples per client, while concurrently ensuring a robust privacy preservation.",
