            "abstract": "A wide range of (multivariate) temporal (1D) and spatial (2D) data analysis tasks, such as grouping vehicle sensor trajectories, can be formulated as clustering with given metric constraints. Existing metric-constrained clustering algorithms overlook the rich correlation between feature similarity and metric distance, i.e., metric autocorrelation. The model-based variations of these clustering algorithms (e.g. TICC and STICC) achieve SOTA performance, yet suffer from computational instability and complexity by using a metric-constrained Expectation-Maximization procedure. In order to address these two problems, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, MC-GTA (Model-based Clustering via Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations). Its objective is only composed of pairwise weighted sums of feature similarity terms (square Wasserstein-2 distance) and metric autocorrelation terms (a novel multivariate generalization of classic semivariogram). We show that MC-GTA is effectively minimizing the total hinge loss for intra-cluster observation pairs not passing goodness-of-fit tests, i.e., statistically not originating from the same distribution. Experiments on 1D/2D synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MC-GTA successfully incorporates metric autocorrelation. It outperforms strong baselines by large margins (up to 14.3% in ARI and 32.1% in NMI) with faster and stabler optimization (>10x speedup).",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Generative AI based on foundation models provides a first glimpse into the world represented by machines trained on vast amounts of multimodal data ingested by these models during training. If we consider the resulting models as knowledge bases in their own right, this may open up new avenues for understanding places through the lens of machines. In this work, we adopt this thinking and select GPT-4, a state-of-the-art representative in the family of multimodal large language models, to study its geographic diversity regarding how well geographic features are represented. Using DBpedia abstracts as a ground-truth corpus for probing, our natural language\u2013based geo-guessing experiment shows that GPT-4 may currently encode insufficient knowledge about several geographic feature types on a global level. On a local level, we observe not only this insufficiency but also inter-regional disparities in GPT-4\u2019s geo-guessing performance on UNESCO World Heritage Sites that carry significance to both local and global populations, and the inter-regional disparities may become smaller as the geographic scale increases. Morever, whether assessing the geo-guessing performance on a global or local level, we find inter-model disparities in GPT-4\u2019s geo-guessing performance when comparing its unimodal and multimodal variants. We hope this work can initiate a discussion on geographic diversity as an ethical principle within the GIScience community in the face of global socio-technical challenges.\n",

            "abstract": "In the classic Philosophical Investigations , Ludwig Wittgenstein suggests that the meaning of words is rooted in their use in ordinary language, challenging the idea of fixed rules determining the meaning of words. Likewise, we believe that the meaning of keywords and concepts in academic papers is shaped by their usage within the articles and evolves as research progresses. For example, the terms natural hazards and natural disasters were once used interchangeably, but this is rarely the case today. When searching for archived documents, such as those related to disaster relief, choosing the appropriate keyword is crucial and requires a deeper understanding of the historical context. To improve interoperability and promote reusability from a Research Data Management (RDM) perspective, we examine the dynamic nature of concepts, providing formal definitions of concept drift and its variants. By employing a case study of past COSIT (Conference on Spatial Information Theory) proceedings to support these definitions, we argue that a quantitative formalization can help systematically detect subsequent changes and enhance the overall interpretation of concepts. 2012 ACM",

            "abstract": "Intuitively, there is a relation between measures of spatial dependence and information theoretical measures of entropy. For instance, we can provide an intuition of why spatial data is special by stating that, on average, spatial data samples contain less than expected information. Similarly, spatial data, e.g., remotely sensed imagery, that is easy to compress is also likely to show significant spatial autocorrelation. Formulating our (highly specific) core concepts of spatial information theory in the widely used language of information theory opens new perspectives on their differences and similarities and also fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, e.g., with the broader AI/ML communities. Interestingly, however, this intuitive relation is challenging to formalize and generalize, leading prior work to rely mostly on experimental results, e.g., for describing landscape patterns. In this work, we will explore the information theoretical roots of spatial autocorrelation, more specifically Moran's I, through the lens of self-information (also known as surprisal) and provide both formal proofs and experiments.",

            "abstract": "Disaster risk properties (or disaster variables) such as intensity, exposure, severity, vulnerability, resilience, and capacity are significant because they provide essential information for understanding and managing disaster risk and cascading effects. While there are an increasing number of datasets that record these properties based on different criteria, such as regional levels (e.g., community resilience at counties vs. census tracts), thematic levels (e.g., social vulnerability based on race vs. socioeconomic status), or even for different hazard types (e.g., disaster risk for earthquakes vs. hurricanes), we lack a formal model that captures the semantics of these properties, i.e., their interactions with one another, and their context. Context is described through relations that constrain each property specific to an entity or as a property of an entity with respect to another entity. For example, intensity is exclusively the property of a disaster event, whereas vulnerability is a property of an element-at-risk concerning a specific hazard type. Here, we propose the Disaster Properties Ontology (DPO) that formalizes seven core properties in the disaster domain. It is built by re-using existing standard ontologies such as OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL, SOSA, and PROV-O. Additionally, DPO is developed as a sub-module of a more comprehensive Disaster Management reference Domain Ontology (DMDO).",

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using foundation models in geospatial artificial intelligence, known as GeoAI Foundation Models, for geographic question answering, remote sensing image understanding, map generation, and location-based services, among others. However, the development and application of GeoAI foundation models can pose serious privacy and security risks, which have not been fully discussed or addressed to date. This paper introduces the potential privacy and security risks throughout the lifecycle of GeoAI foundation models and proposes a comprehensive blueprint for research directions and preventative and control strategies.

We go on to discuss the primary conceptual components and how they can be instantiated, then present overarching examples related to emergency management operations.

            "abstract": "While the paths humans take play out in social as well as physical space, measures to describe and compare their trajectories are carried out in abstract, typically Euclidean, space. When these measures are applied to trajectories of actual individuals in an application area, alterations that are inconsequential in abstract space may suddenly become problematic once overlaid with geographic reality. In this work, we present a different view on trajectory similarity by introducing a measure that utilizes logical entailment. This is an inferential perspective that considers facts as triple statements deduced from the social and environmental context in which the travel takes place, and their practical implications. We suggest a formalization of entailment-based trajectory similarity, measured as the overlapping proportion of facts, which are spatial relation statements in our case study. With the proposed measure, we evaluate LSTM-TrajGAN, a privacy-preserving trajectory-generation model. The entailment-based model evaluation reveals potential consequences of disregarding the rich structure of geographic space (e.g., miscalculated insurance risk due to regional shifts in our toy example). Our work highlights the advantage of applying logical entailment to trajectory-similarity reasoning for location-privacy protection and beyond.",

            "title": "GeoKG'2022 Workshop Report: The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Knowledge Graphs",
            "abstract": "The topic of knowledge graphs (KGs) has recently attracted extensive attention in both industry and academia. Knowledge graphs are a new paradigm for representing, retrieving, integrating, and reasoning data from highly heterogeneous and multimodal sources. For example, international conferences, such as the Knowledge Graph Conference, have emerged in the past years, not to mention the increasing number of specialized workshops on KGs co-located with major computer science conferences, including Knowledge Graph Workshop at KDD 2021, Workshop for Deep Learning in Knowledge Graphs at ISWC 2021, Workshop on Knowledge Graph Construction at ESWC 2021, to name but a few. Also, the number of KGs-related papers accepted at these major conferences, including SIGSPATIAL, is rapidly increasing. Meanwhile, we also witness the increasing popularity of knowledge graph technologies in geography, geoinformatics, and GIScience domains. There are growing numbers of knowledge graph-related manuscripts accepted to the top geospatial-related venues, such as the International Journal of Geographical Information Science, Transactions in GIS, the International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, and so on. Transactions in GIS also held two special issues about knowledge graphs: 1) Symbolic and Subsymbolic GeoAI: Geospatial Knowledge Graphs and Spatially Explicit Machine Learning [4], and 2) Knowledge-based GIS (K-GIS): Theories, Techniques and Applications. In addition, government agencies, industries, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also lifting resources on topics of exploring KGs to build up interdisciplinary science and applications. One example is NSF's Accelerate Convergence Program, which promotes the idea of building an Open Knowledge Network to harness the data revolution. Funded by this program, the KnowWhereGraph is presently among the largest geo-enabled knowledge graphs, which integrates 28 different data layers at the intersection between humans and their environment [2].",

The NSF's new Convergence Accelerator program, which focuses on transitioning research to practice and translational research, announced Track A on the Open Knowledge Network (OKN). The program calls for multidisciplinary and multi-sector teams to work together to build a cooperative and shared open knowledge network infrastructure to drive innovation across science, engineering, and humanities. This workshop aims to invite researchers, practitioners, and the general public to brainstorm the ideas related to OKN, collaboratively build KGs for different domains or applications, develop AI algorithms to provide intelligent services based on OKN, and discuss the social and economic implications related to OKN.",
