            "abstract": "A knowledge graph focusing on water quality in relation to health risks posed by water activities (such as diving or swimming) is not currently available. To address this limitation, we first use existing resources to construct a knowledge graph relevant to water quality and health risks using KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM). Subsequently, we explore knowledge graph completion approaches for maintaining and updating the graph. Specifically, we manually identify a set of domain-specific UMLS concepts and use them to extract a graph of approximately 75,000 semantic triples from the Semantic MEDLINE database (which contains head-relation-tail triples extracted from PubMed). Using the resulting knowledge graph, we experiment with the KG-BERT approach for graph completion by employing pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa models and also models fine-tuned on a collection of water quality and health risks abstracts retrieved from the Web of Science. Experimental results show that KG-BERT with BERT/RoBERTa models fine-tuned on a domain-specific corpus improves the performance of KG-BERT with pre-trained models. Furthermore, KG-BERT gives better results than several translational distance or semantic matching baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Automatic topic classification has been studied extensively to assist managing and indexing scientific documents in a digital collection. With the large number of topics being available in recent years, it has become necessary to arrange them in a hierarchy. Therefore, the automatic classification systems need to be able to classify the documents hierarchically. In addition, each paper is often assigned to more than one relevant topic. For example, a paper can be assigned to several topics in a hierarchy tree. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMLTC) of scientific papers called SciHTC, which contains 186,160 papers and 1,234 categories from the ACM CCS tree. We establish strong baselines for HMLTC and propose a multi-task learning approach for topic classification with keyword labeling as an auxiliary task. Our best model achieves a Macro-F1 score of 34.57% which shows that this dataset provides significant research opportunities on hierarchical scientific topic classification. We make our dataset and code for all experiments publicly available.",

            "abstract": "Stance detection determines whether the author of a text is in favor of, against or neutral to a specific target and provides valuable insights into important events such as legalization of abortion. Despite significant progress on this task, one of the remaining challenges is the scarcity of annotations. Besides, most previous works focused on a hard-label training in which meaningful similarities among categories are discarded during training. To address these challenges, first, we evaluate a multi-target and a multi-dataset training settings by training one model on each dataset and datasets of different domains, respectively. We show that models can learn more universal representations with respect to targets in these settings. Second, we investigate the knowledge distillation in stance detection and observe that transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model can be beneficial in our proposed training settings. Moreover, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) method that applies instance-specific temperature scaling to the teacher and student predictions. Results show that the multi-dataset model performs best on all datasets and it can be further improved by the proposed AKD, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. We publicly release our code.",

Existing works generally train one model for each target pair. However, they fail to learn target-speci\ufb01c representations and are prone to over\ufb01tting. In this paper, we propose a new training strategy under the multi-task learning setting by training one model on all target pairs, which helps the model learn more universal representations and alleviate over\ufb01tting. Moreover, in order to extract more accurate target-speci\ufb01c representations, we propose a multi-task learning network which can jointly train our model with a stance (dis)agreement detection task that is designed to identify agreement and disagreement between stances in paired texts.

            "abstract": "Empathy describes the capacity to feel, understand, and emotionally engage with what other people are experiencing. People have recently started to turn to online health communities to seek empathetic support when they undergo difficult situations such as suffering from a life-threatening disease, while others are there to provide empathetic support to those who need it. It is, therefore, important to detect the direction of empathy expressed in natural language. Previous studies only focus on the presence of empathy at a high-level and do not distinguish the direction of empathy that is expressed in textual messages. In this paper, we take one step further in the identification of perceived empathy from text by introducing IEMPATHIZE, a dataset of messages annotated with the direction of empathy exchanged in an online cancer network. We analyze user messages to identify the direction of empathy at a fine-grained level: seeking or providing empathy. Our dataset IEMPATHIZE serves as a challenging benchmark for studying empathy at a fine-grained level.",

Precisely, we integrate Web search and classification in a unified approach to discover new homepages: first, we use publicly-available author names and research paper titles as queries to a Web search engine to find relevant content, and then we identify the correct homepages from the search results using a powerful deep learning classifier based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Moreover, we use Self-Training in order to reduce the labeling effort and to utilize the unlabeled data to train the efficient researcher homepage classifier. Our experiments on a large scale dataset highlight the effectiveness of our approach, and position Web search as an effective method for acquiring authors' homepages. We show the development and deployment of the proposed approach in CiteSeerX and the maintenance requirements.",
