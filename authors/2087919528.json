            "abstract": "Deciphering the intricate relationships between transcription factors (TFs), enhancers, and genes through the inference of enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks is crucial in understanding gene regulatory programs in a complex biological system. This study introduces STREAM, a novel method that leverages a Steiner Forest Problem model, a hybrid biclustering pipeline, and submodular optimization to infer enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks from jointly profiled single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. Compared to existing methods, STREAM demonstrates enhanced performance in terms of TF recovery, TF-enhancer relation prediction, and enhancer-gene discovery. Application of STREAM to an Alzheimer\u2019s disease dataset and a diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma dataset reveals its ability to identify TF-enhancer-gene relationships associated with pseudotime, as well as key TF-enhancer-gene relationships and TF cooperation underlying tumor cells.",

            "abstract": "High throughput spatial transcriptomics (HST) is a rapidly emerging class of experimental technologies that allow for profiling gene expression in tissue samples at or near single-cell resolution while retaining the spatial location of each sequencing unit within the tissue sample. Through analyzing HST data, we seek to identify sub-populations within a tissue sample that reflect distinct cell types or states. Existing methods either ignore the spatial heterogeneity in gene expression profiles, fail to account for important statistical features such as skewness, or are heuristic network-based clustering methods that lack the inferential benefits of statistical modeling. To address this gap, we develop SPRUCE: a Bayesian spatial multivariate finite mixture model based on multivariate skew-normal distributions, which is capable of identifying distinct cellular sub-populations in HST data. We further implement a novel combination of P\u00f3lya\u2013Gamma data augmentation and spatial random effects to infer spatially correlated mixture component membership probabilities without relying on approximate inference techniques. Via a simulation study, we demonstrate the detrimental inferential effects of ignoring skewness or spatial correlation in HST data. Using publicly available human brain HST data, SPRUCE outperforms existing methods in recovering expertly annotated brain layers. Finally, our application of SPRUCE to human breast cancer HST data indicates that SPRUCE can distinguish distinct cell populations within the tumor microenvironment.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Identifying cis-regulatory motifs from genomic sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq and CLIP-seq) is crucial in identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites and inferring gene regulatory mechanisms for any organism. Since 2015, deep learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to identify TF binding sites and predict motif patterns, with the strengths of offering a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for highly accurate predictions. As far as we know, 20 DL methods have been developed. However, without a clear and systematic assessment, users will struggle to choose the most appropriate tool for their specific studies. In this manuscript, we evaluated 20 DL methods for cis-regulatory motif prediction using 690 ENCODE ChIP-seq, 126 cancer ChIP-seq and 55 RNA CLIP-seq data. Four metrics were investigated, including the accuracy of motif finding, the performance of DNA/RNA sequence classification, algorithm scalability and tool usability. The assessment results demonstrated the high complementarity of the existing DL methods. It was determined that the most suitable model should primarily depend on the data size and type and the method\u2019s outputs.",

            "abstract": "Alternative transcription units (ATUs) are dynamically encoded under different conditions and display overlapping patterns (sharing one or more genes) under a specific condition in bacterial genomes. Genome-scale identification of ATUs is essential for studying the emergence of human diseases caused by bacterial organisms. However, it is unrealistic to identify all ATUs using experimental techniques because of the complexity and dynamic nature of ATUs. Here, we present the first-of-its-kind computational framework, named SeqATU, for genome-scale ATU prediction based on next-generation RNA-Seq data. The framework utilizes a convex quadratic programming model to seek an optimum expression combination of all of the to-be-identified ATUs. The predicted ATUs in Escherichia coli reached a precision of 0.77/0.74 and a recall of 0.75/0.76 in the two RNA-Sequencing datasets compared with the benchmarked ATUs from third-generation RNA-Seq data. In addition, the proportion of 5'- or 3'-end genes of the predicted ATUs, having documented transcription factor binding sites and transcription termination sites, was three times greater than that of no 5'- or 3'-end genes. We further evaluated the predicted ATUs by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analyses. The results suggested that gene pairs frequently encoded in the same ATUs are more functionally related than those that can belong to two distinct ATUs. Overall, these results demonstrated the high reliability of predicted ATUs. We expect that the new insights derived by SeqATU will not only improve the understanding of the transcription mechanism of bacteria but also guide the reconstruction of a genome-scale transcriptional regulatory network.",

Specifically, the investigation of functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand gene interactive networks and complex biological processes. QUBIC2 is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective tools for FGM identification from scRNA-Seq data. However, its limited availability to a C implementation restricted its application to only a few downstream analyses functionalities. We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (Integrative scRNA-Seq Interpretation System for Functional Gene Module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data. Empowered by QUBIC2, IRIS-FGM can effectively identify co-expressed and co-regulated FGMs, predict cell types/clusters, uncover differentially expressed genes, and perform functional enrichment analysis. It is noteworthy that IRIS-FGM can also takes Seurat objects as input, which facilitate easy integration with existing analysis pipeline. Availability and Implementation IRIS-FGM is implemented in R environment (as of version 3.6) with the source code freely available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/IRIS-FGM Contact qin.ma@osumc.edu Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Of interest, shifts of the relationships between microbes and their hosts or environments are associated with critical diseases and ecological changes. While advances in high-throughput Omics technologies offer a great opportunity for understanding the structures and functions of microbiome, it is still challenging to analyse and interpret the omics data. Specifically, the heterogeneity and diversity of microbial communities, compounded with the large size of the datasets, impose a tremendous challenge to mechanistically elucidate the complex communities. Fortunately, network analyses provide an efficient way to tackle this problem, and several network approaches have been proposed to improve this understanding recently. Here, we systemically illustrate these network theories that have been used in biological and biomedical research. Then, we review existing network modelling methods of microbial studies at multiple layers from metagenomics to metabolomics and further to multi-omics. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of present studies and provide a perspective for further directions in support of the understanding of microbial communities.",

            "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine is a prevalent RNA methylation modification, which plays an important role in various biological processes. Accurate identification of the m6A sites is fundamental to deeply understand the biological functions and mechanisms of the modification. However, the experimental methods for detecting m6A sites are usually time-consuming and expensive, and various computational methods have been developed to identify m6A sites in RNA. This paper proposes a novel cross-species computational method StackRAM using machine learning algorithms to identify the m6A sites in S. cerevisiae\u3001H. sapiens and A. thaliana. First, the RNA sequences features are extracted through binary encoding, chemical property, nucleotide frequency, k-mer nucleotide frequency, pseudo dinucleotide composition, and position-specific trinucleotide propensity, and the initial feature set is obtained by feature fusion. Secondly, the Elastic Net is used for the first time to filter redundant and noisy information and retain important features for m6A sites classification. Finally, the base-classifiers output probabilities are combined with the optimal feature subset corresponding to the Elastic Net, and the combination feature input the second-stage meta-classifier SVM. The jackknife test on training dataset S. cerevisiae indicates that the prediction performance of StackRAM is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods. StackRAM prediction accuracy for independent test datasets H. sapiens and A. thaliana reach 92.30% and 87.06%, respectively. Therefore, StackRAM has development potential in cross-species prediction and can be a useful method for identifying m6A sites.

            "abstract": "Proteins play a significant part in life processes such as cell growth, development, and reproduction. Exploring protein subcellular localization (SCL) is a direct way to better understand the function of proteins in cells. Studies have found that more and more proteins belong to multiple subcellular locations, and these proteins are called multi-label proteins. They not only play a key role in cell life activities, but also play an indispensable role in medicine and drug development. This article first presents a new prediction model, MpsLDA-ProSVM, to predict the SCL of multi-label proteins. Firstly, the physical and chemical information, evolution information, sequence information and annotation information of protein sequences are fused. Then, for the first time, use a weighted multi-label linear discriminant analysis framework based on entropy weight form (wMLDAe) to refine and purify features, reduce the difficulty of learning. Finally, input the optimal feature subset into the multi-label learning with label-specific features (LIFT) and multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-KNN) algorithms to obtain a synthetic ranking of relevant labels, and then use Prediction and Relevance Ordering based SVM (ProSVM) classifier to predict the SCLs. This method can rank and classify related tags at the same time, which greatly improves the efficiency of the model. Tested by jackknife method, the overall actual accuracy (OAA) on virus, plant, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria datasets are 98.06%, 98.97%, 99.81% and 98.49%, which are 0.56%-9.16%, 5.37%-30.87%, 3.51%-6.91% and 3.99%-8.59% higher than other advanced methods respectively.

            "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are of great importance to understand genetic mechanisms, disease pathogenesis, and guide drug design. With the increase of PPIs sequence data and development of machine learning, the prediction and identification of PPIs have become a research hotspot in proteomics. In this paper, we propose a new prediction pipeline for PPIs based on gradient tree boosting (GTB). First, the initial feature vector is extracted by fusing pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), pseudo-position-specific scoring matrix (PsePSSM), reduced sequence and index-vectors (RSIV) and autocorrelation descriptor (AD). Second, to remove redundancy and noise, we employ L1-regularized logistic regression to select an optimal feature subset. Finally, GTB-PPI model based on GTB is constructed. Five-fold cross-validation showed GTB-PPI achieved the accuracies of 95.15% and 90.47% on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Helicobacter pylori, respectively. In addition, GTB-PPI could be applied to predict Caenorhabditis elegans, Escherichia coli, Homo sapiens, and Mus musculus independent test sets, the one-core PPIs network for CD9, and the crossover PPIs network. The results show that GTB-PPI can significantly improve prediction accuracy of PPIs. The code and datasets of GTB-PPI can be downloaded from https://github.com/QUST-AIBBDRC/GTB-PPI/.",
