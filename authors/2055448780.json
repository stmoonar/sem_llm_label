            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust multilingual model to improve the quality of search results. Our model not only leverage the processed class-balanced dataset, but also benefit from multitask pre-training that leads to more general representations. In pre-training stage, we adopt mlm task, classification task and contrastive learning task to achieve considerably performance. In fine-tuning stage, we use confident learning, exponential moving average method (EMA), adversarial training (FGM) and regularized dropout strategy (R-Drop) to improve the model's generalization and robustness. Moreover, we use a multi-granular semantic unit to discover the queries and products textual metadata for enhancing the representation of the model. Our approach obtained competitive results and ranked top-8 in three tasks. We release the source code and pre-trained models associated with this work.",

            "abstract": "Result relevance prediction is an essential task of e-commerce search engines to boost the utility of search engines and ensure smooth user experience. The last few years eyewitnessed a flurry of research on the use of Transformer-style models and deep text-match models to improve relevance. However, these two types of models ignored the inherent bipartite network structures that are ubiquitous in e-commerce search logs, making these models ineffective. We propose in this paper a novel Second-order Relevance, which is fundamentally different from the previous First-order Relevance, to improve result relevance prediction. We design, for the first time, an end-to-end First-and-Second-order Relevance prediction model for e-commerce item relevance. The model is augmented by the neighborhood structures of bipartite networks that are built using the information of user behavioral feedback, including clicks and purchases. To ensure that edges accurately encode relevance information, we introduce external knowledge generated from BERT to refine the network of user behaviors. This allows the new model to integrate information from neighboring items and queries, which are highly relevant to the focus query-item pair under consideration. Results of offline experiments showed that the new model significantly improved the prediction accuracy in terms of human relevance judgment. An ablation study showed that the First-and-Second-order model gained a 4.3% average gain over the First-order model. Results of an online A/B test revealed that the new model derived more commercial benefits compared to the base model.",

Existing AGD detection solutions check the domains one by one based on the structural differences between AGD and benign ones, e.g., some AGD families show much more random character composition than legitimate ones. These methods can hardly deal with the newly emerged camouflage technology based AGD types, as each individual AGD seems benign in domain structure features of itself. In this work, the structural correlations among AGDs are analyzed and we find the inter-AGD correlation can be adopted for the AGD detection. We then propose DSQNet, a Domain SeQuence based Deep Neural Network AGD detection model, that simultaneously checks the domains in batch to take the inter-AGD correlation into consideration during the detection. Experiments on the public and real-world dataset show the superiority of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Generally, a few-shot distribution shift will lead to a poor generalization. Furthermore, while the number of instances of each class in the real world may significantly different, the existing few-shot classification methods are based on the assumption that the number of samples in each class is equal, which causes the trained classifier invalid. Moreover, through ResNet and WRN (Wide Residual Network) have achieved great success in the image processing field, the depth and width of CNNs constrain the conventional convolution layer performance. Thus, to overcome the above problems, the model of this paper proposes a novel few-shot classification model that uses learning balance variables to decide how much to learn from the imbalance dataset, which dynamically generates the convolution kernel based on each input. In our model, to extend the decision boundaries and enhance the class representations, this paper uses embedding propagation as a regularizer for manifold smoothing. Manifold smoothing can effectively solve the above problems of transductive learning. The interpolations between neural network features based on similarity graphs are used by embedding propagation. Experiments show that embedding propagation can produce a better embedding manifold and our model in standard few-shot datasets, such as miniImagenet, tieredImagenet, CUB has state-of-the-art results. It significantly outperforms the existing few-shot approaches, which consistently improves the accuracy of the models by about 11%.",

            "abstract": "Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.",

The question is analyzed by shielding invalid characters in this framework, and the TransE calculation of entities and relations is used to search answer, rather than traditional logical queries that rely heavily on predefined rules. In this way, the QA framework can be easily applied to different fields with little manual participation, and reduce the migration cost caused by the lack of scalability of the existing QA systems, which are designed only for specific domains. Then, the proposed framework is operated on the space launch knowledge graph and has achieved HITS@1, HITS@3, HITS@5 scores of 60.60%, 80.87%, 85.61% separately, which is competitive with other restricted domain knowledge graphs. In addition, numerical results on the knowledge graph of the Three Kingdoms and the COVID-19-Character verified the scalability of the QA framework.",

            "abstract": "The sparsity of data is one of the main reasons restricting the performance of recommender systems. In order to solve the sparsity problem, some recommender systems use auxiliary information, especially text information, as a supplement to increase the prediction accuracy of the ratings. However, the two mainstream approaches based on text analysis have some limitations. The bag-of-words-based model is one of them, being difficult to use the contextual information of the paragraph effectively so that only the shallow understanding of paragraph can be parsed. Another model based on deep learning can extract the contextual information of the paragraph, but it also increases the complexity of the model. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model named paragraph vector matrix factorization (P2VMF) which integrates the unsupervised learning of paragraph embeddings into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Therefore, P2VMF can capture the semantic information of the paragraph and can improve the prediction accuracy of the ratings. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the performance of the P2VMF model is preferable as compared with those multiple recommendation models in the situation, where the ratings are quite sparse. And we also verified that the P2V part of the model can well express the semantics in the form of vectors.",

Using MAP and p@k, we evaluate two state-of-the-art PU learning algorithms and the Rocchio classifier (Rc) for document ranking in the proposed framework. We then adopt the idea of ensemble learning to combine Rc with the two state-of-the-art PU learning algorithms respectively.

            "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of the internet, accurate prediction of user's online intent underlying their search queries has received increasing attention from online advertising community. This paper aims to address the major challenges with user queries in the context of behavioral targeting advertising by proposing a query enhancement mechanism that augments user's queries by leveraging a user query log. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that the authors' methodology for query enhancement achieves greater improvement than the baseline models in both intent-based user classification and user segmentation. Different from traditional user segmentation methods, which take little semantics of user behaviors into consideration, the authors propose a novel user segmentation strategy by incorporating the query enhancement mechanism with a topic model to mine the relationships between users and their behaviors in order to segment users in a semantic manner. Comparing with a classical clustering algorithm, K-means, the experimental results indicate that the proposed user segmentation strategy helps improve behavioral targeting effectiveness significantly. This paper also proposes an alternative to define user's search intent for the evaluation purpose, in the case that the dataset is sanitized. This approach automatically labels users in a click graph, which are then used in training an intent-based user classifier.",
