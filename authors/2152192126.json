            "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel paradigm for facial privacy protection that unifies multiple characteristics including anonymity, diversity, reversibility and security within a single lightweight framework. We name it PRO-Face S, short for Privacy-preserving Reversible Obfuscation of Face images via Secure flow-based model. In the framework, an Invertible Neural Network (INN) is utilized to process the input image along with its pre-obfuscated form, and generate the privacy protected image that visually approximates to the pre-obfuscated one, thus ensuring privacy. The pre-obfuscation applied can be in diversified form with different strengths and styles specified by users. Along protection, a secret key is injected into the network such that the original image can only be recovered from the protection image via the same model given the correct key provided. Two modes of image recovery are devised to deal with malicious recovery attempts in different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three public image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over multiple state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "title": "PRO-Face: A Generic Framework for Privacy-preserving Recognizable Obfuscation of Face Images",
            "abstract": "A number of applications (e.g., video surveillance and authentication) rely on automated face recognition to guarantee functioning of secure services, and meanwhile, have to take into account the privacy of individuals exposed under camera systems. This is the so-called Privacy-Utility trade-off. However, most existing approaches to facial privacy protection focus on removing identifiable visual information from images, leaving protected face unrecognizable to machine, which sacrifice utility for privacy. To tackle the privacy-utility challenge, we propose a novel, generic, effective, yet lightweight framework for Privacy-preserving Recognizable Obfuscation of Face images (named as PRO-Face). The framework allows one to first process a face image using any preferred obfuscation, such as image blur, pixelate and face morphing. It then leverages a Siamese network to fuse the original image with its obfuscated form, generating the final protected image visually similar to the obfuscated one from human perception (for privacy) but still recognized as the original identity by machine (for utility). The framework supports various obfuscations for facial anonymization. The face recognition can be performed accurately not only across anonymized images but also between plain and anonymized ones, based on only pre-trained recognizers. Those feature the \"generic\" merit of the proposed framework. In-depth objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both privacy protection and utility preservation under distinct scenarios. Our source code, models and any supplementary materials are made publicly available.",

However, concern on privacy has also been raised, due to not only mistakes or ignorance of impact of careless sharing but also complex infrastructures and cross-use of social media content. In this paper, we present secure JPEG Transmorphing, a flexible framework for protecting image visual privacy in a secure, reversible, fun and personalized manner. With secure JPEG Transmorphing, the protected image is also backwards compatible with JPEG, the most commonly used image format. Experiments have been performed and results show that the proposed method provides a near lossless image reconstruction, a controllable level of storage overhead, and a good degree of privacy protection and subjective pleasantness.",

            "abstract": "Various image editing tools make our pictures more attractive, and at the same time, evoke different emotional responses. With powerful and easy-to-use imaging applications, capturing, editing and then sharing pictures have become daily life for many. This paper investigates the influence of several image manipulations on evoked emotions for different types of images. To do so, various types of images clustered in different categories, were collected from Instagram and subjective evaluations were conducted via crowdsourcing to gather the emotional responses on different manipulations as perceived by subjects. Evaluation results show that certain image manipulations can induce different evoked emotions on transformed pictures when compared to the original ones. However, such changes in image emotions due to manipulation are highly content dependent. Then, we conducted a machine learning based experiment, in attempt to predict the emotions of a manipulated image given its original version and the desired manipulation method. Experimental results present a promising performance of such a prediction model, which could pave the road to automatic selection or recommendation of image editing tools that can efficiently transform or emphasize desired emotions in pictures.",

            "title": "Privacy-Friendly Photo Sharing and Relevant Applications Beyond",
            "abstract": "Popularization of online photo sharing brings people great convenience, but has also raised concerns for privacy. Researchers proposed various approaches to enable image privacy, most of which focus on encrypting or distorting image visual content. In this thesis, we investigate novel solutions to protect image privacy with a particular emphasis on online photo sharing. To this end, we propose not only algorithms to protect visual privacy in image content but also design of architectures for privacy-preserving photo sharing. Beyond privacy, we also explore additional impacts and potentials of employing daily images in other three relevant applications. First, we propose and study two image encoding algorithms to protect visual content in image, within a Secure JPEG framework. The first method scrambles a JPEG image by randomly changing the signs of its DCT coefficients based on a secret key. The second method, named JPEG Transmorphing, allows one to protect arbitrary image regions with any obfuscation, while secretly preserving the original image regions in application segments of the obfuscated JPEG image. Performance evaluations reveal a good degree of storage overhead and privacy protection capability for both methods, and particularly a good level of pleasantness for JPEG Transmorphing, if proper manipulations are applied. Second, we investigate the design of two architectures for privacy-preserving photo sharing. The first architecture, named ProShare, is built on a public key infrastructure (PKI) integrated with a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), to enable the secure and efficient access to user-posted photos protected by Secure JPEG. The second architecture is named ProShare S, in which a photo sharing service provider helps users make photo sharing decisions automatically based on their past decisions using machine learning. The photo sharing service analyzes not only the content of a user'\u0080\u0099s photo, but also context information about the image capture and a prospective requester, and finally makes decision whether or not to share a particular photo to the requester, and if yes, at which granularity. A user study along with extensive evaluations were performed to validate the proposed architecture. In the end, we research into three relevant topics in regard to daily photos captured or shared by people, but beyond their privacy implications. In the first study, inspired by JPEG Transmorphing, we propose an animated JPEG file format, named aJPEG. aJPEG preserves its animation frames as application markers in a JPEG image and provides smaller file size and better image quality than conventional GIF. In the second study, we attempt to understand the impact of popular image manipulations applied in online photo sharing on evoked emotions of observers. The study reveals that image manipulations indeed influence people'\u0080\u0099s emotion, but such impact also depends on the image content. In the last study, we employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), the GoogLeNet model, to perform automatic food image detection and categorization. The promising results obtained provide meaningful insights in design of automatic dietary assessment system based on multimedia techniques, e.g. image analysis.",

An unprecedented number of photos are being uploaded and shared everyday through online social networks or photo hosting services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Flickr.

Popular OSNs typically offer privacy protection solutions only in response to the public demand and therefore are often rudimental, complex to use, and provide limited degree of control and protection.

In contrast, in this paper, we present a JPEG transmorphing algorithm, which converts an image to its processed version while preserving sufficient information about the original image in the processed image. It does this by inserting partial information about the original image in the application markers of the processed JPEG image file, so that the original image can be later recovered.
