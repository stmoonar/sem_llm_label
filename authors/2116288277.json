            "abstract": "Sound decision-making relies on accurate prediction for tangible outcomes ranging from military conflict to disease outbreaks. To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts. The system provides a platform where users can interact with machine models and thus anchor their judgments on an objective",

            "abstract": "While the similarity between two concept words has been evaluated and studied for decades, much less attention has been devoted to algorithms that can compute the similarity of nodes in very large knowledge graphs, like Wikidata. To facilitate investigations and head-to-head comparisons of similarity algorithms on Wikidata, we present a user-friendly interface that allows flexible computation of similarity between Qnodes in Wikidata. At present, the similarity interface supports four algorithms, based on: graph embeddings (TransE, ComplEx), text embeddings (BERT), and class-based similarity. We demonstrate the behavior of the algorithms on representative examples about semantically similar, related, and entirely unrelated entity pairs. To support anticipated applications that require efficient similarity computations, like entity linking and recommendation, we also provide a REST API that can compute most similar neighbors for any Qnode in Wikidata.",

            "abstract": ". An increasing amount of data is shared on the Web through heterogeneous spreadsheets and CSV \ufb01les. In order to homogenize and query these data, the scienti\ufb01c community has developed Extract, Trans-form and Load (ETL) tools and services that help making these \ufb01les machine readable in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, tabular data may be complex; and the level of expertise required by existing ETL tools makes it di\ufb03cult for users to describe their own data. In this paper we propose a simple annotation schema to guide users when transforming complex tables into KGs. We have implemented our approach by extending T2WML, a table annotation tool designed to help users annotate their data and upload the results to a public KG. We have evaluated our e\ufb00ort with six non-expert users, obtaining promising preliminary results.",

Our efforts were split into a Candidate Generation and a Candidate Selection phase. The former involves searching for relevant entities in knowledge bases, while the latter involves picking the top candidate using various techniques such as heuristics (the \u2018TF-IDF\u2019 approach) and machine learning (the Neural Network Ranking model). We achieve an F1 score of 0.826 without any training data on the 400000+ cells to be annotated in Round 2 CEA challenge. On CTA and CPA variants, we score 1.099 and 0.790 respectively.",
