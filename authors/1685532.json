            "abstract": "We consider the problem of all-or-nothing resource allocation for tasks with diverse resource demands in resource-constrained heterogeneous systems. We observed that allocation approaches based on max-min fairness or admission control, despite their desirable properties, may fall short of satisfying task demands and utilizing the full potential of the heterogeneous system. This becomes particularly clear in high-demand scenarios where certain resource types may be insufficient to satisfy all task demands. We present Pricefair, a new all-or-nothing resource allocation mechanism for task demands in heterogeneous systems. The key contribution of Pricefair lies in its approach to high-demand scenarios when specific types of resources are exhausted. Rather than denying those tasks, Pricefair tries to allocate the surplus of that type of resource to less-loaded, better-performing, although more expensive, nodes in the cluster. In such instances, to maintain fairness, Pricefair employs a dynamic pricing model. By using the concept of price parity, Pricefair ensures that all users with resources in the exhausted tiers share the price increase and pay proportionally based on their resource requests. Through our experimental evaluation in realistic, high-demand scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of Pricefair.",

            "abstract": "The radical advances in mobile computing, the IoT technological evolution along with cyberphysical components (e.g., sensors, actuators, control centers) have led to the development of smart city applications that generate raw or preprocessed data, enabling workflows involving the city to better sense the urban environment and support citizens\u2019 everyday lives. Recently, a new era of Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) infrastructures has emerged to support smart city applications that aim to address the challenges raised due to the spatio-temporal dynamics of the urban crowd as well as bring scalability and on-demand computing capacity to urban system applications for timely response. In these, resource capabilities are distributed at the edge of the network and in close proximity to end-users, making it possible to perform computation and data processing at the network edge. However, there are important challenges related to real-time execution, not only due to the highly dynamic and transient crowd, the bursty and highly unpredictable amount of requests but also due to the resource constraints imposed by the Mobile Edge Cloud environment. In this paper, we present TIMBER, our framework for efficiently supporting mobile daTa processing pIpelines in MoBile cloud EnviRonments that effectively addresses the aforementioned challenges. Our detailed experimental results illustrate that our approach can reduce the operating costs by 66.245% on average and achieve up to 96.4% similar throughput performance for agnostic workloads.",

            "abstract": "The imminent need to interpret the output of a Machine Learning model with counterfactual (CF) explanations - via small perturbations to the input \u2013 has been notable in the research community. Although the variety of CF examples is important, the aspect of them being feasible at the same time, does not necessarily apply in their entirety. This work uses different benchmark datasets to examine through the preservation of the logical causal relations of their attributes, whether CF examples can be generated after a small amount of changes to the original input, be feasible and actually useful to the enduser in a real-world case. To achieve this, we used a black box model as a classifier, to distinguish the desired from the input class and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate feasible CF examples. As an extension, we also extracted two-dimensional manifolds (one for each dataset) that located the majority of the feasible examples, a representation that adequately distinguished them from infeasible ones. For our experimentation we used three commonly used datasets and we managed to generate feasible and at the same time sparse, CF examples that satisfy all possible predefined causal constraints, by confirming their importance with the attributes in a dataset.",

            "abstract": "Serverless computing, also referred to as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), is a cloud computing model that has attracted significant attention and has been widely adopted in recent years. The serverless computing model offers an intuitive, event-based interface that makes the development and deployment of scalable cloud-based applications easier and cost-effective. An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems is their energy consumption during the application execution. One way to deal with this issue is to schedule the function invocations in an energy-efficient way. However, efficient scheduling of applications in a multi-tenant environment, like FaaS systems, poses significant challenges. The trade-off between the server\u2019s energy usage and the hosted functions\u2019 performance requirements needs to be taken into consideration. In this work, we propose an Energy Efficient Scheduler for orchestrating the execution of serverless functions so that it minimizes energy consumption while it satisfies the applications\u2019 performance demands. Our approach considers real-time performance measurements and historical data and applies a novel DVFS technique to minimize energy consumption. Our detailed experimental evaluation using realistic workloads on our local cluster illustrates the working and benefits of our approach.",

            "abstract": "The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is a reference venue for scientists and practitioners whose research interests focus on self-organization, autonomic computing, resilience, decentralized behavior, and self-adaptation. ACSOS is the merger of two well-established IEEE conferences: the International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC), which counted 16 editions before the merge, and the International Conference on Self-adaptive and Self-Organising Systems (SASO), which had 13 editions. It provides a forum to share and present their experiences, discuss challenges, and report state-of-theart research in all areas related to autonomic computing, self-adaptation, and self-organization. ACSOS unified the two communities and continued along the path traced by its successful predecessors. The 2nd IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS 2021), originally planned to be held in Washington, D.C., was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the conference received 56 high-quality paper submissions from around the globe, of which 14 were accepted as full papers, resulting in an acceptance rate of 25%, akin to previous editions of SASO and ICAC and similar to the first edition of ACSOS. This special issue contains extended versions of the four best papers presented at ACSOS 2021, selected based on the score obtained by at least four reviewers, the quality of their presentation, and the involvement and discussion they generated during the conference.",

Our responsibility as a community is to ensure that attendees of DB conferences feel included, irrespective of their scientific perspective and personal background. One of the first steps was to establish the role of the DEI chairs at DB Conferences, with the DEI team dedicated to providing leadership to help our community achieve this goal. In this leadership role, the DEI team is advising DEI chairs at DB conferences, serving as a memory of DEI events at conferences, building an agreed-upon vision, and committing to working together to devise a set of measures for achieving DEI. That is pursued via actions led by our core members (Figure 1) and liaisons of individual executive bodies (Figure 2): REACH OUT collects data and experiences from our community. INCLUDE monitors and recommends inclusion efforts. ORGANIZE focuses on in-conference organization efforts, such as adopting a code of conduct. INFORM communicates through various channels. SUPPORT coordinates DEI support from executive bodies and sponsors. SCOUT collates DEI efforts from other communities. COORDINATE manages all actions. Two new actions: MEDIA preserves and disseminates the digital media produced by DEI@DB events. ETHICS establishes and promotes ethics guidelines for publications in our community.",

            "abstract": "In recent years Serverless Computing has emerged as a compelling cloud based model for the development of a wide range of data-intensive applications. However, rapid container provisioning introduces non-trivial challenges for FaaS cloud providers, as (i) real-world FaaS workloads may exhibit highly dynamic request patterns, (ii) applications have service-level objectives (SLOs) that must be met, and (iii) container provisioning can be a costly process. In this paper, we present SLOPE, a prediction framework for serverless FaaS platforms to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, it trains a neural network model that utilizes knowledge from past runs in order to estimate the number of instances required to satisfy the invocation rate requirements of the serverless applications. In cases that a priori knowledge is not available, SLOPE makes predictions using a graph edit distance approach to capture the similarities among serverless applications. Our experimental results illustrate the efficiency and benefits of our approach, which can reduce the operating costs by 66.25% on average.",

The serverless computing model provides an intuitive interface for developing cloud-based applications, where the development and deployment of scalable microservices has become easier and cost-effective. An increasing number of batch-processing applications are deployed as pipelines that comprise a sequence of functions that must meet their deadline targets to be practical. In this paper, we present our Hybrid Cloud Scheduler (HCS) for orchestrating the execution of serverless batch-processing pipelines deployed over heterogeneous infrastructures. Our framework enables developers to (i) automatically schedule and execute batch-processing applications in heterogeneous environments such as the private edge and public cloud serverless infrastructures, (ii) benefit from cost reduction through the utilization of their own resources in a private cluster, and (iii) significantly improves the probability of meeting the deadline requirements of their applications. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and benefits of our approach.",

The serverless computing model offers an intuitive, event-based interface for developing cloud-based applications, that makes the writing and deployment of scalable microservices easier and cost-effective. Existing orchestrators in serverless systems are mainly designed for short-lived functions. Nevertheless, an increasing number of applications are deployed as pipelines that comprise a sequence of functions that execute in a specific order or pattern and must meet a wide range of throughput and latency targets to be practical. In this paper, we present AMESoS, our scalable and elastic framework for latency-sensitive streaming pipelines. AMESoS (i) enables developers to build predictable pipelines that meet their latency demands, (ii) employs prediction to proactively estimate the most appropriate number of active replicas needed for each function in the pipeline, and (iii) dynamically scales the number of replicas for each pipeline's functions in the presence of overloads. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and benefits of our approach over state of the art systems.",
