            "abstract": "Identifying the places an infected person has visited during a virus incubation time in order to conduct contact tracing is currently done using manual interviews since proximity-based contact tracing methods do not store geolocation information due to privacy concerns. During the incubation time, an infected person might visit several locations and either forget where they went or are reluctant to disclose their trip details. To minimize manual location tracing while preserving the user's privacy, the authors propose a mesh block sequence method where the trajectories are transformed into a mesh block sequence before being shared with health authorities. These simulations show that this a useful method by which to protect user privacy by concealing specific details related to a trajectory. While this simulation uses an Australian administrative region structure, this method is applicable in countries which implement similar administrative hierarchical building blocks.",

            "title": "Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Framework With an Autoencoder for Fault Detection in Manufacturing Predictive Maintenance",
            "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables intelligent predictive maintenance in smart manufacturing by incorporating IoT technologies, Big Data techniques, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other ever-developing enabling technologies. Although a large body of research has been conducted on IIoT based predictive maintenance, most work focuses on addressing only a part of the problem. However, predictive maintenance involves an ecosystem from ingesting data from sensors to displaying the results on a dashboard for engineers to visualize. With increasing requirements for real-time responses and privacy, integrating edge computing is no doubt a promising trend. This article proposes a complete and optimized IoT Big Data ecosystem embedded into a three-layer architecture for predictive maintenance applications. The proposed architecture consists of an edge layer, a cloud layer, and an application layer. The proposed edge infrastructure distributes the tasks effectively between the cloud layer and edge layer. On top of the architecture, different layers are integrated seamlessly to address reliability and scalability issues. In addition, an edge computing-assisted autoencoder is introduced and enabled by being deployed in a distributed manner to improve both performance and efficiency. For practical interest, we also provide an application programming interface-oriented implementation guideline for readers. To verify the proposed ecosystem, a real case study from industry is conducted to demonstrate the performance gain of edge computing-based Internet of Things systems in conjunction with the autoencoder-based deep learning technique.",

            "abstract": "With the recent advances of the Internet of Things (IoT), innovative techniques, and concepts have emerged, such as digital twins and industrial 4.0. As one of the essential parts of a digital twin, IoT-based smart predictive maintenance (IoT-SPM) is a key enabling technology for smart manufacturing. This article introduces digital twins and their relationship to IoT-SPM and proposes a reference IoT-SPM, aiming to provide a comprehensive and systematic outlook for the IoT-SPM field. Thus, it can be used as a guide map for interested readers. To give a complete picture of the IoT-SPM ecosystem in industrial 4.0 systems, this article conducts an analysis from multiview perspectives, starting with the architecture, followed by platforms and component. The key components or requirements of an IoT-SPM ecosystem are identified and outlined, including the IoT and cyber\u2013physical system (CPS) as the cornerstone technologies, IoT monitoring data as the base, big data platforms as the backbone, an upgraded computing paradigm as the catalyst, and machine learning-based data analysis as the main processor. This article also focuses on the issues surrounding IoT data when applying analytic models to a real-world industrial IoT system. Then, the current progresses relating IoT and IoT-SPM are depicted, and a research gap on IoT data quality is identified. In particular, regarding the identified IoT data quality problems, this article qualitatively evaluates and discusses the existing solutions. These discussions lead to several open research issues and future directions.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of Industry 4.0 and the rapid advances in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have provided manufacturers with the ability to remotely monitor the process by deploying automatic fault detection in an IoT-based predictive maintenance system. However, the monitoring targets are now manufacturing plant-wide instead of being just a local area. Multiple types of faults are involved and the conventional centralized cloud computing-based IoT solutions always lead to a heavy burden on the network bandwidth due to the large amount of sensor data collected frequently that has to be transmitted to the central server and this leads to poor response time for the monitoring system. To address this problem, this article develops an artificial intelligence-assisted distributed system for manufacturing plant-wide predictive maintenance applications. The developed distributed system relies on the feature selection technique to identity an optimal feature subset for each type of fault and is enabled by deploying each independent model built on the obtained feature subset into different edge nodes. The distributed approach enables the data to be processed near the sensors, requiring less data to be transmitted to the central cloud server reducing network delay and delivering more accurate results. In addition, our proposed feature selection approach is especially designed to accommodate the characteristics of IIoT data such as the lack of labels. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the widely used public Tennessee Eastman dataset.",

Existing theories demonstrate that to facilitate inclusion, multiple types of exclusionary dynamics, such as self-segregation, communication apprehension, and stereotyping and stigmatizing, must be overcome [11]. A diverse group of people tends to surface different perspectives, which help to understand and address D&I. Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",

            "abstract": "In recent years many user-oriented and personalized computing technologies have been developed, in which users are immersed in a virtual world and surrounded by processing units. Such computing technologies require distributed signals to be collected, and perform intelligent analysis with data fusion depending on user preferences and the surrounding environment. In such human-oriented analysis, it is also necessary to consider different user preferences and even behavioral factors, that influence the final computing results. Development of user-oriented computing approaches are especially apparent in virtual reality and interactive technologies, multimedia, and decision-making systems, as well as user-oriented security protocols. Such human-oriented protocols allow the intelligent analysis of a great amount of information, perform analytics processes, extract meaning and manage systems in a secure manner. These subjects, as well as a number of others, such as personalized protocols for data analysis and security, computing approaches based on behavioral or perceptual factors, and bio-inspired technologies for knowledge extraction, will form the topics of this Special Issue on \u201cHuman oriented solutions for intelligent analysis, multimedia and communication systems\u201d in the journal Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience. For this Special Issue eleven articles of particular interest were selected, which present the most interesting research activities and results within the subject matter of this special issue. The article \u201cTowards human oriented solutions for deep semantic data analysis\u201d by Ogiela and Snasel,1 presents novel solutions for efficient semantic analysis of data on the basis of cognitive reasoning and an assessment of marketing preferences registered in the course of the human perception process. Obtaining information from data on the basis of its interpreted meaning, with a view to determine individual preferences, makes it possible to designate the set of features on whose occurrence (or absence) attention is focused and those features whose occurrence has an impact on \u2018interest\u2019 within a given piece of information, product, service, and so forth. The approach presented is based on application of cognitive resonance processes implemented in cognitive information systems. The article entitled \u201cA method to generate context information sets from analysis results with a unified abstraction model based on an extension of data enrichment scheme\u201d by Park et al.2 presents studies on a method for processing analysis modules that can enrich result datasets with context information based on a data abstraction model. Data abstraction provides not only capabilities for context-aware systems and users to inspect the context at four levels from raw datasets to situational relationships, but also supports unified context levels for each entity that can be deployed at any location where systems deal with context to provide dedicated services. The article \u201cCustomer-oriented sales modeling strategy in a big data environment\u201d by Chen et al.3 presents a new idea for a data mining technology application in business services. Different factors are analyzed, which may affect the profit of shopping malls in a big data environment and the most critical factors are found by data mining technology. This allows different sales promotion strategies to be provided for merchants to facilitate the expansion of sales. In management, small profits and quick returns is a popular sales strategy used by many shopping malls to increase turnover. The article \u201cAn online cognitive authentication and trust evaluation application programming interface for cognitive security gateway based on distributed massive Internet of Things network\u201d by Chen et al.4 presents a new online cognitive authentication and trust evaluation API for CSG based on distributed massive IoT network. An online identity generation API is proposed, together with the modified EPC Class 1 Gen2 tag translator which is used to create both provider\u2019s as well as client\u2019s online identities. The article entitled \u201cDealing with Noise in Crowdsourced GPS Human Trajectory Logging Data\u201d by Adhinugraha et al.5 presents new solutions for classifying the noise that might be found from public GPS traces. More than 5300 trajectories that started in the state of Victoria, Australia, were considered, and noise was classified into four types: spike noise, point noise, track noise, and logical noise. The authors tested the behavior of noise when processed with convex hull-based non-map-matching preprocessing methods to reduce spikes, followed by granularity reduction to reduce point density. In the article \u201cAn Effective Architecture of Digital Twin System to Support Human Decision Making and AI-Driven Autonomy\u201d by Mostafa et al.6 a data analytic maturity model is presented, which consists of four phases with ordered activities. It shows that any data analytic project needs to be gradually developed from foundations to powerful AI algorithms. The effort and time spent on a routine will create an exponential increase in business value. The digital twin starts in phase two which immediately follows the event that the big data infrastructure is established. It is started by shallowly replicating the characteristics, features and states of its physical twin, and then dives deeper to copy its behaviors, which is achieved by AI technologies, typically machine learning models.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues.",

            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) are terms which have driven the fourth industrial revolution. The digital revolution has transformed the manufacturing industry into smart manufacturing through the development of intelligent systems. In this paper, a big data ecosystem is presented for the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis in predictive maintenance with real industrial big data gathered directly from large-scale global manufacturing plants, aiming to provide a complete architecture which could be used in industrial IoT-based smart manufacturing in an industrial 4.0 system. The proposed architecture overcomes multiple challenges including big data ingestion, integration, transformation, storage, analytics, and visualization in a real-time environment using various technologies such as the data lake, NoSQL database, Apache Spark, Apache Drill, Apache Hive, OPC Collector, and other techniques. Transformation protocols, authentication, and data encryption methods are also utilized to address data and network security issues. A MapReduce-based distributed PCA model is designed for fault detection and diagnosis. In a large-scale manufacturing system, not all kinds of failure data are accessible, and the absence of labels precludes all the supervised methods in the predictive phase. Furthermore, the proposed framework takes advantage of some of the characteristics of PCA such as its ease of implementation on Spark, its simple algorithmic structure, and its real-time processing ability. All these elements are essential for smart manufacturing in the evolution to Industry 4.0. The proposed detection system has been implemented into the real-time industrial production system in a cooperated company, running for several years, and the results successfully provide an alarm warning several days before the fault happens. A test case involving several outages in 2014 is reported and analyzed in detail during the experiment section.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to enhance manufacturing and industrial processes allows data analysts to address significant problems such as predictive maintenance. For the purpose of accurate data analysis, cleansing noisy sensor data is one of the most fundamental and necessary steps. Without first removing the noise, the anomaly detection techniques are likely to give a large number of false positives. However, using traditional outlier detection methods directly for such analysis are not appropriate as both noise and significant anomalies might exist in the sensor data. This article introduces the new challenges and proposes a novel solution to address the issue of removing noise while preserving anomalies in the IIoT Data. It proposes an approach that measures both the rate of change and deviation to compute the noise score. It employs a sliding window technique to define the analysis unit of the contrast measure which is used in conjunction with statistical techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art noise detection methods, providing a clean data set that preserves the anomalies on which one can effectively apply anomaly detection techniques.",

            "title": "Missing Value Imputation for Industrial IoT Sensor Data With Large Gaps",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-oriented smart manufacturing has become a prominent solution in realizing evolutional digital transformation. Missing data are one of the biggest problems for data preprocessing in an IoT architecture, and it is crucial that missing values are recovered to improve the reliability of monitoring applications. However, due to the high-frequency collection of sensor data, missing data in IoT bring new challenges. Several methods have been developed to recover missing IoT data by utilizing data from sensors that are geographically close to the sensor which is responsible for the missing data, or from sensors which provide data that are highly correlated to the missing data. In IoT systems, because of the transmission of a large volume of data over networks, common mode failures need to be considered where a single event can lead to the loss of data from a large number of sensors. In this situation, it would be infeasible to recover missing data from other sensors. To address this issue, in this article, we focus on missing data imputation for large gaps in univariate time-series data and propose an iterative framework using multiple segmented gap iteration called Itr-MS-STLecImp to provide the most appropriate values. The gap is first segmented into several pieces to initialize the missing value imputation process and then, we iteratively run gap reconstruction and gap concatenation to obtain the final imputation results. We validate the proposed approach using sensor data collected from real manufacturing plants in Australia and the comparison results show that the proposed Itr-MS-STLecImp outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of root-mean-square error. Under different gap-length conditions, the proposed approach consistently reduces the error rate more than the baseline algorithm, and the error reduction is greater when the lengths of the gaps increase, indicating that the performance is significantly improved. These analysis results further prove the effectiveness of the multiple segmentation of missing gaps and the iteration operation.",
