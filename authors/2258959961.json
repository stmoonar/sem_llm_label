            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which obtain node embeddings by attribute propagates along graph topology, exhibit significant power in graph-structured data mining. However, graphs in the real world are usually text-rich, where the text can not only be represented as node attributes, but also contains valuable objective semantic structures. Moreover, the graph topology also exhibits complex subjective semantic structures, especially the heterophily where nodes from different classes are prone to build connections, making existing GNNs that work under the assumption of homophily incapable to realize generalization. To tackle aforementioned limitations, we design a new text-rich graph neural network from a unified perspective, namely SO-GNN. It can effectively enhance the expressive power of GNNs by modeling the implicit but informative subjective-objective semantics underlying the text-rich graphs. Specifically, we first introduce a new constrained Markov matrix with well-defined probabilistic diffusion dynamics to guide information propagation, where the neighbors are more appropriate and indicative in providing both local and global subjective semantics. We then construct a flexible heterogeneous text graph to gain a deeper insight into objective semantics, providing indispensable information for learning node embedding. Finally, we unite subjective and objective semantics in an end-to-end manner, so that the model can fully utilize the most relevant information for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments across various text-rich graphs with low-to-high homophily demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed SO-GNN over state-of-the-arts.",

            "title": "Graph Contrastive Learning Reimagined: Exploring Universality",
            "abstract": "Real-world graphs exhibit diverse structures, including homophilic and heterophilic patterns, necessitating the development of a universal Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) framework. Nonetheless, the existing GCLs, especially those with a local focus, lack universality due to the mismatch between the input graph structure and the homophily assumption for two primary components of GCLs. Firstly, the encoder, commonly Graph Convolution Network (GCN), operates as a low-pass filter, which assumes the input graph to be homophilic. This makes it challenging to aggregate features from neighbor nodes of the same class on heterophilic graphs. Secondly, the local positive sampling regards neighbor nodes as positive samples, which is inspired by the homophily assumption. This results in feature similarity amplification for the samples from the different classes (i.e., FALSE positive samples). Therefore, it is crucial to feed the encoder and positive sampling of GCLs with homophilic graph structures. This paper presents a novel GCL framework, named gRaph cOntraStive Exploring uNiversality (ROSEN), designed to achieve this objective. Specifically, ROSEN equips a local graph structure inference module, utilizing the Block Diagonal Property (BDP) of the affinity matrix extracted from node ego networks. This module can generate the homophilic graph structure by selectively removing disassortative edges. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness and universality of ROSEN across node classification and node clustering tasks.",

            "abstract": "To make Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) meet the requirements of the Web, the universality and the generalization become two important research directions. On one hand, many universal GNNs are presented for semi-supervised tasks on both homophilic and non-homophilic graphs by distinguishing homophilic and heterophilic edges with the help of labels. On the other hand, self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms on graphs are presented by leveraging the self-supervised learning schemes from computer vision and natural language processing. Unfortunately, graph universal self-supervised learning remains resolved. Most existing SSL methods on graphs, which often employ two-layer GCN as the encoder and train the mapping functions, can't alter the low-passing filtering characteristic of GCN. Therefore, to be universal, SSL must becustomized for the graph, i.e., learning the graph. However, learning the graph via universal GNNs is disabled in SSL, since their distinguishability on homophilic and heterophilic edges disappears without the labels. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes novel GrAph-customized Universal Self-Supervised Learning (GAUSS) by exploiting local attribute distribution. The main idea is to replace the global parameters with locally learnable propagation. To make the propagation matrix demonstrate the affinity between the nodes, the self-representative learning framework is employed with k-block diagonal regularization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness, universality and robustness to noises.",

            "abstract": "Most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) follow the message-passing scheme. Residual connection is an effective strategy to tackle GNNs' over-smoothing issue and performance reduction issue on non-homophilic networks. Unfortunately, the coarse-grained residual connection still suffers from class-imbalanced over-smoothing issue, due to the fixed and linear combination of topology and attribute in node representation learning. To make the combination flexible to capture complicated relationship, this paper reveals that the residual connection needs to be node-dependent, layer-dependent, and related to both topology and attribute. To alleviate the difficulty in specifying complicated relationship, this paper presents a novel perspective on GNNs, i.e., the representations of one node in different layers can be seen as a sequence of states. From this perspective, existing residual connections are not flexible enough for sequence modeling. Therefore, a novel node-dependent residual connection, i.e., Long Short-Term Graph Memory Network (LSTGM) is proposed to employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model the sequence of node representation. To make the graph topology fully employed, LSTGM innovatively enhances the updated memory and three gates with graph topology. A speedup version is also proposed for effective training. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness in preventing over-smoothing issue and handling networks with heterophily.",
