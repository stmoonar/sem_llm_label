            "title": "Brain Storm Optimization based Swarm Learning for Diabetic Retinopathy Image Classification",
            "abstract": "The application of deep learning techniques to medical problems has garnered widespread research interest in recent years, such as applying convolutional neural networks to medical image classification tasks. However, data in the medical field is often highly private, preventing different hospitals from sharing data to train an accurate model. Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving machine learning architecture, has shown promising performance in balancing data privacy and model utility by keeping private data on the client's side and using a central server to coordinate a set of clients for model training through aggregating their uploaded model parameters. Yet, this architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party server, which is challenging to achieve in real life. Swarm learning, as a specialized decentralized federated learning architecture that does not require a central server, utilizes blockchain technology to enable direct parameter exchanges between clients. However, the mining of blocks requires significant computational resources, limiting its scalability. To address this issue, this paper integrates the brain storm optimization algorithm into the swarm learning framework, named BSO-SL. This approach clusters similar clients into different groups based on their model distributions. Additionally, leveraging the architecture of BSO, clients are given the probability to engage in collaborative learning both within their cluster and with clients outside their cluster, preventing the model from converging to local optima. The proposed method has been validated on a real-world diabetic retinopathy image classification dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

            "title": "Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning for On-Device Recommendation",
            "abstract": "To address privacy concerns and reduce network latency, there has been a recent trend of compressing cumbersome recommendation models trained on the cloud and deploying compact recommender models to resource-limited devices for the real-time recommendation. Existing solutions generally overlook device heterogeneity and user heterogeneity. They require devices with the same budget to share the same model and assume the available device resources (e.g., memory) are constant, which is not reflective of reality. Considering device and user heterogeneities as well as dynamic resource constraints, this article proposes a Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning framework (PEEL) for the on-device recommendation, which generates Personalized Elastic Embeddings (PEEs) for devices with various memory budgets in a once-for-all manner, adapting to new or dynamic budgets, and addressing user preference diversity by assigning personalized embeddings for different groups of users. Specifically, it pretrains a global embedding table with collected user-item interaction instances and clusters users into groups. Then, it refines the embedding tables with local interaction instances within each group. PEEs are generated from the group-wise embedding blocks and their weights that indicate the contribution of each embedding block to the local recommendation performance. Given a memory budget, PEEL efficiently generates PEEs by selecting embedding blocks with the largest weights, making it adaptable to dynamic memory budgets on devices. Furthermore, a diversity-driven regularizer is implemented to encourage the expressiveness of embedding blocks, and a controller is utilized to optimize the weights. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, and the results show that PEEL yields superior performance on devices with heterogeneous and dynamic memory budgets.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the nature of privacy protection, feder-ated recommender systems (FedRecs) have garnered increasing interest in the realm of on-device recommender systems. However, most existing FedRecs only allow participating clients to collaboratively train a recommendation model of the same public parameter size. Training a model of the same size for all clients can lead to suboptimal performance since clients possess varying resources. For example, clients with limited training data may prefer to train a smaller recommendation model to avoid excessive data consumption, while clients with sufficient data would benefit from a larger model to achieve higher recommendation accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper introduces HeteFedRec, a novel FedRec framework that enables the assignment of personalized model sizes to partici-pants. Specifically, we present a heterogeneous recommendation model aggregation strategy, including a unified dual-task learning mechanism and a dimensional decorrelation regularization, to allow knowledge aggregation among recommender models of different sizes. Additionally, a relation-based ensemble knowledge distillation method is proposed to effectively distil knowledge from heterogeneous item embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HeteFedRec in training federated recommender systems under heterogeneous settings.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems are typically trained based on personal interaction data (e.g., clicks and purchases) that could be naturally represented as ego graphs. However, most existing recommendation methods collect these ego graphs from all users to compose a global graph to obtain high-order collaborative information between users and items, and these centralized CF recommendation methods inevitably lead to a high risk of user privacy leakage. Although recently proposed federated recommendation systems can mitigate the privacy problem, they either restrict the on-device local training to an isolated ego graph or rely on an additional third-party server to access other ego graphs resulting in a cumbersome pipeline, which is hard to work in practice. In addition, existing federated recommendation systems require resource-limited devices to maintain the entire embedding tables resulting in high communication costs. In light of this, we propose a semi-decentralized federated ego graph learning framework for on-device recommendations, named SemiDFEGL, which introduces new device-to-device collaborations to improve scalability and reduce communication costs and innovatively utilizes predicted interacted item nodes to connect isolated ego graphs to augment local subgraphs such that the high-order user-item collaborative information could be used in a privacy-preserving manner. Furthermore, the proposed framework is model-agnostic, meaning that it could be seamlessly integrated with existing graph neural network-based recommendation methods and privacy protection techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed SemiDFEGL, extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemiDFEGL compared to other federated recommendation methods.",

            "title": "Single-shot Embedding Dimension Search in Recommender System",
            "abstract": "As a crucial component of most modern deep recommender systems, feature embedding maps high-dimensional sparse user/item features into low-dimensional dense embeddings. However, these embeddings are usually assigned a unified dimension, which suffers from the following issues: (1) high memory usage and computation cost. (2) sub-optimal performance due to inferior dimension assignments. In order to alleviate the above issues, some works focus on automated embedding dimension search by formulating it as hyper-parameter optimization or embedding pruning problems. However, they either require well-designed search space for hyperparameters or need time-consuming optimization procedures. In this paper, we propose a Single-Shot Embedding Dimension Search method, called SSEDS, which can efficiently assign dimensions for each feature field via a single-shot embedding pruning operation while maintaining the recommendation accuracy of the model. Specifically, it introduces a criterion for identifying the importance of each embedding dimension for each feature field. As a result, SSEDS could automatically obtain mixed-dimensional embeddings by explicitly reducing redundant embedding dimensions based on the corresponding dimension importance ranking and the predefined parameter budget. Furthermore, the proposed SSEDS is model-agnostic, meaning that it could be integrated into different base recommendation models. The extensive offline experiments are conducted on two widely used public datasets for CTR (Click Through Rate) prediction task, and the results demonstrate that SSEDS can still achieve strong recommendation performance even if it has reduced 90% parameters. Moreover, SSEDS has also been deployed on the WeChat Subscription platform for practical recommendation services. The 7-day online A/B test results show that SSEDS can significantly improve the performance of the online recommendation model while reducing resource consumption.",

Second, we present a taxonomy as a classification framework containing feature selection search, embedding dimension search, feature interaction search, model architecture search, and other components search. Furthermore, we put a particular emphasis on the search space and search strategy, as they are the common thread to connect all methods within each category and enable practitioners to analyze and compare various approaches.

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a generative adversarial graph network model, called ImGAGN to address the imbalanced classification problem on graphs. It introduces a novel generator for graph structure data, named GraphGenerator, which can simulate both the minority class nodes' attribute distribution and network topological structure distribution by generating a set of synthetic minority nodes such that the number of nodes in different classes can be balanced. Then a graph convolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between real nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes and majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world imbalanced network datasets.

TDGNN introduces a novel Temporal Aggregator (TDAgg) to aggregate the neighbor nodes\u2019 features and edges\u2019 temporal information to obtain the target node representations. Specifically, it assigns the neighbor nodes aggregation weights using an exponential distribution to bias different edges\u2019 temporal information.

            "title": "BSOGCN: Brain Storm Optimization Graph Convolutional Networks Based Heterogeneous Information Networks Embedding",
            "abstract": "Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph embedding. They map the nodes of the graph into the low dimensional vectors by aggregating the neighbor nodes\u2019 features information. However, most existing GCNs only focus on the homogeneous information networks instead of the heterogeneous information networks (HINs) with multiple types of nodes which are more common in the real world. Because the different types of neighbor nodes could have different impacts on the target nodes, it is difficult to manually design a proper neighbor nodes\u2019 features information aggregating weights. To address this problem, we propose a novel HINs embedding algorithm based on the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm and the graph convolutional network (GCN), called BSOGCN, which utilizes BSO to optimize the neighbor nodes\u2019 features information aggregating weights. It can be applied to the various HINs under various scenarios without any prior knowledge. The proposed method has been evaluated on both inductive and transductive node multi-class classification tasks on three real-world HINs datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that BSOGCN is competitive against other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "title": "Gradient-free Algorithms for Graph Embedding",
            "abstract": "Graph-based data are very ubiquitous in many real-world scenarios, and it is usually difficult to mine valuable information from the large scale graphs because of traditional sparse and high-dimension representations of nodes in the graphs. To address this issue, the graph embedding techniques which aim to map the nodes of the graph into a low-dimension dense vector space are proposed. These vectors can act as the features of nodes for many graph analytics tasks. However, most existing graph embedding algorithms highly rely on gradient information, which largely restricts the flexibility and universality of algorithms and easily reaches local optimum. In this paper, we propose a general and flexible gradient-free (e.g. particle swarm optimization and differential evolution) graph embedding algorithmic framework, which introduces how to apply gradient-free algorithms on graph embedding problems. Furthermore, the experiments on three large scale real-world network datasets for nodes classification and nodes multi-label classification tasks show that the gradient-free graph embedding algorithms can obtain promising results.",
