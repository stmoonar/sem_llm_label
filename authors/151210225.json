            "abstract": "Complex relationships among entities can be modeled very effectively using hypergraphs. Hypergraphs model real-world data by allowing a hyperedge to include two or more entities. Clustering of hypergraphs enables us to group the similar entities together. While most existing algorithms solely consider the connection structure of a hypergraph to solve the clustering problem, we can boost the clustering performance by considering various features associated with the entities as well as auxiliary relationships among the entities. Also, we can further improve the clustering performance if some of the labels are known and we incorporate them into a clustering model. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework for hypergraphs that is able to easily incorporate not only multiple relationships among the entities but also multiple attributes and content of the entities from diverse sources. Furthermore, by showing the close relationship between the hypergraph normalized cut and the weighted kernel K-Means, we also develop an efficient multilevel hypergraph clustering method which provides a good initialization with our semi-supervised multi-view clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting the ground-truth clusters and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Web spam detection is one of the most important and challenging tasks in web search. Since web spam pages tend to have a lot of spurious links, many web spam detection algorithms exploit the hyperlink structure between the web pages to detect the spam pages. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the link structure of web spam using real-world web graphs to systemically investigate the characteristics of the link-based web spam. By exploring the structure of the page-level graph as well as the site-level graph, we propose a scalable site-level seeding methodology for the Anti-TrustRank (ATR) algorithm. The key idea is to map a website into a feature space where we learn a classifier to prioritize the websites so that we can effectively select a set of good seeds for the ATR algorithm. This seeding method enables the ATR algorithm to detect the largest number of spam pages among the competitive baseline methods. Furthermore, we design work-efficient asynchronous ATR algorithms which are able to significantly reduce the computational cost of the traditional ATR algorithm without degrading the performance in detecting spam pages while guaranteeing the convergence.",

            "abstract": "We formally define a hyperlink classification problem in web search by classifying hyperlinks into three classes based on their roles: navigation, suggestion, and action. Real-world web graph datasets are generated for this task. We approach the hyperlink classification problem from a structured graph embedding perspective, and show that we can solve the problem by modifying the recently proposed knowledge graph embedding techniques. The key idea of our modification is to introduce a relation perturbation while the original knowledge graph embedding models only corrupt entities when generating negative triplets in training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the knowledge graph embedding idea to the hyperlink classification problem. We show that our model significantly outperforms the original knowledge graph embedding models in classifying hyperlinks on web graphs.",
