            "abstract": "Location-Based Social Networks can be profitably exploited to characterize citizens\u2019 activities in urban environments. However, collecting LBSN is potentially challenging due to privacy concerns, connectivity issues, and potential imbalances in LBSN service usage. We propose to complement LBSN data with mobility data in the analysis of citizens\u2019 activities in urban areas. Unlike the explicit insights provided by LBSN users, mobility data give implicit feedback on citizens\u2019 habits. This paper explores the spatial and temporal conditions under which user habits are coherent according to both sources and reports the most reliable common sequences of visited categories of Points-Of-Interests. To this aim, it relies on a multidimensional model in which recurrent citizens\u2019 activities are described by a new pattern type, namely the generalized activity pattern. It also detects the eventual presence of bias between LBSN and mobility user activities by customizing the established Statistical Parity metric. The motivations behind the detected bias are explained in terms of combinations of POI categories that are most likely to be the main causes. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world data achieved from Foursquare check-ins, taxi service, and free-floating car sharing. The results highlight not only the complementarity of the data sources regarding specific POI categories, but also their interchangeability in many spatio-temporal conditions.",

Fostering D&I in research communities must address issues related to inclusive interpersonal and small group dynamics, rules and codes of conduct, increasing diversity in under-represented groups and disciplines, and organizing D&I events, and longterm efforts to champion change [15].",

            "abstract": "Free-Floating Car Sharing (FFCS) services are currently available in tens of cities and countries spread all over the worlds. Depending on citizens\u2019 habits, service policies, and road conditions, car usage profiles are rather variable and often hardly predictable. Even within the same city, different usage trends emerge in different districts and in various time slots and weekdays. Therefore, modeling car availability in FFCS systems is particularly challenging. For these reasons, the research community has started to investigate the applicability of Machine Learning models to analyze FFCS usage data. This paper addresses the problem of predicting the short-term level of availability of the FFCS service in the short term. Specifically, it investigates the applicability of Machine Learning models to forecast the number of available car within a restricted urban area. It seeks the spatial and temporal contexts in which nonlinear ML models, trained on past usage data, are necessary to accurately predict car availability. Leveraging ML has shown to be particularly effective while considering highly dynamic urban contexts, where FFCS service usage is likely to suddenly and unexpectedly change. To tailor predictive models to the real FFCS data, we study also the influence of ML algorithm, prediction horizon, and characteristics of the neighborhood of the target area. The empirical outcomes allow us to provide system managers with practical guidelines to setup and tune ML models.",

            "abstract": "During the last years an increasing number of university-level and post-graduation courses on Data Science have been offered. Practices and assessments need specific learning environments where learners could play with data samples and run machine learning and data mining algorithms. To foster learner engagement many closed-and open-source platforms support the design of data science competitions. However, they show limitations on the ability to handle private data, customize the analytics and evaluation processes, and visualize learners' activities and outcomes. This paper presents Data Science Lab Environment (DSLE, in short), a new open-source platform to design and monitor data science competitions. DSLE offers a easily configurable interface to share training and test data, design group works or individual sessions, evaluate the competition runs according to customizable metrics, manage public and private leaderboards, monitor participants' activities and their progress over time. The paper describes also a real experience of usage of DSLE in the context of a 1st-year M.Sc. course, which has involved around 160 students.",

            "abstract": "Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB\u2019s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.",

            "abstract": "Free floating car sharing is a popular rental model for cars in shared use. In urban environments, it has become particularly attractive for users who make short trips or who make occasional use of the car. Since cars are not uniformly distributed across city areas, monitoring the number of cars available within restricted urban areas is crucial for both shaping service provision and improving the user experience. To address these issues, the application of machine learning techniques to analyze car mobility data has become more and more appealing. This paper focuses on forecasting the number of cars available in a restricted urban area in the short term (e.g., in the next 2 hours). It applies regression techniques to train multivariate models from heterogeneous data including the occupancy levels of the target and neighbor areas, weather and temporal information (e.g., season, holidays, daily time slots). To contextualize occupancy level predictions according to the target time and location, we generate models tailored to specific profiles of areas according to the prevalent category of Points-of-Interest in the area. Furthermore, to avoid bias due to presence of uncorrelated features we perform feature selection prior to regression model learning. As a case study, the prediction system is applied to data acquired from a real car sharing system. The results show promising system performance and leave room for insightful extensions.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a knowledge-based decision support system (KB-DSS) to improve the preparedness of crisis situations induced by natural and technological hazards. The proposed KB-DSS aims to manage the potential cascading effects generated by a triggering hazard assessing the possible event time histories based on interconnected probabilistic simulation models. From a methodological point of view, a decision model based on two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) algorithms follows a cascading effect simulation model. This combination allows to support the decision maker in comparing a set of mitigation strategies on the basis of their expected impacts and his priorities. The algorithm is based on an ensemble approach, which combines decisions over an array of possible impact scenarios, instead of only relying on the average impact scenario. An application of the KB-DSS to the case of a possible reactivation of Nea Kameni volcano in Santorini is presented to show how the proposed architecture could be applied to a real case. The proposed methodology supports the emergency planners in making the best decisions supporting them also in the choice of the best timing for the intervention.",

This new generation of systems, named SELF-DATA (SELF-learning DAta TrAnsformation) relies on an engine capable of exploring different data weighting schemas (e.g., normalized term frequencies, logarithmic entropy) and data transformation methods (e.g., PCA, LSI) before applying a given data mining algorithm (e.g., cluster analysis), evaluating and comparing solutions through different quality indices (e.g., weighted Silhouette), and presenting the 3-top solutions to the analyst. SELF-DATA will also include a knowledge database storing results of experiments on previously processed datasets, and a classification algorithm trained on the knowledge base content to forecast the best methods for future analyses. SELF-DATA\u2019s current implementation runs on Apache Spark, a stateof-the-art distributed computing framework. The preliminary validation performed on 4 collections of documents highlights that the TF-IDF and logarithmic entropy weighting methods are effective to measure item relevance with sparse datasets, and the LSI method outperforms PCA in the presence of a larger feature domain.",
