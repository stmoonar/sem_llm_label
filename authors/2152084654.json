            "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently enjoyed great success as an efficient self-supervised representation learning approach. However, the existing methods have focused on designing of contrastive modes and used data augmentation with a rigid and inefficient one-to-one sampling strategy. We adopted node neighborhoods to extend positive samplings and made avoided resorting to data augmentation to create different views. We also considered the homophily problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between the inter-class node pairs. The key novelty of our method hinged upon analyzing this GNNs problem and integrating the GCL sampling strategy with homophily discrimination, where we solved these two significant problems using one approach. We introduced a new parameterized neighbor sampling component to replace the conventional sub-optimal samplings. By keeping and updating the neighbor sets, both the positive sampling of GCL and the message passing of GNNs can be optimized. Moreover, we theoretically proved that the new method provided a lower bound of mutual information for unsupervised semantic learning, and it can also keep the lower bound with downstream tasks. In essence, our method is a new self-supervised approach, which we refer to as group discrimination, and it can make the downstream fine-tuning efficient. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the new method can significantly outperform the existing GCL methods because the former can solve the homophily problem in a self-supervised",

            "abstract": "In recent years, as the demand for senior care services has further increased, it has become more difficult to obtain matching services from the vast amount of data. Therefore, this paper proposes a service recommendation framework PCE-CF based on an embedded user portrait model. The framework accurately describes the elderly users through four dimensions\u2014population, society, consumption, and health\u2014and constructs the user portrait model by embedding tags. The embedded vector of each older man is learned through the deep learning model, and different feature groups are meaningfully expressed in the transformation space. In addition, location context and dynamic interest model are introduced to process embedded vectors, and users' service preferences are predicted according to their dynamic behaviors. The experiment results show that the PCE-CF framework proposed in this paper can improve the recommendation algorithm's efficiency and have higher feasibility in personalized service recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Recommendation systems play a crucial part in helping users efficiently obtain information based on users\u2019 current preferences and discover their individual needs, but the existing works are deficient in terms of the evolution of users\u2019 interests. In this paper, Graph Embedding with Service and User information (GESU) model is proposed to address the limitations of capturing users\u2019 fresh interests. Graph-structured data derived from time-varying session sequences are captured via gated graph neural networks. Then, the evolving influence of different services for users is obtained through a multi-head module. At the same time, a graph attention network is applied to predict users\u2019 fresh consumption preferences by selecting representative friends to characterize user information. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently on various evaluation metrics. GESU provides a means to recommend services that meet current requirements in an environment where users\u2019 interests evolve dynamically.",

            "abstract": "Discovering communities is an essential step in the analysis of complex systems, and it has two purposes: to identify functional modules and to interpret semantics. However, most of the existing community detection methods only focused on identify communities, while learning the semantics interpretation of communities has not been fully studied. In this paper, we focused on the problem of identifying communities and learning the semantics interpretation of modules jointly in an end-to-end model. We designed a novel generative model which combines two closely related parts, one for community discovery and the other for content clustering and semantics interpretation. By extracting the potential correlation between these two parts, our new method is not only robust to discovering communities, but also able to provide a community with more than one semantic topic. As for model inference, we developed a variational algorithm from a Bayesian point of view. Experimental results on the artificial benchmark and real networks showed the superior performance of the proposed approach over existing methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We also analyzed semantic interpretability of community detection results through a case study over a large-scale music platform dataset.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are potent models of complex systems. In practice, many nodes in an HIN have their attributes unspecified, resulting in significant performance degradation for supervised and unsupervised representation learning. We developed an unsupervised heterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach for analyzing HINs with missing attributes (HGCA). HGCA adopts a contrastive learning strategy to unify attribute completion and representation learning in an unsupervised heterogeneous framework. To deal with a large number of missing attributes and the absence of labels in unsupervised scenarios, we proposed an augmented network to capture the semantic relations between nodes and attributes to achieve a fine-grained attribute completion. Extensive experiments on three large real-world HINs demonstrated the superiority of HGCA over several state-of-the-art methods. The results also showed that the complemented attributes by HGCA can improve the performance of existing HIN models.",

However, the GCN aggregating mechanism fails to generalize to networks with heterophily where most nodes have neighbors from different classes, which commonly exists in real-world networks. In order to make the propagation and aggregation mechanism of GCN suitable for both homophily and heterophily (or even their mixture), we introduce block modelling into the framework of GCN so that it can realize \u201cblock-guided classified aggregation\u201d, and automatically learn the corresponding aggregation rules for neighbors of different classes. By incorporating block modelling into the aggregation process, GCN is able to automatically aggregate information from homophilic and heterophilic neighbors discriminately according to their homophily degree. We compared our algorithm with state-of-art methods which deal with the heterophily problem. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our new approach over existing methods in heterophilic datasets while maintaining a competitive performance in homophilic datasets.",
