            "title": "Modeling the Impact of Timeline Algorithms on Opinion Dynamics Using Low-rank Updates",
            "abstract": "Timeline algorithms are key parts of online social networks, but during recent years they have been blamed for increasing polarization and disagreement in our society. Opinion-dynamics models have been used to study a variety of phenomena in online social networks, but an open question remains on how thesemodels can be augmented to take into account the fine-grained impact of user-level timeline algorithms. We make progress on this question by providing a way to model the impact of timeline algorithms on opinion dynamics. Specifically, we show how the popular Friedkin--Johnsen opinion-formation model can be augmented based on aggregate information, extracted from timeline data. We use our model to study the problem of minimizing the polarization and disagreement; we assume that we are allowed to make small changes to the users' timeline compositions by strengthening some topics of discussion and penalizing some others. We present a gradient descent-based algorithm for this problem, and show that under realistic parameter settings, our algorithm computes a (1+\\varepsilon)-approximate solution in time~\\tO(m\\sqrtn \u0142g(1/\\varepsilon)), where m~is the number of edges in the graph and n~is the number of vertices. We also present an algorithm that provably computes an \\varepsilon-approximation of our model in near-linear time. We evaluate our method on real-world data and show that it effectively reduces the polarization and disagreement in the network. Finally, we release an anonymized graph dataset with ground-truth opinions and more than 27\\,000~nodes (the previously largest publicly available dataset contains less than 550~nodes).",
