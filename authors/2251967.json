            "title": "Using health information technology to support the needs of Children with Medical Complexity: Mapping review of consumer informatics applications",
            "abstract": "Background Children with medical complexity (CMC) are fragile populations that require continuous care and supervision. CMC family caregivers experience many challenges trying to address CMC patients' needs which puts these caregivers in a stressful situation that may negatively impact the care of CMC patients. Consumer informatics might help these caregivers in coordinating care. However, few consumer informatics applications explicitly focus on supporting CMC caregivers' needs. Objective This systematic mapping literature review aims to provide an overview and a structured understanding of the consumer informatics designed for CMC and their caregivers. Methods We followed a systematic mapping literature review process to provide an overview of the existing Consumer Informatics literature for CMC, which is the scope of our study. We screened IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PubMed databases using a preset list of mesh terms that cover the use of medical informatics by children with medical complexities and their caregivers. The selected articles are peer-reviewed English publications that were empirically validated from January 2002 to January 2022. After selecting and filtering the articles, we analyzed them based on the preset mapping questions using the following criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, the need addressed, target audience, technology users, and consumer informatics' type. Results The initial search resulted in a number of (N\u2009=\u20092,275) articles, and 17 selected publications were included. The results showed an increasing interest in CMC consumer informatics publications over time. Most of the studies were published in 2021, and feasibility research is the dominant research type. The most used technology was telehealth and telemedicine, followed by mobile health. The technologies addressed various needs, including; coordination & follow-up, medical safety, education & social support, daily living activities, shared decision making, information seeking, and emotional support. Most of the efforts were focused on ensuring good coordination and follow-up. Conclusions CMC consumer informatics is a promising research field to present novel initiatives and approaches to manage the caregivers' workload. Future research should be shifted toward providing more evidence-based studies to examine the effectiveness of CMC consumer informatics solutions and identify the related challenges and limitations.",

            "abstract": "The stability of physicians\u2019 authority over patients despite decades of changes in medicine conflicts with newer institutionalist accounts of professionals as change agents rather than instruments of reproduction. We analyzed whether the cultural scripts that twenty-one residents used to justify their approach to a new change, the electronic health record (EHR), signaled a leveling of the patient-physician hierarchy. Residents are intriguing because their position makes them open to change. Indeed, residents justified using the EHR in ways that level the patient-physician hierarchy, but also offered rationales that sustain it. For the latter, residents described using the EHR to substantiate their expertise, situate themselves as brokers between patients and the technology, and preserve the autonomy of clinicians. Our findings highlight how professionals with little direct experience before a change can selectively apply incumbent scripts to sustain extant structures, while informing newer institutionalist accounts of professionals and the design of EHR systems.",

            "abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) applications have the potential to improve health awareness. This study reports a quasi-controlled intervention to augment maternal health awareness among tribal pregnant mothers through the mHealth application. Households from 2 independent villages with similar socio-demographics in tribal regions of India were selected as intervention (Village A) and control group (Village B). The control group received government mandated programs through traditional means (orally), whereas the intervention group received the same education through mHealth utilization. Postintervention, awareness about tetanus injections and consumption of iron tablets was significantly (P\u2009<\u2009.001) improved in the intervention group by 55% and 58%, respectively. Awareness about hygiene significantly (P\u2009<\u2009.001) increased by 57.1%. In addition, mothers in the intervention group who recognized vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, severe blurring of vision, or convulsions as danger signs during pregnancy significantly (P\u2009<\u2009.001) increased by 18.30%, 23.2%, 20.0%, and 4.90%, respectively. Our study indicates that despite the low literacy of users, mHealth intervention can improve maternal health awareness among tribal communities.",

Medical errors are also driving patients to lose trust in their healthcare providers. We need to better analyze and improve patient experience in cancer care.

            "abstract": "The healthcare system is undergoing a transformational change due to the buildup of frustration against rising costs, inefficient services, long wait times and declining population health outcomes in the United States (US). At the same time, there is a growing excitement about the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in order to mitigate these inefficiencies. Many of the AI initiatives in healthcare are generally focused on highly domain specific solutions. There has not been widespread adoption of systemic solutions proposed. Improving care coordination is a national priority in the US and it is thought to be critical to avoiding unnecessarily hospitalizations. Given the increase in the aging population and the mounting complexity of care dynamics as patients age, the time is ripe to apply systems thinking approaches to model the dynamics of these complex care trajectories with the implication of utilizing AI technologies to augment care transitions. This paper outlines the rationale and approach for utilizing systems thinking in AI implementation design focused on improving care coordination as a driver for high value care.",

            "abstract": "Doctor-patient communication has been one of the main areas of research within the healthcare domain. The impact of doctor-patient communication on patient satisfaction and health outcomes has been acknowledged in the literature. The dynamics of doctor-patient communication in a geriatric setting is unique due to the limited physical and cognitive ability of elderly patients; communicating with them requires more attention, patience, and involvement. Geriatric providers are expected to be trained well to communicate with elderly patients with various levels of mental health conditions. In this study, we explored doctor-patient verbal communication patterns using text mining measures and identified differences between depression and non-depression visits. We analyzed a total of 42 doctor-patient encounters. Doctors in the visit were not aware of patients\u2019 depression status before and during the visit. Findings showed that doctors had more feelings linked to anger, fear, and sadness when they saw depressed patients. On the other hand, non-depressed patients used more anger-related communication compared to depressed patients. In conclusion, this study states that different communication strategies and training materials should be developed to accommodate depressed geriatric patients and geriatric providers.",

            "abstract": "Doctor-patient communication is one of the essential precursors of patient-centered care. The quality of this communication is influenced by several factors, including providers' communication style and the use of existing technologies. In our previous studies, we measured the impact of health information technology on doctor-patient communication. In this study, we used sentiment analysis to understand the impact of doctor-patient gender dyads on verbal communication. The findings showed a noticeable difference in the communication pattern between the same (concordance) and opposite gender dyads (discordance). The findings of this study also indicate that male doctors tend to talk more and in detail with their patients ($p= 0.01$ for gender concordance; $p=0.01$ during gender discordance) than female doctors did with their patients ($p=0.33$ for gender concordance; $p=0.41$ during gender discordance), irrespective of doctor-patient gender dyads. No significant differences were observed in doctor-patient sentiments and emotions. However, we observed more trust in gender concordance (20.9% & 17.6% of the time). In contrast, gender discordance resulted in more sadness (15.5% & 19.8% of the time), anticipation (17.3%), and joy (16.1% of the time). In conclusion, our study indicates that gender influences doctor-patient verbal communication. Further research with larger sample size is required to thoroughly understand the role of gender in overall healthcare communication.",

Clinicians are inundated with new types of data to synthesize in a timely manner to make a clinical decisions about the care of their patients. The overwhelming abundance of data leads to physician burnout, which is a major problem within healthcare. In parallel, there is an immense hype building up about implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as Machine Learning or Deep Learning, to augment clinician decision making processes. Healthcare is a highly regulated environment so it's imperative to involve clinicians and data scientists in the entire model development, validation and implementation lifecycle. There ought to be a mechanism in place for integration of human feedback to build trust in the AI model, through human in the loop implementation models and participatory design approaches. The overarching aim of this stury is to formulate a problem statement and propose the development a system dynamics model highlighting the feedback loops within clinical decision-making workflows leading to diffusion of innovation of AI within healthcare. We propose system dynamics modelling as a mechanism to articulate the problems that are best suited for AI models, and conceptualize how the models would fit into the current workflow.",
