            "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge of explainable AI (XAI) methods driven by the need for understanding machine learning model behaviors in high-stakes scenarios. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness of the XAI methods inevitably requires the involvement of human subjects, and conducting human-centered benchmarks is challenging in a number of ways: designing and implementing user studies is complex; numerous design choices in the design space of user study lead to problems of reproducibility; and running user studies can be challenging and even daunting for machine learning researchers. To address these challenges, this paper presents OpenHEXAI, an open-source framework for human-centered evaluation of XAI methods. OpenHEXAI features (1) a collection of diverse benchmark datasets, pre-trained models, and post hoc explanation methods; (2) an easy-to-use web application for user study; (3) comprehensive evaluation metrics for the effectiveness of post hoc explanation methods in the context of human-AI decision making tasks; (4) best practice recommendations of experiment documentation; and (5) convenient tools for power analysis and cost estimation. OpenHEAXI is the first large-scale infrastructural effort to facilitate human-centered benchmarks of XAI methods. It simplifies the design and implementation of user studies for XAI methods, thus allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on the scientific questions. Additionally, it enhances reproducibility through standardized designs. Based on OpenHEXAI, we further conduct a systematic benchmark of four state-of-the-art post hoc explanation methods and compare their impacts on human-AI decision making tasks in terms of accuracy, fairness, as well as users' trust and understanding of the machine learning model.",
