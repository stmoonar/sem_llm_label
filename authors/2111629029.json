            "abstract": "We describe SynGraphy, a method for visually summarising the structure of large network datasets that works by drawing smaller graphs generated to have similar structural properties to the input graphs. Visualising complex networks is crucial to understand and make sense of networked data and the relationships it represents. Due to the large size of many networks, visualisation is extremely difficult; the simple method of drawing large networks like those of Facebook or Twitter leads to graphics that convey little or no information. While modern graph layout algorithms can scale computationally to large networks, their output tends to a common\"hairball\"look, which makes it difficult to even distinguish different graphs from each other. Graph sampling and graph coarsening techniques partially address these limitations but they are only able to preserve a subset of the properties of the original graphs. In this paper we take the problem of visualising large graphs from a novel perspective: we leave the original graph's nodes and edges behind, and instead summarise its properties such as the clustering coefficient and bipartivity by generating a completely new graph whose structural properties match that of the original graph. To verify the utility of this approach as compared to other graph visualisation algorithms, we perform an experimental evaluation in which we repeatedly asked experimental subjects (professionals in graph mining and related areas) to determine which of two given graphs has a given structural property and then assess which visualisation algorithm helped in identifying the correct answer. Our summarisation approach SynGraphy compares favourably to other techniques on a variety of networks.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of graph generation guided by network statistics, i.e., the generation of graphs which have given values of various numerical measures that characterize networks, such as the clustering coefficient and the number of cycles of given lengths. Algorithms for the generation of synthetic graphs are often based on graph growth models, i.e., rules of adding (and sometimes removing) nodes and edges to a graph that mimic the processes present in real-world networks. While such graph generators are desirable from a theoretical point of view, they are often only able to reproduce a narrow set of properties of real-world networks, resulting in graphs with otherwise unrealistic properties. In this article, we instead evaluate common graph generation algorithms at the task of reproducing the numerical statistics of real-world networks, such as the clustering coefficient, the degree assortativity, and the connectivity. We also propose an iterative algorithm, the Guided Graph Generator, based on a greedy-like procedure that recovers realistic values over a large number of commonly used graph statistics, while at the same time allowing an efficient implementation based on incremental updating of only a small number of subgraph counts. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous graph generation algorithms in terms of the error in the reconstructed graphs for a large number of graph statistics such as the clustering coefficient, the assortativity, the mean node distance, and also evaluate the algorithm in terms of precision, speed of convergence and scalability, and compare it to previous graph generators and models. We also show that the proposed algorithm generates graphs with realistic degree distributions, graph spectra, clustering coefficient distributions, and distance distributions.",

            "abstract": "Collaborative consensus-finding is an integral element of many Web services and greatly determines the quality of information, content, and products that are available through the Web. That also means that the dynamics of democratic consensus-finding strengthen collective resilience against potential threats that attempt to degrade information, content, and products and affect Web data, users, behaviors, and even beyond as well as offline life. Even on Web platforms that are open to all, the influence of some first mover authors may shape future discussion and collaboration, which is comparable to academic citation networks for instance. In a social coding network such as GitHub, activities of a set of users can have influence on other users who can get interested in further actions, possibly contributing to a new project together with influential users. In this paper, we analyze the effect of contribution activities on gaining influence in this and comparable networks that provide users the functionality and aims for reaching collaborative goals on the Web.For this purpose, we present an empirical approach to identify the top influential users by using network features and contribution characteristics, which we find in existing and newly collected data set. We find that early adopter dynamics exist in the GitHub community, where early adopters have more followers in the end as expected. However, we also see counterexamples that arise due to the social networking behavior of late adopters, and due to the aging effect of older repositories and users. We publicly share the source code and the data sets for reproducing our paper.",

            "abstract": "Preferential attachment drives the evolution of many complex networks. Its analytical studies mostly consider the simplest case of a network that grows uniformly in time despite the accelerating growth of many real networks. Motivated by the observation that the average degree growth of nodes is time invariant in empirical network data, we study the degree dynamics in the relevant class of network models where preferential attachment is combined with heterogeneous node fitness and aging. We propose an analytical framework based on the time invariance of the studied systems and show that it is self-consistent only for two special network growth forms: the uniform and the exponential network growth. Conversely, the breaking of such time invariance explains the winner-takes-all effect in some model settings, revealing the connection between the Bose-Einstein condensation in the Bianconi-Barab\u00e1si model and similar gelation in superlinear preferential attachment. Aging is necessary to reproduce realistic node degree growth curves and can prevent the winner-takes-all effect under weak conditions. Our results are verified by extensive numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new preferential attachment-based network growth model in order to explain two properties of growing networks: (1) the power-law growth of node degrees and (2) the decay of node relevance. In preferential attachment models, the ability of a node to acquire links is affected by its degree, its fitness, as well as its relevance which typically decays over time. After a review of existing models, we argue that they cannot explain the above-mentioned two properties (1) and (2) at the same time. We have found that apart from being empirically observed in many systems, the exponential growth of the network size over time is the key to sustain the power-law growth of node degrees when node relevance decays. We therefore make a clear distinction between the event time and the physical time in our model, and show that under the assumption that the relevance of a node decays with its age \u03c4, there exists an analytical solution of the decay function f_R with the form f_R(\u03c4) = ?^(\u03c41). Other properties of real networks such as power-law alike degree distributions can still be preserved, as supported by our experiments. This makes our model useful in explaining and analysing many real systems such as citation networks.",

The efficiency and usability of these keyboards have traditionally been evaluated with conventional text entry performance measures such as words per minute, keystrokes per character, backspace usage, etc. However, in comparison to the traditional text entry approaches, gaze-based typing involves natural eye movements that are highly correlated with human brain cognition. Employing eye gaze as an input could lead to excessive mental demand, and in this work we argue the need to include cognitive load as an eye typing evaluation measure. We evaluate three variations of gaze-based virtual keyboards, which implement variable designs in terms of word suggestion positioning. The conventional text entry metrics indicate no significant difference in the performance of the different keyboard designs. However, STFT (Short-time Fourier Transform) based analysis of EEG signals indicate variances in the mental workload of participants while interacting with these designs. Moreover, the EEG analysis provides insights into the users cognition variation for different typing phases and intervals, which should be considered in order to improve eye typing usability.",

We may train a role classification algorithm on another dataset, but then that dataset may have largely different values of its features, for instance, the degrees in the other network may be distributed in a completely different way than in the first network. Thus, a way to transfer the features of different networks to each other or to a common feature space is needed. This type of setting is called transfer learning. In this paper, we present a transfer learning approach to network role classification based on feature transformations from each network's local feature distribution to a global feature space. We implement our approach and show experiments on real-world networks of discussions on Wikipedia as well as online forums. We also show a concrete application of our approach to an enterprise use case, where we predict the user roles in ARIS Community, the online platform for customers of Software AG, the second-largest German software vendor. Evaluation results show that our approach is suitable for transferring knowledge of user roles across networks.",
