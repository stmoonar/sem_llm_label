            "abstract": "Finding high-importance patterns in data is an emerging data mining task known as High-utility itemset mining (HUIM). Given a minimum utility threshold, a HUIM algorithm extracts all the high-utility itemsets (HUIs) whose utility values are not less than the threshold. This can reveal a wealth of useful information, but the precise needs of users are not well taken into account. In particular, users often want to focus on patterns that have some specific items rather than find all patterns. To overcome that difficulty, targeted mining has emerged, focusing on user preferences, but only preliminary work has been conducted. For example, the targeted high-utility itemset querying algorithm (TargetUM) was proposed, which uses a lexicographic tree to query itemsets containing a target pattern. However, selecting the minimum utility threshold is difficult when the user is not familiar with the processed database. As a solution, this paper formulates the task of targeted mining of the top-k high-utility itemsets and proposes an efficient algorithm called TMKU based on the TargetUM algorithm to discover the top-k target high-utility itemsets (top-k THUIs). At the same time, several pruning strategies are used to reduce memory consumption and execution time. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TMKU algorithm has good performance on real and synthetic datasets.",

            "abstract": "The Chinese Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is difficult to classify words accurately because of the lack of natural separators. Character embedding can effectively avoid the cumulative errors caused by word division, but carries relatively insufficient inter-character sequence information. In order to solve the problem of insufficient feature representation in Chinese NER model, this paper proposes a new CNER model (DBM-CNER), which has a dual-branch encoder structure. One branch is a new Transformer structure, in which the multi-head self-attention has dual-position encodings, and the other is a feedforward multi-scale dilated convolution fusion mechanism. This structure can better extract the global and local dependencies between characters in text from multiple perspectives, and enhance the ability to extract multi-level context features. Compared with other CNER models, the experimental results on the benchmark datasets in three different fields show that the proposed model is superior to state-of-the-art works.",

            "abstract": "The density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is able to cluster arbitrarily structured datasets. However, the clustering result of this algorithm is exceptionally sensitive to the neighborhood radius (Eps) and noise points, and it is hard to obtain the best result quickly and accurately with it. To solve the above problems, we propose an adaptive DBSCAN method based on the chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA-DBSCAN). First, we take the clustering evaluation index of the DBSCNA algorithm as the objective function and use the chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA) to iteratively optimize the evaluation index value of the DBSCAN algorithm to obtain the best Eps value and clustering result. Then, we introduce the theory of deviation in the data point spatial distance of the nearest neighbor search mechanism to assign the identified noise points, which solves the problem of over-identification of the algorithm noise points. Finally, we construct color image superpixel information to improve the CSA-DBSCAN algorithm\u2019s performance regarding image segmentation. The simulation results of synthetic datasets, real-world datasets, and color images show that the CSA-DBSCAN algorithm can quickly find accurate clustering results and segment color images effectively. The CSA-DBSCAN algorithm has certain clustering effectiveness and practicality.",

            "abstract": "To better reflect the precise clustering results of the data samples with different shapes and densities for affinity propagation clustering algorithm (AP), an improved integrated clustering learning strategy based on three-stage affinity propagation algorithm with density peak optimization theory (DPKT-AP) was proposed in this paper. DPKT-AP combined the ideology of integrated clustering with the AP algorithm, by introducing the density peak theory and k-means algorithm to carry on the three-stage clustering process. In the first stage, the clustering center point was selected by density peak clustering. Because the clustering center was surrounded by the nearest neighbor point with lower local density and had a relatively large distance from other points with higher density, it could help the k-means algorithm in the second stage avoiding the local optimal situation. In the second stage, the k-means algorithm was used to cluster the data samples to form several relatively small spherical subgroups, and each of subgroups had a local density maximum point, which is called the center point of the subgroup. In the third stage, DPKT-AP used the AP algorithm to merge and cluster the spherical subgroups. Experiments on UCI data sets and synthetic data sets showed that DPKT-AP improved the clustering performance and accuracy for the algorithm.",

To address the afore-mentioned issues, this paper proposes two novel methods namely the constraint rules-based affinity propagation (CRAP) and matching micro-clusters hierarchical clustering algorithm (MMHC). The CRAP algorithm can obtain better results by searching the optimal preference value by means of the constraint rules-based search algorithm (CRS).

            "abstract": "Global terrorism has created challenges to the criminal justice system due to its abnormal activities, which lead to financial loss, cyberwar, and cyber-crime. Therefore, it is a global challenge to monitor terrorist group activities by mining criminal information accurately from big data for the estimation of potential risk at national and international levels. Many conventional methods of computation have successfully been implemented, but there is little or no literature to be found that solves these issues through the use of big data analytical tools and techniques. To fill this literature gap, this research is aimed at the determination of accurate criminal data from the huge mass of varieties of data using Hadoop clusters to support Social Justice Organizations in combating terrorist activities on a global scale. To achieve this goal, several algorithmic approaches, including parallelization, annotators and annotations, lemmatization, stop word Remover, term frequency and inverse document frequency, and singular value decomposition, were successfully implemented. The success of this work is empirically compared using the same hardware, software, and system configuration. Moreover, the efficacy of the experiment was tested with criminal data with respect to concepts and matching scores. Eventually, the experimental results showed that the proposed approach was able to expose criminal data with 100% accuracy, while matching of multiple criminal terms with documents had 80% accuracy; the performance of this method was also proved in multiple node clusters. Finally, the reported research creates new ways of thinking for security agencies in combating terrorism at global scale.",

            "abstract": "The density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm is not sensitive to the recognition of halo nodes. The halo nodes at the edge of the density peaks clustering algorithm has a lower local density. The outliers are distributed in halo nodes. The novel halo identification method based on density peaks clustering algorithm utilize the advantage of DBSCAN algorithm to quickly identify outliers, which improved the sensitivity to halo nodes. However, the identified halo nodes cannot be effectively assigned to adjacent clusters. Therefore, this paper will use K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to classify the identified halo nodes. K-nearest neighbor is the simplest and most efficient classification method. The KNN algorithm has the advantages of high accuracy, insensitivity to outliers and no input hypothesis data. Hence, we proposed a novel density peaks clustering halo node assignment algorithm based on K-nearest neighbor theory (KNN-HDPC). KNN-HDPC can grasp the internal relations between outliers and cluster nodes more deeply, so as to dig out the deeper relations between nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively cluster and reclassify a large number of complex data. We can quickly dig out the potential relationship between noise points and cluster points. The improved algorithm has higher clustering accuracy than the original DPC algorithm, and essentially has more robust clustering results.",
