            "abstract": "The automatic extraction of topics is a standard technique for summarizing text corpora from various domains (e.g., news articles, transport or logistic reports, scientific publications) that has several applications. Since, in many cases, topics are subject to continuous change there is the need to monitor the evolution of a set of topics of interest, as the corresponding corpora are updated. The evolution of scientific topics, in particular, is of great interest for researchers, policy makers, fund managers, and other professionals/engineers in the research and academic community. In this work, we demonstrate a prototype that provides intuitive visualisations for the evolution of scientific topics providing insights about topic transformation, merging, and splitting during the recent years. Although the prototype works on top of a scientific text corpus, its implementation is generic and can be easily applied on texts from other domains, as well.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) provide a natural way to represent various relationships between entities of different types, thus they are valuable in many domains. Analysing and extracting knowledge from HINs typically relies on the concept of metapaths, which are paths in the network schema denoting relations of different semantics among entities. Moreover, real-world HINs are often extremely large, containing millions of nodes and edges. Therefore, exploring and analysing HINs not only requires interdisciplinary expertise, being able both to interpret and select appropriate metapaths in the network, but also to run the analysis in an efficient and scalable manner. However, there is a lack of tools to facilitate this task. To fill this gap, we present SciNeM, an open source, publicly available, scalable analysis tool for metapath-based knowledge discovery in HINs.",

            "abstract": "Due to the rapidly increasing number of scientific articles, finding valuable work for further research has become tedious and time consuming. To alleviate this issue, search engines have used citation-based article impact ranking. However, most engines rely on very simplistic impact measures (usually the citation count) and make the problematic assumption that there is a one-size-fits-all impact measure. To address these problems, we present BIP! Finder, a search engine that facilitates the identification of valuable articles by exploiting two different impact measures, each capturing a different aspect of the article impact. In addition, BIP! Finder provides many useful features (article comparison, intuitive visualisations, article bookmarking mechanism, etc.) making it a powerful addition to the researcher's toolbox.",
