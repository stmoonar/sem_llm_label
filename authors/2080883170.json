            "abstract": "We tackle the problem of recommending tests to learners to achieve upskilling. Our work is grounded in two learning theories: mastery learning, an instructional strategy that guides learners by providing them tests of increasing difficulty, reviewing their test results, and iterating until they reach a level of mastery; Flow Theory, which identifies different test zones, frustration, learnable, flow and boredom zones, to determine the best k tests to recommend to a learner. We formalize the AdUp Problem and develop a multi-objective optimization solution that adapts the difficulty of recommended tests to the learner's predicted performance, aptitude, and skill gap. We leverage existing models to simulate learner behavior and run experiments to demonstrate that our formalization is best to attain skill mastery. We discuss open research directions including the applicability of reinforcement learning and the recommendation of peers in collaborative projects.",

            "title": "Characterizing the Experimental Procedure in Science Laboratories: A preliminary step towards students experimental design",
            "abstract": "Many studies have stressed students\u2019 lack of understanding of experiments in laboratories. Some researchers suggest that if students design all or parts of entire experiment, as part of an inquiry-based approach, it would overcome certain difficulties. It requires that a procedure be written for experimental design. The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics of a procedure in science laboratories, in an educational context. As a starting point, this paper proposes a model in the form of a hierarchical task diagram that gives the general structure of any procedure. This model allows both the analysis of existing procedures and the design of a new inquiry-based approach. The obtained characteristics are further organized into criteria that can help both teachers and students assess a procedure during and after its writing. These results are obtained through two different sets of data. First, the characteristics of procedures are established by analysing laboratory manuals. This allows the organization and type of information in procedures to be defined. This analysis reveals that students are seldom asked to write a full procedure, but sometimes have to specify tasks within a procedure. Secondly, iterative interviews are undertaken with teachers. This leads to the list of criteria to evaluate the procedure.",

We studied the procedures produced by students to answer a chemical problem of titration by spectrophotometry. We analysed the content of the written procedures with the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic. This facilitated the analysis of the strategies used by the students, and specifically when the procedure is not satisfactory. To be successful, it is necessary for students to understand the knowledge underlying an experimental task, i.e. to relate the technological level to the technical level.

            "abstract": "Science Created by You (SCY) is a project on learning in science and technology domains. SCY uses a pedagogical approach that centres around products, called 'emerging learning objects' (ELOs) that are created by students. Students work individually and collaboratively in SCY-Lab (the general SCY learning environment) on 'missions' that are guided by socio-scientific questions (for example 'How can we design a CO2-friendly house?'). Fulfilling SCY missions requires a combination of knowledge from different content areas (eg, physics, mathematics, biology, as well as social sciences). While on a SCY mission, students perform several types of learning activities that can be characterised as productive processes (experiment, game, share, explain, design, etc), they encounter multiple resources, collaborate with varying coalitions of peers and use changing constellations of tools and scaffolds. The configuration of SCY-Lab is adaptive to the actual learning situation and may provide advice to students on appropriate learning activities, resources, tools and scaffolds, or peer students who can support the learning process. The SCY project aims at students between 12 and 18 years old. In the course of the project, a total of four SCY missions will be developed, of which one is currently available.

            "abstract": "Context and general purpose In the field of learning sciences by scientific inquiry process, most interest is given to the global process of scientific inquiry with reference to research processes, and to the exploration stage relying on questioning and building up hypothesis (Darley 1996; Sere 2002; Tiberghien et al 2001). Our purpose is centred on the particular stage in which the experiment is being designed (Arce and Betancourt 1997). We state that this stage occupies a central position within the scientific inquiry process, as it requires the set up of the link between the stated problem and the experiment and its expected results. We assume that while designing an experiment, learners have to take charge of the stated problem and questions. Therefore it should improve the learners performances to interpret experimental results with regard to the initial scientific question. On the other hand, defining and organising tasks inside an experimental procedure, requires understanding why and how each task takes place in the procedure. Since this kind of scientific reasoning frequently involves scientific models, we assume that models and theory should take place in the process, and that the learners would have to relate them with the empirical elements (Bachelard 1979). Therefore we assume that the design of experiment could play an important role in the learning process of experimental sciences, since it allows learners to handle the whole process of scientific inquiry, and should help them to improve their performance in most stages of the process. Research questions: analysing experimental procedures and design tasks in labwork We are aiming to characterise the different aspects of experimental design, and address the question of experiment design as a learner's task that can be included in labwork activities. In this paper, we deal mainly with the question of the organisation of experimental procedures through the analysis of the usages in current labwork activities. The purpose is to identify and characterise these organisations, and build a model to account for some experimental design process, and try to relate this process with usual teaching situations. This research derives from a previous project, Educaffix.net, which proposed a prototype of a computer-supported learning environment for a remote laboratory in chemistry (d'Ham et al, 2004). The learners' main task is to design the experiment, guided and validated by an artificial tutor.",

            "abstract": "One of the specificity of the experimental sciences courses (i.e. biology, chemistry, physics) is the need for the students to interact with both the domain of real objects and observable things and the domain of ideas. In distance education, ideas are easily transmitted through classic media. The laboratory work, which specifically deals with the objects and the observable things, has been transposed in distance education following two ways: the use of simulations and the use of remote-controlled experiment. Both of these solutions set out difficulties. Simulations are a representation of the real objects, and, in fact, are driven by theories that belong to the domain of ideas. Remote-controlled experiments do represent the domain of real objects, but they often are a transposition of classroom experiments, in which the function of the student is limited: learners have to execute procedures without being aware of the important choices made by the designer of the protocol. This difficulty is enhanced in distance education, by the fact that students don't handle the materials. Our aim is to present a prototype of a remote-controlled experiment, in which the domains of ideas and real objects are closely connected. In this case, theory is used and questioned in order to understand the practical work. The experimental part is not the first step, but appears once the learners have designed the experiment, which will help them to memorize and understand the procedures. In this paper, we will focus on the software that students use to design their experiment.",
