            "title": "Explainable Classification of Internet Memes",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, the integrity of online conversations is faced with a variety of threats, ranging from hateful content to manufactured media. In such a context, Internet Memes make the scalable automation of moderation interventions increasingly more challenging, given their inherently complex and multimodal nature. Existing work on Internet Meme classification has focused on black-box methods that do not explicitly consider the semantics of the memes or the context of their creation. This paper proposes a modular and explainable architecture for Internet Meme classification and understanding. We design and implement multimodal classification methods that perform exampleand prototype-based reasoning over training cases, while leveraging both textual and visual SOTA models to represent the individual cases. We study the relevance of our modular and explainable models in detecting harmful memes on two existing tasks: Hate Speech Detection and Misogyny Classification. We compare the performance between exampleand prototype-based methods, and between text, vision, and multimodal models, across different categories of harmfulness (e.g., stereotype and objectification). We devise a user-friendly interface that facilitates the comparative analysis of examples retrieved by all of our models for any given meme, informing the community about the strengths and limitations of these explainable methods.",

            "title": "Contextualizing Internet Memes Across Social Media Platforms",
            "abstract": "Internet memes have emerged as a novel format for communication and expressing ideas on the web. Their fluidity and creative nature are reflected in their widespread use, often across platforms and occasionally for unethical or harmful purposes. While computational work has already analyzed their high-level virality over time and developed specialized classifiers for hate speech detection, there have been no efforts to date that aim to holistically track, identify, and map internet memes posted on social media. To bridge this gap, we investigate whether internet memes across social media platforms can be contextualized by using a semantic repository of knowledge, namely, a knowledge graph. We collect thousands of potential internet meme posts from two social media platforms, namely Reddit and Discord, and develop an extract-transform-load procedure to create a data lake with candidate meme posts. By using vision transformer-based similarity, we match these candidates against the memes cataloged in IMKG --- a recently released knowledge graph of internet memes. We leverage this grounding to highlight the potential of our proposed framework to study the prevalence of memes on different platforms, map them to IMKG, and provide context about memes on social media.",
