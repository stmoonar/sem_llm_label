            "title": "FAIR Research Object Assessment: A landscape analysis",
            "abstract": ". Research Objects (ROs) are becoming a popular means to capture the context and research artefacts associated with a research investigation in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. However, it is unclear how well ROs themselves adhere to the FAIR (find-able, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles. In this work, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the FAIR assessment of more than 2500 ROs across multiple disciplines. Our work integrates FAIROs, our existing RO evaluation service, in the ROHub platform. We discuss the challenges of calculating the FAIR assessment of aggregations of resources, and how we supplement the FAIROs tests with information from the RO-Crate descriptor file generated by ROHub.",
