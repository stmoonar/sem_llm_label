            "title": "Collaborative Intelligence: A Scoping Review Of Current Applications",
            "abstract": "Humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems have complementary strengths. This complementarity creates the potential to improve performance by combining inputs from human and AI on a common task or goal. A systematic review of academic and grey literature was conducted to investigate whether real-world examples of \u2018collaborative intelligence\u2019 could be identified. Applications utilising collaborative intelligence had to have (1) complementarity (i.e., the collaboration improves performance beyond that which could be achieved by the human or the AI alone), (2) a shared objective and outcome, and (3) sustained, task-related interaction between human and AI. The literature search yielded 1250 documents but only 16 applications meeting these criteria were identified. Most collaborative applications were at the prototyping stage but they could perform a variety of types of work (creative, industrial, healthcare, emergency response and knowledge work) and delivered a range of benefits (efficiency, creativity and safety). In most applications the AI had a virtual presence but there were examples where the AI also had a cyber-physical form. These early applications reveal the potential for collaborative intelligence to be applied in a range of domains and formats.",

            "title": "Do Text-to-Vis Benchmarks Test Real Use of Visualisations?",
            "abstract": "Large language models are able to generate code for visualisations in response to user requests. This is a useful application, and an appealing one for NLP research because plots of data provide grounding for language. However, there are relatively few benchmarks, and it is unknown whether those that exist are representative of what people do in practice. This paper aims to answer that question through an empirical study comparing benchmark datasets and code from public repositories. Our findings reveal a substantial gap in datasets, with evaluations not testing the same distribution of chart types, attributes, and the number of actions. The only representative dataset requires modification to become an end-to-end and practical benchmark. This shows that new, more benchmarks are needed to support the development of systems that truly address users' visualisation needs. These observations will guide future data creation, highlighting which features hold genuine significance for users.",
