            "abstract": "The Euclidean space is the familiar space for training neural models and performing arithmetic operations. However, many data types inherently possess complex geometries, and model training methods involve operating over their latent representations, which cannot be effectively captured in the Euclidean space. The hyperbolic space provides a more generalized representative geometry to model the hierarchical complexities of the tree-like structure of natural language. We propose A DA PT a set of guidelines for initialization, parametrization, and training of neural networks, which adapts to the dataset and can be used with different manifolds. A DA PT can be generalized over any existing neural network training methodology and leads to more stable training without a substantial increase in training time. We apply A DA PT guidelines over two state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on three tasks over 12 languages across speech and text. Through extensive qualitative analysis, we put forward the applicability of A DA PT as a set of guidelines optimally utilizing the manifold geometry, which can be extended to various downstream tasks across languages and modalities.",

However, it involves calculating the saliency over gradient vectors in the Euclidean space, representations that often possess complicated geometries and inherent hierarchical structure. We propose PISA, saliency-aware interpolative regularization operating in the hyperbolic space, to better capture the complex geometries of representations. To this end, we also formulate a saliency-aware mixup for speech signals. PISA outperforms existing state-of-the-art interpolative augmentation methods on 7 benchmark and low-resource datasets from the domains of speech signal processing and computer vision. PISA results in more stable training than existing data augmentation methods while being robust to adversarial attacks. It can be generalized across modalities, models and downstream tasks.",

            "title": "Knowledge-based Analogical Reasoning in Neuro-symbolic Latent Spaces",
            "abstract": "Analogical Reasoning problems challenge both connectionist and symbolic AI systems as these entail a combination of background knowledge, reasoning and pattern recognition. While symbolic systems ingest explicit domain knowledge and perform deductive reasoning, they are sensitive to noise and require inputs be mapped to preset symbolic features. Connectionist systems on the other hand can directly ingest rich input spaces such as images, text or speech and recognize pattern even with noisy inputs. However, connectionist models struggle to include explicit domain knowledge for deductive reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines the pattern recognition abilities of neural networks with symbolic reasoning and background knowledge for solving a class of Analogical Reasoning problems where the set of attributes and possible relations across them are known apriori. We take inspiration from the 'neural algorithmic reasoning' approach [DeepMind 2020] and use problem-specific background knowledge by (i) learning a distributed representation based on a symbolic model of the problem (ii) training neural-network transformations reflective of the relations involved in the problem and finally (iii) training a neural network encoder from images to the distributed representation in (i). These three elements enable us to perform search-based reasoning using neural networks as elementary functions manipulating distributed representations. We test this on visual analogy problems in RAVENs Progressive Matrices, and achieve accuracy competitive with human performance and, in certain cases, superior to initial end-to-end neural-network based approaches. While recent neural models trained at scale yield SOTA, our novel neuro-symbolic reasoning approach is a promising direction for this problem, and is arguably more general, especially for problems where domain knowledge is available.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we perform a thorough match prediction analysis of our newly mined NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) volleyball data set. We also investigate the comparative power of two distinct yet comparable models, namely team aggregates and player aggregates, to predict the outcome of an NCAA volleyball match. The dependent variables for both models are mainly hitting rates of serves, recepts, attacks, and assists. The output variable is the winning team. Apart from the features specific to volleyball, we also incorporated a few general match statistics. Among the multitude of Machine Learning models available for classification, the study finalizes on three primary ones viz Logistic Regression, Decision trees, and Neural Networks. Results show that Decision trees and Neural Networks perform considerably well in both the team and player models on the ROC metric and accuracy, with Neural Networks giving marginally better results. Logistic regression on team aggregates performs only slightly better than randomized outcomes, whereas, for the player model, it performs way better. In terms of model structure, player aggregates give much better classification than team aggregates with a maximum ROC of 0.98. This shows that volleyball, despite being a team sport, is intrinsically more impacted by players who make the team than the team as a whole. Our model accuracy suggests that this model can be successfully used to predict the outcome of a NCAA volleyball match.",

However, it is not yet well-understood how machine learning algorithms might best collaborate with people to support creative expression. To investigate how practicing designers perceive the role of AI in the creative process, we developed a game level design tool for Super Mario Bros.-style games with a built-in AI level designer. In this paper we discuss our design of the Morai Maker intelligent tool through two mixed-methods studies with a total of over one-hundred participants. Our findings are as follows: (1) level designers vary in their desired interactions with, and role of, the AI, (2) the AI prompted the level designers to alter their design practices, and (3) the level designers perceived the AI as having potential value in their design practice, varying based on their desired role for the AI.",
