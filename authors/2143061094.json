            "title": "Learning Topology-Specific Experts for Molecular Property Prediction",
            "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to predicting molecular properties, which is one of the most classical cheminformatics tasks with various applications. Despite their effectiveness, we empirically observe that training a single GNN model for diverse molecules with distinct structural patterns limits its prediction performance. In this paper, motivated by this observation, we propose TopExpert to leverage topology-specific prediction models (referred to as experts), each of which is responsible for each molecular group sharing similar topological semantics. That is, each expert learns topology-specific discriminative features while being trained with its corresponding topological group. To tackle the key challenge of grouping molecules by their topological patterns, we introduce a clustering-based gating module that assigns an input molecule into one of the clusters and further optimizes the gating module with two different types of self-supervision: topological semantics induced by GNNs and molecular scaffolds, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TopExpert has boosted the performance for molecular property prediction and also achieved better generalization for new molecules with unseen scaffolds than baselines.

            "title": "Ask Me What You Need: Product Retrieval using Knowledge from GPT-3",
            "abstract": "As online merchandise become more common, many studies focus on embedding-based methods where queries and products are represented in the semantic space. These methods alleviate the problem of vocab mismatch between the language of queries and products. However, past studies usually dealt with queries that precisely describe the product, and there still exists the need to answer imprecise queries that may require common sense knowledge, i.e., 'what should I get my mom for Mother's Day.' In this paper, we propose a GPT-3 based product retrieval system that leverages the knowledge-base (KB) of GPT-3 for question answering; users do not need to know the specific illustrative keywords for a product when querying. Our method tunes prompt tokens of GPT-3 to prompt knowledge and render answers that are mapped directly to products without further processing. Our method shows consistent performance improvement on two real-world and one public dataset, compared to the baseline methods. We provide an in-depth discussion on leveraging GPT-3 knowledge into a question answering based retrieval system.",

            "title": "Learnable Structural Semantic Readout for Graph Classification",
            "abstract": "With the great success of deep learning in various domains, graph neural networks (GNNs) also become a dominant approach to graph classification. By the help of a global readout operation that simply aggregates all node (or node-cluster) representations, existing GNN classifiers obtain a graph-level representation of an input graph and predict its class label using the representation. However, such global aggregation does not consider the structural information of each node, which results in information loss on the global structure. In this work, we propose structural semantic readout (SSRead) to summarize the node representations at the position-level, which allows to model the position-specific weight parameters for classification as well as to effectively capture the graph semantic relevant to the global structure. Given an input graph, SSRead aims to identify structurally-meaningful positions by using the semantic alignment between its nodes and structural prototypes, which encode the prototypical features of each position. The structural prototypes are optimized to minimize the alignment cost for all training graphs, while the other GNN parameters are trained to predict the class labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that SSRead significantly improves the classification performance and interpretability of GNN classifiers while being compatible with a variety of aggregation functions, GNN architectures, and learning frameworks.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancement of large-scale pretrained models such as BERT, GPT-3, CLIP, and Gopher, has shown astonishing achievements across various task domains. Unlike vision recognition and language models, studies on general-purpose user representation at scale still remain underexplored. Here we explore the possibility of general-purpose user representation learning by training a universal user encoder at large scales. We demonstrate that the scaling law is present in user representation learning areas, where the training error scales as a power-law with the amount of computation. Our Contrastive Learning User Encoder (CLUE), optimizes task-agnostic objectives, and the resulting user embeddings stretch our expectation of what is possible to do in various downstream tasks. CLUE also shows great transferability to other domains and companies, as performances on an online experiment shows significant improvements in Click-Through-Rate (CTR). Furthermore, we also investigate how the model performance is influenced by the scale factors, such as training data size, model capacity, sequence length, and batch size. Finally, we discuss the broader impacts of CLUE in general.",
