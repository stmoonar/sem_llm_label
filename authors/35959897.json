            "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the positive impact of incorporating linguistic representations as additional context and scaffolds on the in-domain performance of several NLP tasks. We extend this work by exploring the impact of linguistic representations on cross-domain performance in a few-shot transfer setting. An important question is whether linguistic representations enhance generalizability by providing features that function as cross-domain pivots. We focus on the task of relation extraction on three datasets of procedural text in two domains, cooking and materials science. Our approach augments a popular transformer-based architecture by alternately incorporating syntactic and semantic graphs constructed by freely available off-the-shelf tools. We examine their utility for enhancing generalization, and investigate whether earlier findings, e.g. that semantic representations can be more helpful than syntactic ones, extend to relation extraction in multiple domains. We find that while the inclusion of these graphs results in significantly higher performance in few-shot transfer, both types of graph exhibit roughly equivalent utility.",

            "abstract": "In quantitative question answering, compositional generalization is one of the main challenges of state of the art models, especially when longer sequences of reasoning steps are required. In this paper we propose CounterComp, a method that uses counterfactual scenarios to generate samples with compositional contrast. Instead of a data augmentation approach, CounterComp is based on metric learning, which allows for direct sampling from the training set and circumvents the need for additional human labels. Our proposed auxiliary metric learning loss improves the performance of three state of the art models on four recently released datasets. We also show how the approach can improve OOD performance on unseen domains, as well as unseen compositions. Lastly, we demonstrate how the method can lead to better compositional attention patterns during training.",

The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web-based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners. In this module, students work with unstructured text data and learn to train, test, and improve text classification models such as intent recognition, clickbait filter, and sentiment analysis. As they interact with machine-learning language models deeply, students also gain a nuanced understanding of language and how to wield it, not just as a data structure, but as a tool in our human-human encounters as well. The current version contains eight lessons, all delivered through a full-featured online learning and teaching platform. Computers and Internet access are required to implement the module. The module was piloted in an ELA class in the Spring of 2022, and the student learning outcomes were positive. The module is currently undergoing revision and will be further tested and improved in Fall 2022.",

            "abstract": "Forums are essential components facilitating interactions in online courses. However, in large-scale courses, many posts generated, which results in learners\u2019 difficulties. First, the posts are poorly organized and some deviate from the topic, making it difficult for learners\u2019 knowledge acquisition. Second, learners cannot receive timely feedback and guidance, making the learning progress unclear for them. Well-designed scaffoldings should be built based on challenges of forums to improve learners\u2019 learning outcomes, knowledge construction, and completion rate. While targeting the problems in online forums, this article proposed principles for the design of online scaffolding after analyzing the requirements of online learning scaffolding or scripts. Subsequently, in this article, we designed an automatic feedback scaffolding based on the principles and a knowledge construction model. The scaffolding provided learners with timely feedback and related learning guidance. Tags were used to assist learners in acquiring relevant information more easily. The scaffolding was then integrated into the Learning Cell Knowledge Community and used in an online course for 955 learners. The results showed that automatic feedback scaffolding positively affected learners\u2019 learning and promoted positive knowledge transformation. Furthermore, we found that the scaffolding could help learners induce more constructive behaviors defined in the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive deep learning framework that demonstrated the reason for learners\u2019 knowledge transformation. At last, learners\u2019 course completion rate also increased with the help of the scaffolding, which provided evidence that well-designed scaffolding can result in positive educational outcomes. In addition, the principles proposed could also contribute to further scaffolding design and practices.",

            "title": "StoryQ: A Web-Based Machine Learning and Text Mining Tool for K-12 Students",
            "abstract": "StoryQ is a web-based machine learning and text mining tool that allows young learners (Grade 6-12) to engage in machine learning practices and work with unstructured text data without coding. StoryQ features dynamically linked data representations that promote meaningful inquiries across tables, graphs, and texts--a unique user experience that makes machine learning models transparent, explainable, and fun to explore. This demo provides a brief tutorial on how to use StoryQ to train, test, and troubleshoot text classification models using both standard feature extractors (e.g., N-grams) and special feature extraction tools and visualizations designed to support young learners and non-computing teachers. This demo also includes sample learning activities designed for high school English Language Arts classes to showcase how machine learning concepts and practices can be introduced in non-computing classes. This work is supported by an NSF I-TEST project (DRL-1949110).",
