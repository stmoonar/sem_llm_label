            "abstract": "Variational Autoencoder (VAE) offers a non-linear probabilistic modeling of user's preferences. While it has achieved remarkable performance at collaborative filtering, it typically samples a single vector for representing user's preferences, which may be insufficient to capture the user's diverse interests. Existing solutions extend VAE to model multiple interests of users by resorting a variant of self-attentive method, i.e., employing prototypes to group items into clusters, each capturing one topic of user's interests. Despite showing improvements, the current design could be more effective since prototypes are randomly initialized and shared across users, resulting in uninformative and non-personalized clusters. To fill the gap, firstly, we introduce iterative latent attention for personalized item grouping into VAE framework to infer multiple interests of users. Secondly, we propose to incorporate implicit differentiation to improve training of our iterative refinement model. Thirdly, we study the self-attention to refine cluster prototypes for item grouping, which is largely ignored by existing works. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate stronger performance of our method over those of baselines.",

            "title": "Memory Network-Based Interpreter of User Preferences in Content-Aware Recommender Systems",
            "abstract": "This article introduces a novel architecture for two objectives recommendation and interpretability in a unified model. We leverage textual content as a source of interpretability in content-aware recommender systems. The goal is to characterize user preferences with a set of human-understandable attributes, each is described by a single word, enabling comprehension of user interests behind item adoptions. This is achieved via a dedicated architecture, which is interpretable by design, involving two components for recommendation and interpretation. In particular, we seek an interpreter, which accepts holistic user\u2019s representation from a recommender to output a set of activated attributes describing user preferences. Besides encoding interpretability properties such as fidelity, conciseness and diversity, the proposed memory network-based interpreter enables the generalization of user representation by discovering relevant attributes that go beyond her adopted items\u2019 textual content. We design experiments involving both human- and functionally-grounded evaluations of interpretability. Results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed model not only discovers highly relevant attributes for interpreting user preferences, but also enjoys comparable or better recommendation accuracy than a series of baselines.",
