            "title": "Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "As user behaviors become complicated on business platforms, online recommendations focus more on how to touch the core conversions, which are highly related to the interests of platforms. These core conversions are usually continuous targets, such as \\textit{watch time}, \\textit{revenue}, and so on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion actions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to learn these hybrid targets. However, existing works mainly emphasize investigating the sequential dependence among discrete conversion actions, which neglects the complexity of dependence between discrete conversions and the final continuous conversion. Moreover, simultaneously optimizing hybrid tasks with stronger task dependence will suffer from volatile issues where the core regression task might have a larger influence on other tasks. In this paper, we study the MTL problem with hybrid targets for the first time and propose the model named Hybrid Targets Learning Network (HTLNet) to explore task dependence and enhance optimization. Specifically, we introduce label embedding for each task to explicitly transfer the label information among these tasks, which can effectively explore logical task dependence. We also further design the gradient adjustment regime between the final regression task and other classification tasks to enhance the optimization. Extensive experiments on two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HTLNet. Moreover, online A/B tests on the financial recommender system also show that our model has improved significantly. Our implementation is available here\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/HTLNet}}.",

            "abstract": "Online marketing is critical for many industrial platforms and business applications, aiming to increase user engagement and platform revenue by identifying corresponding delivery-sensitive groups for specific incentives, such as coupons and bonuses. As the scale and complexity of features in industrial scenarios increase, deep uplift modeling (DUM) as a promising technique has attracted increased research from academia and industry, resulting in various predictive models. However, current DUM still lacks some standardized benchmarks and unified evaluation protocols, which limit the reproducibility of experimental results in existing studies and the practical value and potential impact in this direction. In this paper, we provide an open benchmark for DUM and present comparison results of existing models in a reproducible and uniform manner. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative industrial datasets with different preprocessing settings to re-evaluate 13 existing models. Surprisingly, our experimental results show that the most recent work differs less than expected from traditional work in many cases. In addition, our experiments also reveal the limitations of DUM in generalization, especially for different preprocessing and test distributions. Our benchmarking work allows researchers to evaluate the performance of new models quickly but also reasonably demonstrates fair comparison results with existing models. It also gives practitioners valuable insights into often overlooked considerations when deploying DUM. We will make this benchmarking library, evaluation protocol, and experimental setup available on GitHub.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scenario recommender systems (MSRSs) have been increasingly used in real-world industrial platforms for their excellent advantages in mitigating data sparsity and reducing maintenance costs. However, conventional MSRSs usually use all relevant features indiscriminately and ignore that different kinds of features have varying importance under different scenarios, which may cause confusion and performance degradation. In addition, existing feature selection methods for deep recommender systems may lack the exploration of scenario relations. In this paper, we propose a novel automated multi-scenario feature selection (MultiFS) framework to bridge this gap, which is able to consider scenario relations and utilize a hierarchical gating mechanism to select features for each scenario. Specifically, MultiFS first efficiently obtains feature importance across all the scenarios through a scenario-shared gate. Then, some scenario-specific gate aims to identify feature importance to individual scenarios from a subset of the former with lower importance. Subsequently, MultiFS imposes constraints on the two gates to make the learning mechanism more feasible and combines the two to select exclusive features for different scenarios. We evaluate MultiFS and demonstrate its ability to enhance the multi-scenario model performance through experiments over two public multi-scenario benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "In modern online platforms, incentives are essential factors that enhance user engagement and increase platform revenue. Over recent years, uplift modeling has been introduced as a strategic approach to assign incentives to individual customers. Especially in many real-world applications, online platforms can only incentivize customers with specific budget constraints. This problem can be reformulated as the multi-choice knapsack problem. This optimization aims to select the optimal incentive for each customer to maximize the return on investment. Recent works in this field frequently tackle the budget allocation problem using a two-stage approach. However, this solution is confronted with the following challenges: (1) The causal inference methods often ignore the domain knowledge in online marketing, where the expected response curve of a customer should be monotonic and smooth as the incentive increases. (2) An optimality gap between the two stages results in inferior sub-optimal allocation performance due to the loss of the incentive recommendation information for the uplift prediction under the limited budget constraint. To address these challenges, we propose a novel End-to-End Cost-Effective Incentive Recommendation (E3IR) model under budget constraints. Specifically, our methods consist of two modules, i.e., the uplift prediction module and the differentiable allocation module. In the uplift prediction module, we construct prediction heads to capture the incremental improvement between adjacent treatments with the marketing domain constraints (i.e., monotonic and smooth). We incorporate integer linear programming (ILP) as a differentiable layer input in the allocation module. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on public and real product datasets, demonstrating that our E3IR improves allocation performance compared to existing two-stage approaches.",

            "abstract": "Multi-behavior recommender systems (MBRS) have been commonly deployed on real-world industrial platforms for their superior advantages in understanding user preferences and mitigating data sparsity. However, the cascade graph modeling paradigm adopted in mainstream MBRS usually assumes that users will refer to all types of behavioral knowledge they have when making decisions about target behaviors, i.e., use all types of behavioral interactions indiscriminately when modeling and predicting target behaviors for each user. We call this a full decision chain constraint and argue that it may be too strict by ignoring that different types of behavioral knowledge have varying importance for different users. In this paper, we propose a novel automated decision chain selection (AutoDCS) framework to relax this constraint, which can consider each user\u2019s unique decision dependencies and select a reasonable set of behavioral knowledge to activate for the prediction of target behavior. Specifically, AutoDCS first integrates some existing MBRS methods in a base cascade module to obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings. Then, a bilateral matching gating mechanism is used to select an exclusive set of behaviors for the current user-item pair to form a decision chain, and the corresponding behavior-augmented embeddings are selectively activated. Subse-quently, AutoDCS combines the behavior-augmented and original behavior-aware embeddings to predict the target behavior. Finally, we evaluate AutoDCS and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments over four public multi-behavior benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "Uplift modeling has been widely employed in online marketing by predicting the response difference between the treatment and control groups, so as to identify the sensitive individuals toward interventions like coupons or discounts. Compared with traditional \\textit{conversion uplift modeling}, \\textit{revenue uplift modeling} exhibits higher potential due to its direct connection with the corporate income. However, previous works can hardly handle the continuous long-tail response distribution in revenue uplift modeling. Moreover, they have neglected to optimize the uplift ranking among different individuals, which is actually the core of uplift modeling. To address such issues, in this paper, we first utilize the zero-inflated lognormal (ZILN) loss to regress the responses and customize the corresponding modeling network, which can be adapted to different existing uplift models. Then, we study the ranking-related uplift modeling error from the theoretical perspective and propose two tighter error bounds as the additional loss terms to the conventional response regression loss. Finally, we directly model the uplift ranking error for the entire population with a listwise uplift ranking loss. The experiment results on offline public and industrial datasets validate the effectiveness of our method for revenue uplift modeling. Furthermore, we conduct large-scale experiments on a prominent online fintech marketing platform, Tencent FiT, which further demonstrates the superiority of our method in real-world applications.",

            "abstract": "Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) prediction is a critical task in business applications. Accurately predicting CLTV is challenging in real-world business scenarios, as the distribution of CLTV is complex and mutable. Firstly, there is a large number of users without any consumption consisting of a long-tailed part that is too complex to fit. Secondly, the small set of high-value users spent orders of magnitude more than a typical user leading to a wide range of the CLTV distribution which is hard to capture in a single distribution. Existing approaches for CLTV estimation either assume a prior probability distribution and fit a single group of distribution-related parameters for all samples, or directly learn from the posterior distribution with manually predefined buckets in a heuristic manner. However, all these methods fail to handle complex and mutable distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal distribution selection model OptDist for CLTV prediction, which utilizes an adaptive optimal sub-distribution selection mechanism to improve the accuracy of complex distribution modeling. Specifically, OptDist trains several candidate sub-distribution networks in the distribution learning module (DLM) for modeling the probability distribution of CLTV. Then, a distribution selection module (DSM) is proposed to select the sub-distribution for each sample, thus making the selection automatically and adaptively. Besides, we design an alignment mechanism that connects both modules, which effectively guides the optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on both two public and one private dataset to verify that OptDist outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, OptDist has been deployed on a large-scale financial platform for customer acquisition marketing campaigns and the online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of OptDist.",

            "title": "Prior-Guided Accuracy-Bias Tradeoff Learning for CTR Prediction in Multimedia Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Although debiasing in multimedia recommendation has shown promising results, most existing work relies on the ability of the model itself to fully disentangle the biased and unbiased information and considers arbitrarily removing all the biases. However, in many business scenarios, it is usually possible to extract a subset of features associated with the biases by means of expert knowledge, i.e., the confounding proxy features. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel debiasing framework with confounding proxy priors for the accuracy-bias tradeoff learning in the multimedia recommendation, or CP2Rec for short, in which these confounding proxy features driven by the expert experience are integrated into the model as prior knowledge corresponding to the biases. Specifically, guided by these priors, we use a bias disentangling module with some orthogonal constraints to force the model to avoid encoding biased information in the feature embeddings. We then introduce an auxiliary unbiased loss to synergize with the original biased loss in an accuracy-bias tradeoff module, aiming at recovering the beneficial bias information from the above-purified feature embeddings to achieve a more reasonable accuracy-bias tradeoff recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a product dataset to verify the effectiveness of CR2Rec. In addition, CR2Rec is also deployed on a large-scale financial multimedia recommendation platform in China and achieves a sustained performance gain.",

            "abstract": "Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential for commercial recommender systems. Recently, to improve the prediction accuracy, plenty of deep learning-based CTR models have been proposed, which are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to optimize well. General hyperparameter optimization methods fix these hyperparameters across the entire model training and repeat them multiple times. This trial-and-error process not only leads to suboptimal performance but also requires non-trivial computation efforts. In this paper, we propose an automatic hyperparameters scheduling and optimization method for deep CTR models, AutoOpt, making the optimization process more stable and efficient. Specifically, the whole training regime is firstly divided into several consecutive stages, where a data-efficient model is learned to model the relation between model states and prediction performance. To optimize the stage-wise hyperparameters, AutoOpt uses the global and local scheduling modules to propose proper hyperparameters for the next stage based on the training in the current stage. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoOpt. Moreover, AutoOpt has been deployed onto an advertising platform and a music platform, where online A/B tests also demonstrate superior improvement. In addition, the code of our algorithm is publicly available in MindSpore1.",
