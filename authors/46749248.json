            "abstract": "In hyperspectral classification applications, band selection (BS) is an effective preprocessing method that reduces image redundancy without changing the original data. The property whereby different objects can be spatially separated is used for image classification, but BS methods based on quantitation of this property have not gotten enough attention. A cluster-based BS method that uses the dilation distances (DDs) with respect to the metric of spatial distances has been proposed, but the DD is strongly affected by outliers and calculating DD is time-consuming. Moreover, there is a mismatch between DD and the method of clustering and selecting representative band. In this letter, we propose a BS method based on pixel sorting-feature-based DD (SFDD) to accurately determine spatial information differences (SIDs) metric and design a method of successive clustering as well as a method of representative BS to match the features of this metric. We optimize the method to calculate the SFDD to reduce the time needed for it. In contrast to most BS methods, the bands selected by our method have a large SID among them such that objects at different positions are clearly differentiated in the spectral dimension after dimension reduction. The results of experiments showed that the proposed approach provides results that are competitive with those of several state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Fourier ptychography microscopy provides a large field of view and high-resolution imaging by simultaneously recovering intensity and phase distributions. However, in real setups, the process of capturing large numbers of low-resolution images will inevitably suffer from imaging noise, which could seriously distort the results recovered using the conventional Fourier ptychography approach. To suppress the effects of imaging noise optimally, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed. This algorithm consists of two objective functions; one is based on the augmented Lagrangian function for the inverse computation, and its solution is found by utilizing the alternating direction multiplier method; the other is the separate sparse model built for amplitude and absolute phase image; the filtering process is accomplished by exploiting the block-matching 3D frames. In combination with the Nash equilibrium balancing theory, the proposed algorithm is realized by alternately optimizing the two objective functions. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust to noise and is capable of reconstructing complete and good contrast amplitude and phase images.",

The approach can directly derive luminance maps ofa light source from the ray file. The Fibonacci lattice model and the Kriging techniques are used to reconstruct the rays and to interpolate the luminous flux values of the new rays from the original ray data, respectively. A planar LED is used for the verification experiments. Luminance maps are simulated via sampling a ray file of the LED, and compared with actually measured luminance maps. A good agreement is found by high NCC and low NRMSE values as wellas the visual comparisons,and indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the ray emission experiments are performed,and the experimental results preliminarily validate the ability of the proposed sampling method in terms of compressing ray data.",

The theoretical model is put forward, as well as the corresponding calculation method. This method includes two steps. First, as the initial estimation, integral approximation is applied to fit the distributed spots' offset function; second, the Boltzmann function is employed to compensate for the estimation error to improve detection accuracy. The simulation results attest to the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method, and tolerance synthesis analysis of DALAMS is conducted to determine the maximum uncertainties of manufacturing and installation. The maximum angle error is less than 0.08\u00b0 in the prototype distributed measurement system, which shows the stability and robustness for prospective applications.",

Only one detector is used to detect target location from four distributed aperture optical systems through a 4\u00d71 imaging fiber bundle.

According to the working principle of a four-quadrant (4Q) detector, fiber diamond alignment is adopted between an optical system and a 4Q detector. The structure of the laser semiactive angle measurement system is, we believe, novel. Tolerance analysis is carried out to determine tolerance limits of manufacture and installation errors of the optical system. The performance of the proposed method is identified by computer simulations and experiments. It is demonstrated that the linear region of the system is \u00b112\u00b0, with measurement error of better than 0.2\u00b0. In general, this new system can be used with large field of view and high accuracy, providing an efficient, stable, and fast method for angle measurement in practical situations.",

The calibration process was carried out by measuring a \u03a6460\u2009\u2009mm standard flat sample multiple times at different sites of the PMI with a length gauge; then the subaperture data were stitched together using a sequential or simultaneous stitching algorithm that minimizes the inconsistency (i.e., difference) of the discrete data in the overlapped areas. The system error can be used to compensate the measurement results of not only large flats, but also spheres and aspheres. The feasibility of the calibration was validated by measuring a \u03a61070\u2009\u2009mm aspheric mirror, which can raise the measurement accuracy of PMIs and provide more reliable 3D surface profiles for guiding grinding, lapping, and even initial polishing processes.",

            "abstract": "Aspheric surfaces are widely used because of their desirable characteristics. Such a surface can obtain nearly perfect imaging quality with fewer optical elements and reduce the size and mass of optical systems. Various machine systems have been developed based on modern deterministic polishing technologies for large aperture aspheric surfaces. Several factors affect the final precision of large aperture aspheric surfaces, such as the velocity limit of the machine and the path design. Excess velocity, which will be truncated automatically by the computer numerical control system, may cause the dwell time to deviate from the desired time. When a path designed on a two-dimensional surface map with equidistant pitch is projected onto an aspheric surface, the pitch changes as a result of the varied curvature of the aspheric surface. This may affect the removal map and cause some ripple errors. A multiregion distribution strategy, which includes velocity checking, is proposed in this study to avoid exceeding the velocity limits. The strategy can be used to modify local errors and edge effects. A three-dimensional spiral path generation method is also presented using an iterative method to ensure uniformity in the space length of the adjacent circle of the spiral path. This process can reduce the ripple error caused by the overlapping of tool paths. A polishing experiment was conducted, and the results proved the validity of the proposed strategies.",

            "abstract": "The remounting accuracy of optical components between measurement and polishing affects the polishing results, especially for small polishing footprint processes such as magnetorheological jet polishing (MJP). In this paper, two important remounting errors (translation and rotation errors) are discussed, and a masking method is proposed to correct these errors. A mathematical model that describes the relationship between remounting errors and reference points is constructed. A mask is created to provide reference points on a sample because such points are important for identifying remounting errors. The remounting errors are then used as bases in correcting the parameters used for actual polishing. Experiments are conducted on a K9 optical sample to validate the proposed approach. After the reference points are obtained by measuring the mask on the sample, the remounting errors are derived. The translation errors are 5.61 mm in the X direction and 6.08 mm in the Y direction; the rotation error is 4.1\u00b0. Deviations from the desired positions are eliminated and the desired surface smoothness is obtained after parameter correction. Results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for high-precision polishing.",

The process and the machine are complicated. This paper is concerned with the process optimization and tool design, and results obtained by FEA on the designed MJF tool.",
