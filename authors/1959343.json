As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following \"blue sky\" questions: \u2022How could/should AI courses incorporate AI Ethics into the curriculum? \u2022How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary school level? \u2022AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields? \u2022How should standard AI courses evolve? \u2022How could we leverage AI education to promote diversity in the field?

The problem is especially important for digitazing analog photographs. We substantially improve on the published state of the art in terms of the performance on one of the standard datasets, and test our system on a more difficult large dataset of consumer photos. We use Guided Backpropagation to obtain insights into how our CNN detects photo orientation, and to explain its mistakes.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes probability models for human travel, using latent factors learned from data. The latent factors represent interpretable properties: travel distance cost, desirability of destinations, and affinity between locations. Individuals are clustered into distinct styles of travel. The latent factors combine in a multiplicative manner, and are learned using Maximum Likelihood. The resulting models exhibit significant improvements in predictive power over previous methods, while also using far fewer parameters than histogram-based methods. The method is demonstrated on travel data from two sources: geotags from a social image sharing site (Flickr), and GPS tracks from Shanghai taxis.",
