            "abstract": "Evolutionary Algorithms have been regularly used for solving multi and many objectives optimization problems. The effectiveness of such methods is determined generally by their ability to generate a well-distributed front (diversity) that is as close as possible to the optimal Pareto front (proximity). Analysis of current multi-objective evolutionary frameworks shows that they are still sub-optimal and present poor versatility on different geometries and dimensionalities. For that, in this paper, we present AGE-MOEA++, a new Multi and Many Objective Evolutionary Algorithm that: (1) incorporates the principle of Pareto Front (PF) shape fitting to enhance the convergence in different shaped high dimensional objective spaces, and (2) adapts K-means ++ fundamentals in order to best manage the diversity in non-uniform distributed PF. The empirical study shows that our proposal has better results than the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of IGD and is competitive in terms of GD.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater level prediction is an applied time series forecasting task with important social impacts to optimize water management as well as preventing some natural disasters: for instance, floods or severe droughts. Machine learning methods have been reported in the literature to achieve this task, but they are only focused on the forecast of the groundwater level at a single location. A global forecasting method aims at exploiting the groundwater level time series from a wide range of locations to produce predictions at a single place or at several places at a time. Given the recent success of global forecasting methods in prestigious competitions, it is meaningful to assess them on groundwater level prediction and see how they are compared to local methods. In this work, we created a dataset of 1026 groundwater level time series. Each time series is made of daily measurements of groundwater levels and two exogenous variables, rainfall and evapotranspiration. This dataset is made available to the communities for reproducibility and further evaluation. To identify the best configuration to effectively predict groundwater level for the complete set of time series, we compared different predictors including local and global time series forecasting methods. We assessed the impact of exogenous variables. Our result analysis shows that the best predictions are obtained by training a global method on past groundwater levels and rainfall data.",

            "abstract": "This paper tackles the Campaign Allocation Problem of commercial Ads in TV breaks. The problem is NP-Hard and can be viewed as a multi-stakeholders multiobjective problem with highly competing objectives for different brands and numerous constraints. The expected solutions should be able to focus on, at least, one sub-part of the Pareto Optimal Front according to the decision maker's (DM) region of interest. Consequently, reference point-based many objective approaches could be a good option for solving this kind of problems. However, such approaches suffer from limitations in terms of diversity around the reference points, and other issues due to the fact that they consider the objective space as Euclidean. For the latter, recently a new algorithm called AGE-MOEA, by removing the assumption of Euclidean spaces, has proven to be the best in terms of diversity for a lot of many-objective problems in the literature. Nevertheless, AGE-MOEA has a high computational complexity and cannot be driven to a specific sub-parts of the Pareto Front. For that, we propose a novel approach, called RAGE-MOEA, that combines the AGE-MOEA diversity principles with the convergence elements of reference based approaches. Experiments have shown that this approach obtains better results in terms of compromise between diversity and convergence around the reference points than usual Reference-based methods (R-NSGA-II and R-NSGA-III) on literature benchmarks, and significantly better results for our industrial problem.",

            "abstract": "Post-hoc explanation aims at defining a simple local surrogate model to shed light on a prediction produced by a complex, generally black-box, model. In the general context of classification, it has been shown that local surrogatesmay not be able to always capture a local explanation, i.e. for a specific instance prediction, but rather traduce more of a general behavior of the black-box. This problem is even more complex in a recommendation scenario where classes and decision boundaries are not explicitly defined and where data are very sparse by nature. We show in this paper that it is possible to tackle these problems with an efficient sampling around the recommendation instance to explain, to finally learn a proper local surrogate model. Our experiments show that our method is as accurate or better than the methods of the literature while retrieving more meaningful explainable features locally.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, marketing strategies are data-driven, and their quality depends significantly on the quality and quantity of available data. As it is not always possible to access this data, there is a need for synthetic data generation. Most of the existing techniques work well for low-dimensional data and may fail to capture complex dependencies between data dimensions. Moreover, the tedious task of identifying the right combination of models and their respective parameters is still an open problem. In this paper, we present MTCopula, a novel approach for synthetic complex data generation based on Copula functions. MTCopula is a flexible and extendable solution that automatically chooses the best Cop-ula model, between Gaussian Copula and T-Copula models, and the best-fitted marginals to catch the data complexity. It relies on Maximum Likelihood Estimation to fit the possible marginal distribution models and introduces Akaike Information Criterion to choose both the best marginals and Copula models, thus removing the need for a tedious manual exploration of their possible combinations. Comparisons with state-of-art synthetic data generators on a real use case private dataset, called AdWanted, and literature datasets show that our approach preserves better the variable behaviors and the dependencies between variables in the generated synthetic datasets.",

First, we present a simple and intuitive method for multi-objective and multi-stakeholder recommendation that relies on preferences for each stakeholder. The second contribution is the adaptation of Halpern and Pearl's definition of causality to introduce definitions of causes and explanations for multi-stakeholder recommender systems. Experiments conducted on real data study the tractability of such explanation approach in the context of RS.",

            "abstract": "Automatic identification of mutiword expressions (MWEs) is a pre-requisite for semantically-oriented downstream applications. This task is challenging because MWEs, especially verbal ones (VMWEs), exhibit surface variability. However, this variability is usually more restricted than in regular (non-VMWE) constructions, which leads to various variability profiles. We use this fact to determine the optimal set of features which could be used in a supervised classification setting to solve a subproblem of VMWE identification: the identification of occurrences of previously seen VMWEs. Surprisingly, a simple custom frequency-based feature selection method proves more efficient than other standard methods such as Chi-squared test, information gain or decision trees. An SVM classifier using the optimal set of only 6 features outperforms the best systems from a recent shared task on the French seen data.",

To this aim, we propose to automatically infer this user belief based on the user's past interactions over a data cube, the cube schema and other users past activities. We express the belief under the form of a probability distribution over all the query parts potentially accessible to the user, and use a random walk to learn this distribution. This belief is then used to define a first Subjective Interestingness measure over multidimensional queries. Experiments conducted on simulated and real explorations show how this new subjective interestingness measure relates to prototypical and real user behaviors, and that query parts offer a reasonable proxy to infer user belief.",

This paper studies this question in the context of online reviews writing, where the skill corresponds to the procedural knowledge needed to write helpful reviews. To this end, we model the quality of a review by a combination of various metrics stemming from text analysis (like readability, polarity, spelling errors or length) and we use customer declared helpfulness as a ground truth for constructing the model. We use Knowledge Tracing, a popular model of skill acquisition, to measure the evolution of the ability to write reviews of good quality over a period of time. While recent studies have tried to measure the quality of a review and correlate it to helpfulness, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address this question as the exercise of a reviewer\u2019s skill over a sequence of reviews. Our experiments on a set of 41,681 Amazon book reviews show that it is possible to accurately assess the individual skill acquisition of writing a helpful review, based on a statistical model of the procedural knowledge at hand rather than human evaluations prone to subjectivity and variations over time.",

Active learning for semi-supervised clustering allows algorithms to solicit a domain expert to provide side information as instances constraints, for example a set of labeled instances called seeds. The problem consists in selecting the queries to the expert that are likely to improve either the relevance or the quality of the proposed clustering. However, these active methods su\ufb00er from several limitations: (i) they are generally tailored for only one speci\ufb01c clustering paradigm or cluster shape and size, (ii) they may be counter-productive if the seeds are not selected in an appropriate manner and, (iii) they have to work e\ufb03ciently with minimal expert supervision. In this paper, we propose a new active seed selection algorithm that relies on a k-nearest neighbors structure to locate dense potential clusters and e\ufb03ciently query and propagate expert information. Our approach makes no hypothesis on the underlying data distribution and can be paired with any clustering algorithm. Comparative experiments conducted on real data sets show the e\ufb03ciency of this new approach compared to existing ones.",

A new metric learning algorithm is derived that achieves a compromise clustering between a data-driven and a user-driven solution and converges with a good complexity.

            "abstract": "The objective of any tutoring system is to provide resources to learners that are adapted to their current state of knowledge. With the availability of a large variety of online content and the disjunctive nature of results provided by traditional search engines, it becomes crucial to provide learners with adapted learning paths that propose a sequence of resources that match their learning objectives. In an ideal case, the sequence of documents provided to the learner should be such that each new document relies on concepts that have been already defined in previous documents. Thus, the problem of determining an effective learning path from a corpus of web documents depends on the accurate identification of outcome and prerequisite concepts in these documents and on their ordering according to this information. Until now, only a few works have been proposed to distinguish between prerequisite and outcome concepts, and to the best of our knowledge, no method has been introduced so far to benefit from this information to produce a meaningful learning path. To this aim, this article first describes a concept annotation method that relies on machine-learning techniques to predict the class of each concept\u2014prerequisite or outcome\u2014on the basis of contextual and local features. Then, this categorization is exploited to produce an automatic resource sequencing on the basis of different representations and scoring functions that transcribe the precedence relation between learning resources. Experiments conducted on a real dataset built from online resources show that our concept annotation approach outperforms the baseline method and that the learning paths automatically generated are consistent with the ground truth provided by the author of the online content.",

We focus on cases where data are not numerical vectors and where it is not necessarily possible to compute a mean for each cluster. In this case, the distance of each point to existing clusters can be computed exhaustively with a quadratic complexity which is not tractable in most of nowadays use cases. In this paper we first introduce a stochastic approach for estimating the distance of each new data point to existing clusters based on Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds, that reduces the number of computations by simultaneously selecting the quantity of data to be sampled and by eliminating the non-competitive clusters. Second, this paper shows that it is possible to improve the efficiency of our approach by reducing the theoretical values of the Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds. Our algorithms, tested on real data sets, provide significant acceleration of the one-pass clustering algorithms, while making less error (or any depending on parameters) than one-pass clustering algorithm with fixed number of comparisons with each cluster.",

These algorithms are tailored to work with continuous data streams, where all the data is not necessarily available at once or can not fit in main memory. Some fuzzy algorithms already propose solutions to manage large datasets in a similar way but are generally limited to spatial datasets to avoid the complexity of medoids computation. Our methods keep the advantages of the fuzzy approaches and add the capability to handle large relational datasets by considering the continuous input stream of data as a set of data chunks that are processed sequentially. Two distinct models are proposed to aggregate the information discovered from each data chunk and produce the final partition of the dataset. Our new algorithms are compared to state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering algorithms on artificial and real datasets. Experiments show that our new approaches perform closely if not better than existing algorithms while adding the capability to handle relational data to better match the needs of real world applications.",

In this paper, we propose a new approach in which decisions trees from a forest are clustered to simplify the overall decision process while maintaining a large amount of decision trees and to facilitate the interpretation of the results.

Our novel approach relies on a k-nearest neighbors graph to estimate the dense regions of the data space and generates queries at the frontier between clusters where the cluster membership is most uncertain.

This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for active seeds selection which relies on a Min-Max approach that favors the coverage of the whole dataset.

            "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of active query selection for clustering with constraints. The objective is to determine automatically a set of user queries to define a set of must-link or cannot-link constraints. Some works on active constraint learning have already been proposed but they are mainly applied to K-Means like clustering algorithms which are known to be limited to spherical clusters, while we are interested in clusters of arbitrary sizes and shapes. The novelty of our approach relies on the use of a k-nearest neighbor graph to determine candidate constraints coupled with a new constraint utility function. Comparative experiments conducted on real datasets from machine learning repository show that our approach significantly improves the results of constraints based clustering algorithms.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, clustering with constraints has become a topic of significant interest for many researchers because it allows to take into account the knowledge from the domain, expressed as a set of constraints, and thus to improve the efficiency of the analysis. For example, these approaches can take place in an interactive process where a user iteratively expresses new constraints to refine previous clustering results. In this paper, we propose three new variants of the leader ant clustering with constraint algorithm (MCLA, MELA and CELA) that implements the following constraints: the must-link, cannot-link constraints and epsiv-constraints. These algorithms have been compared to other constraint based clustering algorithms such as K-means clustering with constraints and the original leader ant clustering algorithm. Our experiments show that, on UCI machine learning and artificial data sets, our approach compares well to the other algorithms.",

            "abstract": "In the context of web personalization and dynamic content recommendation, it is crucial to learn typical user profiles. Although there exists several approaches to mine user profiles (such as association rules or sequential patterns extraction), this paper focuses on the application of relational clustering algorithms on web usage data to characterize user access profiles. These methods rely on the definition of a distance (or dissimilarity) measure between user sessions and thus can carry more information (content, sequence of page views, context of navigation) than simple transactions. Moreover, as web user sessions are often noisy, uncertain or inaccurate (because of proxy web server, local browser cache and sessions building heuristics), we propose to use two clustering algorithms: the leader Ant clustering algorithm that is inspired by the chemical recognition system of ants and a new variant of the fuzzy C Medoids. The paper also describes the similarity measures used to compare these algorithms with the traditional fuzzy C Medoids on real web usage data sets from French museums. The evaluation is conducted according to the quality of the output partitions and the interpretability of each cluster based on its content.",

In our approach, each object of the data set is associated to the colonial odour of an artificial ant. At each iteration , a randomly chosen ant meets ants from each already existing nest to decide if it integrates this nest or if it creates its own nest. At the end of this iterative meeting process , the nests represent a partition of the intial data set. Similarily to the Leader algorithm, LA processes each data only once, which allows short computation times even on large data sets. LA is compared to other clustering algorithm such as k-means or AntClust [9] on artificial and real data sets. Finally, we briefly describe results obtained when applying LA on real Web usage data from a French museum Web site.",

It then applies rules that mimic the behavior of real ants to group into the same nest (or cluster) the artificial ants.

This mechanism of colonial closure, can be observed when real ants need to discriminate between nestmates and intruders. Many works already describe this phenomenon for distinct species, but none of them formalises it from a computational point of view. In this work, we aim at reproducing experiments that are performed by biologists with real ants and testing hypothesis that may explain biological results. To reach our goal, we first model the individual and social behaviours that are involved in the establishment of a Gestalt odour in the colonies. We then simulate these behaviours in an artificial laboratory. For the time being, our results confirm the role of food in the divergence of cuticular odours profiles for the fungus growing ant species. Moreover, our system allow one to better appreciate the role of external cues such as queen and environmental odour as their influence is fully parameterised by the user.",
