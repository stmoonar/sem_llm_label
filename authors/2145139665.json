            "abstract": "With the rapid development of 5G Internet of things technology, the traditional WebGIS visualization technology can not meet the needs of Oilfield Engineering for the integration and visualization of various sensor monitoring data. This paper uses the most advanced ecarts open source data visualization technology, combined with the basic architecture of WebGIS, to realize the multi-dimensional and comprehensive visualization of all kinds of sensor data with temporal and spatial characteristics, and improve the ability of integration and analysis of multi-source data.",
