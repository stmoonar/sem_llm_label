            "abstract": "The output distribution of a neural network (NN) over the entire input space captures the complete input-output mapping relationship, offering insights toward a more comprehensive NN understanding. Exhaustive enumeration or traditional Monte Carlo methods for the entire input space can exhibit impractical sampling time, especially for high-dimensional inputs. To make such difficult sampling computationally feasible, in this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-based Wang-Landau (GWL) sampler. We first draw the connection between the output distribution of a NN and the density of states (DOS) of a physical system. Then, we renovate the classic sampler for the DOS problem, the Wang-Landau algorithm, by replacing its random proposals with gradient-based Monte Carlo proposals. This way, our GWL sampler investigates the under-explored subsets of the input space much more efficiently. Extensive experiments have verified the accuracy of the output distribution generated by GWL and also showcased several interesting findings - for example, in a binary image classification task, both CNN and ResNet mapped the majority of human unrecognizable images to very negative logit values.",

Using the representation learning capability of generative modeling, MLRG automatically learns the optimal renormalization group (RG) transformations from self-generated spin configurations and formulates RG equations without human supervision. The algorithm does not focus on simulating any particular lattice model but broadly explores all possible models compatible with the internal and lattice symmetries given the on-site symmetry representation. It can uncover the RG monotone that governs the RG flow, assuming a strong form of the c-theorem. This enables several downstream tasks, including unsupervised classification of phases, automatic location of phase transitions or critical points, controlled estimation of critical exponents, and operator scaling dimensions. We demonstrate the MLRG method in two-dimensional lattice models with Ising symmetry and show that the algorithm correctly identifies and characterizes the Ising criticality.",

            "abstract": "Classical shadow tomography is a powerful randomized measurement protocol for predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two classical shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the single-qubit (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting local operators but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford measurement, which is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on near-term quantum devices due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit measurement protocol provides immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli measurement protocol for predicting quasi-local operators. It also enables a more efficient fidelity estimation compared to the Pauli measurement.",

In the last few years, it was gradually understood that there is a new mechanism of mass generation for fermions without involving any symmetry breaking within an anomaly-free symmetry group, also applicable to chiral fermions with anomaly-free chiral symmetries. This new mechanism is generally referred to as the symmetric mass generation (SMG). It is realized that the SMG has deep connections with interacting topological insulator/superconductors, symmetry-protected topological states, perturbative local and non-perturbative global anomaly cancellations, and deconfined quantum criticality. It has strong implications for the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories. This article defines the SMG, summarizes the current numerical results, introduces an unifying theoretical framework (including the parton-Higgs and the s-confinement mechanisms, as well as the symmetry-extension construction), and presents an overview of various features and applications of SMG.",

            "abstract": "Classical shadow tomography provides an efficient method for predicting functions of an unknown quantum state from a few measurements of the state. It relies on a unitary channel that efficiently scrambles the quantum information of the state to the measurement basis. Facing the challenge of realizing deep unitary circuits on near-term quantum devices, we explore the scenario in which the unitary channel can be shallow and is generated by a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian via time evolution. We provide an unbiased estimator of the density matrix for all ranges of the evolution time. We analyze the sample complexity of the Hamiltonian-driven shadow tomography. We find that it can be more efficient than the unitary-2-design-based shadow tomography in a sequence of intermediate time windows that range from an order-1 scrambling time to a time scale of D, given the Hilbert space dimension D. In particular, the efficiency of predicting diagonal observables is improved by a factor of D without sacrificing the efficiency of predicting off-diagonal observables.",

In this work, we incorporate the key ideas of renormalization group (RG) and sparse prior distribution to design a hierarchical flow-based generative model, RG-Flow, which can separate information at different scales of images and extract disentangled representations at each scale. We demonstrate our method on synthetic multi-scale image datasets and the CelebA dataset, showing that the disentangled representations enable semantic manipulation and style mixing of the images at different scales. To visualize the latent representations, we introduce receptive fields for flow-based models and show that the receptive fields of RG-Flow are similar to those of convolutional neural networks. In addition, we replace the widely adopted isotropic Gaussian prior distribution by the sparse Laplacian distribution to further enhance the disentanglement of representations. From a theoretical perspective, our proposed method has O(logL) complexity for inpainting of an image with edge length L, compared to previous generative models with O(L2) complexity.",

Given a field theory action, we train a flow-based hierarchical deep generative neural network to reproduce the boundary field ensemble from uncorrelated bulk field fluctuations. In this way, the neural network develops the optimal renormalization group transformations. Using the machine-designed EHM to map the CFT back to a bulk effective action, we determine the bulk geodesic distance from the residual mutual information.

            "abstract": "The quantum neural network is one of the promising applications for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. A quantum neural network distills the information from the input wave function into the output qubits. In this Letter, we show that this process can also be viewed from the opposite direction: the quantum information in the output qubits is scrambled into the input. This observation motivates us to use the tripartite information-a quantity recently developed to characterize information scrambling-to diagnose the training dynamics of quantum neural networks. We empirically find strong correlation between the dynamical behavior of the tripartite information and the loss function in the training process, from which we identify that the training process has two stages for randomly initialized networks. In the early stage, the network performance improves rapidly and the tripartite information increases linearly with a universal slope, meaning that the neural network becomes less scrambled than the random unitary. In the latter stage, the network performance improves slowly while the tripartite information decreases. We present evidences that the network constructs local correlations in the early stage and learns large-scale structures in the latter stage. We believe this two-stage training dynamics is universal and is applicable to a wide range of problems. Our work builds bridges between two research subjects of quantum neural networks and information scrambling, which opens up a new perspective to understand quantum neural networks.",
