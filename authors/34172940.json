            "title": "Intelligent Interface: Enhancing Lecture Engagement with Didactic Activity Summaries",
            "abstract": "Recently, multiple applications of machine learning have been introduced. They include various possibilities arising when image analysis methods are applied to, broadly understood, video streams. In this context, a novel tool, developed for academic educators to enhance the teaching process by automating, summarizing, and offering prompt feedback on conducting lectures, has been developed. The implemented prototype utilizes machine learning-based techniques to recognise selected didactic and behavioural teachers' features within lecture video recordings. Specifically, users (teachers) can upload their lecture videos, which are preprocessed and analysed using machine learning models. Next, users can view summaries of recognized didactic features through interactive charts and tables. Additionally, stored ML-based prediction results support comparisons between lectures based on their didactic content. In the developed application text-based models trained on lecture transcriptions, with enhancements to the transcription quality, by adopting an automatic speech recognition solution are applied. Furthermore, the system offers flexibility for (future) integration of new/additional machine-learning models and software modules for image and video analysis.",

            "abstract": "An important challenge in the study of complex systems is to identify appropriate effective variables at different times. In this paper, we explain why structures that are persistent with respect to changes in length and time scales are proper effective variables, and illustrate how persistent structures can be identified from the spectra and Fiedler vector of the graph Laplacian at different stages of the topological data analysis (TDA) filtration process for twelve toy models. We then investigated four market crashes, three of which were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In all four crashes, a persistent gap opens up in the Laplacian spectra when we go from a normal phase to a crash phase. In the crash phase, the persistent structure associated with the gap remains distinguishable up to a characteristic length scale \u03f5* where the first non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue changes most rapidly. Before \u03f5*, the distribution of components in the Fiedler vector is predominantly bi-modal, and this distribution becomes uni-modal after \u03f5*. Our findings hint at the possibility of understanding market crashs in terms of both continuous and discontinuous changes. Beyond the graph Laplacian, we can also employ Hodge Laplacians of higher order for future research.",

            "title": "Strategic differences between regional investments into graphene technology and how corporations and universities manage patent portfolios",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, patenting activities are essential in converting applied science to technology in the prevailing innovation model. To gain strategic advantages in the technological competitions between regions, nations need to leverage the investments of public and private funds to diversify over all technologies or specialize in a small number of technologies. In this paper, we investigated who the leaders are at the regional and assignee levels, how they attained their leadership positions, and whether they adopted diversification or specialization strategies, using a dataset of 176,193 patent records on graphene between 1986 and 2017 downloaded from Derwent Innovation. By applying a co-clustering method to the IPC subclasses in the patents and using a z-score method to extract keywords from their titles and abstracts, we identified seven graphene technology areas emerging in the sequence synthesis \u2013 composites \u2013 sensors \u2013 devices \u2013 catalyst \u2013 batteries \u2013 water treatment . We then examined the top regions in their investment preferences and their changes in rankings over time and found that they invested in all seven technology areas. In contrast, at the assignee level, some were diversified while others were specialized. To illustrate this difference, we classified assignees into different categories (corporations, universities, and others) and three quartile groups based on their accumulated patent credits. We also visualized the distributions of portfolio entropy and accumulated patent credits and how these evolved. We found significant differences between small entities and large entities, as well as between universities and corporations, in how they managed their patent portfolios. While large entities diversified their portfolios across multiple technology areas, small entities specialized around their core competencies. In addition, we found that universities had higher entropy values than corporations on average, leading us to the hypothesis that corporations file, buy, or sell patents to enable product development. In contrast, universities focus only on licensing their patents. We validated this hypothesis through an aggregate analysis of reassignment and licensing and a more detailed analysis of three case studies \u2013 SAMSUNG, RICE UNIVERSITY, and DYSON.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Scientific research is an essential stage of the innovation process. However, it remains unclear how a scientific idea becomes applied knowledge and, after that, a commercial product. This paper describes a hypothesis of innovation based on the emergence of new research fields from more mature research fields after interactions between the latter. We focus on graphene, a rising field in materials science, as a case study. First, we used a coclustering method on titles and abstracts of graphene papers to organize them into four meaningful and robust topics (theory and experimental tests, synthesis and functionalization, sensors, and supercapacitors and electrocatalysts). We also demonstrated that they emerged in the order listed. We then tested all topics against the literature on nanotubes and batteries, and the possible parent fields of theory and experimental tests, as well as supercapacitors and electrocatalysts. We found incubation signatures for all topics in the nanotube papers collection and weaker incubation signatures for supercapacitors and electrocatalysts in the battery papers collection. Surprisingly, we found and confirmed that the 2004 breakthrough in graphene created a stir in both the nanotube and battery fields. Our findings open the door for a better understanding of how and why new research fields coalesce.",

One signature of this information processing is the existence of recurrent sequences. In this paper, we developed a procedure for finding these sequences and a process of statistical significance testing to identify the most meaningful ones. To do so, we downloaded daily closing prices of the Dow Jones Industrial Average component stocks, as well as various assets like stock market indices, United States government bonds, precious metals, commodities, oil and gas, and foreign exchange. We mapped each financial instrument to a letter and their upward movements to words, before testing the frequencies of these words against a null model obtained by reshuffling the empirical time series. We then identify market leaders and followers from the statistically significant words in different cross sections of financial instruments, and interpret actionable trends that can be traded upon.",

This kind of discipline level analysis not only give insights of one particular field but also shed light on general principles of scientific enterprise. In this paper we focus on graphene research, a fast growing field covers both theoretical and applied study. Using co-clustering method, we split graphene literature into two groups and confirm that one group is about theoretical research (T) and another corresponds to applied research (A). We analyze the proportion of T/A and found applied research becomes more and more popular after 2007. Geographical analysis demonstrated that countries have different preference in terms of T/A and they reacted differently to research trend. The interaction between two groups has been analyzed and shows that T extremely relies on T and A heavily relies on A, however the situation is very stable for T but changed markedly for A. No geographic difference is found for the interaction dynamics. Our results give a comprehensive picture of graphene research evolution and also provide a general framework which is able to analyze other disciplines. \u2217Corresponding author Email address: wenyuan.liu@ntu.edu.sg (Wenyuan Liu,) 1These authors contributed equally.

            "abstract": "In econophysics, the achievements of information filtering methods over the past 20 years, such as the minimal spanning tree (MST) by Mantegna and the planar maximally filtered graph (PMFG) by Tumminello et al., should be celebrated. Here, we show how one can systematically improve upon this paradigm along two separate directions. First, we used topological data analysis (TDA) to extend the notions of nodes and links in networks to faces, tetrahedrons, or k-simplices in simplicial complexes. Second, we used the Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to acquire geometric information that cannot be provided by simple information filtering. In this sense, MSTs and PMFGs are but first steps to revealing the topological backbones of financial networks. This is something that TDA can elucidate more fully, following which the ORC can help us flesh out the geometry of financial networks. We applied these two approaches to a recent stock market crash in Taiwan and found that, beyond fusions and fissions, other non-fusion/fission processes such as cavitation, annihilation, rupture, healing, and puncture might also be important. We also successfully identified neck regions that emerged during the crash, based on their negative ORCs, and performed a case study on one such neck region.",

In the Hong Kong housing market from 1992 to 2010, signs of quasi-periodicity in housing price and transaction volume can be observed. We find that there is an overall periodicity of approximately 30 months in housing price changes and a strong lead\u2013lag relationship between housing price and transaction volume. Analysis of the cross-covariance of the housing price, transaction volume and prime lending rate reveals that this quasi-periodicity is potentially driven by prime lending rates. Incorporation of quasi-periodicity into the kernel of Gaussian processes further enables us to construct a predictive model of the Hong Kong housing price trends that outperforms other traditional kernel functions.",

Here we use the bibliographic coupling network, derived from all physics papers that were published in the Physical Review journals in the past century, to try to identify them as mainstream, out-of-the-box, or interdisciplinary. We show that the network clusters into scientific fields. The position of individual papers with respect to these clusters allows us to estimate their degree of mainstreamness or interdisciplinarity. We show that over the past decades the fraction of mainstream papers increases, the fraction of out-of-the-box decreases, and the fraction of interdisciplinary papers remains constant. Studying the rewards of papers, we find that in terms of absolute citations, both, mainstream and interdisciplinary papers are rewarded. In the long run, mainstream papers perform less than interdisciplinary ones in terms of citation rates. We conclude that to avoid a unilateral trend towards mainstreamness a new incentive scheme is necessary.",

            "abstract": "Human language contains regular syntactic structures and grammatical patterns that should be detectable in their co-occurence networks. However, most standard complex network measures can hardly differentiate between co-occurence networks built from an empirical corpus and a body of scrambled text. In this work, we employ a motif extraction procedure to show that empirical networks have much greater motif densities. We demonstrate that motifs function as efficient and effective shortcuts in language networks, potentially explaining why we are able to generate and decipher language expressions so rapidly. Finally we suggest a link between motifs and constructions in Construction Grammar as well as speculate on the mechanisms behind the emergence of constructions in the early stages of language acquisition.",
