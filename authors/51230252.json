            "title": "Focused Contrastive Loss for Classification With Pre-Trained Language Models",
            "abstract": "Contrastive learning, which learns data representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar instances, has achieved great success in various domains including natural language processing (NLP). Recently, it has been demonstrated that incorporating class labels into contrastive learning, i.e., supervised contrastive learning (SCL), can further enhance the quality of the learned data representations. Although several works have shown empirically that incorporating SCL into classification models leads to better performance, the mechanism of how SCL works for classification is less studied. In this paper, we first investigate how SCL facilitates the classifier learning, where we show that the contrastive region, i.e., the data instances involved in each contrasting operation, has a crucial link to the mechanism of SCL. We reveal that the vanilla SCL is suboptimal since its behavior can be altered by variances in class distributions. Based on this finding, we propose a Focused Contrastive Loss (FoCL) for classification. Compared with SCL, FoCL defines a finer contrastive region, focusing on the data instances surrounding decision boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on three NLP tasks: text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction. Experimental results show consistent and significant improvements of FoCL over strong baselines on various benchmark datasets, especially in few-shot scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can produce harmful responses, exposing users to unexpected risks when LLMs are deployed. Previous studies have proposed comprehensive taxonomies of the risks posed by LLMs, as well as corresponding prompts that can be used to examine the safety mechanisms of LLMs. However, the focus has been almost exclusively on English, and little has been explored for other languages. Here we aim to bridge this gap. We first introduce a dataset for the safety evaluation of Chinese LLMs, and then extend it to two other scenarios that can be used to better identify false negative and false positive examples in terms of risky prompt rejections. We further present a set of fine-grained safety assessment criteria for each risk type, facilitating both manual annotation and automatic evaluation in terms of LLM response harmfulness. Our experiments on five LLMs show that region-specific risks are the prevalent type of risk, presenting the major issue with all Chinese LLMs we experimented with.

Faced with the problem, the field of red teaming is experiencing fast-paced growth, which highlights the need for a comprehensive organization covering the entire pipeline and addressing emerging topics for the community. Our extensive survey, which examines over 120 papers, introduces a taxonomy of fine-grained attack strategies grounded in the inherent capabilities of language models. Additionally, we have developed the searcher framework that unifies various automatic red teaming approaches. Moreover, our survey covers novel areas including multimodal attacks and defenses, risks around multilingual models, overkill of harmless queries, and safety of downstream applications. We hope this survey can provide a systematic perspective on the field and unlock new areas of research.",

Loki adopts a human-centered approach, striking a balance between the quality of fact-checking and the cost of human involvement. It decomposes the fact-checking task into a five-step pipeline: breaking down long texts into individual claims, assessing their check-worthiness, generating queries, retrieving evidence, and verifying the claims. Instead of fully automating the claim verification process, Loki provides essential information at each step to assist human judgment, especially for general users such as journalists and content moderators. Moreover, it has been optimized for latency, robustness, and cost efficiency at a commercially usable level. Loki is released under an MIT license and is available on GitHub. We also provide a video presenting the system and its capabilities.",

The ChEMU 2020 lab provided two information extraction tasks, named entity recognition and event extraction. The ChEMU 2021 lab introduced one more task, anaphora resolution. This year, we re-run all the three tasks with new test data. Together, the tasks support comprehensive automatic chemical patent analysis. Herein, we describe the resources created for these tasks and the evaluation methodology adopted. We also provide a brief summary of the methods employed by participants of this lab and the results obtained across 22 runs from 3 teams, finding that several submissions achieve better results than the baseline methods prepared by the organizers.",

The ChEMU evaluation lab focuses on information extraction over chemical reactions from patent texts. As the second instance of our ChEMU lab series, we build upon the ChEMU corpus developed for ChEMU 2020, extending it for two distinct tasks related to reference resolution in chemical patents. Task 1 \u2014 Chemical Reaction Reference Resolution \u2014 focuses on paragraph-level references and aims to identify the chemical reactions or general conditions specified in one reaction description referred to by another. Task 2 \u2014 Anaphora Resolution \u2014 focuses on expression-level references and aims to identify the reference relationships between expressions in chemical reaction descriptions. Herein, we describe the resources created for these tasks and the evaluation methodology adopted. We also provide a brief sum-mary of the results obtained in this lab, finding that one submission achieves substantially better results than our baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Chemical patents represent a valuable source of information about new chemical compounds, which is critical to the drug discovery process. Automated information extraction over chemical patents is, however, a challenging task due to the large volume of existing patents and the complex linguistic properties of chemical patents. The Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), was introduced to support the development of advanced text mining techniques for chemical patents. The ChEMU 2020 lab proposed two fundamental information extraction tasks focusing on chemical reaction processes described in chemical patents: (1) chemical named entity recognition, requiring identification of essential chemical entities and their roles in chemical reactions, as well as reaction conditions; and (2) event extraction, which aims at identification of event steps relating the entities involved in chemical reactions. The ChEMU 2020 lab received 37 team registrations and 46 runs. Overall, the performance of submissions for these tasks exceeded our expectations, with the top systems outperforming strong baselines. We further show the methods to be robust to variations in sampling of the test data. We provide a detailed overview of the ChEMU 2020 corpus and its annotation, showing that inter-annotator agreement is very strong. We also present the methods adopted by participants, provide a detailed analysis of their performance, and carefully consider the potential impact of data leakage on interpretation of the results. The ChEMU 2020 Lab has shown the viability of automated methods to support information extraction of key information in chemical patents.",

            "abstract": ". The discovery of new chemical compounds is perceived as a key driver of the chemistry industry and many other economic sectors. The information about the new discoveries are usually disclosed in sci-enti\ufb01c literature and in particular, in chemical patents, since patents are often the \ufb01rst venues where the new chemical compounds are publicized. Despite the signi\ufb01cance of the information provided in chemical patents, extracting the information from patents is costly due to the large volume of existing patents and its drastic expansion rate. The Cheminformat-ics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), provides a platform to advance the state-of-the-arts in automatic information extraction systems over chemical patents. In particular, we focus on extracting synthesis process of new chemical compounds from chemical patents. Using the ChEMU corpus of 1500 \u201csnippets\u201d (text segments) sampled from 170 patent documents and annotated by chemical experts, we de\ufb01ned two key information extraction tasks. Task 1 targets at chemical named entity recognition, i.e., the identi\ufb01cation of chemical compounds and their speci\ufb01c roles in chemical reactions. Task 2 targets at event extraction, i.e., the identi\ufb01cation of reaction steps, relating the chemical compounds involved in a chemical reaction. In this paper, we provide an overview of our ChEMU2020 lab. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks, the evaluation methodology adopted, and participants results. We also provide a brief summary of the meth-ods employed by participants of this lab and the results obtained across 46 runs from 11 teams, \ufb01nding that several submissions achieve substantially better results than the baseline methods prepared by the organizers.",

            "abstract": "Chemical patents are an important resource for chemical information. However, few chemical Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems have been evaluated on patent documents, due in part to their structural and linguistic complexity. In this paper, we explore the NER performance of a BiLSTM-CRF model utilising pre-trained word embeddings, character-level word representations and contextualized ELMo word representations for chemical patents. We compare word embeddings pre-trained on biomedical and chemical patent corpora. The effect of tokenizers optimized for the chemical domain on NER performance in chemical patents is also explored. The results on two patent corpora show that contextualized word representations generated from ELMo substantially improve chemical NER performance w.r.t. the current state-of-the-art. We also show that domain-specific resources such as word embeddings trained on chemical patents and chemical-specific tokenizers, have a positive impact on NER performance.",
