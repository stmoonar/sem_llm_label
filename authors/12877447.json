            "title": "A Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework for Fake News Detection",
            "abstract": "Recently, the wanton dissemination of fake news on social media has adversely affected our lives, rendering automatic fake news detection a pressing issue. Current methods are often fully supervised and typically employ deep neural networks (DNN) to learn implicit relevance from labeled data, ignoring explicitly shared properties (e.g., inflammatory expressions) across fake news. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-theoretic framework, called Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework (GDMRFF), that inherits the capability of deep learning while at the same time exploiting the correlations among the news articles (including labeled and unlabeled data). Specifically, we first leverage a DNN-based module to learn implicit relations, which we then reveal as the unary function of MRF. Pairwise functions with refining effects to encapsulate human insights are designed to capture the explicit association among all samples. Meanwhile, an event removal module is introduced to remove event impact on pairwise functions. Note that we train GDMRFF with the semi-supervised setting, which decreases the reliance on labeled data while maximizing the potential of unlabeled data. We further develop an Ambiguity Learning Guided MRF (ALGM) model as a concretization of GDMRFF. Experiments show that ALGM outperforms the compared methods significantly on two datasets, especially when labeled data is limited.",

            "title": "Augmenting Affective Dependency Graph via Iterative Incongruity Graph Learning for Sarcasm Detection",
            "abstract": "Recently, progress has been made towards improving automatic sarcasm detection in computer science. Among existing models, manually constructing static graphs for texts and then using graph neural networks (GNNs) is one of the most effective approaches for drawing long-range incongruity patterns. However, the manually constructed graph structure might be prone to errors (e.g., noisy or incomplete) and not optimal for the sarcasm detection task. Errors produced during the graph construction step cannot be remedied and may accrue to the following stages, resulting in poor performance. To surmount the above limitations, we explore a novel Iterative Augmenting Affective Graph and Dependency Graph (IAAD) framework to jointly and iteratively learn the incongruity graph structure. IAAD can alternatively update the incongruity graph structure and node representation until the learning graph structure is optimal for the metrics of sarcasm detection. More concretely, we begin with deriving an affective and a dependency graph for each instance, then an iterative incongruity graph learning module is employed to augment affective and dependency graphs for obtaining the optimal inconsistent semantic graph with the goal of optimizing the graph for the sarcasm detection task. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for sarcasm detection with significant margins.",
