            "abstract": "Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are a crucial tool for evaluating policies in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where exploration is often infeasible, unethical, or expensive. However, the extent to which such methods can be trusted under adversarial threats to data quality is largely unexplored. In this work, we make the first attempt at investigating the sensitivity of OPE methods to marginal adversarial perturbations to the data. We design a generic data poisoning attack framework leveraging influence functions from robust statistics to carefully construct perturbations that maximize error in the policy value estimates. We carry out extensive experimentation with multiple healthcare and control datasets. Our results demonstrate that many existing OPE methods are highly prone to generating value estimates with large errors when subject to data poisoning attacks, even for small adversarial perturbations. These findings question the reliability of policy values derived using OPE methods and motivate the need for developing OPE methods that are statistically robust to train-time data poisoning attacks.",

            "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, robust policies for high-stakes decision-making problems with limited data are usually computed by optimizing the percentile criterion, which minimizes the probability of a catastrophic failure. Unfortunately, such policies are typically overly conservative as the percentile criterion is non-convex, difficult to optimize, and ignores the mean performance. To overcome these shortcomings, we study the soft-robust criterion, which uses risk measures to balance the mean and percentile criteria better. In this paper, we establish the soft-robust criterion's fundamental properties, show that it is NP-hard to optimize, and propose and analyze two algorithms to optimize it approximately. Our theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithms compute much less conservative solutions than the existing approximate methods for optimizing the percentile-criterion.",

            "title": "Clay Codes: Moulding MDS Codes to Yield an MSR Code",
            "abstract": "With increase in scale, the number of node failures in a data center increases sharply. To ensure availability of data, failure-tolerance schemes such as Reed-Solomon (RS) or more generally, Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) erasure codes are used. However, while MDS codes offer minimum storage overhead for a given amount of failure tolerance, they do not meet other practical needs of today's data centers. Although modern codes such as Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes are designed to meet these practical needs, they are available only in highly-constrained theoretical constructions, that are not sufficiently mature enough for practical implementation. We present Clay codes that extract the best from both worlds. Clay (short for Coupled-Layer) codes are MSR codes that offer a simplified construction for decoding/repair by using pairwise coupling across multiple stacked layers of any single MDS code. \n \nIn addition, Clay codes provide the first practical implementation of an MSR code that offers (a) low storage overhead, (b) simultaneous optimality in terms of three key parameters: repair bandwidth, sub-packetization level and disk I/O, (c) uniform repair performance of data and parity nodes and (d) support for both single and multiple-node repairs, while permitting faster and more efficient repair. \n \nWhile all MSR codes are vector codes, none of the distributed storage systems support vector codes. We have modified Ceph to support any vector code, and our contribution is now a part of Ceph's master codebase. We have implemented Clay codes, and integrated it as a plugin to Ceph. Six example Clay codes were evaluated on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances and code parameters were carefully chosen to match known erasure-code deployments in practice. A particular example code, with storage overhead 1:25x, is shown to reduce repair network traffic by a factor of 2:9 in comparison with RS codes and similar reductions are obtained for both repair time and disk read.",
