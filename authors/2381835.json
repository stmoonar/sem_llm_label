            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Finding the shortest path through open spaces is a well-known challenge for pedestrian routing engines. A common solution is routing on the open space boundary, which causes in most cases an unnecessarily long route. A possible alternative is to create a subgraph within the open space. This paper assesses this approach and investigates its implications for routing engines. A number of algorithms (Grid, Spider-Grid, Visibility, Delaunay, Voronoi, Skeleton) have been evaluated by four different criteria: (i) Number of additional created graph edges, (ii) additional graph creation time, (iii) route computation time, (iv) routing quality. We show that each algorithm has advantages and disadvantages depending on the use case. We identify the algorithms Visibility with a reduced number of edges in the subgraph and Spider-Grid with a large grid size to be a good compromise in many scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The mechanization of processes in agriculture is growing within the last hundred years. Within the last decades, the information technology in this sector constantly grew and data is one of the key factors for process optimization. For planning and execution of logistic processes and harvest campaigns, road maps and field geometries are essential to guide the large vehicles to their work places and to optimize harvest chains. Through nowadays available telemetry data of these vehicles, a new data source generates new opportunities. Mining geographic data from these movement data, that can improve agricultural work processes is one of the main objectives of this thesis. As a first step, data cleaning processes, and further preprocessing steps are shown. With classification algorithms, the continuous movement data will be separated into different work processes. Based on this data, algorithms to generate geographic geographic features, such as field boundaries have been analyzed and improved. As quality metric to compare the results, the Jaccard-Distance has been established. With the classified road representing measurements, the rural road networks were created and the results of different algorithmic approaches have been compared. The usability of volunteered geographic information to route the heterogeneous set of agricultural vehicles is shown in a third step. Due to the fact, that routes for e.g. harvesters are not ending at the field boundary, solutions for infield route graph generation have been given. The presented components provide the content and the services within a framework structure. The concluding prototype, a web based routing system demonstrates the interaction of all components and provides a consecutive routing from farm to field and within the field.",

The framework implements interfaces for interacting with data providers and integrates performant spatial databases for passing storage intense analysis methods on complex datasets. Preprocessing steps include methods to efficiently handle raw data to filter erroneous records and detect noisy outliers. While previously mentioned steps are described briefly, the focus is on an approach to automatically extract geographic features such as field boundaries from the filtered data. This is done using the supervised k-Nearest Neighbors classification method to determine the specific working-mode of the machine and differentiate between field work and road. To find and construct meaningful metrics leading to the required objective, a so-called Space-Time-Cube was utilized which depicts trajectories from agricultural machines in 3dimensional space.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays mobile phones and especially smart phones are common technical communication devices. Most of them are equipped with a huge number of sensors that detect environment and user interaction. The processing of the sensor measurements is a big challenge as the data is very heterogeneous and frequently available. Usage of these low cost sensors and combining them with other data sources is one of the most promising tasks and will speed up the crowd sourced (geo-)data in the future. This vision will only become reality if we are able to establish techniques to integrate different devices and test many varied situations. In this work, we present a framework for storing, fusioning and processing of mobile smartphone sensor data. Further we give an outlook on possible applications and our future work.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides a sample for acquiring and processing crowd sourced mobile sensor data. An infrastructure for receiving and storing has been developed as well as the corresponding clients that collect smartphone sensor data and send them to the server. Tests and statistics were generated to get first impressions how data logging and storing will work. To analyze the collected data, a web based visualizing toolkit has been connected as well as a processing framework to generate refined geodata. Giving an example on possibilities with crowd sourced sensor data a classification approach using crowd generated categories and data mining methods.",

            "title": "An Algorithm Based Methodology for the Creation of a Regularly Updated Global Online Map Derived From Volunteered Geographic Information",
            "abstract": "Global online maps are an important tool and data sets such for such maps are normally provided by commercial providers or public authorities. Nevertheless, the ever expanding trend of collaboratively collected geodata by hobbyists, namely Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), increases regarding both data quantity and quality. Therefore, VGI can be considered as a real alternative data source for the provision of a global online map service, similar to those provided by Google Maps or Bing Maps. Therefore, an online map service needs to be created, whereby relevant data comes from a regularly updated database containing VGI. Due to the dynamic and fast changing nature of VGI sources, the workflow for processing VGI data needs to be automated on a regular base. The particular innovation of the here presented approach is that after an initial data import all required processing steps for transforming VGI data into a map- optimized data structure, is done internally with SQL database functions. That is, the processing is purely based on database technology and no additional software is required. The developed system uses standards and open-source software and is publicly available at www.osm-wms.de. The data can be consumed by either using a user adaptable standardized WMS, or via a high-performance web map application with partly pre-rendered map tiles. With the here presented approach, an regularly updated map based on open data can be provided.",
