            "title": "Probabilistic Solar Generation Forecasting for Rapidly Changing Weather Conditions",
            "abstract": "Probabilistic solar generation forecasting provides a better means of quantifying generation uncertainties for power grid operations by providing a range of potential power outputs rather than a single-point estimate. The traditional probabilistic models are unreliable under rapidly changing weather conditions due to fluctuating data correlations, necessitating dynamic modeling of spatio-temporal feature correlations under diverse weather scenarios. The correlations represent the interactions across space and time that reflect the impact of weather conditions on solar power output. This paper addresses this critical problem with a novel method by fusing copula theory and machine learning methods to dynamically quantify the spatio-temporal correlations among meteorological data under diverse weather conditions. The meteorological data and the functions employed to estimate spatio-temporal correlations change dynamically based on weather conditions. A data-driven environment-aware model has been developed to produce probabilistic forecasts from this data, effectively quantifying uncertainty in meteorological data. Case studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed dynamic method exhibits robust performance in solar irradiance and solar power forecasting. Moreover, the model outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 60% higher accuracy under non-sunny conditions in autumn and winter.",

            "abstract": "A robust system should perform well under random failures or targeted attacks, and networks have been widely used to model the underlying structure of complex systems such as communication, infrastructure, and transportation networks. Hence, network robustness becomes critical to understanding system robustness. In this paper, we propose a spectral measure for network robustness: the second spectral moment $m_{2}$ of the network. Our results show that a smaller second spectral moment $m_{2}$ indicates a more robust network. We demonstrate both theoretically and with extensive empirical studies that the second spectral moment can help (1) capture various traditional measures of network robustness; (2) assess the robustness of networks; (3) design networks with controlled robustness; and (4) study how complex networked systems (e.g., power systems) behave under cascading failures.",

            "abstract": "Real-time Transient Stability Assessment (TSA) is essential for prompt control decisions that lead to a stable power system. With the wide deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in power grids, data-driven TSA approaches, particularly those based on machine learning (ML) techniques, have become increasingly relevant in recent years. Within cycles, the well-trained ML-based TSA classifiers enable accurately assessing the post-fault transient stability of a power system. However, events that lead to transient instability are rare. Hence, the training datasets used by ML-based classifiers are highly imbalanced, challenging the accuracy of these methods. An imbalanced dataset, where the number of unstable samples is significantly lower than the number of stable samples, will result in an inaccurate and biased classifier. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is utilized to generate synthetic unstable datasets by learning from the real unstable transient data, with a goal to balance the distribution of the stable and unstable datasets. To learn the spatial and temporal correlations of the PMU data, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the correlation loss are utilized to construct the GAN model. Comparison with other data resampling methods demonstrates that the developed GAN model addresses the problem of an imbalanced training dataset, and results in more accurate machine learning-based algorithms for TSA.",

            "abstract": "Online transient stability assessment (TSA) is essential for secure and stable power system operations. The growing number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) brings about massive sources of data that can enhance online TSA. However, conventional data-driven methods require large amounts of transient data to correctly assess the transient stability state of a system. In this paper, a new data-driven TSA approach is developed for TSA with fewer data compared to the conventional methods. The data reduction is enabled by learning the dynamic behaviors of the historical transient data using generative and adversarial networks (GAN). This knowledge is used online to predict the voltage time series data after a transient event. A classifier embedded in the generative network deploys the predicted post-contingency data to determine the stability of the system following a fault. The developed GAN-based TSA approach preserves the spatial and temporal correlations that exist in multivariate PMU time series data. Hence, in comparison with the state-of-the-art TSA methods, it achieves a higher assessment accuracy using only one sample of the measured data and a shorter response time. Case studies conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the superior performance of the GAN-based method compared to the conventional data-driven techniques.",

            "abstract": "As electric power grids are increasingly growing in scale and complexity, modeling and analysis of cascading failures become more critical. In this paper, a new method is proposed for identification of critical components using global and relative indices. These indices are extracted from the data from cascading failure analysis based on distributed slack power flow under load uncertainty. The proposed model considers fast propagation of failures and avoids the problems caused by the common assumption that optimal power flow can be implemented between subsequent failures. It also alleviates the unrealistic assignment of criticality to the transmission lines that are in the vicinity of slack bus in cascading failure models based on power flow solution. The proposed model and analysis are tested on Illinois 200-bus system and results are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Grid operators are required to keep a certain level of spinning reserves to ensure system reliability. To keep the same level of reliability in systems with increased penetration of intermittent generation resources, such as wind and solar, these spinning reserves should be increased, leading to increased operations costs. This paper investigates the capability of demand response in eliminating the need for additional spinning reserves in systems with high levels of uncertainty due to wind resources. Demand response is modeled as a responsive load in which customers change their energy consumption with respect to change in the price of electricity. The cost of spinning reserves is computed using a day-ahead unit commitment and economic dispatch, while capturing load and generation uncertainties. Numerical simulations on a testbed power system indicate that an effective demand response program can offset the cost of operations by reducing the need for additional spinning reserves.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale adoption of renewable energy resources is a relatively new concept for the utilities, and the best ways to integrate these resources into existing power grids is yet to be determined. Renewable energy resources are dramatically different from conventional resources, and are intermittent in nature. Studies have confirmed that the impacts of renewables are largely system-dependent. Hence, to keep bulk power systems reliable and yet facilitate massive integration of wind and solar energy resources, optimal strategies for making use of the remaining conventional generation resources and retiring others are needed. This paper proposes a methodology to determine the best candidate, among traditional resources, for retirement and replacement by wind power generation resources. The goal is to ensure that during unplanned wind power unavailability, power systems remain reliable. High wind penetration scenarios on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems are analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the developed methodology on maintaining system steady-state stability and reliability.",

            "abstract": "Failure propagation in power systems, and the possibility of becoming a cascading event, depend significantly on power system operating conditions. To make informed operating decisions that aim at preventing cascading failures, it is crucial to know the most probable failures based on operating conditions that are close to real-time conditions. In this paper, this need is addressed by developing a cascading failure model that is adaptive to different operating conditions and can quantify the impact of failed grid components on other components. With a three-step approach, the developed model enables predicting potential sequence of failures in a cascading failure, given system operating conditions. First, the interactions between system components under various operating conditions are quantified using the data collected offline, from a simulation-based failure model. Next, given measured line power flows, the most probable interactions corresponding to the system operating conditions are identified. Finally, these interactions are used to predict potential sequence of failures with a propagation tree model. The performance of the developed model under a specific operating condition is evaluated on both IEEE 30-bus and Illinois 200-bus systems, using various evaluation metrics such as Jaccard coefficient, $F_{1}$ score, Precision@ $K$ , and Kendall\u2019s tau.",

Hence, ensuring reliability under high penetration of PV systems would require additional reserves, purchase of power from real-time markets, or renewable curtailments, all of which dramatically increase cost of power generation and transmission. Accurate PV forecasting can eliminate the need for these costly measures and is necessary for seamless grid operations with high levels of solar PV systems. PV forecasting, however, is challenged by the fact that PV generation behavior differs in different regions and under different weather patterns. Hence, it is critical to consider both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data when developing a data-driven forecast model. This paper seeks to provide a comparison of different methods for forecasting solar irradiance, using data from the Syracuse area, with diverse weather patterns that challenge PV forecasting. For a large dataset, a new approach to forecasting based on Symbolic Aggregate Approximation is introduced which enables increasing the calculation speed and reducing the dimensions for accurate forecasting.",

            "abstract": "An effective model to represent real-world wind power production scenarios is essential for an accurate assessment of the impact of wind power generation on power systems. Such a model should capture the spatial and temporal correlations between different wind turbines that are part of a wind farm. Accurate modeling of these correlations will ensure that the wind power uncertainty can be properly quantified. This is especially critical when analyzing systems with high penetration of wind power productions. This paper addresses this critical need by developing the Hourly Mixed Copula Model, a new probabilistic model, based on Gaussian and Archimedean copulas, to model the uncertainty and variability of wind power generation. This model enables the simulation of realistic scenarios of a wind farm power production. Metrics such as the Euclidean distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model in incorporating the spatio-temporal dependence among the turbine power productions. The impact of accurate characterization of uncertainty in wind power modeling on power system steady-state operational planning is also demonstrated by case studies. These studies indicate that, in order to correctly evaluate the effect of wind power variation on steady-state operational planning, the dependence among wind power resources should not be neglected for power flow studies.",
