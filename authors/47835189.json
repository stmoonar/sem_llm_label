            "title": "Digital Twin-Driven Reinforcement Learning Method for Marine Equipment Vehicles Scheduling Problem",
            "abstract": "In the traditional marine equipment construction process, the material transportation vehicle scheduling method dominated by manual experience has shown great limitations, which is inefficient, costly, wasteful of human resources, and unable to cope with complex and changing scheduling scenarios. The existing scheduling system cannot realize the information interaction and collaborative integration between the physical world and the virtual world, while the digital twin (DT) technology can effectively solve the problem of real-time information interaction and the reinforcement learning (RL) method can cope with dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposed a DT-driven RL method to solve the marine equipment vehicle scheduling problem. Given the dynamic nature of transportation tasks, the diversity of transported goods, and the optimization characteristics of transportation requirements, a framework for scheduling transportation vehicle operations based on DT is constructed, and a RL-based vehicle scheduling method in a dynamic task environment is proposed. A Markov decision process (MDP) model of the vehicle scheduling process is established to realize one-to-one mapping between information and physical elements. An improved RL method based on Q-learning is proposed to solve the MDP model, and the value function approximation and convergence enhancement methods are applied to optimize the solving process. Finally, a case study is used for example verification to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. Note to Practitioners\u2014The motivation of this paper is to optimize material transportation vehicle scheduling in dynamic task environments and to improve logistics transportation efficiency. Therefore, a DT-based vehicle scheduling method for marine equipment is proposed. Firstly, a framework of vehicle scheduling based on DT is designed to establish a MDP model of the vehicle scheduling process, and the dynamic task characteristics are described by mathematical methods in the design of the elements of the model. A RL-based vehicle scheduling method is proposed. The value function approximation method and the convergence enhancement method of the algorithm are investigated for the characteristics of continuous dynamic action features leading to huge state space and non-convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm performance is verified and analyzed through data validation of actual cases.",

            "title": "An AI-Augmented Kalman Filter Approach to Monitoring Network Traffic Matrix",
            "abstract": "Many network operations depend on traffic matrix (TM). However, how to obtain TM often turns out as a dilemma, i.e., direct measurements have a high accuracy but with a high operation cost, while indirect measurements save measurement budgets but at the cost of lowering accuracy. In this article, we propose an AI-Augmented Kalman filter, attempting to exploit the best of both. By viewing TM as the unknown state and indirect measurements as state observations, TM estimation is formulated as a filtering problem. Unlike the conventional Kalman filter that assumes explicit model knowledge for both state prediction and update, we learn them from direct measurements of TM and construct the AI-Augmented Kalman filter in a data-driven way. Specifically, a novel recurrent neural network called ConvGRU, is employed to capture characteristics like spatio-temporal correlations and traffic dynamics, in regard to establishing relationships for both state transition and difference reasoning of state observation. Evaluations on real datasets demonstrate that TM estimated by our proposed scheme gains superior accuracy compared with existing methods. Since both direct and indirect measurements are employed for TM monitoring, our proposed scheme also enables one to further develop a balance between performance and cost according to their practical deployments.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, aiming at a large infrastructure structural health monitoring network, a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) image denoising algorithm is proposed to process original data, and a depth feedforward neural network (FNN) is introduced to extract physical information from the denoised data. A Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA)-distributed sensor system is established, and a QWT denoising algorithm and a temperature extraction scheme using FNN are demonstrated. The results indicate that when the frequency interval is less than 4 MHz, the temperature error is kept within \u00b10.11 \u00b0C, but is \u00b10.15 \u00b0C at 6 MHz. It takes less than 17 s to extract the temperature distribution from the FNN. Moreover, input vectors for the Brillouin gain spectrum with a frequency interval of no more than 6 MHZ are unified into 200 input elements by linear interpolation. We hope that with the progress in technology and algorithm optimization, the FNN information extraction and QWT denoising technology will play an important role in distributed optical fiber sensor networks for real-time monitoring of large-scale infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Semantic matching is a mainstream paradigm of zero-shot relation extraction, which matches a given input with a corresponding label description. The entities in the input should exactly match their hypernyms in the description, while the irrelevant contexts should be ignored when matching.However, general matching methods lack explicit modeling of the above matching pattern. In this work, we propose a fine-grained semantic matching method tailored for zero-shot relation extraction. Guided by the above matching pattern, we decompose the sentence-level similarity score into the entity matching score and context matching score. Considering that not all contextual words contribute equally to the relation semantics, we design a context distillation module to reduce the negative impact of irrelevant components on context matching. Experimental results show that our method achieves higher matching accuracy and more than 10 times faster inference speed, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "The principle of continual relation extraction~(CRE) involves adapting to emerging novel relations while preserving od knowledge. While current endeavors in CRE succeed in preserving old knowledge, they tend to fail when exposed to contaminated data streams. We assume this is attributed to their reliance on an artificial hypothesis that the data stream has no annotation errors, which hinders real-world applications for CRE. Considering the ubiquity of noisy labels in real-world datasets, in this paper, we formalize a more practical learning scenario, termed as \\textit{noisy-CRE}. Building upon this challenging setting, we develop a noise-resistant contrastive framework named as \\textbf{N}oise-guided \\textbf{a}ttack in \\textbf{C}ontrative \\textbf{L}earning~(NaCL) to learn incremental corrupted relations. Compared to direct noise discarding or inaccessible noise relabeling, we present modifying the feature space to match the given noisy labels via attacking can better enrich contrastive representations. Extensive empirical validations highlight that NaCL can achieve consistent performance improvements with increasing noise rates, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Pretrained language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, pretraining has recently shifted toward larger models and larger data, and this has resulted in significant computational and energy costs. In this paper, we propose Influence Subset Selection (ISS) for language model, which explicitly utilizes end-task knowledge to select a tiny subset of the pretraining corpus. Specifically, the ISS selects the samples that will provide the most positive influence on the performance of the end-task. Furthermore, we design a gradient matching based influence estimation method, which can drastically reduce the computation time of influence. With only 0.45% of the data and a three-orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost, ISS outperformed pretrained models (e.g., RoBERTa) on eight datasets covering four domains.",

However, their robustness and abilities to handle various complexities of the open world have yet to be explored, which is especially crucial in assessing the stability of models and is a key aspect of trustworthy AI. In this study, we perform a comprehensive experimental analysis of GPT-3.5, exploring its robustness using 21 datasets (about 116K test samples) with 66 text transformations from TextFlint that cover 9 popular Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. Our findings indicate that while GPT-3.5 outperforms existing fine-tuned models on some tasks, it still encounters significant robustness degradation, such as its average performance dropping by up to 35.74\\% and 43.59\\% in natural language inference and sentiment analysis tasks, respectively. We also show that GPT-3.5 faces some specific robustness challenges, including robustness instability, prompt sensitivity, and number sensitivity. These insights are valuable for understanding its limitations and guiding future research in addressing these challenges to enhance GPT-3.5's overall performance and generalization abilities.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to be sensitive towards perturbations on input samples, and previous works high-light that adversarial samples are even more vulnerable than normal ones. In this work, this phenomenon is illustrated from the perspective of sharpness via visualizing the input loss landscape of models. We \ufb01rst show that adversarial samples locate in steep and narrow local minima of the loss landscape ( high sharpness ) while normal samples, which differs distinctly from adversarial ones, reside in the loss surface that is more \ufb02atter ( low sharpness ). Based on this, we propose a simple and effective sharpness-based detector to distinct adversarial samples by maximizing the loss increment within the region where the inference sample is located. Considering that the notion of sharpness of a loss landscape is relative, we further propose an adaptive optimization strategy in an attempt to fairly compare the relative sharpness among different samples. Experimental results show that our approach can outperform previous detection methods by large margins (average +6.6 F1 score) for four advanced attack strategies considered in this paper across three text classi\ufb01cation tasks.

            "abstract": "High accuracy, high adaptability and low complexity have always been the goals of on-board state of health (SoH) estimation in a well-designed battery management system for electric vehicles. In this article, we proposed a practical SoH estimation method for LiFePO4 batteries based on Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) and incremental capacity (IC) analysis. According to the close correlation between the SoH and the IC curve of LiFePO4 battery, the peak coordinates of the curve are extracted as capacity feature to train an aging model using GMR. The capacity degradation of batteries is well described by multiple Gaussian distributions, and the estimation accuracy of SoH is improved. Furthermore, the coordinates of three peaks in the curve are separately analyzed as capacity feature to enhance the adaptability of the aging model to different charging regions. Finally, the complexity of the proposed method is compared with that of other methods. The results show that taking the coordinates of any peak as the capacity feature, SoH can be accurately estimated based on GMR even for different tested batteries, and the mean absolute error and root mean square error are both less than 1%.",

            "abstract": "Task embeddings are task-specific vectors designed to construct a semantic space of tasks, which can be used to predict the most transferable source task for a given target task via the similarity between task embeddings. However, existing methods use optimized parameters and representations as task embeddings, resulting in substantial computational complexity and storage requirements. In this work, we draw inspiration from the operating mechanism of deep neural networks (DNNs) and biological brains, where neuronal activations are sparse and task-specific, and we use the connectivity patterns of neurons as a unique identifier associated with the task. The proposed method learns to assign importance masks for sub-structures of DNNs, and accordingly indicate the task-specific connectivity patterns. In addition to the storage advantages brought by the binary masking mechanism and structured sparsity, the early-bird nature of the sparse optimization process can deliver an efficient computation advantage. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms other baselines in predicting inter-task transferability across data regimes and transfer settings, while keeping high efficiency in computation and storage.",
