The extra operations permit the description of hierarchical systems, and ones with evolving geometry.",

As a consequence, we are able to study the relation of minimization and minimal realization to serial composition of automata using (co)lax (co)monads. We are led to define suitable behaviour categories and prove minimal realization theorems that extend classical results.",

The second is Span(Graph), an algebra of specifications of systems (nondeterminist ic transition systems), which is a discrete cartesian bicategory, in which the natural feedback is instantaneous. This algebra provides a compositional cal culus of transition systems with interfaces, which generalizes the operation of product of automata of [A94], [Z87], and Kurshan. Further, to an expression in each algebra there is a grap hic representation, which corresponds to the distributed nature of the system. We show here that in addition to the discrete examples d escribed earlier also continuous linear systems (including RLC circuits) are examples of the alg bra. The main difference between this approach and the traditional one [Rugh96] is that our theory is completely compositional, and includes in a common framework the continuous and the disc rete.

We then provide a full specification of the procedure, followed by its application in relation to each of the examples. Finally, we provide a formulation of the procedure in terms of graphs and presentations of actions of graphs (automata) which is more convenient for theoretical purposes.",
