            "title": "Breaking the Time-Frequency Granularity Discrepancy in Time-Series Anomaly Detection",
            "abstract": "In light of the remarkable advancements made in time-series anomaly detection(TSAD), recent emphasis has been placed on exploiting the frequency domain as well as the time domain to address the difficulties in precisely detecting pattern-wise anomalies. However, in terms of anomaly scores, the window granularity of the frequency domain is inherently distinct from the data-point granularity of the time domain. Owing to this discrepancy, the anomaly information in the frequency domain has not been utilized to its full potential for TSAD. In this paper, we propose a TSAD framework, Dual-TF, that simultaneously uses both the time and frequency domains while breaking the time-frequency granularity discrepancy. To this end, our framework employs nested-sliding windows, with the outer and inner windows responsible for the time and frequency domains, respectively, and aligns the anomaly scores of the two domains. As a result of the high resolution of the aligned scores, the boundaries of pattern-wise anomalies can be identified more precisely. In six benchmark datasets, our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.0--147%, as demonstrated by experimental results.",

            "abstract": "In real-world continual learning (CL) scenarios, tasks often exhibit intricate and unpredictable semantic shifts, posing challenges for fixed prompt management strategies which are tailored to only handle semantic shifts of uniform degree (i.e., uniformly mild or uniformly abrupt). To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive prompting approach that effectively accommodates semantic shifts of varying degree where mild and abrupt shifts are mixed. AdaPromptCL employs the assign-and-refine semantic grouping mechanism that dynamically manages prompt groups in accordance with the semantic similarity between tasks, enhancing the quality of grouping through continuous refinement. Our experiment results demonstrate that AdaPromptCL outperforms existing prompting methods by up to 21.3%, especially in the benchmark datasets with diverse semantic shifts between tasks.",

            "abstract": "Summarizing text-rich documents has been long studied in the literature, but most of the existing efforts have been made to summarize a static and predefined multi-document set. With the rapid development of online platforms for generating and distributing text-rich documents, there arises an urgent need for continuously summarizing dynamically evolving multi-document sets where the composition of documents and sets is changing over time. This is especially challenging as the summarization should be not only effective in incorporating relevant, novel, and distinctive information from each concurrent multi-document set, but also efficient in serving online applications. In this work, we propose a new summarization problem, Evolving Multi-Document sets stream Summarization (EMDS), and introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm PDSum with the idea of prototype-driven continuous summarization. PDSum builds a lightweight prototype of each multi-document set and exploits it to adapt to new documents while preserving accumulated knowledge from previous documents. To update new summaries, the most representative sentences for each multi-document set are extracted by measuring their similarities to the prototypes. A thorough evaluation with real multi-document sets streams demonstrates that PDSum outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised multi-document summarization algorithms in EMDS in terms of relevance, novelty, and distinctiveness and is also robust to various evaluation settings.",

            "abstract": "Due to the continuing colossal socio-economic losses caused by traffic accidents, it is of prime importance to precisely forecast the traffic accident risk to reduce future accidents. In this paper, we use dangerous driving statistics from driving log data and multi-graph learning to enhance predictive performance. We first conduct geographical and temporal correlation analyses to quantify the relationship between dangerous driving and actual accidents. Then, to learn various dependencies between districts besides the traditional adjacency matrix, we simultaneously model both static and dynamic graphs representing the spatio-temporal contextual relationships with heterogeneous environmental data, including the dangerous driving behavior. A graph is generated for each type of the relationships. Ultimately, we propose an end-to-end framework, called MG-TAR, to effectively learn the association of multiple graphs for accident risk prediction by adopting multi-view graph neural networks with a multi-attention module. Thorough experiments on ten real-world datasets show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, MG-TAR reduces the error of predicting the accident risk by up to 23% and improves the accuracy of predicting the most dangerous areas by up to 27%.",

            "abstract": "Text classification is essential for organizing unstructured text. Traditional methods rely on human annotations or, more recently, a set of class seed words for supervision, which can be costly, particularly for specialized or emerging domains. To address this, using class surface names alone as extremely weak supervision has been proposed. However, existing approaches treat different levels of text granularity (documents, sentences, or words) independently, disregarding inter-granularity class disagreements and the context identifiable exclusively through joint extraction. In order to tackle these issues, we introduce MEGClass, an extremely weakly-supervised text classification method that leverages Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities. MEGClass utilizes coarse- and fine-grained context signals obtained by jointly considering a document's most class-indicative words and sentences. This approach enables the learning of a contextualized document representation that captures the most discriminative class indicators. By preserving the heterogeneity of potential classes, MEGClass can select the most informative class-indicative documents as iterative feedback to enhance the initial word-based class representations and ultimately fine-tune a pre-trained text classifier. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly supervised methods.",

            "abstract": "Unsupervised discovery of stories with correlated news articles in real-time helps people digest massive news streams without expensive human annotations. A common approach of the existing studies for unsupervised online story discovery is to represent news articles with symbolic- or graph-based embedding and incrementally cluster them into stories. Recent large language models are expected to improve the embedding further, but a straightforward adoption of the models by indiscriminately encoding all information in articles is ineffective to deal with text-rich and evolving news streams. In this work, we propose a novel thematic embedding with an off-the-shelf pretrained sentence encoder to dynamically represent articles and stories by considering their shared temporal themes. To realize the idea for unsupervised online story discovery, a scalable framework USTORY is introduced with two main techniques, theme- and time-aware dynamic embedding and novelty-aware adaptive clustering, fueled by lightweight story summaries. A thorough evaluation with real news data sets demonstrates that USTORY achieves higher story discovery performances than baselines while being robust and scalable to various streaming settings.",

Recently, consistency regularization techniques have been used to generate artificial labels from unlabeled augmented instances. To fully exploit the sequential characteristic of time series in consistency regularization, we propose a novel method of data augmentation called context-attached augmentation , which adds preceding and succeeding instances to a target instance to form its augmented instance. Unlike the existing augmentation techniques that modify a target instance by directly perturbing its attributes, the context-attached augmentation generates instances augmented with varying contexts while maintaining the target instance. Based on our augmentation method, we propose a context consistency regularization framework, which first adds different contexts to a target instance sampled from a given time series and then shares unitary reliability-based cross-window labels across the augmented instances to maintain consistency. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art consistency regularization frameworks through comprehensive experiments on real-world time-series datasets.",

To organize news article streams into stories, existing approaches directly encode the articles and cluster them based on representation similarity.

SCStory employs self-supervised and continual learning with a novel idea of story-indicative adaptive modeling of news article streams. With a lightweight hierarchical embedding module that first learns sentence representations and then article representations, SCStory identifies story-relevant information of news articles and uses them to discover stories. The embedding module is continuously updated to adapt to evolving news streams with a contrastive learning objective, backed up by two unique techniques, confidence-aware memory replay and prioritized-augmentation, employed for label absence and data scarcity problems. Thorough experiments on real and the latest news data sets demonstrate that SCStory outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised online story discovery.",
