            "title": "SkinGPT-4: An Interactive Dermatology Diagnostic System with Visual Large Language Model",
            "abstract": "Skin and subcutaneous diseases rank high among the leading contributors to the global burden of nonfatal diseases, impacting a considerable portion of the population. Nonetheless, the field of dermatology diagnosis faces three significant hurdles. Firstly, there is a shortage of dermatologists accessible to diagnose patients, particularly in rural regions. Secondly, accurately interpreting skin disease images poses a considerable challenge. Lastly, generating patient-friendly diagnostic reports is usually a time-consuming and labor-intensive task for dermatologists. To tackle these challenges, we present SkinGPT-4, which is the world's first interactive dermatology diagnostic system powered by an advanced visual large language model. SkinGPT-4 leverages a fine-tuned version of MiniGPT-4, trained on an extensive collection of skin disease images (comprising 52,929 publicly available and proprietary images) along with clinical concepts and doctors' notes. We designed a two-step training process to allow SkinGPT to express medical features in skin disease images with natural language and make accurate diagnoses of the types of skin diseases. With SkinGPT-4, users could upload their own skin photos for diagnosis, and the system could autonomously evaluate the images, identifies the characteristics and categories of the skin conditions, performs in-depth analysis, and provides interactive treatment recommendations. Meanwhile, SkinGPT-4's local deployment capability and commitment to user privacy also render it an appealing choice for patients in search of a dependable and precise diagnosis of their skin ailments. To demonstrate the robustness of SkinGPT-4, we conducted quantitative evaluations on 150 real-life cases, which were independently reviewed by certified dermatologists, and showed that SkinGPT-4 could provide accurate diagnoses of skin diseases. Though SkinGPT-4 is not a substitute for doctors, it could enhance users' comprehension of their medical conditions, facilitate improve communication between patients and doctors, expedite the diagnostic process for dermatologists, and potentially promote human-centred care and healthcare equity in underdeveloped areas.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Single-cell omics data are growing at an unprecedented rate, whereas effective integration of them remains challenging due to different sequencing methods, quality, and expression pattern of each omics data. In this study, we propose a universal framework for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data based on graph convolutional network (GCN-SC). Among the multiple single-cell data, GCN-SC usually selects one data with the largest number of cells as the reference and the rest as the query dataset. It utilizes mutual nearest neighbor algorithm to identify cell-pairs, which provide connections between cells both within and across the reference and query datasets. A GCN algorithm further takes the mixed graph constructed from these cell-pairs to adjust count matrices from the query datasets. Finally, dimension reduction is performed by using non-negative matrix factorization before visualization. By applying GCN-SC on six datasets, we show that GCN-SC can effectively integrate sequencing data from multiple single-cell sequencing technologies, species or different omics, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including Seurat, LIGER, GLUER and Pamona.",

            "title": "A unified method to revoke the private data of patients in intelligent healthcare with audit to forget",
            "abstract": "Revoking personal private data is one of the basic human rights, which has already been sheltered by several privacy-preserving laws in many countries. However, with the development of data science, machine learning and deep learning techniques, this right is usually neglected or violated as more and more patients\u2019 data are being collected and used for model training, especially in intelligent healthcare, thus making intelligent healthcare a sector where technology must meet the law, regulations, and privacy principles to ensure that the innovation is for the common good. In order to secure patients\u2019 right to be forgotten, we proposed a novel solution by using auditing to guide the forgetting process, where auditing means determining whether a dataset has been used to train the model and forgetting requires the information of a query dataset to be forgotten from the target model. We unified these two tasks by introducing a new approach called knowledge purification. To implement our solution, we developed AFS, a unified open-source software, which is able to evaluate and revoke patients\u2019 private data from pre-trained deep learning models. We demonstrated the generality of AFS by applying it to four tasks on different datasets with various data sizes and architectures of deep learning networks. The software is publicly available at https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/AFS.",
