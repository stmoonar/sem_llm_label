            "title": "Multi-Interest Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation System with Fuzzy Feedback based User Simulator",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

            "abstract": "Product quantization (PQ) coupled with a space rotation, is widely used in modern approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search systems to significantly compress the disk storage for embeddings and speed up the inner product computation. Existing rotation learning methods, however, minimize quantization distortion for fixed embeddings, which are not applicable to an end-to-end training scenario where embeddings are updated constantly. In this paper, based on geometric intuitions from Lie group theory, in particular the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$, we propose a family of block Givens coordinate descent algorithms to learn rotation matrix that are provably convergent on any convex objectives. Compared to the state-of-the-art SVD method, the Givens algorithms are much more parallelizable, reducing runtime by orders of magnitude on modern GPUs, and converge more stably according to experimental studies. They further improve upon vanilla product quantization significantly in an end-to-end training scenario.",

            "title": "Meta Policy Learning for Cold-Start Conversational Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) explicitly solicit users' preferences for improved recommendations on the fly. Most existing CRS solutions count on a single policy trained by reinforcement learning for a population of users. However, for users new to the system, such a global policy becomes ineffective to satisfy them, i.e., the cold-start challenge. In this paper, we study CRS policy learning for cold-start users via meta reinforcement learning. We propose to learn a meta policy and adapt it to new users with only a few trials of conversational recommendations. To facilitate fast policy adaptation, we design three synergetic components. Firstly, we design a meta-exploration policy dedicated to identifying user preferences via a few exploratory conversations, which accelerates personalized policy adaptation from the meta policy. Secondly, we adapt the item recommendation module for each user to maximize the recommendation quality based on the collected conversation states during conversations. Thirdly, we propose a Transformer-based state encoder as the backbone to connect the previous two components. It provides comprehensive state representations by modeling complicated relations between positive and negative feedback during the conversation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the advantage of our solution in serving new users, compared with a rich set of state-of-the-art CRS solutions.",

            "title": "Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence in E-commerce",
            "abstract": "Product images are essential for providing desirable user experience in an e-commerce platform. For a platform with billions of products, it is extremely time-costly and labor-expensive to manually pick and organize qualified images. Furthermore, there are the numerous and complicated image rules that a product image needs to comply in order to be generated/selected. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a new learning framework in order to achieve Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence (AGPIS) in e-commerce. To this end, we propose a Multi-modality Unified Image-sequence Classifier (MUIsC), which is able to simultaneously detect all categories of rule violations through learning. MUIsC leverages textual review feedback as the additional training target and utilizes product textual description to provide extra semantic information. %Without using prior knowledge or manually-crafted task, a single MUIsC model is able to learn the holistic knowledge of image reviewing and detect all categories of rule violations simultaneously. Based on offline evaluations, we show that the proposed MUIsC significantly outperforms various baselines. Besides MUIsC, we also integrate some other important modules in the proposed framework, such as primary image selection, non-compliant content detection, and image deduplication. With all these modules, our framework works effectively and efficiently in JD.com recommendation platform. By Dec 2021, our AGPIS framework has generated high-standard images for about 1.5 million products and achieves 13.6% in reject rate.

            "abstract": "Automatic product description generation for e-commerce has witnessed significant advancement in the past decade. Product copy- writing aims to attract users' interest and improve user experience by highlighting product characteristics with textual descriptions. As the services provided by e-commerce platforms become diverse, it is necessary to adapt the patterns of automatically-generated descriptions dynamically. In this paper, we report our experience in deploying an E-commerce Prefix-based Controllable Copywriting Generation (EPCCG) system into the JD.com e-commerce product recommendation platform. The development of the system contains two main components: 1) copywriting aspect extraction; 2) weakly supervised aspect labelling; 3) text generation with a prefix-based language model; and 4) copywriting quality control. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EPCCG. In addition, we introduce the deployed architecture which cooperates the EPCCG into the real-time JD.com e-commerce recommendation platform and the significant payoff since deployment.

            "abstract": "Towards real-world information extraction scenario, research of relation extraction is advancing to document-level relation extraction(DocRE). Existing approaches for DocRE aim to extract relation by encoding various information sources in the long context by novel model architectures. However, the inherent long-tailed distribution problem of DocRE is overlooked by prior work. We argue that mitigating the long-tailed distribution problem is crucial for DocRE in the real-world scenario. Motivated by the long-tailed distribution problem, we propose an Easy Relation Augmentation(ERA) method for improving DocRE by enhancing the performance of tailed relations. In addition, we further propose a novel contrastive learning framework based on our ERA, i.e., ERACL, which can further improve the model performance on tailed relations and achieve competitive overall DocRE performance compared to the state-of-arts.",

            "title": "Robust Meta-learning with Sampling Noise and Label Noise via Eigen-Reptile",
            "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in meta-learning techniques for tackling the few-shot learning (FSL) problem. However, the meta-learner is prone to overfitting since there are only a few available samples, which can be identified as sampling noise on a clean dataset. Moreover, when handling the data with noisy labels, the meta-learner could be extremely sensitive to label noise on a corrupted dataset. To address these two challenges, we present Eigen-Reptile (ER) that updates the meta-parameters with the main direction of historical task-specific parameters to alleviate sampling and label noise. Specifically, the main direction is computed in a fast way, where the scale of the calculated matrix is related to the number of gradient steps instead of the number of parameters. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate main direction for Eigen-Reptile in the presence of many noisy labels, we further propose Introspective Self-paced Learning (ISPL). We have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed Eigen-Reptile and ISPL. Particularly, our experiments on different tasks show that the proposed method is able to outperform or achieve highly competitive performance compared with other gradient-based methods with or without noisy labels. The code and data for the proposed method are provided for research purposes https://github.com/Anfeather/Eigen-Reptile.",

            "abstract": "We propose a novel domain-specific generative pre-training (DSGPT) method for text generation and apply it to the product title and review summarization problems on E-commerce mobile display. First, we adopt a decoder-only transformer architecture, which fits well for fine-tuning tasks by combining input and output all together. Second, we demonstrate utilizing only small amount of pre-training data in related domains is powerful. Pre-training a language model from a general corpus such as Wikipedia or the Common Crawl requires tremendous time and resource commitment, and can be wasteful if the downstream tasks are limited in variety. Our DSGPT is pre-trained on a limited dataset, the Chinese short text summarization dataset (LCSTS). Third, our model does not require product-related human-labeled data. For title summarization task, the state of art explicitly uses additional background knowledge in training and predicting stages. In contrast, our model implicitly captures this knowledge and achieves significant improvement over other methods, after fine-tuning on the public Taobao.com dataset. For review summarization task, we utilize JD.com in-house dataset, and observe similar improvement over standard machine translation methods which lack the flexibility of fine-tuning. Our proposed work can be simply extended to other domains for a wide range of text generation tasks.",

In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive study of applying deep NLP techniques to five representative tasks in search engines. Through the model design and experiments of the five tasks, readers can find answers to three important questions: (1) When is deep NLP helpful/not helpful in search systems? (2) How to address latency challenges? (3) How to ensure model robustness? This work builds on existing efforts of LinkedIn search, and is tested at scale on a commercial search engine. We believe our experiences can provide useful insights for the industry and research communities.",
