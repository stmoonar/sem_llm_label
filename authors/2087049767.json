            "title": "Adaptive Value Decomposition with Greedy Marginal Contribution Computation for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Real-world cooperation often requires intensive coordination among agents simultaneously. This task has been extensively studied within the framework of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and value decomposition methods are among those cutting-edge solutions. However, traditional methods that learn the value function as a monotonic mixing of per-agent utilities cannot solve the tasks with non-monotonic returns. This hinders their application in generic scenarios. Recent methods tackle this problem from the perspective of implicit credit assignment by learning value functions with complete expressiveness or using additional structures to improve cooperation. However, they are either difficult to learn due to large joint action spaces or insufficient to capture the complicated interactions among agents which are essential to solving tasks with non-monotonic returns. To address these problems, we propose a novel explicit credit assignment method to address the non-monotonic problem. Our method, Adaptive Value decomposition with Greedy Marginal contribution (AVGM), is based on an adaptive value decomposition that learns the cooperative value of a group of dynamically changing agents. We first illustrate that the proposed value decomposition can consider the complicated interactions among agents and is feasible to learn in large-scale scenarios. Then, our method uses a greedy marginal contribution computed from the value decomposition as an individual credit to incentivize agents to learn the optimal cooperative policy. We further extend the module with an action encoder to guarantee the linear time complexity for computing the greedy marginal contribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements in several non-monotonic domains.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems aim to predict users\u2019 next interested item given their historical interactions. However, a long-standing issue is how to distinguish between users\u2019 long/short-term interests, which may be heterogeneous and contribute differently to the next recommendation. Existing approaches usually set pre-defined short-term interest length by exhaustive search or empirical experience, which is either highly inefficient or yields subpar results. The recent advanced transformer-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performances despite the aforementioned issue, but they have a quadratic computational complexity to the length of the input sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming for better modeling users\u2019 long/short-term interests from their historical interactions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm for preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization. Through extensive experiments, we show that AutoMLP has competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining linear computational complexity.",

Empowering online games with AI has made a great success, however, ignores the explainability of black-box model makes AI less responsible and hinders its further development. In this article, we introduce and discuss the audience and the concept of XAI (eXplainable AI) in online games. We propose a GXAI workflow, which combines the strong expressiveness of multiview data sources and the clear transparency of multiview black-box models. We present four specific classifiers and explainers in the character portrait view, the behavior sequence view, the client image view, and the social graph view. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets for game cheating detection and player churn prediction show the accuracy of classification and the rationality of explanation. We also discover and present numerous interesting and valuable findings from the individual, local, and global explanations. We implement and deploy three practical applications, including evidence and reason generation, model debugging and testing, and model compression and comparison in NetEase Games and have received quite positive reviews from user studies. More future work is in progress since this is the first work that introduces XAI in online games.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the problem of stable prediction across unknown test data, where the test distribution might be different from the training one and is always agnostic when model training. In such a case, previous machine learning methods might exploit subtly spurious correlations induced by non-causal variables in training data for prediction. Those spurious correlations can vary across datasets, leading to instability of prediction across unknown test data. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm based on conditional independence tests to screen out non-causal features and reduce spurious correlations by leveraging a seed variable. We show, both theoretically and with empirical experiments, that our algorithm can precisely screen out the isolated non-causal variables, which have no causal relationship with other variables, and remove the spurious correlations induced by them, increasing the stability of prediction across unknown test data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for stable prediction across unknown test data.",

            "abstract": "In online games, user profiling plays a vital role in a variety of personalized services. Current solutions typically treat different dimensions or labels (e.g., willing to pay or not, high, medium, or low appetite for some gameplays) of the full user profiles as independent multi-class/binary classification tasks. However, such a one-by-one profiling strategy clearly overlooks the implicit correlations among profiling tasks, which results in degraded performance. To cope with this issue, we make the first attempt to formalize this problem as a multi-label learning task. Accordingly, we develop a unified Multi-Source Multi-Label learning framework (MSML) that well utilizes semantically rich features and labels for boosted user profiling in online games. Specifically, we first introduce a multi-source user representation network that exploits multi-source data in online games to obtain informative user representations. Subsequently, to handle multiple labels, we propose a novel embedding-based multi-label network that consists of two variational autoencoders with disentangled latent spaces. Note that our framework can guarantee the consistency of the training and testing phases by a novel dual-tower design to overcome the limitation of existing approaches that use one coupled decoder for both features and labels. Extensive experiments on six public multi-label datasets and one real-world online game dataset from Justice demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, our proposed framework has been successfully deployed in several online games, yielding a significant boost in multi-label user profiling.",

            "abstract": "Online games make up the largest segment of the booming global game market in terms of revenue as well as players. Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Our work has been implemented and deployed in many online games released from NetEase Games. Online A/B testing in production shows that perCLTV achieves a prominent improvement in two precision marketing applications of popup recommendation and churn intervention.",

            "abstract": "In observational studies, confounder separation and balancing are the fundamental problems of treatment effect estimation. Most of the previous methods focused on addressing the problem of confounder balancing by treating all observed pre-treatment variables as confounders, ignoring confounder separation. In general, not all the observed pre-treatment variables are confounders that refer to the common causes of the treatment and the outcome, some variables only contribute to the treatment (i.e., instrumental variables) and some only contribute to the outcome (i.e., adjustment variables). Balancing those non-confounders, including instrumental variables and adjustment variables, would generate additional bias for treatment effect estimation. By modeling the different causal relations among observed pre-treatment variables, treatment variables and outcome variables, we propose a synergistic learning framework to i) separate confounders by learning decomposed representations of both confounders and non-confounders, ii) balance confounder with sample re-weighting technique, and simultaneously iii) estimate the treatment effect in observational studies via counterfactual inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can precisely decompose confounders and achieve a more precise estimation of treatment effect than baselines.",

            "title": "Rethinking Noisy Label Learning in Real-world Annotation Scenarios from the Noise-type Perspective",
            "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning with noisy labels in real-world annotation scenarios, where noise can be categorized into two types: factual noise and ambiguity noise. To better distinguish these noise types and utilize their semantics, we propose a novel sample selection-based approach for noisy label learning, called Proto-semi. Proto-semi initially divides all samples into the confident and unconfident datasets via warm-up. By leveraging the confident dataset, prototype vectors are constructed to capture class characteristics. Subsequently, the distances between the unconfident samples and the prototype vectors are calculated to facilitate noise classification. Based on these distances, the labels are either corrected or retained, resulting in the refinement of the confident and unconfident datasets. Finally, we introduce a semi-supervised learning method to enhance training. Empirical evaluations on a real-world annotated dataset substantiate the robustness of Proto-semi in handling the problem of learning from noisy labels. Meanwhile, the prototype-based repartitioning strategy is shown to be effective in mitigating the adverse impact of label noise.

            "abstract": "Faced with saturated market and fierce competition of online games, it is of great value to analyze the causes of the player churn for improving the game product, maintaining the player retention. A large number of research efforts on churn analysis have been made into churn prediction, which can achieve a sound accuracy benefiting from the booming of AI technologies. However, game publishers are usually unable to apply high-accuracy prediction methods in practice for preventing or relieving the churn due to the lack of the specific decision support (e.g., why they leave and what to do next). In this study, we fully exploit the expertise in online games and propose a comprehensive data-driven decision support framework for addressing game player churn. We first define the churn analysis in online games from a commercial perspective and elaborate the core demands of game publishers for churn analysis. Then we employ and improve the cutting-edge eXplainable AI (XAI) methods to predict player churn and analyze the potential churn causes. The possible churn causes can finally guide game publishers to make specific decisions of revision or intervention in our designed procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and high practical value of the framework by conducting extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale online game, Justice PC. The whole decision support framework, bringing interesting and valuable insights, also receives quite positive reviews from the game product and operation teams. Notably, the whole pipeline is readily transplanted to other online systems for decision support to address similar issues.",

            "abstract": "With an increasing popularity, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games where two opposing teams compete against each other, have played a major role in E-sports tournaments. Among game analysis, real-time winning prediction is an important but challenging problem, which is mainly due to the complicated coupling of the overall Confrontation1, the excessive noise of the player\u2019s Movement, and unclear optimization goals. Existing research is difficult to solve this problem in a dynamic, comprehensive and systematic way. In this study, we design a unified framework, namely Winning Tracker (WT), for solving this problem. Specifically, offense and defense extractors are developed to extract the Confrontation of both sides. A well-designed trajectory representation algorithm is applied to extracting individual\u2019s Movement information. Moreover, we design a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture team-level strategies and facilitate the interpretability of the framework. To optimize accurately, we adopt a multi-task learning method to design short-term and long-term goals, which are used to represent immediate state and make end-state prediction respectively. Intensive experiments on a real-world data set demonstrate that our proposed method WT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our work has been practically deployed in real MOBA games, and provided case studies reflecting its outstanding commercial value.",
