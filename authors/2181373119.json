            "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) can effectively model the ever-evolving nature of real-world knowledge, and their completeness and enhancement can be achieved by reasoning new events from existing ones. However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.",

As an essential technological backbone and application carrier of the low-altitude economy, intelligent vehicles are not only active on land but also increasingly needed to actively participate in the air and water. The integration of social radars and social vision will enable intelligent vehicles to perceive complex scenarios and task demands from a human perspective, providing more efficient and safer services for the low-altitude economy.

            "abstract": "Entity alignment, which is a prerequisite for creating a more comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG), involves pinpointing equivalent entities across disparate KGs. Contemporary methods for entity alignment have predominantly utilized knowledge embedding models to procure entity embeddings that encapsulate various similarities-structural, relational, and attributive. These embeddings are then integrated through attention-based information fusion mechanisms. Despite this progress, effectively harnessing multifaceted information remains challenging due to inherent heterogeneity. Moreover, while Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks by implicitly capturing entity semantics, this implicit knowledge has yet to be exploited for entity alignment. In this study, we propose a Large Language Model-enhanced Entity Alignment framework (LLMEA), integrating structural knowledge from KGs with semantic knowledge from LLMs to enhance entity alignment. Specifically, LLMEA identifies candidate alignments for a given entity by considering both embedding similarities between entities across KGs and edit distances to a virtual equivalent entity. It then engages an LLM iteratively, posing multiple multi-choice questions to draw upon the LLM's inference capability. The final prediction of the equivalent entity is derived from the LLM's output. Experiments conducted on three public datasets reveal that LLMEA surpasses leading baseline models. Additional ablation studies underscore the efficacy of our proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "The potential of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to reduce on-board system costs in autonomous vehicles through shared intelligence is considerable. However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.",

DeFACT is a framework of parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse where the Decentralized Autonomous Organization-based interactions between parallel workers consisting of robotic, digital, and human workers are elaborated to transform from professional division to real-virtual division. In DeFACT, human workers are only responsible for 5% physical and mental work that is complex and creative, and the robotic and digital workers can take care of the rest. The perceptual and cognitive intelligence of digital workers are intensified by a manufacturing foundation model (MF-PC), where calibration and certification (C&C), and verification and validation (V&V) guarantee not only the accuracy of task models, but also the interpretability and controllability of feature learning. As a case study, the workflow of customized shoes of SANBODY Technology Company is illustrated to show how DeFACT breaks the time and space constraints, avoids production waste caused by aesthetic discrepancies with consumers, and truly realizes flexible manufacturing.",

            "title": "A Framework and Operational Procedures for Metaverses-Based Industrial Foundation Models",
            "abstract": "Industrial processes are typical cyber\u2013physical\u2013social systems (CPSSs), where the effective management of employees and the efficient control of machines play important roles. Traditional industries heavily rely on human labor and neglect the development of collection\u2013utilization\u2013transmission integrated information loops, thereby leading to high costs and low efficiency in operational procedures. To facilitate the natural interactions and smart operations for humans and machines, industrial foundation models (IFMs) based on metaverses are proposed in this article, serving as the operating systems of industrial parallel machines that provide sustainable data resources and scenarios for management and control experiments. On this basis, IFM comprised of vision foundation models, language foundation models, as well as operational foundation models, are constructed to manage resources in industrial parallel machines and provides comprehensive services for industrial procedures. On the one hand, IFM can efficiently manage various resources including computing power, digital assets, enterprise resources, and platform I/O via the proposed CPSS-based competing, sharing, scheduling, monitoring, allocating, and recovering mechanisms. On the other hand, imaginative intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and algorithmic intelligence can be achieved through vivid visualization of vision foundation models, natural conversations of language foundation models, and smart manipulation of operational foundation models. With the proposed IFM, cyber\u2013physical\u2013social intelligence (CPSI) can be achieved to enhance the efficient management and control of industrial processes.",

            "abstract": "Very recently, intensive discussions and studies on Industry 5.0 have sprung up and caused the attention of researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers from various sectors around the world. However, there is no consensus on why and what is Industry 5.0 yet. In this paper, we define Industry 5.0 from its philosophical and historical origin and evolution, emphasize its new thinking on virtual-real duality and human-machine interaction, and introduce its new theory and technology based on parallel intelligence (PI), artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (the ACP method), and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). Case studies and applications of Industry 5.0 over the last decade have been briefly summarized and analyzed with suggestions for its future development. We believe that Industry 5.0 of virtual-real interactive parallel industries has great potentials and is critical for building smart societies. Steps are outlined to ensure a roadmap that would lead to a smooth transition from CPS-based Industry 4.0 to CPSS-based Industry 5.0 for a better world which is Safe in physical spaces, Secure in cyberspaces, Sustainable in ecology, Sensitive in indi-vidual privacy and rights, Service for all, and Smartness of all.",
