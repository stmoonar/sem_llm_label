            "title": "ASA - The Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm",
            "abstract": "In High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures, the control of resources by batch systems can lead to prolonged queue waiting times and adverse effects on the overall execution times of applications, particularly in data-intensive and low-latency workflows where efficient processing hinges on resource planning and timely allocation. Allocating the maximum capacity upfront ensures the fastest execution but results in spare and idle resources, extended queue waits, and costly usage. Conversely, dynamic allocation based on workflow stage requirements optimizes resource usage but may negatively impact the total workflow makespan. To address these issues, we introduce ASA, the Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm. ASA is a novel, convergence-proven scheduling technique that minimizes jobs inter-stage waiting times by estimating the queue waiting times to proactively submit resource change requests ahead of time. It strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation, considering both learning (waiting times) and applying learnt insights. Real-world experiments over two supercomputers centers with scientific workflows demonstrate ASA's effectiveness, achieving near-optimal resource utilization and accuracy, with up to 10% and 2% reductions in average workflow queue waiting times and makespan, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

In previous work, we developed and deployed ScienceSearch, a search infrastructure for scientific data which uses machine learning to automate metadata creation. Our current deployment is deployed atop a container based platform at a HPC center. In this article, we present an evaluation and discuss our experiences with the ScienceSearch infrastructure. Specifically, we present a performance evaluation of ScienceSearch's infrastructure focusing on scalability trends. The obtained results show that ScienceSearch is able to serve up to 130 queries/min with latency under 3 s. We discuss our infrastructure setup and evaluation results to provide our experiences and a perspective on opportunities and challenges of our search infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Increasing data volumes, particularly in science and engineering, has resulted in the widespread adoption of parallel and distributed file systems for data storage and access. However, as file system sizes and the amount of data \u201cowned\u201d by users has grown, it is increasingly difficult to discover and locate data amongst the terabytes or petabytes of accessible data. While it is now routine to search for data on a personal computer or discover data online at the click of a button, there is no such equivalent method for discovering data on large parallel and distributed file systems in high-performance computing systems. Popular search solutions, such as Apache Lucene, were designed and implemented to run on commodity hardware thus posing significant limitations in achieving good efficiency on large-scale storage systems with many-core architectures, multiple NUMA nodes, and multiple NVMe storage devices. In this work we revisit and propose methods and techniques to support efficient indexing of data in order to enable search. We propose SCANNS, an indexing framework that can exploit the properties of modern high-performance computing systems delivering an order of magnitude better performance. SCANNS supports out-of-the-box Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency information retrieval model. We evaluate SCANNS on the Mystic system with configurations up to 192-cores, 768GiB of RAM, 8 NUMA nodes, and up to 16 NVMe drives, and achieved performance improvements up to 19x better indexing while delivering up to 280X lower search latency when compared to Apache Lucene.",

Intertwined with data are complex human processes, policies and decisions that need to be accounted for when building software tools.

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual \u201cWorkflows Community Summits\u201d (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.",

            "abstract": "We are seeing a growth in scientific data from experimental and observational facilities that are resulting in significant new computational patterns and needs. For example, scientists running experiments at light sources, often analyses workflows require near real-time access to compute resources in order to obtain results used for re-configuring on-going experiments. These workflows often have requirements that are different from the traditional large-scale parallel applications that have traditionally run at HPC centers. In this paper, we present our experiences supporting two light source data analysis workflows that run on HPC resources at National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. We discuss the characteristics of workflows, runtime requirements and associated execution challenges when running on HPC environments. We present a discussion and a summary of best practices that address execution challenges and current and future solutions for leveraging HPC resources for near real-time data analysis.",

            "abstract": "\n Scientific workflows in\n High Performance Computing\n (\n HPC\n ) environments are processing large amounts of data. The storage hierarchy on HPC systems is getting deeper, driven by new technologies (NVRAMs, SSDs, etc.) There is a need for new programming abstractions that allow users to seamlessly manage data at the workflow level on multi-tiered storage systems, and provide optimal workflow performance and use of storage resources. In previous work, we introduced a software architecture\n Managing Data on Tiered Storage for Scientific Workflows\n (MaDaTS\n ) that used a\n Virtual Data Space\n (\n VDS\n ) abstraction to hide the complexities of the underlying storage system while allowing users to control data management strategies. In this article, we detail the data-centric programming abstractions that allow users to manage a workflow around its data on the storage layer. The programming abstractions simplify data management for scientific workflows on multi-tiered storage systems, without affecting workflow performance or storage capacity. We measure the overheads and effectiveness introduced by the programming abstractions of MaDaTS. Our results show that these abstractions can optimally use the storage capacity in lesser capacity storage tiers, and simplify data management without adding any performance overheads.\n",

            "title": "Science Capsule: Towards Sharing and Reproducibility of Scientific Workflows",
            "abstract": "Workflows are increasingly processing large volumes of data from scientific instruments, experiments and sensors. These workflows often consist of complex data processing and analysis steps that might include a diverse ecosystem of tools and also often involve human-in-the-loop steps. Sharing and reproducing these workflows with collaborators and the larger community is critical but hard to do without the entire context of the workflow including user notes and execution environment. In this paper, we describe Science Capsule, which is a framework to capture, share, and reproduce scientific workflows. Science Capsule captures, manages and represents both computational and human elements of a workflow. It automatically captures and processes events associated with the execution and data life cycle of workflows, and lets users add other types and forms of scientific artifacts. Science Capsule also allows users to create 'workflow snapshots' that keep track of the different versions of a workflow and their lineage, allowing scientists to incrementally share and extend workflows between users. Our results show that Science Capsule is capable of processing and organizing events in near real-time for high-throughput experimental and data analysis workflows without incurring any significant performance overheads.",
