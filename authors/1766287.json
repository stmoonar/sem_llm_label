            "title": "From Talent Shortage to Workforce Excellence in the CHIPS Act Era: Harnessing Industry 4.0 Paradigms for a Sustainable Future in Domestic Chip Production",
            "abstract": "The CHIPS Act is driving the U.S. towards a self-sustainable future in domestic chip production. Decades of outsourced manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging has diminished the workforce ecosystem, imposing major limitations on semiconductor companies racing to build new fabrication sites as part of the CHIPS Act. In response, a systemic alliance between academic institutions, the industry, government, various consortiums, and organizations has emerged to establish a pipeline to educate and onboard the next generation of talent. Establishing a stable and continuous flow of talent requires significant time investments and comes with no guarantees, particularly factoring in the low workplace desirability in current fabrication houses for U.S workforce. This paper will explore the feasibility of two paradigms of Industry 4.0, automation and Augmented Reality(AR)/Virtual Reality(VR), to complement ongoing workforce development efforts and optimize workplace desirability by catalyzing core manufacturing processes and effectively enhancing the education, onboarding, and professional realms-all with promising capabilities amid the ongoing talent shortage and trajectory towards advanced packaging.",

            "abstract": "The technologically-relevant task of feature extraction from data performed in deep-learning systems is routinely accomplished as repeated fast Fourier transforms (FFT) electronically in prevalent domain-specific architectures such as in graphics processing units (GPUs). However, electronics systems are limited with respect to power dissipation and delay, both, due to wire-charging challenges related to interconnect capacitance. Here we present a silicon photonics-based architecture for convolutional neural networks that harnesses the phase property of light to perform FFTs efficiently by executing the convolution as a multiplication in the Fourier-domain. The algorithmic executing time is determined by the time-of-flight of the signal through this photonic reconfigurable passive FFT filter circuit and is on the order of 10s of picosecond. A sensitivity analysis shows that this optical processor must be thermally phase stabilized corresponding to a few degrees. Furthermore, we find that for a small sample number, the obtainable number of convolutions per {time-power-chip area) outperforms GPUs by about 2 orders of magnitude. Lastly, we show that, conceptually, the optical FFT and convolution-processing performance is indeed directly linked to optoelectronic device-level, and improvements in plasmonics, metamaterials or nanophotonics are fueling next generation densely interconnected intelligent photonic circuits with relevance for edge-computing 5G networks.",

            "abstract": "Machine-intelligence has become a driving factor in modern society. However, its demand outpaces the underlying electronic technology due to limitations given by fundamental physics such as capacitive charging of wires, but also by system architecture of storing and handling data, both driving recent trends towards processor heterogeneity. Here we introduce a novel amplitude-only Fourier-optical processor paradigm capable of processing large-scale ~(1,000 x 1,000) matrices in a single time-step and 100 microsecond-short latency. Conceptually, the information-flow direction is orthogonal to the two-dimensional programmable-network, which leverages 10^6-parallel channels of display technology, and enables a prototype demonstration performing convolutions as pixel-wise multiplications in the Fourier domain reaching peta operations per second throughputs. The required real-to-Fourier domain transformations are performed passively by optical lenses at zero-static power. We exemplary realize a convolutional neural network (CNN) performing classification tasks on 2-Megapixel large matrices at 10 kHz rates, which latency-outperforms current GPU and phase-based display technology by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. Training this optical convolutional layer on image classification tasks and utilizing it in a hybrid optical-electronic CNN, shows classification accuracy of 98% (MNIST) and 54% (CIFAR-10). Interestingly, the amplitude-only CNN is inherently robust against coherence noise in contrast to phase-based paradigms and features an over 2 orders of magnitude lower delay than liquid crystal-based systems. Beyond contributing to novel accelerator technology, scientifically this amplitude-only massively-parallel optical compute-paradigm can be far-reaching as it de-validates the assumption that phase-information outweighs amplitude in optical processors for machine-intelligence.",

            "title": "Integrated photonic FFT for photonic tensor operations towards efficient and high-speed neural networks",
            "abstract": "Abstract The technologically-relevant task of feature extraction from data performed in deep-learning systems is routinely accomplished as repeated fast Fourier transforms (FFT) electronically in prevalent domain-specific architectures such as in graphics processing units (GPU). However, electronics systems are limited with respect to power dissipation and delay, due to wire-charging challenges related to interconnect capacitance. Here we present a silicon photonics-based architecture for convolutional neural networks that harnesses the phase property of light to perform FFTs efficiently by executing the convolution as a multiplication in the Fourier-domain. The algorithmic executing time is determined by the time-of-flight of the signal through this photonic reconfigurable passive FFT \u2018filter\u2019 circuit and is on the order of 10\u2019s of picosecond short. A sensitivity analysis shows that this optical processor must be thermally phase stabilized corresponding to a few degrees. Furthermore, we find that for a small sample number, the obtainable number of convolutions per {time, power, and chip area) outperforms GPUs by about two orders of magnitude. Lastly, we show that, conceptually, the optical FFT and convolution-processing performance is indeed directly linked to optoelectronic device-level, and improvements in plasmonics, metamaterials or nanophotonics are fueling next generation densely interconnected intelligent photonic circuits with relevance for edge-computing 5G networks by processing tensor operations optically.",

            "abstract": "The sudden rise of the worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in early 2020 has called into drastic action measures to perform instant detection and reduce the rate of spread. Common clinical and nonclinical diagnostic testing methods have been partially effective in satisfying the increasing demand for fast detection point-of-care (POC) methods to slow down further spread. However, accurate point-of-risk diagnosis of this emerging viral infection is paramount as the need for simultaneous standard operating procedures and symptom management of SARS-CoV-2 will be the norm for years to come. A sensitive, cost-effective biosensor with mass production capability is crucial until a universal vaccination becomes available. Optical biosensors can provide a noninvasive, extremely sensitive rapid detection platform with sensitivity down to \u223c67 fg/ml (1 fM) concentration in a few minutes. These biosensors can be manufactured on a mass scale (millions) to detect the COVID-19 viral load in nasal, saliva, urine, and serological samples, even if the infected person is asymptotic. Methods investigated here are the most advanced available platforms for biosensing optical devices that have resulted from the integration of state-of-the-art designs and materials. These approaches include, but are not limited to, integrated optical devices, plasmonic resonance, and emerging nanomaterial biosensors. The lab-on-chip platforms examined here are suitable not only for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection but also for other contagious virions such as influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).",
