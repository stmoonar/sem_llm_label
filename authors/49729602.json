            "abstract": "An experimental study was conducted in a sieve tray column. This study used a simulated flue gas consisting of 30% CO2 and 70%. A 10% mass fraction of methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) aqueous solution was used as a solvent. Three ramp-up tests were performed to investigate the effect of different load changes in inlet gas and solvent flow rate on CO2 absorption. The rate of change in gas flow rate was 0.1 Nm3/h/s, and the rate of change in MDEA aqueous solution was about 0.7 NL/h/s. It was found that different load changes in inlet gas and solvent flow rate significantly affect the CO2 volume fraction at the outlet during the transient state. The CO2 volume fraction reaches a peak value during the transient state. The effect of different load changes in inlet gas and solvent flow rate on the hydrodynamic properties of the sieve tray were also investigated. The authors studied the correlation between the performance of the absorber column for CO2 capture during the transient state and the hydrodynamic properties of the sieve tray. In addition, this paper presents an experimental investigation of the bubble-liquid interaction as a contributor to entropy generation on a sieve tray in the absorption column used for CO2 absorption during the transient state of different load changes.",

            "abstract": "Today algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is prevalent in several fields including medicine, the criminal justice system, financial markets etc. On the one hand, this is testament to the ever improving performance and capabilities of complex machine learning models. On the other hand, the increased complexity has resulted in a lack of transparency and interpretability which has led to critical decision-making models being deployed as functional black boxes. There is a general consensus that being able to explain the actions of such systems will help to address legal issues like transparency (ex ante) and compliance requirements (interim) as well as liability (ex post). Moreover it may build trust, expose biases and in turn lead to improved models. This has most recently led to research on extracting post-hoc explanations from black box classifiers and sequence generators in tasks like image captioning, text classification and machine translation. However, there is no work yet that has investigated and revealed the impact of model explanations on the nature of human decision-making. We undertake a large scale study using crowd-sourcing as a means to measure how interpretability affects human-decision making using well understood principles of behavioral economics. To our knowledge this is the first of its kind of an inter-disciplinary study involving interpretability in ADM models.",
