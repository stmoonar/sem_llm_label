            "title": "Visualizing the effects of power management algorithms for mobile networks under realistic conditions",
            "abstract": "Today's mobile networks run on full capacity 24/7 even though they are not always fully utilized. The resulting power consumption can be reduced by dynamically applying a less energy-consuming configuration to the mobile network. Decisions regarding these optimizations are based on contextual information acquired from the network elements as well as external sources. We propose a test environment, which is able to visualize the effects of the re-configuration algorithms for mobile networks under realistic conditions. This environment comprises a Multi-RAT Testbed, which again consists of a number of different radio access technology nodes. Furthermore, we built a ShowTable that demonstrates one power management scenario based on contextual information, which is acquired and processed by the context management server. The ShowTable utilizes Wi-Fi access points and focuses on the de- and reactivation of unused network components and the intelligent handover of the active users. As an exemplary application, video streams are used and a visualization on an external screen helps to display the status of the network as well as live information about traffic load and power consumption. The deployed algorithm applies a threshold-based policy by deactivating one of the access points in case that the traffic load falls below a defined threshold.",

            "title": "Towards a dynamic adaption of capacity in mobile telephony networks using context information",
            "abstract": "As of today, components of radio access networks are operated in an always-on manner. Since network providers need to fulfill the traffic demands of all customers even during peak times to stay competitive, a significantly higher amount of network resources (i.e., bandwidth) is provided. By the end of 2010, Germany's mobile network providers operated more than 123.000 base stations which are available 24/7 \u2014 even when the provided resources are not required at this time. The total energy consumption of these base stations sums up to approx. 1455 GWh per year, inflicting not only high costs to the network operators, but also contributes to worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. Context data, which is already present in the different network entities can be utilized to model the state of radio networks allowing network providers to identify idle components. These components can then be reconfigured dynamically according to the actual demands on connectivity in the network. In this paper, we propose a Context Management Architecture, which is able to acquire and consolidate context from various components in radio access networks as well as additional external sources. The raw context data is sensed by special Context Collection Agents, which are installed on the devices the context data is originating from. It is then published to Context Managers, which provide functionality for storage, reasoning mechanisms, and provisioning of the context data. Context-aware applications (e.g., an application capable of optimizing the configuration of radio networks) can access the refined context via appropriate interfaces for further processing.",

            "abstract": "In addition to terminal mobility enabled by mobile cellular networks, future telecommunication systems must also provide for appropriate capabilities to support personal and session mobility as well as service portability. To cope with the strong user requirements concerning service provision and mobility support, future service architectures can be regarded as global distributed systems in which billions of mobile objects move and interact to optimally support the user. Based on this scenario, the paper proposes localization and positioning strategies for objects. To realize location transparency between them, the concept of location bridges is introduced, which enables to dynamically implement arbitrary localization strategies. Using different combinations of localization and positioning strategies, the realization of service portability and personal mobility is demonstrated in the context of the TINA service architecture. Finally, the approaches presented are compared by a performance evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The future nomadic customer will want to make requests according to his personal service profile and to be reachable under the same number, no matter to what terminal he is currently registered and to which provider he is currently attached. Unfortunately, the TINA service architecture does not provide satisfactory solutions for supporting nomadic communication up to now. The paper compares two strategies for realizing nomadic communication in TINA-compliant networks. Following the first approach, each customer is associated with a home domain where customer-related resources like the user agent are executed. In the alternative approach, the resources are modeled as mobile agents that follow the customer through the fixed network part. The presented strategies are analyzed and compared in a large-scale scenario using simulations. These simulations are based on a mathematical model that considers the movement and call behavior of customers. Furthermore, to enable the deployment of mobile agents in TINA systems, an agent platform is presented that has been developed in the AMASE project.",
