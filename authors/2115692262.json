            "abstract": "Abstract The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) underwent a focused review of assay term annotations, logic and hierarchy with a goal to improve and standardize these terms. As a result, inconsistencies in W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) expressions were identified and corrected, and additionally, standardized design patterns and a formalized template to maintain them were developed. We describe here this informative and productive process to describe the specific benefits and obstacles for OBI and the universal lessons for similar projects.",

            "abstract": "Biological ontologies are used to organize, curate, and interpret the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments. While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application, and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology\u2019s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data FAIR.",

In this study, we report our development of the community-driven Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation (OPMI) and its applications in clinical data and metadata representation. OPMI has been used to represent the common data model (CDM) of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI) program. It has also been used to represent approximately 30 case report forms defined by the NIH-supported Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Our case studies showed that OPMI is able to semantically and precisely represent the OHDSI CDM, various KPMP clinical forms, and their associated data and metadata. Such ontological representations support standardized data representation, sharing, recording, integration, and advanced analysis.",

            "abstract": "MIABIS 2.0, an updated, modular version of MIABIS, is a set of minimum data elements for biobanks and studies using human biospecimens. Though MIABIS was previously ontologized and became part of the Ontology for Biobanking (OBIB), MIABIS 2.0 necessitated an updated mapping and extension of OBIB. A working group of MIABIS 2.0 and OBIB developers communicated via teleconference and email to ensure that the new concepts were accurately represented in the ontology either by existing OBIB classes, classes that could be imported from other OBO Foundry ontologies, or in newly-requested terms. Mapping for 84.44% of the elements has been completed and we expect to conclude the process by July 2019. Our efforts show that OBO Foundry ontologies support the mapping of developing sets of standard data elements but that one-to-one mappings are not always been feasible.",

While epidemiology data sets are increasingly deposited in databases and repositories, barriers to access still remain. ClinEpiDB was constructed as an open-access online resource for clinical and epidemiologic studies by leveraging the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure of the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resources (EuPathDB; a collection of databases covering 170+ eukaryotic pathogens, relevant related species, and select hosts) combined with a unified semantic web framework. Here we present an intuitive point-and-click website that allows users to visualize and subset data directly in the ClinEpiDB browser and immediately explore potential associations. Supporting study documentation aids contextualization, and data can be downloaded for advanced analyses. By facilitating access and interrogation of high-quality, large-scale data sets, ClinEpiDB aims to spur collaboration and discovery that improves global health.",
