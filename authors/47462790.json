            "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most common imaging modalities for brain function analysis. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been adopted for fMRI analysis with superior performance. Unfortunately, traditional functional brain networks are mainly constructed based on similarities among region of interests (ROIs), which are noisy and can lead to inferior results for GNN models. To better adapt GNNs for fMRI analysis, we propose DABNet, a Deep DAG learning framework based on Brain Networks for fMRI analysis. DABNet adopts a brain network generator module, which harnesses the DAG learning approach to transform the raw time-series into effective brain connectivities. Experiments on two fMRI datasets demonstrate the efficacy of DABNet. The generated brain networks also highlight the prediction-related brain regions and thus provide interpretations for predictions.",

            "abstract": "Healthcare knowledge graphs (HKGs) are valuable tools for organizing biomedical concepts and their relationships with interpretable structures. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for building more comprehensive and accurate HKGs. This, in turn, can improve the reliability of generated content and enable better evaluation of LLMs. However, the challenges of HKGs such as regarding data heterogeneity and limited coverage are not fully understood, highlighting the need for detailed reviews. This work provides the first comprehensive review of HKGs. It summarizes the pipeline and key techniques for HKG construction, as well as the common utilization approaches, i.e., model-free and model-based. The existing HKG resources are also organized based on the data types they capture and application domains they cover, along with relevant statistical information (Resource available at https://github.com/lujiaying/Awesome-HealthCare-KnowledgeBase). At the application level, we delve into the successful integration of HKGs across various health domains, ranging from fine-grained basic science research to high-level clinical decision support and public health. Lastly, the paper highlights the opportunities for HKGs in the era of LLMs. This work aims to serve as a valuable resource for understanding the potential and opportunities of HKG in health research.",

            "abstract": "Biological networks are commonly used in biomedical and healthcare domains to effectively model the structure of complex biological systems with interactions linking biological entities. However, due to their characteristics of high dimensionality and low sample size, directly applying deep learning models on biological networks usually faces severe overfitting. In this work, we propose R-MIXUP, a Mixup-based data augmentation technique that suits the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of adjacency matrices from biological networks with optimized training efficiency. The interpolation process in R-MIXUP leverages the log-Euclidean distance metrics from the Riemannian manifold, effectively addressing the swelling effect and arbitrarily incorrect label issues of vanilla Mixup. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MIXUP with five real-world biological network datasets on both regression and classification tasks. Besides, we derive a commonly ignored necessary condition for identifying the SPD matrices of biological networks and empirically study its influence on the model performance. The code implementation can be found in Appendix D.",

            "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most common imaging modalities for brain function analysis. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been adopted for fMRI analysis with superior performance. Unfortunately, traditional functional brain networks are mainly constructed based on similarities among region of interests (ROI), which are noisy and agnostic to the downstream prediction tasks and can lead to inferior results for GNN-based models.

The key component of TBDS is the brain network generator which adopts a DAG learning approach to transform the raw time-series into task-aware brain connectivities. Besides, we design an additional contrastive regularization to inject task-specific knowledge during the brain network generation process. Comprehensive experiments on two fMRI datasets, namely Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TBDS. In addition, the generated brain networks also highlight the prediction-related brain regions and thus provide unique interpretations of the prediction results.
