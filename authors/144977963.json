            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Action abstractions restrict the number of legal actions available for real-time planning in zero-sum extensive-form games, thus allowing algorithms to focus their search on a set of promising actions. Even though unabstracted game trees can lead to optimal policies, due to real-time constraints and the tree size, they are not a practical choice. In this context, we introduce an action abstraction scheme which we call asymmetric action abstraction. Asymmetric abstractions allow search algorithms to \u201cpay more attention\u201d to some aspects of the game by unevenly dividing the algorithm\u2019s search effort amongst different aspects of the game. We also introduce four algorithms that search in asymmetrically abstracted game trees to evaluate the effectiveness of our abstraction schemes. Two of our algorithms are adaptations of algorithms developed for searching in action-abstracted spaces, Portfolio Greedy Search and Stratified Strategy Selection, and the other two are adaptations of an algorithm developed for searching in unabstracted spaces, Na\u00efveMCTS. An extensive set of experiments in a real-time strategy game shows that search algorithms using asymmetric abstractions are able to outperform all other search algorithms tested.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents BikeVibes1, an app that cyclists can use to log data regarding the smoothness of their rides. The main goal of BikeVibes is to facilitate the collection of anonymized open data about road quality that others can download and peruse. A few sample scenarios where having this type of crowdsourced data would be useful are as follows. A city can use the gathered data in order to determine which roads need to be maintained/upgraded since the quality of the road can be perceived very differently when riding a bike compared to driving a car. Likewise, a city can determine paths that are more frequently used by cyclists in order to decide where to build or upgrade dedicated bike lanes and/or how to prioritize maintenance. Also, third-party app developers can use the road quality data to suggest paths to cyclists based on smoothness, as this may be an important attribute for some people, e.g., in the case of parents riding bicycles hauling trailers with children. None of these scenarios could be easily contemplated without the availability of data such as that gathered through BikeVibes.",

            "abstract": "Last-mile delivery (LMD) is known as the task of delivering items from a warehouse to a customer. In LMD's original version, each item is to be delivered to a single location in a city's network. In this paper, we extend such a scenario by assuming that there can be alternative delivery locations for each item, depending on the time of the day, and aim at maximizing the number of deliveries completed by a courier. We call this new problem the Last Mile Flexible Delivery (LMFD) problem. In fact, at least one e-commerce company, namely Amazon, currently offers the possibility of delivering items to a customer's parked car, thus making the LMFD problem, not only computationally challenging, but also practically relevant. After showing LMFD's NP-hardness, we propose an efficient heuristic approach based on provably correct pruning of the search space, and, using a real and large mobility dataset, we show that such heuristic is both effective and highly efficient.",

We also propose a series of visualizations that allow users to analyze a collection of hierarchies for a range of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$mpts$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"cavalcantearaujoneto-ieq7-2962412.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> values, along with case studies that illustrate how these analyses are performed.",

            "abstract": "Consider the following scenario: (a) a worker traveling on the shortest path between two locations in a city's road network, (b) he/she is willing to deviate from such path in order to complete tasks in the network, (c) tasks are associated with rewards and appear and disappear dynamically, i.e., they are not known in advance, and (d) the worker specifies a time budget which limits the total time he/she is willing to spend on his/her trip. Now assume the worker wants to minimize the detour from the original path while, at the same time, maximizing the rewards collected by completing tasks; clearly two competing criteria. We call this problem the Online In-Route Task Selection (Online-IRTS) query, and we investigate it using the paradigm of skyline queries in order to systematically explore different trade-offs between earned rewards and path deviation. Because of the online nature of the problem, i.e., irrevocable decisions about which task to perform have to be made without knowledge of future tasks, it is not possible to guarantee optimal solutions for the Online-IRTS query. Therefore, we propose two heuristic approaches, one is based on local optimizations, and the other one is based on incremental solutions, along with a method to evaluate the quality of their solutions w.r.t. the optimal offline solution. Our experiments using city-scale realistic datasets show that the first approach is more effective whereas the second is more efficient, allowing one to choose which approach to use according to his/her priorities.",

For instance, individual users could be interested in which modes of transport are more effective to reach a set of alternative locations at a given time of the day, whereas urban planners could be interested in the effect that adding/removing a bus line would have in connecting regions of a city, e.g., a residential neighborhood and downtown. Given that context and using real data from the city of Berlin, we introduce RRAMEN , an interactive tool which is well equipped to support different city-scale mobility-related queries by different types of users.",

            "abstract": "Augmenting training datasets has been shown to improve the learning effectiveness for several computer vision tasks. A good augmentation produces an augmented dataset that adds variability while retaining the statistical properties of the original dataset. Some techniques, such as AutoAugment and Fast AutoAugment, have introduced a search phase to find a set of suitable augmentation policies for a given model and dataset. This comes at the cost of great computational overhead, adding up to several thousand GPU hours. More recently RandAugment was proposed to substantially speedup the search phase by approximating the search space by a couple of hyperparameters, but still incurring non-negligible cost for tuning those. In this paper we show that, under the assumption that the augmentation space is approximately distribution invariant, a uniform sampling over the continuous space of augmentation transformations is sufficient to train highly effective models. Based on that result we propose UniformAugment, an automated data augmentation approach that completely avoids a search phase. In addition to discussing the theoretical underpinning supporting our approach, we also use the standard datasets, as well as established models for image classification, to show that UniformAugment's effectiveness is comparable to the aforementioned methods, while still being highly efficient by virtue of not requiring any search.",

            "abstract": "The well-known Optimal Sequenced Routing (OSR) query considers a traveller that needs to stop by some cost-free points of interest (POIs), each belonging to a given strict sequence of categories of interest (COIs), while minimizing only the distance traveled. In this paper we extend the OSR query by adding the constraint that (1) each POI yields a non-null cost and that (2) the traveller wishes to minimize the travel distance as well as the total cost of POIs he/she stops by. We name this new query as Trade-Off Aware Sequenced Routing (TASeR). The challenging aspect of this query is that it is not always possible to optimize both travel distance and total POI cost simultaneously. As well, combining both criteria into a single one with predetermined weights may not be desirable or even feasible. As our main contribution we make use of the linear skyline paradigm, along with provably correct pruning criteria, to propose an approach that finds all optimal solutions for any linear combination of the two competing criteria very efficiently. Our experiments using real city-scale data show that our proposed approach can obtain optimal linear skyline sets in sub-second processing time for reasonably sized instances of the TASeR query. Moreover, we show that any instance of the traditional OSR query can be easily modeled as a TASeR query, hence, our proposed approach can also solve OSR queries at the expense of negligible overhead.",
