            "title": "FLY: Venue Recommendation using Limited Context",
            "abstract": "Recommendation of publication venues is very much the need of the hour. There is a sea of options for research conferences and journals. As a result, it is often found that researchers are not even aware of many publication venues in their research area. Existing work uses information, such as all the references in a given paper, past publication venues of the author(s), co-author relationships, and the paper content to do venue recommendation. However, in this paper, we propose a system that uses very limited context, namely the paper title, abstract, and a venue network, which is constructed using only a small subset of authors' publication history, to do venue recommendation. Our venue recommendation system, FLY, gives 30% higher accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art limited context venue recommendation system.",

            "abstract": "In an e-commerce site, reviews help augment basic product descriptions with detailed user experiences and opinions on the product. These reviews greatly influence the purchase decisions of oncoming customers. Since these reviews are haphazardly presented, they call for befitting review exploration techniques. We propose a novel view based review exploration system that can be used to control the depth and content of the retrieved reviews. We propose three views depending on the depth personified by them: the Bird-eye view, the Unidirectional view, and the Microscopic view. The views present a ranked list of relevant reviews that meet the view criteria. The proposed view based exploration recorded precision as high as 0.85.",

            "abstract": "In many real-world applications, multiple agents seek to learn how to perform highly related yet slightly different tasks in an online bandit learning protocol. We formulate this problem as the $\\epsilon$-multi-player multi-armed bandit problem, in which a set of players concurrently interact with a set of arms, and for each arm, the reward distributions for all players are similar but not necessarily identical. We develop an upper confidence bound-based algorithm, RobustAgg$(\\epsilon)$, that adaptively aggregates rewards collected by different players. In the setting where an upper bound on the pairwise similarities of reward distributions between players is known, we achieve instance-dependent regret guarantees that depend on the amenability of information sharing across players. We complement these upper bounds with nearly matching lower bounds. In the setting where pairwise similarities are unknown, we provide a lower bound, as well as an algorithm that trades off minimax regret guarantees for adaptivity to unknown similarity structure.",

            "abstract": "Multimedia data is known for its variety and also for the difficulty that comes in extracting relevant features from multimedia data. Owing to which the collaborative recommendation systems have found their foothold in multimedia recommender systems. However, modern-day multimedia sites have tons of user history in the form of user feedback, reviews, votes, comments, and etc. We can use these social interactions to extract useful content features, which can then be used in content based recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid recommender system that combines the content and collaborative systems using a Bayesian model. We substitute the concrete textual content with a sparse tag information. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset show that tags significantly improves the recommendation performance for multimedia data.",

            "title": "Information Diffusion and Summarization in Social Networks",
            "abstract": "Social networks are web-based services that allow users to connect and share information. Due to the huge size of social network graph and the plethora of generated content, it is difficult to diffuse and summarize the social media content. This thesis thus addresses the problems of information diffusion and information summarization in social networks. Information diffusion is a process by which information about new opinions, behaviors, conventions, practices, and technologies flow from person-to-person through a social network. Studies on information diffusion primarily focus on how information diffuses in networks and how to enhance information diffusion. Our aim is to enhance the information diffusion in social networks. Many factors affect information diffusion, such as network connectivity, location, posting timestamp, post content, etc. In this thesis, we analyze the effect of three of the most important factors of information diffusion, namely network connectivity, posting time and post content. We first study the network factor to enhance the information diffusion, and later analyze how time and content factors can diffuse the information to a large number of users. Network connectivity of a user determines his ability to disseminate information. A well-connected authoritative user can disseminate information to a more wider audience compared to an ordinary user. We present a novel algorithm to find topicsensitive authorities in social networks. We use the topic-specific authoritative position of the users to promote a given topic through word-of-mouth (WoM) marketing. Next, the lifetime of social media content is very short, which is typically a few hours. If post content is posted at the time when the targeted audience are not online or are not interested in interacting with the content, the content will not receive high audience reaction. We look at the problem of finding the best posting time(s) to get high information diffusion. Further, the type of social media content determines the amount of audience interaction, it gets in social media. Users react differently to different types of content. If a post is related to a topic that is more arousing or debatable, then it tends to get more comments. We propose a novel method to identify whether a post has high arousal content or not. Furthermore, the sentiment of post content is also an important factor to garner users\u2019 attention in social media. Same information conveyed with different sentiments receives a different amount of audience reactions. We understand to what extent the sentiment policies employed in social media have been successful to catch users\u2019 attention. Finally, we study the problem of information summarization in social networks. Social media services generate a huge volume of data every day, which is difficult to search or comprehend. Information summarization is a process of creating a concise readable summary of this huge volume of unstructured information. We present a novel method to summarize unstructured social media text by generating topics similar to manually created topics. We also show a comprehensive topical summary by grouping semantically related topics.",

            "title": "Tag Boosted Hybrid Recommendation System forMultimedia Data",
            "abstract": "Collaborative recommendation systems are more popular for multimedia data compared to content- \nbased recommendation system. Existing content-based recommendation algorithms give low-quality \nrecommendations for multimedia data due to lack of good content-based features. Collaborative \nalgorithms do well only when suficient user history is available. However, it gives very poor perfor- \nmance compared to content-based algorithms for new users or new items due to lack of user history. \nTo get best of both, one can use hybrid recommendation system that integrates content and collab- \norative algorithms. For multimedia data, it is di\ufffdcult to build a hybrid recommendation system as \nrelevant content based features are not easily available. With the advent ofWeb 2.0, a lot of feedback \nfrom users on these multimedia objects is available in the form of tags, reviews, likes, comments, \netc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommendation system that uses features from such social \ninteractions. We do collaborative filtering using probabilistic matrix factorization and content-based \nfiltering using topic modeling and integrate them using Bayesian model. Extensive experiments on \nreal-world dataset show that our algorithm significantly improves the recommendation performance \nfor multimedia data.",

            "abstract": "We examine the applicability of Composite Items (CIs) for generating customized travel packages consisting of Points of Interest (POIs) in a given city. CIs have been shown to serve complex information needs such as selecting books for a reading club, identifying a set of products for a promotion, or planning a city tour. In the travel domain, a synthesized view of travel options in a city can be provided with a set of cohesive CIs, each of which is covering a different region in the city. In this paper, we attempt to understand the benefit of letting users customize travel packages, and examine the relationship between customization and personalization. For personalization, we gather user preferences on POI features when available or on latent topics extracted from POI tags. For customization, we develop a framework within which a user interacts with proposed travel packages and the system suggests new CIs according to refined user preferences. Our experiments reveal a tension between personalization and the cohesiveness of items forming each CI. As a result, customization is necessary to find a balance between POI personalization and CI cohesiveness. We also show that the refined user preferences obtained from customization in one city help build better travel packages in another city.",
