            "title": "RIDnet: Radiologist-Inspired Deep Neural Network for Low-dose CT Denoising",
            "abstract": "Being low-level radiation exposure and less harmful to health, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been widely adopted in the early screening of lung cancer and COVID-19. LDCT images inevitably suffer from the degradation problem caused by complex noises. It was reported that, compared with commercial iterative reconstruction methods, deep learning (DL)-based LDCT denoising methods using convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved competitive performance. Most existing DL-based methods focus on the local information extracted by CNN, while ignoring both explicit non-local and context information (which are leveraged by radiologists). To address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning model named radiologist-inspired deep denoising network (RIDnet) to imitate the workflow of a radiologist reading LDCT images. Concretely, the proposed model explicitly integrates all the local, non-local and context information rather than local information only. Our radiologist-inspired model is potentially favoured by radiologists as a familiar workflow. A double-blind reader study on a public clinical dataset shows that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model achieves the most impressive performance in terms of the structural fidelity, the noise suppression and the overall score. As a physicians-inspired model, RIDnet gives a new research roadmap that takes into account the behavior of physicians when designing decision support tools for assisting clinical diagnosis.

            "abstract": "Geothermal heat, as renewable energy, shows great advantage with respect to its environmental impact due to its significantly lower CO2 emissions than conventional fossil fuel. Open and closed-loop geothermal heat pumps, which utilize shallow geothermal systems, are an efficient technology for cooling and heating buildings, especially in urban areas. Integrated use of geothermal energy technologies for district heating, cooling, and thermal energy storage can be applied to optimize the subsurface for communities to provide them with multiple sustainable energy and community resilience benefits. The utilization of the subsurface resources may lead to a variation in the underground environment, which might further impact local environmental conditions. However, very few simulators can handle such a highly complex set of coupled computations on a regional or city scale. We have developed high-performance computing (HPC) based hydrothermal finite element (FE) simulator that can simulate the subsurface and its hydrothermal conditions at a scale of tens of km. The HPC simulator enables us to investigate the subsurface thermal and hydrologic response to the built underground environment (such as basements and subways) at the community scale. In this study, a coupled hydrothermal simulator is developed based on the open-source finite element library deal.II. The HPC simulator was validated by comparing the results of a benchmark case study against COMSOL Multiphysics, in which Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) is modeled and a process of heat injection into ATES is simulated. The use of an energy pile system at the Treasure Island redevelopment site (San Francisco, CA, USA) was selected as a case study to demonstrate the HPC capability of the developed simulator. The simulator is capable of modeling multiple city-scale geothermal scenarios in a reasonable amount of time.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved notable performance in the denoising task of low-quality medical images and the detection task of lesions, respectively. However, existing low-quality medical image denoising approaches are disconnected from the detection task of lesions. Intuitively, the quality of denoised images will influence the lesion detection accuracy that in turn can be used to affect the denoising performance. To this end, we propose a play-and-plug medical image denoising framework, namely Lesion-Inspired Denoising Network (LIDnet), to collaboratively improve both denoising performance and detection accuracy of denoised medical images. Specifically, we propose to insert the feedback of downstream detection task into existing denoising framework by jointly learning a multi-loss objective. Instead of using perceptual loss calculated on the entire feature map, a novel region-of-interest (ROI) perceptual loss induced by the lesion detection task is proposed to further connect these two tasks. To achieve better optimization for overall framework, we propose a customized collaborative training strategy for LIDnet. On consideration of clinical usability and imaging characteristics, three low-dose CT images datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed LIDnet. Experiments show that, by equipping with LIDnet, both of the denoising and lesion detection performance of baseline methods can be significantly improved.",

            "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) has shown a useful approach to produce a brain-computer interface (BCI). One-dimensional (1-D) EEG signal is yet easily disturbed by certain artifacts (a.k.a. noise) due to the high temporal resolution. Thus, it is crucial to remove the noise in received EEG signal. Recently, deep learning-based EEG signal denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance compared with traditional ones. It is well known that the characteristics of self-similarity (including non-local and local ones) of data (e.g., natural images and time-domain signals) are widely leveraged for denoising. However, existing deep learning-based EEG signal denoising methods ignore either the non-local self-similarity (e.g., 1-D convolutional neural network) or local one (e.g., fully connected network and recurrent neural network). To address this issue, we propose a novel 1-D EEG signal denoising network with 2-D transformer, namely EEGDnet. Specifically, we comprehensively take into account the non-local and local self-similarity of EEG signal through the transformer module. By fusing non-local self-similarity in self-attention blocks and local self-similarity in feed forward blocks, the negative impact caused by noises and outliers can be reduced significantly. Extensive experiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art models, EEGDnet achieves much better performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative metrics.",

            "abstract": "Compared with normal-dose computed tomography (NDCT), low-dose CT (LDCT) images have lower potential radiation risk for patients while suffering from the degradation problem by noise. In the past decades, deep learning-based (DL-based) methods have achieved impressive denoising performances in comparison to traditional methods. However, most existing DL-based methods typically preform training on a specific pairs of LDCT/NDCT images and aim to generalize well on clinical scenarios with LDCT images only. It is a difficult task and challenge, denoising LDCT images with various noise characteristics due to different imaging protocols. We propose a task-driven deep learning framework for LDCT image denoising. Specifically, the variational autoencoder (VAE) is leveraged to learn noise distribution. By utilizing abundant open-source NDCT images as the latent references, we then construct pairs of induced-LDCT (namely pseudo-LDCT)/NDCT images rather than simply using pairs of non-induced-LDCT/NDCT images. Thus, the denoising model can perceive the noise within LDCT images directly. Extensive experiments on LDCT datasets (without NDCT references) show that our proposed framework achieves competitive performances compared with existing DL-based LDCT denoising methods.",

In a short period of time, Chinese medical workers have experienced the gradual understanding, evidence accumulation and clinical practice of the unknown virus. So far, National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has issued seven trial versions of the \"Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19\". However, it is difficult for clinicians and laymen to quickly and accurately distinguish the similarities and differences among the different versions and locate the key points of the new version. This paper reports a computer-aided intelligent analysis method based on machine learning, which can automatically analyze the similarities and differences of different treatment plans, present the focus of the new version to doctors, reduce the difficulty in interpreting the \"diagnosis and treatment plan\" for the professional, and help the general public better understand the professional knowledge of medicine. Experimental results show that this method can achieve the topic prediction and matching of the new version of the program text through unsupervised learning of the previous versions of the program topic with an accuracy of 100%. It enables the computer interpretation of \"diagnosis and treatment plan\" automatically and intelligently.",

The transient electromagnetic method (TEM) is extremely important in geophysics.\nHowever, the secondary field signal (SFS) in the TEM received by coil is easily\ndisturbed by random noise, sensor noise and man-made noise, which results in\nthe difficulty in detecting deep geological information. To reduce the noise\ninterference and detect deep geological information, we apply autoencoders, which\nmake up an unsupervised learning model in deep learning, on the basis of the analysis of the\ncharacteristics of the SFS to denoise the SFS. We introduce the SFSDSA (secondary\nfield signal denoising stacked autoencoders) model based on deep neural networks of\nfeature extraction and denoising. SFSDSA maps the signal points of the noise\ninterference to the high-probability points with a clean signal as reference\naccording to the deep characteristics of the signal, so as to realize the\nsignal denoising and reduce noise interference. The method is validated by the\nmeasured data comparison, and the comparison results show that the noise\nreduction method can (i)\u00a0effectively reduce the noise of the SFS in contrast with the\nKalman, principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet transform methods and (ii)\u00a0strongly support the\nspeculation of deeper underground features.\n",

            "abstract": "As one of the main channels for citizens to reflect urban management issues, the urban hotline can collect many problems and occurrences about the city, such as noise nuisance and illegal buildings. However, traditional manual statistical methods have been adopting to analyze the topics of the urban hotline records, and few automatic analysis models or software on topic mining of urban hotline records has been documented. In order to automatically analyze the massive amount of information on urban hotline, we propose a semantic-based short-text fast clustering method to cluster short texts of semantic similarity to form long texts according to the similarity of semantic-based keywords set, and the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is then applied to mine the topics distribution of urban hotline records. Experiments on 87,055 urban hotline records from 2017 to 2018 in Chengdu show that our approach can achieve a significantly better performance both in accurate and topic coherence than LDA method.",
