            "abstract": "Recent neural language models have taken a significant step forward in producing remarkably controllable, fluent, and grammatical text. Although studies have found that AI-generated text is not distinguishable from human-written text for crowd-sourcing workers, there still exist errors in AI-generated text which are even subtler and harder to spot. We primarily focus on the scenario in which scientific AI writing assistant is deeply involved. First, we construct a feature description framework to distinguish between AI-generated text and human-written text from syntax, semantics, and pragmatics based on the human evaluation. Then we utilize the features, i.e., writing style, coherence, consistency, and argument logistics, from the proposed framework to analyze two types of content. Finally, we adopt several publicly available methods to investigate the gap of between AI-generated scientific text and human-written scientific text by AI-generated scientific text detection models. The results suggest that while AI has the potential to generate scientific content that is as accurate as human-written content, there is still a gap in terms of depth and overall quality. The AI-generated scientific content is more likely to contain errors in factual issues. We find that there exists a\"writing style\"gap between AI-generated scientific text and human-written scientific text. Based on the analysis result, we summarize a series of model-agnostic and distribution-agnostic features for detection tasks in other domains. Findings in this paper contribute to guiding the optimization of AI models to produce high-quality content and addressing related ethical and security concerns.",

            "abstract": "With the wide application of keyphrases in many Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, automatic keyphrase prediction has been emerging. However, these statistically important phrases are contributing increasingly less to the related tasks because the end\u2010to\u2010end learning mechanism enables models to learn the important semantic information of the text directly. Similarly, keyphrases are of little help for readers to quickly grasp the paper's main idea because the relationship between the keyphrase and the paper is not explicit to readers. Therefore, we propose to generate keyphrases with specific functions for readers to bridge the semantic gap between them and the information producers, and verify the effectiveness of the keyphrase function for assisting users\u2019 comprehension with a user experiment. A controllable keyphrase generation framework (the CKPG) that uses the keyphrase function as a control code to generate categorized keyphrases is proposed and implemented based on Transformer, BART, and T5, respectively. For the Computer Science domain, the Macro\u2010avgs of P@5 , R@5 , and F1@5 on the Paper with Code dataset are up to 0.680, 0.535, and 0.558, respectively. Our experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the CKPG models.",

We observe that a few references are reused many times in an author\u2019s oeuvre while most of his or her references only occur in the reference list for quite a limited number of times. A power law distribution depicts such an inequality. We particularly utilise the power value, [Formula: see text], to characterise the nuanced difference of such inequalities. A pilot study based upon Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) shows that the [Formula: see text] tends to be normally distributed, regardless of whether it is from a citing or a cited perspective. Our empirical study also reveals that the [Formula: see text] of highly cited publications tends to be greater than that of lowly cited ones, yet we also observe a saturation when the number of citations increases.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Informal knowledge constantly transitions into formal domain knowledge in the dynamic knowledge base. This article focuses on an integrative understanding of the knowledge role transition from the perspective of knowledge codification. The transition process is characterized by several dynamics involving a variety of bibliometric entities, such as authors, keywords, institutions, and venues. We thereby designed a series of temporal and cumulative indicators to respectively explore transition possibility (whether new knowledge could be transitioned into formal knowledge) and transition pace (how long it would take). By analyzing the large-scale metadata of publications that contain informal knowledge and formal knowledge in the PubMed database, we find that multidimensional variables are essential to comprehensively understand knowledge role transition. More significantly, early funding support is more important for improving transition pace; journal impact has a positive correlation with the transition possibility but a negative correlation with transition pace; and weaker knowledge relatedness raises the transition possibility, whereas stronger knowledge relatedness improves the transition pace.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPubMed has suffered from the author ambiguity problem for many years. Existing studies on author name disambiguation (AND) for PubMed only used internal metadata for development. However, some of them are incomplete (eg, a large number of names are only abbreviated and their full names are not available) or less discriminative. To this end, we present a new disambiguation method, namely AggAND, by aggregating information from external databases.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe address this issue by exploring Microsoft Academic Graph, Semantic Scholar, and PubMed Knowledge Graph to enhance the built-in name metadata, and extend the internal metadata with some external and more discriminative metadata.\n\n\nRESULTS\nExperimental results on enhanced name metadata demonstrate comparable performance to 3 author identifier systems, as well as show superiority over the original name metadata. More importantly, our method, AggAND, incorporating both enhanced name and extended metadata, yields F1 scores of 95.80% and 93.71% on 2 datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin (3.61% and 6.55%, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe feasibility and good performance of our methods not only help better understand the importance of external databases for disambiguation, but also point to a promising direction for future AND studies in which information aggregated from multiple bibliographic databases can be effective in improving disambiguation performance. The methodology shown here can be generalized to broader bibliographic databases beyond PubMed. Our code and data are available online (https://github.com/carmanzhang/PubMed-AND-method).",

In this paper, we grouped section headers with similar functions as a structural function and defined the distribution of citations from structural functions for a paper as its citation structure. We aim to explore the relationship between citation structure and the future impact of a publication and disclose the relative importance among citations from different structural functions. Specifically, we proposed two citation counting methods and a citation life cycle identification method, by which the regression data were built. Subsequently, we employed a ridge regression model to predict the future impact of the paper and analyzed the relative weights of regressors. Based on documents collected from the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology website, our empirical experiments disclosed that functional structure features improve the prediction accuracy of citation count prediction and that there exist differences among citations from different structural functions. Specifically, at the early stage of citation lifetime, citations from Introduction and Method are particularly important for perceiving future impact of papers, and citations from Result and Conclusion are also vital. However, early accumulation of citations from the Background seems less important.",

            "abstract": "Dividing papers based on their numbers of citations into several groups constitutes one of the most common research practices in bibliometrics and beyond. However, existing dividing methods are both arbitrary and subject to bias. This article proposes a novel approach to partition highly, medium and lowly cited publications based on their citation distribution. We utilise the whole Web of Science (WoS) dataset to demonstrate how to apply this approach to scholarly datasets and examine the robustness of our algorithm in each of the six disciplines under the WoS dataset. The codes that underlie the algorithm are available online.",

            "abstract": "Author identifier (ID) is essential for many downstream tasks, such as co-author network and scientist mobility analysis. As a widely used database, author ID of PubMed is not officially provided by National Institutes of Health (NIH), that restrict some identifier-based researches or systems. This study exploited three open bibliographic databases Aminer, Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and Semantic Scholar (S2) to associate author ID for PubMed. For this purpose, paper linking and author linking was performed in order to mine paper and author links between PubMed and these databases. Performance of author name disambiguation (AND) was evaluated on two datasets. Our findings suggested that, S2 contains full volume of PubMed regarding link completeness. With respect to correctness of author ID, S2 and MAG achieved better performance than Aminer. The best F1 score of there available identifiers is below 90%, indicate AND for large scale database remain as a difficult task and efforts are being need for further improvement. We made the final dataset publicly available for facilitating future research.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, publication citation networks are regarded as acyclic, that is, no loops in the network as an earlier published article cannot cite a later published article. However, due to the accessibility of pre-print versions of articles, there might be some loops in a publication citation network. This article presents a descriptive statistic on loops in publication citation networks of computer science and physics by employing a network-based indicator, namely, strongly connected component (SCC). By employing computer science and physics disciplines publications from the Web of Science database as examples, this article examines the count of loops, how the count changes over time and how the count relates to the published year difference between publications within the loop in the citation network. Some common structural patterns are also extracted and analysed; we observe that the two disciplines share the most frequent patterns though there exist some minor differences. Moreover, we find that self-citations in terms of authors, authors\u2019 institutions and journals contribute to the formation of loops in publication citation networks.",
