            "title": "Explanation Shift: How Did the Distribution Shift Impact the Model?",
            "abstract": "As input data distributions evolve, the predictive performance of machine learning models tends to deteriorate. In practice, new input data tend to come without target labels. Then, state-of-the-art techniques model input data distributions or model prediction distributions and try to understand issues regarding the interactions between learned models and shifting distributions. We suggest a novel approach that models how explanation characteristics shift when affected by distribution shifts. We find that the modeling of explanation shifts can be a better indicator for detecting out-of-distribution model behaviour than state-of-the-art techniques. We analyze different types of distribution shifts using synthetic examples and real-world data sets. We provide an algorithmic method that allows us to inspect the interaction between data set features and learned models and compare them to the state-of-the-art. We release our methods in an open-source Python package, as well as the code used to reproduce our experiments.",

            "abstract": "Understanding which traffic light controls which lane is crucial to navigate intersections safely. Autonomous vehicles commonly rely on High Definition (HD) maps that contain information about the assignment of traffic lights to lanes. The manual provisioning of this information is tedious, expensive, and not scalable. To remedy these issues, our novel approach derives the assignments from traffic light states and the corresponding motion patterns of vehicle traffic. This works in an automated way and independently of the geometric arrangement. We show the effectiveness of basic statistical approaches for this task by implementing and evaluating a pattern-based contribution method. In addition, our novel rejection method includes accompanying safety considerations by leveraging statistical hypothesis testing. Finally, we propose a dataset transformation to re-purpose available motion prediction datasets for semantic map learning. Our publicly available API for the Lyft Level 5 dataset enables researchers to develop and evaluate their own approaches55https://github.com/map-learning/tl2la.",

            "abstract": "We develop a new method to detect anomalies within time series, which is essential in many application domains, reaching from self-driving cars, finance, and marketing to medical diagnosis and epidemiology. The method is based on self-supervised deep learning that has played a key role in facilitating deep anomaly detection on images, where powerful image transformations are available. However, such transformations are widely unavailable for time series. Addressing this, we develop Local Neural Transformations(LNT), a method learning local transformations of time series from data. The method produces an anomaly score for each time step and thus can be used to detect anomalies within time series. We prove in a theoretical analysis that our novel training objective is more suitable for transformation learning than previous deep Anomaly detection(AD) methods. Our experiments demonstrate that LNT can find anomalies in speech segments from the LibriSpeech data set and better detect interruptions to cyber-physical systems than previous work. Visualization of the learned transformations gives insight into the type of transformations that LNT learns.",

            "abstract": "Recently, various methods for representation learning on Knowledge Bases (KBs) have been developed. However, these approaches either only focus on learning the embed-dings of the data-level knowledge (ABox) or exhibit inherent limitations when dealing with the concept-level knowledge (TBox), e.g., not properly modelling the structure of the logical knowledge. We present BoxEL, a geometric KB embedding approach that allows for better capturing logical structure expressed in the theories of Description Logic EL ++ . BoxEL models concepts in a KB as axis-parallel boxes exhibiting the advantage of intersectional closure, entities as points inside boxes, and relations between concepts/entities as af\ufb01ne transformations . We show theoretical guarantees ( soundness ) of BoxEL for preserving logical structure. Namely, the trained model of BoxEL embedding with loss 0 is a (logical) model of the KB. Experimental results on subsumption reasonings and a real-world application\u2013protein-protein prediction show that BoxEL out-performs traditional knowledge graph embedding methods as well as state-of-the-art EL ++ embedding approaches.",

            "abstract": "In the building industry, disciplines have specific requirements for capturing, storing and representing information. As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontologies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly.",

            "abstract": "Past research has demonstrated that the explicit use of protected attributes in machine learning can improve both performance and fairness. Many machine learning algorithms, however, cannot directly process categorical attributes, such as country of birth or ethnicity. Because protected attributes frequently are categorical, they must be encoded as features that can be input to a chosen machine learning algorithm, e.g. support vector machines, gradient boosting decision trees or linear models. Thereby, encoding methods influence how and what the machine learning algorithm will learn, affecting model performance and fairness. This work compares the accuracy and fairness implications of the two most well-known encoding methods: one-hot encoding and target encoding. We distinguish between two types of induced bias that may arise from these encoding methods and may lead to unfair models. The first type, irreducible bias, is due to direct group category discrimination and the second type, reducible bias, is due to the large variance in statistically underrepresented groups. We investigate the interaction between categorical encodings and target encoding regularization methods that reduce unfairness. Furthermore, we consider the problem of intersectional unfairness that may arise when machine learning best practices improve performance measures by encoding several categorical attributes into a high-cardinality feature.",

The topological structures of real-world KGs, however, are rather heterogeneous, i.e., a KG is composed of multiple distinct hierarchies and non-hierarchical graph structures. Therefore, a homogeneous (either Euclidean or hyperbolic) geometry is not sufficient for fairly representing such heterogeneous structures. To capture the topological heterogeneity of KGs, we present an ultrahyperbolic KG embedding (UltraE) in an ultrahyperbolic (or pseudo-Riemannian) manifold that seamlessly interleaves hyperbolic and spherical manifolds. In particular, we model each relation as a pseudo-orthogonal transformation that preserves the pseudo-Riemannian bilinear form. The pseudo-orthogonal transformation is decomposed into various operators (i.e., circular rotations, reflections and hyperbolic rotations), allowing for simultaneously modeling heterogeneous structures as well as complex relational patterns. Experimental results on three standard KGs show that UltraE outperforms previous Euclidean, hyperbolic, and mixed-curvature KG embedding approaches.",

            "title": "Formalizing Cost Fairness for Two-Party Exchange Protocols using Game Theory and Applications to Blockchain",
            "abstract": "Existing fair exchange protocols usually neglect consideration of cost when assessing their fairness. However, in an environment with non-negligible transaction cost, e.g., public blockchains, high or unexpected transaction cost might be an obstacle for wide-spread adoption of fair exchange protocols in business applications. For example, as of 2021-12-17, the initialization of the FairSwap protocol on the Ethereum blockchain requires the selling party to pay a fee of approx. 349.20 USD per exchange. We address this issue by defining cost fairness, which can be used to assess two-party exchange protocols including implied transaction cost. We show that in an environment with non-negligible transaction cost where one party has to initialize the exchange protocol and the other party can leave the exchange at any time cost fairness cannot be achieved.",
