            "title": "PriMeSRL-Eval: A Practical Quality Metric for Semantic Role Labeling Systems Evaluation",
            "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) identifies the predicate-argument structure in a sentence. This task is usually accomplished in four steps: predicate identification, predicate sense disambiguation, argument identification, and argument classification. Errors introduced at one step propagate to later steps. Unfortunately, the existing SRL evaluation scripts do not consider the full effect of this error propagation aspect. They either evaluate arguments independent of predicate sense (CoNLL09) or do not evaluate predicate sense at all (CoNLL05), yielding an inaccurate SRL model performance on the argument classification task. In this paper, we address key practical issues with existing evaluation scripts and propose a more strict SRL evaluation metric PriMeSRL. We observe that by employing PriMeSRL, the quality evaluation of all SoTA SRL models drops significantly, and their relative rankings also change. We also show that PriMeSRLsuccessfully penalizes actual failures in SoTA SRL models.",

            "title": "Universal Proposition Bank 2.0",
            "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) represents the meaning of a sentence in the form of predicate-argument structures. Such shallow semantic analysis is helpful in a wide range of downstream NLP tasks and real-world applications. As treebanks enabled the development of powerful syntactic parsers, the accurate predicate-argument analysis demands training data in the form of propbanks. Unfortunately, most languages simply do not have corresponding propbanks due to the high cost required to construct such resources. To overcome such challenges, Universal Proposition Bank 1.0 (UP1.0) was released in 2017, with high-quality propbank data generated via a two-stage method exploiting monolingual SRL and multilingual parallel data. In this paper, we introduce Universal Proposition Bank 2.0 (UP2.0), with significant enhancements over UP1.0: (1) propbanks with higher quality by using a state-of-the-art monolingual SRL and improved auto-generation of annotations; (2) expanded language coverage (from 7 to 9 languages); (3) span annotation for the decoupling of syntactic analysis; and (4) Gold data for a subset of the languages. We also share our experimental results that confirm the significant quality improvements of the generated propbanks. In addition, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation on how different implementation choices impact the quality of the resulting data. We release these resources to the research community and hope to encourage more research on cross-lingual SRL.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates updates of Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in 23 languages and their impact on a downstream application. Numerous people are involved in updating UD\u2019s annotation guidelines and treebanks in various languages. However, it is not easy to verify whether the updated resources maintain universality with other language resources. Thus, validity and consistency of multilingual corpora should be tested through application tasks involving syntactic structures with PoS tags, dependency labels, and universal features. We apply the syntactic parsers trained on UD treebanks from multiple versions (2.0 to 2.7) to a clause-level sentiment extractor. We then analyze the relationships between attachment scores of dependency parsers and performance in application tasks. For future UD developments, we show examples of outputs that differ depending on version.",

            "abstract": "The maintenance of wordnets and lexical knwoledge bases typically relies on time-consuming manual effort. In order to minimise this issue, we propose the exploitation of models of distributional semantics, namely word embeddings learned from corpora, in the automatic identification of relation instances missing in a wordnet. Analogy-solving methods are first used for learning a set of relations from analogy tests focused on each relation. Despite their low accuracy, we noted that a portion of the top-given answers are good suggestions of relation instances that could be included in the wordnet. This procedure is applied to the enrichment of OpenWordNet-PT, a public Portuguese wordnet. Relations are learned from data acquired from this resource, and illustrative examples are provided. Results are promising for accelerating the identification of missing relation instances, as we estimate that about 17% of the potential suggestions are good, a proportion that almost doubles if some are automatically invalidated.",

Depending on the language, the information comes from treebanks (mostly Universal Dependencies v2.x) or from automatic parsers trained on UD v2.x treebanks (e.g., UDPipe). \nVMWEs include idioms (let the cat out of the bag), light-verb constructions (make a decision), verb-particle constructions (give up), inherently reflexive verbs (help oneself), and multi-verb constructions (make do). \nFor the 1.2 shared task edition, the data covers 14 languages, for which VMWEs were annotated according to the universal guidelines. The corpora are provided in the cupt format, inspired by the CONLL-U format. \nMorphological and syntactic information \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2013 not necessarily using UD tagsets \u2013 including parts of speech, lemmas, morphological features and/or syntactic dependencies are also provided.

Our aim is to improve WordNet to better function within Oil & Gas domain, particularly geoscience texts. We use a three step approach: a proof of concept-level extension of WordNet, a major extension on which we evaluate the impact with positive results and a full extension encompassing all GBA\u2019s lithological terms. We also build a mapping to GBA which also links to several other resources: WikiData, British Geological Survey, Inspire, GeoSciML and DBpedia.",

            "abstract": "This multilingual resource contains corpora in which verbal MWEs have been manually annotated, gathered at the occasion of the 1.2 edition of the PARSEME Shared Task on semi-supervised Identification of Verbal MWEs (2020). \nVMWEs include idioms (let the cat out of the bag), light-verb constructions (make a decision), verb-particle constructions (give up), inherently reflexive verbs (help oneself), and multi-verb constructions (make do). \nFor the 1.2 shared task edition, the data covers 14 languages, for which VMWEs were annotated according to the universal guidelines. The corpora are provided in the cupt format, inspired by the CONLL-U format. \nMorphological and syntactic information \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2013 not necessarily using UD tagsets \u2013 including parts of speech, lemmas, morphological features and/or syntactic dependencies are also provided. Depending on the language, the information comes from treebanks (e.g., Universal Dependencies) or from automatic parsers trained on treebanks (e.g., UDPipe). \nThis item contains training, development and test data, as well as the evaluation tools used in the PARSEME Shared Task 1.2 (2020). The annotation guidelines are available online: http://parsemefr.lif.univ-mrs.fr/parseme-st-guidelines/1.2",

In this paper, we detail the second release of this resource entitled \u201cEnglish WordNet 2020\u201d. The work has focused firstly, on the introduction of new synsets and senses and developing guidelines for this and secondly, on the integration of contributions from other projects. We present the changes in this edition, which total over 15,000 changes over the previous release.",

            "abstract": ". Ontologies are formal specifications that enable inferential processes over shared knowledge. In distributed contexts, applications frequently need to access information from multiple ontologies. For this end, concepts of two different ontologies must be matched through an alignment. If the alignment is not semantically sound, however, the integration of the ontologies may lead to unintended consequences. One type of possible consequences is the introduction of new subsumption relations between concepts from one of the input ontologies, which violate the conservativity principle. We propose a method based on the mathematical formalism of Category Theory for detecting such violations.",
