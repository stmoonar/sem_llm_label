            "title": "Scalable Spatio-temporal Top-k Interaction Queries on Dynamic Communities",
            "abstract": "Social media platforms generate massive amounts of data that reveal valuable insights about users and communities at large. Existing techniques have not fully exploited such data to help practitioners perform a deep analysis of large online communities. Lack of scalability hinders analyzing communities of large sizes and requires tremendous system resources and unacceptable runtime. This article proposes a new analytical query that identifies the top-k posts that a given user community has interacted with during a specific time interval and within a spatial range. We propose a novel indexing framework that captures the interactions of users and communities to provide a low query latency. Moreover, we propose exact and approximate algorithms to process the query efficiently and utilize the index content to prune the search space. The extensive experimental evaluation on real data has shown the superiority of our techniques and their scalability to support large online communities.",

            "abstract": "Mobility data captures the locations of moving objects such as humans, animals, and cars. With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location-tracking technologies, mobility data is collected ubiquitously. In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated a significant impact in various domains, including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this article, we present the domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we present a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state-of-the-art, and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "The process of regionalization involves clustering a set of spatial areas into spatially contiguous regions. Given the NP-hard nature of regionalization problems, all existing algorithms yield approximate solutions. To ascertain the quality of these approximations, it is crucial for domain experts to obtain statistically significant evidence on optimizing the objective function, in comparison to a random reference distribution derived from all potential sample solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial regionalization problem, denoted as SISR (Statistical Inference for Spatial Regionalization), which generates random sample solutions with a predetermined region cardinality. The driving motivation behind SISR is to conduct statistical inference on any given regionalization scheme. To address SISR, we present a parallel technique named PRRP (P-Regionalization through Recursive Partitioning). PRRP operates over three phases: the region growing phase constructs initial regions with a predefined cardinality, while the region merging and region splitting phases ensure the spatial contiguity of unassigned areas, allowing for the growth of subsequent regions with predefined cardinalites. An extensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of PRRP using various real datasets.",

Current DCEL implementations assume a standalone machine environment, which does not scale when processing the large dataset sizes that abound in today\u2019s spatial applications. This paper proposes a Distributed Doubly Connected Edge List (DDCEL) data structure extending the DCEL to a distributed environment. The DDCEL constructor undergoes a two-phase paradigm to generate the subdivision\u2019s vertices, half-edges, and faces. After spatially partitioning the input data, the first phase runs the sequential DCEL construction algorithm on each data partition in parallel. The second phase then iteratively merges information from multiple data partitions to generate the shared data structure. Our experimental evaluation with real data of road networks of up to 563 million line segments shows significant performance advantages of the proposed approach over the existing techniques.",

            "abstract": "The widespread of geotagged data combined with modern map services allows for the accurate attachment of data to spatial networks. Applying statistical analysis, such as hotspot detection, over spatial networks is very important for precise quantification and patterns analysis, which empowers effective decision-making in various important applications. Existing hotspot detection algorithms on spatial networks either lack statistical evidence on detected hotspots, such as clustering, or they provide statistical evidence at a prohibitive computational overhead. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for detecting hotspots based on the network local K-function for predefined and unknown hotspot radii. The network local K-function is a widely adopted statistical approach for network pattern analysis that enables the understanding of the density and distribution of activities and events in the spatial network. However, its practical application has been limited due to the inefficiency of existing algorithms, particularly for large-sized networks. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets shows that our algorithms are up to 28 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms in computing hotspots with a predefined radius and up to more than four orders of magnitude faster in identifying hotspots without a predefined radius.",

            "abstract": "Regionalization techniques group spatial areas into a set of homogeneous regions to analyze and draw conclusions about spatial phenomena. A recent regionalization problem, called MP-regions, groups spatial areas to produce a maximum number of regions by enforcing a user-defined constraint at the regional level. The MP-regions problem is NP-hard. Existing approximate algorithms for MP-regions do not scale for large datasets due to their high computational cost and inherently centralized approaches to process data. This article introduces a parallel scalable regionalization framework (PAGE) to support MP-regions on large datasets. The proposed framework works in two stages. The first stage finds an initial solution through randomized search, and the second stage improves this solution through efficient heuristic search. To build an initial solution efficiently, we extend traditional spatial partitioning techniques to enable parallelized region building without violating the spatial constraints. Furthermore, we optimize the region building efficiency and quality by tuning the randomized area selection to trade off runtime with region homogeneity. The experimental evaluation shows the superiority of our framework to support an order of magnitude larger datasets efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art techniques while producing high-quality solutions.",

Numerous techniques for spatial regionalization have been proposed in the literature, which employ varying methods for region growing, seeding, optimization and enforce different user-defined constraints and objectives. This paper introduces a scalable unified system for addressing seeding spatial regionalization queries efficiently. The proposed system provides a usable and scalable framework that employs a wide-range of existing spatial regionalization techniques and allows users to submit novel combinations of queries that have not been previously explored. This represents a significant step forward in the field of spatial regionalization as it provides a robust platform for addressing different regionalization queries. The system is mainly composed of three components: query parser, query planner, and query executor. Preliminary evaluations of the system demonstrate its efficacy in efficiently addressing various regionalization queries.",

However, existing sequential implementations for computing the overlay do not scale and fail to complete for large datasets (for example the US census tracks). In this paper we propose a distributed and scalable way to compute the overlay operation and its related supported queries.

In addition, existing architectures suffer from a lack of generality for different types of kNN queries. This paper proposes U-ASK; a Unified Architecture for Spatial-Keyword query supporting negative keyword predicates.
