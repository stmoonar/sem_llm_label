            "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed an increasing frequency and intensity of disasters, from extreme weather, drought, and wildfires to hurricanes, floods, and wars. Providing timely disaster response and humanitarian aid to these events is a critical topic for decision makers and relief experts in order to mitigate impacts and save lives. When a disaster occurs, it is important to acquire first-hand, real-time information about the potentially affected area, its infrastructure, and its people in order to develop situational awareness and plan a response to address the health needs of the affected population. This requires rapid assembly of multi-source geospatial data that need to be organized and visualized in a way to support disaster-relief efforts. In this paper, we introduce a new cyberinfrastructure solution\u2014GeoGraphVis\u2014that is empowered by knowledge graph technology and advanced visualization to enable intelligent decision making and problem solving. There are three innovative features of this solution. First, a location-aware knowledge graph is created to link and integrate cross-domain data to make the graph analytics-ready. Second, expert-driven disaster response workflows are analyzed and modeled as machine-understandable decision paths to guide knowledge exploration via the graph. Third, a scene-based visualization strategy is developed to enable interactive and heuristic visual analytics to better comprehend disaster impact situations and develop action plans for humanitarian aid.",

            "abstract": "Initiated by the University Consortium of Geographic Information Science (UCGIS), the GIS&T Body of Knowledge (BoK) is a community\u2010driven endeavor to define, develop, and document geospatial topics related to geographic information science and technologies (GIS&T). In recent years, GIS&T BoK has undergone rigorous development in terms of its topic re\u2010organization and content updating, resulting in a new digital version of the project. While the BoK topics provide useful materials for researchers and students to learn about GIS, the semantic relationships among the topics, such as semantic similarity, should also be identified so that a better and automated topic navigation can be achieved. Currently, the related topics are either defined manually by editors or authors, which may result in an incomplete assessment of topic relationships. To address this challenge, our research evaluates the effectiveness of multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques in extracting semantics from text, including both deep neural networks and traditional machine learning approaches. Besides, a novel text summarization\u2014KACERS (Keyword\u2010Aware Cross\u2010Encoder\u2010Ranking Summarizer)\u2014is proposed to generate a semantic summary of scientific publications. By identifying the semantic linkages among key topics, this work guides the future development and content organization of the GIS&T BoK project. It also offers a new perspective on the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing scientific publications and demonstrates the potential of the KACERS summarizer in semantic understanding of long text documents.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from highly heterogeneous sources. Within just a few years, KGs and their supporting technologies have become a core component of modern search engines, intelligent personal assistants, business intelligence, and so on. Interestingly, despite large-scale data availability, they have yet to be as successful in the realm of environmental data and environmental intelligence. In this paper, we will explain why spatial data require special treatment, and how and when to semantically lift environmental data to a KG. We will present our KnowWhereGraph that contains a wide range of integrated datasets at the human\u2013environment interface, introduce our application areas, and discuss geospatial enrichment services on top of our graph. Jointly, the graph and services will provide answers to questions such as \u201cwhat is here,\u201d \u201cwhat happened here before,\u201d and \u201chow does this region compare to \u2026\u201d for any region on earth within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph technology is considered a powerful and semantically enabled solution to link entities, allowing users to derive new knowledge by reasoning data according to various types of reasoning rules. However, in building such a knowledge graph, events modeling, such as that of disasters, is often limited to single, isolated events. The linkages among cascading events are often missing in existing knowledge graphs. This paper introduces our GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence) solutions to identify causality among events, in particular, disaster events, based on a set of spatially and temporally-enabled semantic rules. Through a use case of causal disaster events modeling, we demonstrated how these defined rules, including theme-based identification of correlated events, spatiotemporal co-occurrence constraint, and text mining of event metadata, enable the automatic extraction of causal relationships between different events. Our solution enriches the event knowledge base and allows for the exploration of linked cascading events in large knowledge graphs, therefore empowering knowledge query and discovery.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper, we present a data-driven framework to support exploratory spatial, temporal, and statistical analysis of intra-urban human mobility. We leveraged a new mobility data source, the dockless bike-sharing service Mobike, to quantify short-trip transportation patterns in Shanghai, China, the world\u2019s largest bike-share city. A data-driven framework was established to integrate multiple data sources, including transportation network data (roads, bikes, and public transit), road characteristics, and urban land use, to achieve a detailed, accurate analysis of cycling patterns at both the individual and group levels. The results provide a comprehensive view of mobility patterns in the use of shared-ride bicycles, including: (1) the temporal and spatiotemporal distribution of shared-bike usage and how this varies according to different land use; (2) the statistical distribution of Mobike trips, which are primarily short-distance; and (3) the travel behavior and road factors that influence Mobike users\u2019 route choice. The findings offer valuable insights for city planners regarding infrastructure development, for shared-ride bike companies to offer better bike rebalancing strategies to meet user demand, and for the promotion of this new green transportation mode to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance public health.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of geospatial data from diverse sources, such as Earth observation satellites, social media, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has created a pressing demand for cross-platform data integration, interoperation, and intelligent data analysis. To address this big data challenge, this paper reports our research in developing a rule-based, semantic-enabled service chain model to support intelligent question answering for leveraging the abundant data and processing resources available online. Four key techniques were developed to achieve this goal: (1) A spatial and temporal reasoner resolves the spatial and temporal information in a given scientific question and enables place-name disambiguation based on support from a gazetteer; (2) a spatial operation ontology categorizes important spatial analysis operations, data types, and data themes, which will be used in automated chain generation; (3) a language-independent chaining rule defines the template for input, spatial operation, and output as well as rules for embedding multiple spatial operations for solving a complex problem; and (4) a recursive algorithm facilitates the generation of executive workflow metadata according to the chaining rules. We implement this service chain model in a cyberinfrastructure for online and reproducible spatial analysis and question answering. Moving the problem-solving environment from a desktop-based environment onto a geospatial cyberinfrastructure (GeoCI) offers better support to collaborative spatial decision-making and ensures science replicability. We expect this work to contribute significantly to the advancement of a reproducible spatial data science and to building the next-generation open knowledge network.",
