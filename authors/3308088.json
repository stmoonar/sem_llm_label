            "abstract": "Applications of large open-domain knowledge graphs (KGs) to real-world problems pose many unique challenges. In this paper, we present extensions to Saga our platform for continuous construction and serving of knowledge at scale. In particular, we describe a pipeline for training knowledge graph embeddings that powers key capabilities such as fact ranking, fact verification, a related entities service, and support for entity linking. We then describe how our platform, including graph embeddings, can be leveraged to create a Semantic Annotation service that links unstructured Web documents to entities in our KG. Semantic annotation of the Web effectively expands our knowledge graph with edges to open-domain Web content which can be used in various search and ranking problems. Finally, we leverage annotated Web documents to drive Open-domain Knowledge Extraction. This targeted extraction framework identifies important coverage issues in the KG, then finds relevant data sources for target entities on the Web and extracts missing information to enrich the KG. Finally, we describe adaptations to our knowledge platform needed to construct and serve private personal knowledge on-device. This includes private incremental KG construction, cross- device knowledge sync, and global knowledge enrichment.",

            "title": "Studying the \"Wisdom of Crowds\" at Scale",
            "abstract": "In a variety of problem domains, it has been observed that the aggregate opinions of groups are often more accurate than those of the constituent individuals, a phenomenon that has been dubbed the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d. However, due to the varying contexts, sample sizes, methodologies, and scope of previous studies, it has been difficult to gauge the extent to which conclusions generalize. To investigate this question, we carried out a large online experiment to systematically evaluate crowd performance on 1,000 questions across 50 topical domains. We further tested the effect of different types of social influence on crowd performance. For example, in one condition, participants could see the cumulative crowd answer before providing their own. In total, we collected more than 500,000 responses from nearly 2,000 participants. We have three main results. First, averaged across all questions, we find that the crowd indeed performs better than the average individual in the crowd\u2014but we also find substantial heterogeneity in performance across questions. Second, we find that crowd performance is generally more consistent than that of individuals; as a result, the crowd does considerably better than individuals when performance is computed on a full set of questions within a domain. Finally, we find that social influence can, in some instances, lead to herding, decreasing crowd performance. Our findings illustrate some of the subtleties of the wisdom-of-crowds phenomenon, and provide insights for the design of social recommendation platforms.",

            "abstract": "This short paper describes a sentiment analysis system for micro-post data that includes analysis of tweets from Twitter and Short Messaging Service (SMS) text messages. We discuss our system that makes use of Word Sense Disambiguation techniques in sentiment analysis at the message level, where the entire tweet or SMS text was analysed to determine its dominant sentiment. Previous work done in the area of Word Sense Disambiguation does not throw light on its influence on the analysis of social-media text and micropost data, which is what our work aims to achieve. Our experiments show that the use of Word Sense Disambiguation alone has resulted in an improved sentiment analysis system that outperforms systems built without incorporating Word Sense Disambiguation.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally a communication channel is mandatory for performing verbal and written communication. The same use case when mapped to information and communication technology gives rise to one of the concept called textual communication, which deals with transmitting text using a communication channel. Every symbol used in the text needs a unit of storage called byte, the metric for transmission and storage resources. Due to the limitations of the transmission channel with respect to bandwidth and storage with respect to size, considerable models, methods and technologies have been proposed and evolved to optimally utilize the said resources without compromising the content and the semantics of the text. This work carried out proposes a novel framework for representing and storing textual data called Ordell Ugo Nano hereinafter termed as OUNano, which can be seamlessly integrated with existing communication and storage infrastructure. The proposed methodology attempts to best optimize the utilization of existing digital storage and communication resources, thus allowing such resources to be exploited to their maximum potential. This facilitates a considerably higher rate of textual data transmission and processing in communication channels, along with significant increase in storage capacities of the existing storage assets in place, without investing in additional resources.",

            "abstract": "In a variety of problem domains, it has been observed that the aggregate opinions of groups are often more accurate than those of the constituent individuals, a phenomenon that has been termed the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" Yet, perhaps surprisingly, there is still little consensus on how generally the phenomenon holds, how best to aggregate crowd judgements, and how social influence affects estimates. We investigate these questions by taking a meta wisdom of crowds approach. With a distributed team of over 100 student researchers across 17 institutions in the United States and India, we develop a large-scale online experiment to systematically study the wisdom of crowds effect for 1,000 different tasks in 50 subject domains. These tasks involve various types of knowledge (e.g., explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, and prediction), question formats (e.g., multiple choice and point estimation), and inputs (e.g., text, audio, and video). To examine the effect of social influence, participants are randomly assigned to one of three different experiment conditions in which they see varying degrees of information on the responses of others. In this ongoing project, we are now preparing to recruit participants via Amazon?s Mechanical Turk.",
