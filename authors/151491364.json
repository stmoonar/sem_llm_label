            "title": "A Complementary Split-Ring Resonator (CSRR)-Based 2D Displacement Sensor",
            "abstract": "In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) displacement sensor based on the diagonal symmetry complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) structure is proposed. The one-dimensional (1D) displacement sensor is initially developed by etching a ring on the ground plane, and a triangle metal patch is used as the mover. When the mover is attached, a CSRR is formed, thereby inducing a resonant frequency. The displacement of the mover can be retrieved by the variation in the resonant frequency. Then, the structure is extended for designing a 2D displacement sensor. To further reduce the error caused by the lateral displacement, the shape of the sensor is further optimized using the particle swarm algorithm. Finally, the structure of the CSRR displacement sensor is simulated and analyzed, and a physical prototype is made. The measured results are consistent with the theoretical analysis, and its sensitivity is 160 MHz/mm.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of big data era, short video social network has gradually become an important battlefield for the outbreak of online public opinion. Therefore, the study for information transmission model is a hot topic for governing online public opinion. Based on improving the shortcomings of traditional SEIR model, we establish the BLSI model. Furthermore, the main affecting factors of information dissemination are selected by the principal component analysis method. Through changing the value of model parameters, the processes of information dissemination are simulated under different conditions. The simulation results are similar to the real network.",

            "title": "A Hybrid Two-Axis Force Sensor for the Mesoscopic Structural Superlubricity Studies",
            "abstract": "Structural superlubricity (SSL) is a state of nearly zero friction and zero wear between two directly contacted solid surfaces. Recently, SSL was achieved in mesoscale and thus opened the SSL technology which promises great applications in Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS), sensors, storage technologies, etc. However, load issues in current mesoscale SSL studies are still not clear. The great challenge is to simultaneously measure both the ultralow shear forces and the much larger normal forces, although the widely used frictional force microscopes (FFM) and micro tribometers can satisfy the shear forces and normal forces requirements, respectively. Here we propose a hybrid two-axis force sensor that can well fill the blank between the capabilities of FFM and micro tribometers for the mesoscopic SSL studies. The proposed sensor can afford 1mN normal load with 10 nN lateral resolution. Moreover, the probe of the sensor is designed at the edge of the structure for the convenience of real-time optical observation. Calibrations and preliminary experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the design.",
