            "title": "Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows",
            "abstract": "Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.",

            "abstract": "We present our ongoing work on integrating Research Object practices with Common Workflow Language, capturing and describing prospective and retrospective provenance. Performing computational data analysis using scientific workflows is common in many domains, including bioinformatics, physics, earth sciences and cheminformatics [1]; and it is now considered best practice to use workflows or automated scripts to improve reproducibility of analyses [2]. Recent advances in software containers and packaging help remove previous challenges in capturing software tools needed by an analysis [3,4], but other interoperability factors remain important, such as ensuring a pipeline definition can execute in multiple workflow systems [5], and that provenance of workflow runs can be reliably captured and used across heterogeneous execution environments [6]. While robust reproducibility of results is important, the outcomes and methods also need to be replicable and generalizable [7].",
