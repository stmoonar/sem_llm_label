            "title": "LLM-Ensemble: Optimal Large Language Model Ensemble Method for E-commerce Product Attribute Value Extraction",
            "abstract": "Product attribute value extraction is a pivotal component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the contemporary e-commerce industry. The provision of precise product attribute values is fundamental in ensuring high-quality recommendations and enhancing customer satisfaction. The recently emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in numerous attribute extraction tasks, without the need for domain-specific training data. Nevertheless, varying strengths and weaknesses are exhibited by different LLMs due to the diversity in data, architectures, and hyperparameters. This variation makes them complementary to each other, with no single LLM dominating all others. Considering the diverse strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, it becomes necessary to develop an ensemble method that leverages their complementary potentials. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called LLM-ensemble to ensemble different LLMs' outputs for attribute value extraction. We iteratively learn the weights for different LLMs to aggregate the labels with weights to predict the final attribute value. Not only can our proposed method be proven theoretically optimal, but it also ensures efficient computation, fast convergence, and safe deployment. We have also conducted extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, on Walmart's internal data. Our offline metrics demonstrate that the LLM-ensemble method outperforms all the state-of-the-art single LLMs on Walmart's internal dataset. This method has been launched in several production models, leading to improved Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate (CVR), and Add-to-Cart Rate (ATC).",

            "title": "Prompt Optimizer of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Abstract Concept Understanding",
            "abstract": "The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality. However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express \"peace\", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in enhancing e-commerce system performance by providing structured information about entities and their relationships, such as complementary or substitutable relations between products or product types, which can be utilized in recommender systems. However, relation labeling in KGs remains a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of e-commerce domains and the associated cost of human labor. Recently, breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising results in numerous natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of LLMs for relation labeling in e-commerce KGs, investigating their powerful learning capabilities in natural language and effectiveness in predicting relations between product types with limited labeled data. We evaluate various LLMs, including PaLM and GPT-3.5, on benchmark datasets, demonstrating their ability to achieve competitive performance compared to humans on relation labeling tasks using just 1 to 5 labeled examples per relation. Additionally, we experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to examine their impact on model performance. Our results show that LLMs significantly outperform existing KG completion models in relation labeling for e-commerce KGs and exhibit performance strong enough to replace human labeling.",

            "abstract": "Similar item recommendation is a critical task in the e-Commerce industry, which helps customers explore similar and relevant alternatives based on their interested products. Despite the traditional machine learning models, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), by design, can understand complex relations like similarity between products. However, in contrast to their wide usage in retrieval tasks and their focus on optimizing the relevance, the current GNN architectures are not tailored toward maximizing revenue-related objectives such as Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), which is one of the major business metrics for e-Commerce companies. In addition, defining accurate edge relations in GNNs is non-trivial in large-scale e-Commerce systems, due to the heterogeneity nature of the item-item relationships. This work aims to address these issues by designing a new GNN architecture called GNN-GMVO (Graph Neural Network - Gross Merchandise Value Optimizer). This model directly optimizes GMV while considering the complex relations between items. In addition, we propose a customized edge construction method to tailor the model toward similar item recommendation task and alleviate the noisy and complex item-item relations. In our comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we show higher prediction performance and expected GMV for top ranked items recommended by our model when compared with selected state-of-the-art benchmark models.",

            "abstract": "Data processing is one of the fundamental steps in machine learning pipelines to ensure data quality. Majority of the applications consider the user-defined function (UDF) design pattern for data processing in databases. Although the UDF design pattern introduces flexibility, reusability and scalability, the increasing demand on machine learning pipelines brings three new challenges to this design pattern \u2013 not low-code, not dependency-free and not knowledge-aware. To address these challenges, we propose a new design pattern that large language models (LLMs) could work as a generic data operator (LLM-GDO) for reliable data cleansing, transformation and modeling with their human-compatible performance. In the LLM-GDO design pattern, user-defined prompts (UDPs) are used to represent the data processing logic rather than implementations with a specific programming language. LLMs can be centrally maintained so users don\u2019t have to manage the dependencies at the run-time. Fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data could enhance the performance on the domain-specific tasks which makes data processing knowledge-aware. We illustrate these advantages with examples in different data processing tasks. Furthermore, we summarize the challenges and opportunities introduced by LLMs to provide a complete view of this design pattern for more discussions.",

            "abstract": "Keyword extraction is one of the core tasks in natural language processing. Classic extraction models are notorious for having a short attention span which make it hard for them to conclude relational connections among the words and sentences that are far from each other. This, in turn, makes their usage prohibitive for generating keywords that are inferred from the context of the whole text. In this paper, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating keywords for items that are inferred from the items\u2019 textual metadata. Our modeling framework includes several stages to fine grain the results by avoiding outputting keywords that are non-informative or sensitive and reduce hallucinations common in LLM\u2019s. We call our LLM-based framework Theme-Aware Keyword Extraction (LLM-TAKE). We propose two variations of framework for generating extractive and abstractive themes for products in an E-commerce setting. We perform an extensive set of experiments on three real data sets and show that our modeling framework can enhance accuracy-based and diversity-based metrics when compared with benchmark models.",

            "abstract": "The outfit generation problem involves recommending a complete outfit to a user based on their interests. Existing approaches focus on recommending items based on anchor items or specific query styles but do not consider customer interests in famous characters from movie, social media, etc. In this paper, we define a new Character-based Outfit Generation (COG) problem, designed to accurately interpret character information and generate complete outfit sets according to customer specifications such as age and gender. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework LVA-COG that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract insights from customer interests (e.g., character information) and employ prompt engineering techniques for accurate understanding of customer preferences. Additionally, we incorporate text-to-image models to enhance the visual understanding and generation (factual or counterfactual) of cohesive outfits. Our framework integrates LLMs with text-to-image models and improves the customer\u2019s approach to fashion by generating personalized recommendations. With experiments and case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution from multiple dimensions.",

            "abstract": "In e-Commerce Industry, customers\u2019 purchase decision of an item are usually influenced by the reference price of that item, which is implied within the context of the items (e.g. prices of an item set from search/recommendation) or external environments (e.g. prices from another e-Commerce platform). Despite of the prevalence and influence of the reference price on customers\u2019 behavior, existing works in Information Retrieval domain do not exploit the value of the reference price in ranking problems. In this paper, we propose a list-wise ranking model named \"Prospect-Net\" by incorporating the prospect theory, which is the theoretical foundation for framing the reference price. We consider the Top-K retrieval task under a product recommendation setting, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Prospect-Net to capture various forms of reference price under different scenarios. Polynomial solutions are proposed to solve the Top-K retrieval problem for some of the cases where the reference price is dependent on the recommended set of items to the user. Both offline e valuation and online experiments are performed on a real-world industrial dataset with significant performance improvement.",

            "title": "NEAT: A Label Noise-resistant Complementary Item Recommender System with Trustworthy Evaluation",
            "abstract": "The complementary item recommender system (CIRS) recommends the complementary items for a given query item. Existing CIRS models consider the item co-purchase signal as a proxy of the complementary relationship, due to the lack of human-curated labels from the huge transaction records. These methods represent items in a complementary embedding space and model the complementary relationship as a point estimation of the similarity between items vectors. However, co-purchased items are not necessarily complementary to each other. For example, customers may frequently purchase bananas and bottle water within the same transaction, but these two items are not complementary. Hence, using co-purchase signals directly as labels will aggravate the model performance. On the other hand, model evaluation will not be trustworthy if the labels for evaluation are not reflecting the true complementary relatedness. To address the above challenges from noisy labeling of the co-purchase data, we model the co-purchases of two items as a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes the co-purchases from the complementary relatedness, and covariance denotes the co-purchases from the noise. To do so, we represent each item as a Gaussian embedding and parameterize the Gaussian distribution of co-purchases by the means and covariances from item Gaussian embedding. To reduce the impact of the noisy labels during evaluation, we propose an independence test-based method to generate a trustworthy label set with certain confidence. Our extensive experiments on both the publicly available dataset and the large-scale real-world dataset justify the effectiveness of our proposed model in complementary item recommendations compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

            "title": "2nd International Workshop on Industrial Recommendation Systems (IRS)",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems are used widely across many industries, such as e-commerce, multimedia content platforms and social networks, to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume or connect; thus, improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry and research organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, which has resulted in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on the performance of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, it often neglects key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform in a real-world environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: business metric definition and evaluation, recommendation quality control, data and model scalability, model interpretability, model robustness and fairness, and resource limitations, such as computing and memory resources budgets, engineering workforce cost, etc. The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the broad applicability of many of academia's contributions for industrial recommendation systems. This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia and industry. Its goal is to serve as a venue through which academic researchers become aware of the additional factors that may affect the adoption of an algorithm into real production systems, and how well it will perform if deployed. Industrial researchers will also benefit from sharing the practical insights, approaches, and frameworks as well.",
