            "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.",

            "title": "Graph Neural Network for Higher-Order Dependency Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) has become a popular tool to analyze the graph data. Existing GNNs only focus on networks with first-order dependency, that is, conventional networks following the Markov property. However, many networks in real life own the higher-order dependency, such as click-stream data where the choice of the next page depends not only on the current page but also on previous pages. This kind of sequential data from complex systems (including natural dependencies) are often ignored by existing GNNs which makes them ineffective. To address this problem, we propose for the first time new GNN approaches for higher-order networks in this paper. First, we form sequence fragments by the current node and its predecessor nodes of different orders as candidate higher-order dependencies. When the fragment significantly affects the probability distribution of different successor nodes of the current node, we include it in the higher-order dependency set. We formulize the network with higher-order dependency as an augmented conventional first-order network, and then feed it into GNNs to derive network embeddings. Moreover, we further propose a new end-to-end GNN framework for dealing with higher-order networks directly in the model. Specifically, the higher-order dependency is used as the neighbor aggregation controller when the node is embedded and updated. In the graph convolutional layer, in addition to the first-order neighbor information, we also aggregate the middle node information from the higher-order dependency segment. We finally test the new approaches on three real networks with higher-order dependency, and compare with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show significant improvements of the new approaches which consider higher-order dependency.",

            "abstract": "Capturing structural similarity has been a hot topic in the field of network embedding (NE) recently due to its great help in understanding node functions and behaviors. However, existing works have paid very much attention to learning structures on homogeneous networks, while the related study on heterogeneous networks is still void. In this article, we try to take the first step for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying structures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures, we first propose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous walk (HAW) and give two more applicable variants. Then, we devise the HAW embedding (HAWE) and its variants in a data-driven manner to circumvent using an extremely large number of possible walks and train embeddings by predicting occurring walks in the neighborhood of each node. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure learning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate our methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classic methods and can be applied on large-scale networks.",

            "abstract": "In Community Question Answering (CQA) websites, expert finding aims at seeking suitable experts to answer questions. The key is to explore the inherent relevance based on the representations of questions and experts. Existing methods usually learn these features from single view information (e.g., question title), which would be not insufficient to fully learn their representations. In this paper, we propose a personalized expert finding method with a multi-view attentive matching mechanism. We design three modules under the multi-view paradigm, including a question encoder, an intra-view encoder, and an inter-view encoder, which aims to comprehend the comprehensive relationships between experts and questions. In the question encoder, we learn the multi-view question features from its title, body and tag views respectively. In the intra-view encoder, we design an interactive attention network to capture the view-specific relevance between the target question and the historical answered questions of experts for all different views. Furthermore, in the inter-view encoder we employ a personalized attention network to aggregate different view information to learn expert/question representations. In this way, the match of the expert and question could be fully captured from the multi-view information via the intra- and inter-view mechanisms. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Temporal community detection is helpful to discover and analyze significant groups or clusters hidden in dynamic networks in the real world. A variety of methods, such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model, has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving the accuracy of dynamic community detection.",

However, existing role-oriented network embedding methods focus more on identifying underlying roles for static network, which leads to complex temporal behaviors being overlooked and degraded performance facing dynamic network. The few role analytics methods for dynamic networks either cannot learn general node representations or fail to discovery role transitions of nodes. In this work, we propose a unified framework RDNE (Role-oriented Dynamic Network Embedding) to tackle such challenges, which aim to learn multiple embeddings for individual nodes based on time-varying structural behaviors. Based on regular equivalence, RDNE propagates the structural features over the graph to derive the initial role-oriented representations. Then, it applies capsule network to further model the mapping between nodes and roles, which is the first time capsule network is used for role discovery. For the varying and temporal dependence within dynamic network, we utilize the Gated Recurrent Unit to compute historical information and use historical information to influence the generation of representations at the next snapshot. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks validate the superiority of the proposed RDNE.",

            "abstract": "A variety of methods have been proposed for modeling and mining dynamic complex networks, in which the topological structure varies with time. As the most popular and successful network model, the stochastic block model (SBM) has been extended and applied to community detection, link prediction, anomaly detection, and evolution analysis of dynamic networks. However, all current models based on the SBM for modeling dynamic networks are designed at the community level, assuming that nodes in each community have the same dynamic behavior, which usually results in poor performance on temporal community detection and loses the modeling of node abnormal behavior. To solve the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes a hierarchical Bayesian dynamic SBM (HB-DSBM) for modeling the node-level and community-level dynamic behavior in a dynamic network synchronously. Based on the SBM, we introduce a hierarchical Dirichlet generative mechanism to associate the global community evolution with the microscopic transition behavior of nodes near-perfectly and generate the observed links across the dynamic networks. Meanwhile, an effective variational inference algorithm is developed and we can easy to infer the communities and dynamic behaviors of the nodes. Furthermore, with the two-level evolution behaviors, it can identify nodes or communities with abnormal behavior. Experiments on simulated and real-world networks demonstrate that HB-DSBM has achieved state-of-the-art performance on community detection and evolution. In addition, abnormal evolutionary behavior and events on dynamic networks can be effectively identified by our model.",

            "title": "Inflation Improves Graph Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant success in graph representation learning and become the go-to approach for many graph-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness, the performance of GNNs is known to decline gradually as the number of layers increases. This attenuation is mainly caused by noise propagation, which refers to the useless or negative information propagated (directly or indirectly) from other nodes during the multi-layer graph convolution for node representation learning. This noise increases more severely as the layers of GNNs deepen, which is also a main reason of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a new convolution strategy for GNNs to address this problem via suppressing the noise propagation. Specifically, we first find that the feature propagation process of GNNs can be taken as a Markov chain. And then, based on the idea of Markov clustering, we introduce a new graph inflation layer (i.e., using a power function over the distribution) into GNNs to prevent noise propagating from local neighbourhoods to the whole graph with the increase of network layers. Our method is simple in design, which does not require any changes on the original basis and therefore can be easily extended. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world networks and have a stable improved performance as the network depth increases over existing GNNs.",

            "title": "Modeling Community Evolution Characteristics of Dynamic Networks with Evolutionary Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization",
            "abstract": "In most cases, the block structures and evolution characteristics always coexist in dynamic networks. This leads to inaccurate results of temporal community structure analysis with a two-step strategy. Fortunately, a few approaches take the evolution characteristics into account for modeling temporal community structures. But the number of communities cannot be determined automatically. Therefore, a model, Evolutionary Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (EvoBNMF), is proposed in this paper. It focuses on modeling the temporal community structures with evolution characteristics. More specifically, the evolution behavior, which is introduced into EvoBNMF, can quantify the transfer intensity of communities between adjacent snapshots for modeling the evolution characteristics. Innovatively, the most appropriate number of communities can be determined autonomously by shrinking the corresponding evolution behaviors. Experimental results show that our approach has superior performance on temporal community detection with the virtue of autonomous determination of the number of communities.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and solving the psychological health problems of college students have become a focus of social attention. Complex networks have become important tools to study the factors affecting psychological health, and the Gaussian graphical model is often used to estimate psychological networks. However, previous studies leave some gaps to overcome, including the following aspects. (1) When studying networks of subpopulations, the estimation neglects the intrinsic relationships among subpopulations, leading to a large difference between the estimated network and the real network. (2) Because of the high cost, previous psychological surveys often have a small sample size, and the psychological description is insufficient. Here, the intrinsic connections among multiple tasks are used, and multitask machine learning is applied to develop a multitask Gaussian graphical model. The psychological networks of the population and subpopulations are estimated based on psychological questionnaire data. This study is the first to apply a psychological network to such a large-scale college student psychological analysis, and we obtain some interesting results. The model presented here is a dynamic model based on complex networks which predicts individual behavior and provides insight into the intrinsic links among various symptoms.",
