            "abstract": "In recent years, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been applied to improve numerous processes, such as inventory management in retail stores. However, automatic localization of RFID-tagged goods in stores is still a challenging problem. To address this issue, we equip fixtures (e.g., shelves) with reference tags and use data we collect during RFID-based stocktakes to map articles to fixtures. Knowing the location of goods enables the implementation of several practical applications, such as automated Money Mapping (i.e., a heat map of sales across fixtures). Specifically, we conduct controlled lab experiments and a case-study in two fashion retail stores to evaluate our article-to-fixture prediction approaches. The approaches are based on calculating distances between read event time series using DTW, and clustering of read events using DBSCAN. We find that, read events collected during RFID-based stocktakes can be used to assign articles to fixtures with an accuracy of more than 90%. Additionally, we conduct a pilot to investigate the challenges related to the integration of such a localization system in the day-to-day business of retail stores. Hence, in this paper we present an exploratory venture into novel and practical RFID-based applications in fashion retails stores, beyond the scope of stock management.",

            "abstract": "Social media users express their opinions about arbitrary subjects, including controversial matters such as the 2020 U.S. presidential election or climate change. Controversial topics typically attract user attention, which often lead to fruitful, but sometimes also heated discussions potentially segregating the community. Understanding features that are predictive of controversy in social media can improve moderation of communities and therefore the public discourse. In this paper, we analyze and predict controversy on the multilingual social platform Reddit. In particular, we compare a large set of textual and user activity features in controversial and non-controversial comments posted in six different languages. Using these features we perform a prediction task and study their predictive strengths for controversy. Our results indicate that, regardless of the language, controversial comments are harder to read, more negative and users follow up faster and more frequently to such comments. Moreover, with our prediction experiment (ROC AUC = 0.79) we find that across all languages user activity is the most predictive of controversy on Reddit. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of controversy in social media and can serve as a foundation for tools and models to automatically detect controversial content posted on such platforms.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are efficient exploration tools providing their users with valuable suggestions about items, such as products or movies. However, in scenarios where users have more specific ideas about what they are looking for (e.g., they provide describing narratives, such as \"Movies with minimal story, but incredible atmosphere, such as No Country for Old Men\"), traditional recommender systems struggle to provide relevant suggestions. In this paper, we study this problem by investigating a large collection of such narratives from the movie domain. We start by empirically analyzing a dataset containing free-text narratives representing movie suggestion requests from reddit users as well as community suggestions to those requests. We find that community suggestions are frequently more diverse than requests, making a recommendation task a challenging one. In a prediction experiment, we use embedding algorithms to assess the importance of request features including movie descriptions, genres, and plot keywords, by computing recommendations. Our findings suggest that, in our dataset, positive movies and keywords have the strongest, whereas negative movie features have the weakest predictive power. We strongly believe that our new insights into narratives for recommender systems represent an important stepping stone towards novel applications, such as interactive recommender applications.",

            "abstract": "Over the course of the last decade, online retailers have demonstrated that knowledge about customer preferences and shopping patterns is an important asset for running a successful business. For example, customer preferences and shopping histories are the foundation for recommender systems that support the search for relevant products to buy online. With the increasing adoption of modern technologies, traditional retailers are able to collect similar data about customer behavior in their stores. For example, smart fitting rooms allow to track interactions of customers with products beyond the scope of a traditional retail store. In this paper we explore how customers of a large international fashion retailer buy products online and in brick-and-mortar stores, and uncover significant differences between the two domains. In particular, we find that online customers frequently focus on buying products from one specific category, whereas customers in brick-and-mortar stores often buy a more diverse range of product types. Further, we investigate products that customers take into fitting rooms, and we find that they frequently deviate from, and complement purchases. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings impact practical applications, illustrated using recommender systems, and discuss how shopping baskets from different domains can be leveraged.",

            "abstract": "Over the course of recent years, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been applied in many different business domains to solve, for example, the problem of monitoring stock. However, keeping track of the exact (geo-) locations of items in stock is still an open problem. This is particularly problematic for logistics, retail as well as warehouses, where information about relative locations of items can drastically increase staff efficiency and business process efficacy. In this paper we set out to tackle the problem of determining relative distances between RFID tags based on time-differences in read events, without the introduction of additional hardware. To that end, we first present a novel approach, which leverages time-based distances for inferring relative RFID tag distances. We then qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our proposed approach by inferring tag locations for different experimental setups, and comparing our results to ground truth data. Finally, we present and discuss the results of a case study, which emulates real-world conditions of retailers using RFID technology for stock taking. Our results show that time-differences in read events are suitable for calculating and approximating the relative position of RFID tags in several setups. We strongly believe that the results presented in this paper represent a novel and important step towards new approaches, which leverage time-differences in read events for inferring relative tag distances.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems have become omni-present tools that are used by a wide variety of users in everyday life tasks, such as finding products in Web stores or online movie streaming portals. However, in situations where users already have an idea of what they are looking for (e.g., 'The Lord of the Rings', but in space with a dark vibe), most traditional recommender algorithms struggle to adequately address such a priori defined requirements. Therefore, users have built dedicated discussion boards to ask peers for suggestions, which ideally fulfill the stated requirements. In this paper, we set out to determine the utility of well-established recommender algorithms for calculating recommendations when provided with such a narrative. To that end, we first crowdsource a reference evaluation dataset from human movie suggestions. We use this dataset to evaluate the potential of five recommendation algorithms for incorporating such a narrative into their recommendations. Further, we make the dataset available for other researchers to advance the state of research in the field of narrative-driven recommendations. Finally, we use our evaluation dataset to improve not only our algorithmic recommendations, but also existing empirical recommendations of IMDb. Our findings suggest that the implemented recommender algorithms yield vastly different suggestions than humans when presented with the same a priori requirements. However, with carefully configured post-filtering techniques, we can outperform the baseline by up to 100%. This represents an important first step towards more refined algorithmic narrative-driven recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Over the course of recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and in particular Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), has seen widespread adoption across several different domains. Particularly the fashion industry has integrated RFID into their day-to-day business for accurate stock tracking and monitoring. While inventory accuracy can be increased well above 90%, perfect inventory accuracy is hard to achieve, which is often related to the inherent problems of RFID technology. Several factors can favor or adversely affect RFID reader performance, such as the materials items are made of, their placement in the store, or the location of where the RFID tag has been attached. Therefore, identifying such products, that are frequently missed during stocktakes, is crucial to reach fully accurate inventories, as they require special attention to be properly processed. In this paper, we set out to tackle this real-world problem of determining products with low detectability, based on historical stocktake data of more than 400 brick-and-mortar stores. Further, we conduct a controlled user study to evaluate and improve the detectability of frequently missed products for a total of 16 stores. Our results indicate that frequently missed products can be identified and used as a foundation to further improve stock accuracy in retail stores.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are an essential component in many e-commerce platforms to drive sales and guide customers when exploring new products. With the increasing adoption of RFID technology in traditional brick-and-mortar stores, for example, in the form of smart fitting rooms that allow to display recommendations in the integrated mirror, retailers have only recently started to tap into existing product recommendation algorithms. However, due to limited data availability as well as sparsity, for example due to assortments adapted for different demographics, traditional retailers largely struggle to leverage this technology. In this paper we extend the state-of-the-art embedding-based recommender approach prod2vec by processing information about co-purchased products (i.e., shopping baskets) in retail stores. By adding point-of-sale information to shopping baskets we are able to provide recommendations aimed at individual stores, without having to maintain separate models for each location. Furthermore, we experiment with data augmentation methods to overcome the imposed limitations of the available data, and are able to increase the quality of the computed recommendations by more than 6.9%.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces HopRank, an algorithm for modeling human navigation on semantic networks. HopRank leverages the assumption that users know or can see the whole structure of the network. Therefore, besides following links, they also follow nodes at certain distances (i.e., k-hop neighborhoods), and not at random as suggested by PageRank, which assumes only links are known or visible. We observe such preference towards k-hop neighborhoods on BioPortal, one of the leading repositories of biomedical ontologies on the Web. In general, users navigate within the vicinity of a concept. But they also \u201cjump\u201d to distant concepts less frequently. We fit our model on 11 ontologies using the transition matrix of clickstreams, and show that semantic structure can influence teleportation in PageRank. This suggests that users-to some extent-utilize knowledge about the underlying structure of ontologies, and leverage it to reach certain pieces of information. Our results help the development and improvement of user interfaces for ontology exploration.",
