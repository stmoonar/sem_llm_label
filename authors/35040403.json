            "abstract": "Most sequential recommendation systems (SRSs) predict the next item as the target for users given its preceding items as input, assuming the target is definitely related to its input. However, users may unintentionally click items that are inconsistent with their preference due to external factors, causing unreliable instances whose target mismatches the input. We, for the first time, verify SRSs can be misguided by such unreliable instances and design a generic SRS framework By Eliminating unReliable Data (BERD+), which can be flexibly plugged into existing SRSs. Specifically, BRED+ is guided with observations on the training process of instances: Unreliable instances generally have high training loss; high-loss instances are not necessarily unreliable but uncertain ones caused by blurry sequential patterns; and item attributes help rectify instance loss and uncertainty, but may also introduce disturbance. Accordingly, BERD+ models both the loss and uncertainty of each instance via a Gaussian distribution, whereby a heterogeneous uncertainty-aware graph convolution network is designed to learn accurate embeddings for different entities while reducing the disturbance caused by uncertain attribute values. Thereafter, an explicit preference extractor rectifies instance loss and uncertainty and reduces the disturbance caused by less-focused attribute types. Finally, instances with high loss and low uncertainty are eliminated as unreliable data. Extensive experiments verify the efficacy of BERD+.",

            "abstract": "Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item consumption or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them. For example, the intention of watching a movie could be killing time or watching it with friends; Likewise, one might connect with others due to friendships or colleagues. To fill this gap, we propose to Disentangle the multi-faceted Motives in each network (i.e., the user-item interaction network and social network) defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence is then exploited asymmetrically to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP over state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.",

            "abstract": "Re-ranking models refine item recommendation lists generated by the prior global ranking model, which have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving the recommendation quality. However, most existing re-ranking solutions only learn from implicit feedback with a shared prediction model, which regrettably ignore inter-item relationships under diverse user intentions. In this paper, we propose a novel Intention-aware Re-ranking Model with Dynamic Transformer Encoder (RAISE), aiming to perform user-specific prediction for each individual user based on her intentions. Specifically, we first propose to mine latent user intentions from text reviews with an intention discovering module (IDM). By differentiating the importance of review information with a co-attention network, the latent user intention can be explicitly modeled for each user-item pair. We then introduce a dynamic transformer encoder (DTE) to capture user-specific inter-item relationships among item candidates by seamlessly accommodating the learned latent user intentions via IDM. As such, one can not only achieve more personalized recommendations but also obtain corresponding explanations by constructing RAISE upon existing recommendation engines. Empirical study on four public datasets shows the superiority of our proposed RAISE, with up to 13.95%, 9.60%, and 13.03% relative improvements evaluated by Precision@5, MAP@5, and NDCG@5 respectively.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SR) has gained increasing attention in recent years. Quite a great amount of studies have been devoted to designing complex algorithms to improve recommendation performance, where deep learning methods account for the majority. However, most of these methods are black-box ones and ignore to provide moderate explanations to facilitate users\u2019 understanding, which thus might lead to lowered user satisfaction and reduced system revenues. Therefore, in our study, we propose a generic Reinforced Explainable framework with Knowledge graph for Session-based recommendation (i.e., REKS), which strives to improve the existing black-box SR models (denoted as non-explainable ones) with Markov decision process. In particular, we construct a knowledge graph with session behaviors and treat SR models as part of the policy network of Markov decision process. Based on our particularly designed state vector, reward strategy, and loss function, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework not only achieves improved recommendation accuracy, but also provides appropriate explanations at the same time. Finally, we instantiate the REKS in five representative, state-of-the-art SR models (i.e., GRU4REC, NARM, SR-GNN, GCSAN, BERT4REC), whereby extensive experiments towards these methods on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both recommendation and explanation tasks.",

They, however, completely ignore the impact of future behaviors on the decision-making, thus hindering the quality of user preference learning. Intuitively, users' next POI visits may also be affected by their multi-step future behaviors, as users may often have activity planning in mind. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Context-aware Future Preference inference Recommender (CFPRec) to help infer user future preference in a self-ensembling manner. In particular, it delicately derives multi-step future preferences from the learned past preference thanks to the periodic property of users' daily check-ins, so as to implicitly mimic user\u2019s activity planning before her next visit. The inferred future preferences are then seamlessly integrated with the current preference for more expressive user preference learning. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of CFPRec against state-of-the-arts.",

            "abstract": "Current session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) mainly focus on maximizing recommendation accuracy, while few studies have been devoted to improve diversity beyond accuracy. Meanwhile, it is unclear how the accuracy-oriented SBRSs perform in terms of diversity. In addition, the asserted \u201ctradeoff\u201d relationship between accuracy and diversity has been increasingly questioned in the literature. Toward the aforementioned issues, we conduct a holistic study to particularly examine the recommendation performance of representative SBRSs w.r.t. both accuracy and diversity, striving for better understanding of the diversity-related issues for SBRSs and providing guidance on designing diversified SBRSs. Particularly, for a fair and thorough comparison, we deliberately select state-of-the-art non-neural, deep neural, and diversified SBRSs by covering more scenarios with appropriate experimental setups, e.g., representative datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyper-parameter optimization technique. The source code can be obtained via github.com/qyin863/Understanding-Diversity-in-SBRSs. Our empirical results unveil that (1) non-diversified methods can also obtain satisfying performance on diversity, which can even surpass diversified ones, and (2) the relationship between accuracy and diversity is quite complex. Besides the \u201ctradeoff\u201d relationship, they can be positively correlated with each other, that is, having a same-trend (win\u2013win or lose\u2013lose) relationship, which varies across different methods and datasets. Additionally, we further identify three possible influential factors on diversity in SBRSs (i.e., granularity of item categorization, session diversity of datasets, and length of recommendation lists) and offer an intuitive guideline and a potential solution regarding learned item embeddings for more effective session-based recommendation.",

We, therefore, conduct studies from the perspectives of practical theory and experiments, aiming at benchmarking recommendation for rigorous evaluation. Regarding the theoretical study, a series of hyper-factors affecting recommendation performance throughout the whole evaluation chain are systematically summarized and analyzed via an exhaustive review on 141 papers published at eight top-tier conferences within 2017-2020. We then classify them into model-independent and model-dependent hyper-factors, and different modes of rigorous evaluation are defined and discussed in-depth accordingly. For the experimental study, we release DaisyRec 2.0 library by integrating these hyper-factors to perform rigorous evaluation, whereby a holistic empirical study is conducted to unveil the impacts of different hyper-factors on recommendation performance. Supported by the theoretical and experimental studies, we finally create benchmarks for rigorous evaluation by proposing standardized procedures and providing performance of ten state-of-the-arts across six evaluation metrics on six datasets as a reference for later study. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation, provides potential solutions for rigorous evaluation, and lays foundation for further investigation.",

            "title": "Synthesising Audio Adversarial Examples for Automatic Speech Recognition",
            "abstract": "Adversarial examples in automatic speech recognition (ASR) are naturally sounded by humans yet capable of fooling well trained ASR models to transcribe incorrectly. Existing audio adversarial examples are typically constructed by adding constrained perturbations on benign audio inputs. Such attacks are therefore generated with an audio dependent assumption. For the first time, we propose the Speech Synthesising based Attack (SSA), a novel threat model that constructs audio adversarial examples entirely from scratch, i.e., without depending on any existing audio to fool cutting-edge ASR models. To this end, we introduce a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) as the speech synthesiser. Meanwhile, an adaptive sign gradient descent algorithm is proposed to solve the adversarial audio synthesis task. Experiments on three datasets (i.e., Audio Mnist, Common Voice, and Librispeech) show that our method could synthesise naturally sounded audio adversarial examples to mislead the start-of-the-art ASR models.

            "title": "A Multi-channel Next POI Recommendation Framework with Multi-granularity Check-in Signals",
            "abstract": "Current study on next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation mainly explores user sequential transitions with the fine-grained individual-user POI check-in trajectories only, which suffers from the severe check-in data sparsity issue. In fact, coarse-grained signals (i.e., region- and global-level check-ins) in such sparse check-ins would also benefit to augment user preference learning. Specifically, our data analysis unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable patterns w.r.t. the regions of visited POIs. Meanwhile, the global all-user check-ins can help reflect sequential regularities shared by the crowd. We are, therefore, inspired to propose the MCMG: a Multi-Channel next POI recommendation framework with Multi-Granularity signals categorized from two orthogonal perspectives, i.e., fine-coarse grained check-ins at either POI/region level or local/global level. The MCMG is equipped with three modules, namely, global user behavior encoder, local multi-channel (i.e., region, category, and POI channels) encoder, and region-aware weighting strategy. Such design enables MCMG to be capable of capturing both fine- and coarse-grained sequential regularities as well as exploring the dynamic impact of multi-channel by differentiating the check-in patterns w.r.t. visited regions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our MCMG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art next POI recommendation approaches.",
