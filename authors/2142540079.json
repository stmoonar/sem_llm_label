            "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Macrocyclic peptides hold great promise as therapeutics targeting intracellular proteins. This stems from their remarkable ability to bind flat protein surfaces with high affinity and specificity while potentially traversing the cell membrane. Research has already explored their use in developing inhibitors for intracellular proteins, such as KRAS, a well-known driver in various cancers. However, computational approaches for de novo macrocyclic peptide design remain largely unexplored. Results Here, we introduce HELM-GPT, a novel method that combines the strength of the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules (HELM) representation and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) for de novo macrocyclic peptide design. Through reinforcement learning (RL), our experiments demonstrate that HELM-GPT has the ability to generate valid macrocyclic peptides and optimize their properties. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive preference loss during the RL process, further enhanced the optimization performance. Finally, to co-optimize peptide permeability and KRAS binding affinity, we propose a step-by-step optimization strategy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating molecules fulfilling both criteria. In conclusion, the HELM-GPT method can be used to identify novel macrocyclic peptides to target intracellular proteins. Availability and implementation The code and data of HELM-GPT are freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/charlesxu90/helm-gpt).",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous data is endemic due to the use of diverse models and settings of devices by hospitals in the field of medical imaging. However, there are few open-source frameworks for federated heterogeneous medical image analysis with personalization and privacy protection without the demand to modify the existing model structures or to share any private data. In this paper, we proposed PPPML-HMI, a novel open-source learning paradigm for personalized and privacy-preserving federated heterogeneous medical image analysis. To our best knowledge, personalization and privacy protection were achieved simultaneously for the first time under the federated scenario by integrating the PerFedAvg algorithm and designing the novel cyclic secure aggregation with the homomorphic encryption algorithm. To show the utility of PPPML-HMI, we applied it to a simulated classification task namely the classification of healthy people and patients from the RAD-ChestCT Dataset, and one real-world segmentation task namely the segmentation of lung infections from COVID-19 CT scans. For the real-world task, PPPML-HMI achieved $sim$5% higher Dice score on average compared to conventional FL under the heterogeneous scenario. Meanwhile, we applied the improved deep leakage from gradients to simulate adversarial attacks and showed the strong privacy-preserving capability of PPPML-HMI. By applying PPPML-HMI to both tasks with different neural networks, a varied number of users, and sample sizes, we further demonstrated the strong generalizability of PPPML-HMI.",
