            "abstract": "The Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) extends the traditional segmentation task by incrementally learning newly added classes. Previous work has introduced generative replay, which involves replaying old class samples generated from a pre-trained GAN, to address the issues of catastrophic forgetting and privacy concerns. However, the generated images lack semantic precision and exhibit out-of-distribution characteristics, resulting in inaccurate masks that further degrade the segmentation performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DiffusePast, a novel framework featuring a diffusion-based generative replay module that generates semantically accurate images with more reliable masks guided by different instructions (e.g., text prompts or edge maps). Specifically, DiffusePast introduces a dual-generator paradigm, which focuses on generating old class images that align with the distribution of downstream datasets while preserving the structure and layout of the original images, enabling more precise masks. To adapt to the novel visual concepts of newly added classes continuously, we incorporate class-wise token embedding when updating the dual-generator. Moreover, we assign adequate pseudo-labels of old classes to the background pixels in the new step images, further mitigating the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments, our method demonstrates competitive performance across mainstream benchmarks, striking a better balance between the performance of old and novel classes.",

            "abstract": "Pairwise learning strategies are prevalent for optimizing recommendation models on implicit feedback data, which usually learns user preference by discriminating between positive (i.e., clicked by a user) and negative items (i.e., obtained by negative sampling). However, the size of different item groups (specified by item attribute) is usually unevenly distributed. We empirically find that the commonly used uniform negative sampling strategy for pairwise algorithms (e.g., BPR) can inherit such data bias and oversample the majority item group as negative instances, severely countering group fairness on the item side. In this paper, we propose a Fairly adaptive Negative sampling approach (FairNeg), which improves item group fairness via adaptively adjusting the group-level negative sampling distribution in the training process. In particular, it first perceives the model\u2019s unfairness status at each step and then adjusts the group-wise sampling distribution with an adaptive momentum update strategy for better facilitating fairness optimization. Moreover, a negative sampling distribution Mixup mechanism is proposed, which gracefully incorporates existing importance-aware sampling techniques intended for mining informative negative samples, thus allowing for achieving multiple optimization purposes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show our proposed method\u2019s superiority in group fairness enhancement and fairness-utility tradeoff.",

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict next click action (e.g., item) of anonymous users based on a fixed number of previous actions. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in various applications. Inspired by the success of GNNs, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to introduce GNNs into session-based recommendation and have achieved significant results. Nevertheless, due to the highly diverse types of potential information in sessions, existing GNNs-based methods perform differently on different session datasets, leading to the need for efficient design of neural networks adapted to various session recommendation scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Automated neural architecture search for Graph-based Session Recommendation, namely AutoGSR, a framework that provides a practical and general solution to automatically find the optimal GNNs-based session recommendation model. In AutoGSR, we propose two novel GNN operations to build an expressive and compact search space. Building upon the search space, we employ a differentiable search algorithm to search for the optimal graph neural architecture. Furthermore, to consider all types of session information together, we propose to learn the item meta knowledge, which acts as a priori knowledge for guiding the optimization of final session representations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoGSR is able to find effective neural architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the neural architecture search for the session-based recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to achieve malicious purposes, such as promote or demote a set of target items. Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.",

Most social recommendation models unify user representations for the user-item interactions (collaborative domain) and social relations (social domain).

In this work, to address such limitation, we propose a novel Disentangled contrastive learning framework for social Recommendations (DcRec). More specifically, we propose to learn disentangled users' representations from the item and social domains. Moreover, disentangled contrastive learning is designed to perform knowledge transfer between disentangled users' representations for social recommendations.

            "abstract": "Session-based recommendation is a challenging problem in the real-world scenes, e.g., ecommerce, short video platforms, and music platforms, which aims to predict the next click action based on the anonymous session. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art methods for session-based recommendation. However, we find that there exist two limitations in these methods. One is the item transition relations are not fully exploited since the relations are not explicitly modeled. Another is the long-range dependencies between items can not be captured effectively due to the limitation of GNNs. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel approach for session-based recommendation, called Transition Relation Aware Self-Attention (TRASA). Specifically, TRASA first converts the session to a graph and then encodes the shortest path between items through the gated recurrent unit as their transition relation. Then, to capture the long-range dependencies, TRASA utilizes the self-attention mechanism to build the direct connection between any two items without going through intermediate ones. Also, the transition relations are incorporated explicitly when computing the attention scores. Extensive experiments on three real-word datasets demonstrate that TRASA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods consistently.",

In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning paradigm on graphs with heterophily (namely HGRL) for improving the generalizability of node representations, where node representations are optimized without any label guidance. Inspired by the designs of existing heterophilous graph neural networks, HGRL learns the node representations by preserving the node original features and capturing informative distant neighbors. Such two properties are obtained through carefully designed pretext tasks that are optimized based on estimated high-order mutual information. Theoretical analysis interprets the connections between HGRL and existing advanced graph neural network designs.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Bayesian optimization framework (termed SILBO), which finds a low-dimensional space to perform Bayesian optimization iteratively through semi-supervised dimension reduction. SILBO incorporates both labeled points and unlabeled points acquired from the acquisition function to guide the embedding space learning. To accelerate the learning procedure, we present a randomized method for generating the projection matrix. Furthermore, to map from the low-dimensional space to the high-dimensional original space, we propose two mapping strategies: $\\text{SILBO}_{FZ}$ and $\\text{SILBO}_{FX}$ according to the evaluation overhead of the objective function. Experimental results on both synthetic function and hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrate that SILBO outperforms the existing state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian optimization methods.",
