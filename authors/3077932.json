            "abstract": "Motivation A common but critical task in genomic data analysis is finding features that separate and thereby help explain differences between two classes of biological objects, e.g., genes that explain the differences between healthy and diseased patients. As lower-cost, high-throughput experimental methods greatly increase the number of samples that are assayed as objects for analysis, computational methods are needed to quickly provide insights into high-dimensional datasets with tens of thousands of objects and features. Results We develop an interactive exploration tool called Genvisage that rapidly discovers the most discriminative feature pairs that best separate two classes in a dataset, and displays the corresponding visualizations. Since quickly finding top feature pairs is computationally challenging, especially when the numbers of objects and features are large, we propose a suite of optimizations to make Genvisage more responsive and demonstrate that our optimizations lead to a 400X speedup over competitive baselines for multiple biological data sets. With this speedup, Genvisage enables the exploration of more large-scale datasets and alternate hypotheses in an interactive and interpretable fashion. We apply Genvisage to uncover pairs of genes whose transcriptomic responses significantly discriminate treatments of several chemotherapy drugs.

These gene sets are frequently subjected to functional interpretation using databases of gene annotations. Recent approaches have extended this approach to also consider networks of gene-gene relationships and interactions when attempting to characterize properties of a gene set. We present here a supervised learning algorithm for gene set analysis, called \u2018GeneSet MAPR\u2019, that for the first time explicitly considers the patterns of direct as well as indirect relationships present in the network to quantify gene-gene similarities and then report shared properties of the gene set. Our extensive evaluations show that GeneSet MAPR performs better than other network-based methods for the task of identifying genes related to a given gene set, enabling more reliable functional characterizations of the gene set. When applied to the set of response-associated genes from a triple negative breast cancer study, GeneSet MAPR uncovers gene families such as claudins, kallikreins, and collagen type alpha chains related to patient\u2019s response to treatment, and which are not uncovered with traditional analysis.",

The majority of the initially proposed methods for gene regulatory network discovery create a network of genes and then mine it in order to uncover previously unknown regulatory processes. More recent approaches have focused on inferring modules of co-regulated genes, linking these modules with regulatory genes and then mining them to discover new molecular biology.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this work we analyze module-based network approaches to build gene regulatory networks, and compare their performance to single gene network approaches. In the process, we propose a novel approach to estimate gene regulatory networks drawing from the module-based methods. We show that generating modules of co-expressed genes which are predicted by a sparse set of regulators using a variational bayes method, and then building a bipartite graph on the generated modules using sparse regression, yields more informative networks than previous single and module-based network approaches as measured by: i) the rate of enriched gene sets, ii) a network topology assessment, iii) ChIP-Seq evidence, and iv) the KnowEnG Knowledge Network collection of previously characterized gene-gene interactions.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe code is written in R and can be downloaded from https://github.com/mikelhernaez/linker.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

These gene signature collections are utilized through bioinformatics tools for \u2018signature matching', whereby a researcher studying an expression profile can identify previously cataloged biological conditions most related to their profile. Signature matching tools typically retrieve from the collection the signature that has highest similarity to the user\u2010provided profile. Alternatively, classification models may be applied where each biological condition in the signature collection is a class label; however, such models are trained on the collection of available signatures and may not generalize to the novel cellular context or cell line of the researcher's expression profile. Results We present an advanced multi\u2010way classification algorithm for signature matching, called SigMat, that is trained on a large signature collection from a well\u2010studied cellular context, but can also classify signatures from other cell types by relying on an additional, small collection of signatures representing the target cell type. It uses these \u2018tuning data' to learn two additional parameters that help adapt its predictions for other cellular contexts. SigMat outperforms other similarity scores and classification methods in identifying the correct label of a query expression profile from as many as 244 or 500 candidate classes (drug treatments) cataloged by the LINCS L1000 project.

            "abstract": "Motivation: Analysis of co-expressed gene sets typically involves testing for enrichment of different annotations or \u2018properties\u2019 such as biological processes, pathways, transcription factor binding sites, etc., one property at a time. This common approach ignores any known relationships among the properties or the genes themselves. It is believed that known biological relationships among genes and their many properties may be exploited to more accurately reveal commonalities of a gene set. Previous work has sought to achieve this by building biological networks that combine multiple types of gene\u2013gene or gene\u2013property relationships, and performing network analysis to identify other genes and properties most relevant to a given gene set. Most existing network-based approaches for recognizing genes or annotations relevant to a given gene set collapse information about different properties to simplify (homogenize) the networks. Results: We present a network-based method for ranking genes or properties related to a given gene set. Such related genes or properties are identified from among the nodes of a large, heterogeneous network of biological information. Our method involves a random walk with restarts, performed on an initial network with multiple node and edge types that preserve more of the original, specific property information than current methods that operate on homogeneous networks. In this first stage of our algorithm, we find the properties that are the most relevant to the given gene set and extract a subnetwork of the original network, comprising only these relevant properties. We then re-rank genes by their similarity to the given gene set, based on a second random walk with restarts, performed on the above subnetwork. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for ranking genes related to Drosophila embryonic development and aggressive responses in the brains of social animals.

            "abstract": "Genomic researchers commonly study complex phenotypes by identifying experimentally derived sets of functionally related genes with similar transcriptional profiles. These gene sets are then frequently subjected to statistical tests of association relating them to previously characterized gene sets from literature and public databases. However, few tools exist examining the non-coding, regulatory sequence of gene sets for evidence of a shared regulatory signature that may signal the involvement of important DNA-binding proteins called transcription factors (TFs). Here, we proposed and developed new computational methods for identifying major regulatory features of co-expressed gene sets that incorporate TF-DNA binding specificities (\" motifs \") with other important features such as sequence conservation and chromatin structure. We additionally demonstrated a novel approach for discovering regulatory signatures that are shared across gene sets from multiple experimental conditions or tissues. Given the co-expressed genes of a particular cell type, we also attempted to annotate their specific regulatory sequences (\" enhancers \") by constructing models of enhancer activity that incorporate the expression and binding specificities of the relevant transcription factors. We first developed and tested these models in well-characterized cell types, and then evaluated the extent to which these models were applicable using only minimal experimental evidence to poorly characterized systems without known transcriptional regulators and functional enhancers. Finally, we developed a network-based algorithm for examining novel gene sets that integrates many diverse types of biological evidences and relationships to better discover functionally related genes. This novel approach processed a comprehensive, heterogeneous network of biological knowledge and ranked genes and molecular properties represented in the network for their relevance to the given set of co-expressed genes. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS",

            "abstract": "The Motif Enrichment Tool (MET) provides an online interface that enables users to find major transcriptional regulators of their gene sets of interest. MET searches the appropriate regulatory region around each gene and identifies which transcription factor DNA-binding specificities (motifs) are statistically overrepresented. Motif enrichment analysis is currently available for many metazoan species including human, mouse, fruit fly, planaria and flowering plants. MET also leverages high-throughput experimental data such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq from ENCODE and ModENCODE to identify the regulatory targets of a transcription factor with greater precision. The results from MET are produced in real time and are linked to a genome browser for easy follow-up analysis. Use of the web tool is free and open to all, and there is no login requirement.

            "abstract": "Quantitative models of cis-regulatory activity have the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation. However, the few models available today have been based on simplistic assumptions about the sequences being modeled, or heuristic approximations of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We have developed a thermodynamics-based model to predict gene expression driven by any DNA sequence, as a function of transcription factor concentrations and their DNA-binding specificities. It uses statistical thermodynamics theory to model not only protein-DNA interaction, but also the effect of DNA-bound activators and repressors on gene expression. In addition, the model incorporates mechanistic features such as synergistic effect of multiple activators, short range repression, and cooperativity in transcription factor-DNA binding, allowing us to systematically evaluate the significance of these features in the context of available expression data. Using this model on segmentation-related enhancers in Drosophila, we find that transcriptional synergy due to simultaneous action of multiple activators helps explain the data beyond what can be explained by cooperative DNA-binding alone. We find clear support for the phenomenon of short-range repression, where repressors do not directly interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. We also find that the binding sites contributing to an enhancer's function may not be conserved during evolution, and a noticeable fraction of these undergo lineage-specific changes. Our implementation of the model, called GEMSTAT, is the first publicly available program for simultaneously modeling the regulatory activities of a given set of sequences.",
