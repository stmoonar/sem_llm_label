            "title": "HousE: Knowledge Graph Embedding with Householder Parameterization",
            "abstract": "The effectiveness of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) largely depends on the ability to model intrinsic relation patterns and mapping properties. However, existing approaches can only capture some of them with insufficient modeling capacity. In this work, we propose a more powerful KGE framework named HousE, which involves a novel parameterization based on two kinds of Householder transformations: (1) Householder rotations to achieve superior capacity of modeling relation patterns; (2) Householder projections to handle sophisticated relation mapping properties. Theoretically, HousE is capable of modeling crucial relation patterns and mapping properties simultaneously. Besides, HousE is a generalization of existing rotation-based models while extending the rotations to high-dimensional spaces. Empirically, HousE achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/anrep/HousE.",

            "abstract": "In this technical report, we present our solution of KDD Cup 2021 OGB Large-Scale Challenge - PCQM4M-LSC Track. We adopt Graphormer and ExpC as our basic models. We train each model by 8-fold cross-validation, and additionally train two Graphormer models on the union of training and validation sets with different random seeds. For final submission, we use a naive ensemble for these 18 models by taking average of their outputs. Using our method, our team MachineLearning achieved 0.1200 MAE on test set, which won the first place in KDD Cup graph prediction track.",

            "abstract": "Geo-tags from micro-blog posts have been shown to be useful in many data mining applications. This work seeks to find out if the location type derived from these geo-tags can benefit input methods, which attempts to predict the next word a user will input during typing. If a correlation between different location types and a change in word distribution can be found, the location type information can be used to make the input method more accurate. This work queried micro-blog posts from Twitter API and location type of these posts from Google Place API, forming a dataset of around 500k samples. A statistical study on the word distribution found weak support for the assumption. An LSTM based prediction experiment found a 2% edge in the accuracy from language models leveraging location type information when compared to a baseline without that information.",
