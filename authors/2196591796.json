            "title": "Understanding Modality Preferences in Search Clarification",
            "abstract": "This study is the first attempt to explore the impact of clarification question modality on user preference in search engines. We introduce the multi-modal search clarification dataset, MIMICS-MM, containing clarification questions with associated expert-collected and model-generated images. We analyse user preferences over different clarification modes of text, image, and combination of both through crowdsourcing by taking into account image and text quality, clarity, and relevance. Our findings demonstrate that users generally prefer multi-modal clarification over uni-modal approaches. We explore the use of automated image generation techniques and compare the quality, relevance, and user preference of model-generated images with human-collected ones. The study reveals that text-to-image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion, can effectively generate multi-modal clarification questions. By investigating multi-modal clarification, this research establishes a foundation for future advancements in search systems.",

            "title": "Nudging Towards Health in a Conversational Food Recommender System Using Multi-Modal Interactions and Nutrition Labels",
            "abstract": "Humans engage with other humans and their surroundings through various modalities, most notably speech, sight, and touch. In a conversation, all these inputs provide an overview of how another person is feeling. When translating these modalities to a digital context, most of them are unfortunately lost. The majority of existing conversational recommender systems (CRSs) rely solely on natural language or basic click-based interactions. This work is one of the first studies to examine the influence of multi-modal interactions in a conversational food recommender system. In particular, we examined the effect of three distinct interaction modalities: pure textual, multi-modal (text plus visuals), and multi-modal supplemented with nutritional labeling. We conducted a user study ( \ud835\udc41 =195) to evaluate the three interaction modalities in terms of how effectively they supported users in selecting healthier foods. Structural equation modelling revealed that users engaged more extensively with the multi-modal system that was annotated with labels, compared to the system with a single modality, and in turn evaluated it as more effective.",
