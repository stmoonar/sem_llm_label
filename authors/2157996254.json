            "title": "Leveraging Watch-time Feedback for Short-Video Recommendations: A Causal Labeling Framework",
            "abstract": "With the proliferation of short video applications, the significance of short video recommendations has vastly increased. Unlike other recommendation scenarios, short video recommendation systems heavily rely on feedback from watch time. Existing approaches simply treat watch time as a direct label, failing to effectively harness its extensive semantics and introduce bias, thereby limiting the potential for modeling user interests based on watch time. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework named Debiased Multiple-semantics-extracting Labeling (DML). DML constructs labels that encompass various semantics by utilizing quantiles derived from the distribution of watch time, prioritizing relative order rather than absolute label values. This approach facilitates easier model learning while aligning with the ranking objective of recommendations. Furthermore, we introduce a method inspired by causal adjustment to refine label definitions, thereby directly mitigating bias at the label level. We substantiate the effectiveness of our DML framework through both online and offline experiments. Extensive results demonstrate that our DML could effectively leverage watch time to discover users' real interests, enhancing their engagement in our application.",

            "title": "Understanding and Modeling Passive-Negative Feedback for Short-video Sequential Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc. However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences. Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users\u2019 interests and serve as an important supervision signal in extracting users\u2019 preferences. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation scenario. In this work, we first conduct analyses based on a large-scale real-world short-video behavior dataset and illustrate the significance of leveraging passive feedback. We then propose a novel method that deploys the sub-interest encoder, which incorporates positive feedback and passive-negative feedback as supervision signals to learn the user\u2019s current active sub-interest. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive fusion layer to integrate various sub-interests effectively. To enhance the robustness of our model, we then introduce a multi-task learning module to simultaneously optimize two kinds of feedback \u2013 passive-negative feedback and traditional randomly-sampled negative feedback. The experiments on two large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

            "abstract": "Modern recommender systems often deal with a variety of user interactions, e.g., click, forward, purchase, etc., which requires the underlying recommender engines to fully understand and leverage multi-behavior data from users. Despite recent efforts towards making use of heterogeneous data, multi-behavior recommendation still faces great challenges. Firstly, sparse target signals and noisy auxiliary interactions remain an issue. Secondly, existing methods utilizing self-supervised learning (SSL) to tackle the data sparsity neglect the serious optimization imbalance between the SSL task and the target task. Hence, we propose a Multi-Behavior Self-Supervised Learning (MBSSL) framework together with an adaptive optimization method. Specifically, we devise a behavior-aware graph neural network incorporating the self-attention mechanism to capture behavior multiplicity and dependencies. To increase the robustness to data sparsity under the target behavior and noisy interactions from auxiliary behaviors, we propose a novel self-supervised learning paradigm to conduct node self-discrimination at both inter-behavior and intra-behavior levels. In addition, we develop a customized optimization strategy through hybrid manipulation on gradients to adaptively balance the self-supervised learning task and the main supervised recommendation task. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the consistent improvements obtained by MBSSL over ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

            "abstract": "Recommender systems are currently widely used in various applications helping people filter information. Existing models always embed the rich information for recommendation, such as items, users, and contexts in real-value vectors, and make predictions based on these vectors. In the view of causal inference, the associations between representation vectors and user feedback are inevitably a mixture of the causal part that describes why a user prefers an item, and the non-causal part that merely reflects the statistical dependencies, for example, the display ranking position and sales promotion. However, most recommender systems assume the user-item interactions are only affected by user preferences, neglecting the striking differences between these two associations. To address this problem, we propose a model-agnostic causal learning framework called IV4Rec+ that can effectively decompose the embedding vectors into these two parts. Moreover, two strategies are proposed to utilize search queries as instrumental variables: IV4Rec+(I) only decomposes the item embeddings, while IV4Rec+(UI) decomposes both user and item embeddings. IV4Rec+ is a model-agnostic design that can be applied to many existing recommender systems, e.g., DIN, NRHUB, and SRGNN. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that IV4Rec+ significantly facilitates the performance of recommender systems and outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks.",

            "abstract": "Accurate user interest modeling is vital for recommendation scenarios. One of the effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click behaviors, but this is not elegant in the video feed recommendation where users are passive in receiving the streaming contents and return skip or no-skip behaviors. Here skip and no-skip behaviors can be treated as negative and positive feedback, respectively. With the mixture of positive and negative feedback, it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of behavioral sequence. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer, which may be inelegant because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not consider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest Factorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR) consisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer and prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose each head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations. Then we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific head interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the relation between different types of feedback. Additionally, we propose a dual-interest disentangling layer to decouple positive and negative interests before performing disentanglement on their representations. Finally, we evolve the positive and negative interests by corresponding towers whose outputs are contrastive by BPR loss. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation study and visualization also sustain its effectiveness.

The core of multi-task and multi-domain recommendation is to accurately capture user interests in multiple scenarios given multiple user behaviors. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Parameter and Embedding Personalized Network (PEPNet) for multi-domain and multi-task recommendation. PEPNet takes personalized prior information as input and dynamically scales the bottom-level Embedding and top-level DNN hidden units through gate mechanisms. Embedding Personalized Network (EPNet) performs personalized selection on Embedding to fuse features with different importance for different users in multiple domains. Parameter Personalized Network (PPNet) executes personalized modification on DNN parameters to balance targets with different sparsity for different users in multiple tasks. We have made a series of special engineering optimizations combining the Kuaishou training framework and the online deployment environment. By infusing personalized selection of Embedding and personalized modification of DNN parameters, PEPNet tailored to the interests of each individual obtains significant performance gains, with online improvements exceeding 1% in multiple task metrics across multiple domains. We have deployed PEPNet in Kuaishou apps, serving over 300 million users every day.",

            "abstract": "Life-long user behavior modeling, i.e., extracting a user's hidden interests from rich historical behaviors in months or even years, plays a central role in modern CTR prediction systems. Conventional algorithms mostly follow two cascading stages: a simple General Search Unit (GSU) for fast and coarse search over tens of thousands of long-term behaviors and an Exact Search Unit (ESU) for effective Target Attention (TA) over the small number of finalists from GSU. Although efficient, existing algorithms mostly suffer from a crucial limitation: the inconsistent target-behavior relevance metrics between GSU and ESU. As a result, their GSU usually misses highly relevant behaviors but retrieves ones considered irrelevant by ESU. In such case, the TA in ESU, no matter how attention is allocated, mostly deviates from the real user interests and thus degrades the overall CTR prediction accuracy. To address such inconsistency, we propose TWo-stage Interest Network (TWIN), where our Consistency-Preserved GSU (CP-GSU) adopts the identical target-behavior relevance metric as the TA in ESU, making the two stages twins. Specifically, to break TA's computational bottleneck and extend it from ESU to GSU, or namely from behavior length 102 to length 104 - 105, we build a novel attention mechanism by behavior feature splitting. For the video inherent features of a behavior, we calculate their linear projection by efficient pre-computing & caching strategies. And for the user-item cross features, we compress each into a one-dimentional bias term in the attention score calculation to save the computational cost. The consistency between two stages, together with the effective TA-based relevance metric in CP-GSU, contributes to significant performance gain in CTR prediction. Offline experiments on a 46 billion scale real production dataset from Kuaishou and an Online A/B test show that TWIN outperforms all compared SOTA algorithms. With optimized online infrastructure, we reduce the computational bottleneck by 99.3%, which contributes to the successful deployment of TWIN on Kuaishou, serving the main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users everyday.",

            "title": "When Search Meets Recommendation: Learning Disentangled Search Representation for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Modern online service providers such as online shopping platforms often provide both search and recommendation (S&R) services to meet different user needs. Rarely has there been any effective means of incorporating user behavior data from both S&R services. Most existing approaches either simply treat S&R behaviors separately, or jointly optimize them by aggregating data from both services, ignoring the fact that user intents in S&R can be distinctively different. In our paper, we propose a Search-Enhanced framework for the Sequential Recommendation (SESRec) that leverages users' search interests for recommendation, by disentangling similar and dissimilar representations within S&R behaviors. Specifically, SESRec first aligns query and item embeddings based on users' query-item interactions for the computations of their similarities. Two transformer encoders are used to learn the contextual representations of S&R behaviors independently. Then a contrastive learning task is designed to supervise the disentanglement of similar and dissimilar representations from behavior sequences of S&R. Finally, we extract user interests by the attention mechanism from three perspectives, i.e., the contextual representations, the two separated behaviors containing similar and dissimilar interests. Extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate that SESRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models. Empirical studies further validate that SESRec successfully disentangle similar and dissimilar user interests from their S&R behaviors.",

            "abstract": "The confluence of Search and Recommendation (S&R) services is vital to online services, including e-commerce and video platforms. The integration of S&R modeling is a highly intuitive approach adopted by industry practitioners. However, there is a noticeable lack of research conducted in this area within academia, primarily due to the absence of publicly available datasets. Consequently, a substantial gap has emerged between academia and industry regarding research endeavors in joint optimization using user behavior data from both S&R services. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first large-scale, real-world dataset KuaiSAR of integrated Search And Recommendation behaviors collected from Kuaishou, a leading short-video app in China with over 350 million daily active users. Previous research in this field has predominantly employed publicly available semi-synthetic datasets, with artificially fabricated search behaviors. Distinct from previous datasets, KuaiSAR contains genuine user behaviors, including the occurrence of each interaction within either search or recommendation service, and the users' transitions between the two services. This work aids in joint modeling of S&R, and utilizing search data for recommender systems (and recommendation data for search engines). Furthermore, due to the various feedback labels associated with user-video interactions, KuaiSAR also supports a broad range of tasks, including intent recommendation, multi-task learning, and modeling of long sequential multi-behavioral patterns. We believe this dataset will serve as a catalyst for innovative research and bridge the gap between academia and industry in understanding the S&R services in practical, real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://ethan00si.github.io/KuaiSAR/. The dataset is also shared at https://zenodo.org/record/8181109.",

            "abstract": "Short-video recommendation is one of the most important recommendation applications in today's industrial information systems. Compared with other recommendation tasks, the enormous amount of feedback is the most typical characteristic. Specifically, in short-video recommendation, the easiest-to-collect user feedback is theskipping behavior, which leads to two critical challenges for the recommendation model. First, the skipping behavior reflects implicit user preferences, and thus, it is challenging for interest extraction. Second, this kind of special feedback involves multiple objectives, such as total watching time and skipping rate, which is also very challenging. In this paper, we present our industrial solution in Kuaishou1, which serves billion-level users every day. Specifically, we deploy a feedback-aware encoding module that extracts user preferences, taking the impact of context into consideration. We further design a multi-objective prediction module which well distinguishes the relation and differences among different model objectives in the short-video recommendation. We conduct extensive online A/B tests, along with detailed and careful analysis, which verify the effectiveness of our solution.",
