            "abstract": "Understanding the identities, needs, realities and development of subcultures has been a long term target of sociology and cultural studies. Socio-cultural linguistics, in particular, examines the use of language and, in particular, the existence and use of neologisms, slang and jargon. These terms capture concepts and expressions that are not in common use and represent the new realities, norms and values of subcommunities. Identifying and understanding such terms, however, is a very complex task, particularly considering the vast amount of content that is currently available online for many such groups. In this paper, we propose a combination of computational and socio-linguistic methods to automatically extract new terminology from large amounts of data, using word-embeddings to semantically contextualise their meaning. As a use case, we explore subculture on the platform Reddit. More specifically, we investigate groups considered part of the manosphere, a loose online community where men\u2019s perspectives, gripes, frustrations and desires are explicitly expressed and where women are typically targets of hostility. Characterisations of this group as a subculture are then provided, based on an in-depth analysis of the identified jargon.",

            "abstract": "In the world of public misinformation, there are many cases where the information is not false or fabricated, but rather has been manipulated using more subtle techniques such as word replacements, selection of details, omissions and argument distortion. These techniques can have the effect of influencing the reader\u2019s frame of mind towards the events reported. We currently lack the necessary tools to uncover such manipulations automatically. In this position paper, we propose an integrated analysis framework and pipeline to identify various narrative signals in news articles; such as structural roles, framing, and subjectivity. By comparing these at the document level and sentence level, it will be possible to highlight differences of narrative techniques used to report the same news events.",

            "abstract": "With misinformation being one of the biggest issues of current times, many organisations are emerging to offer verifications of information and assessments of news sources. However, it remains unclear how they relate in terms of coverage, overlap and agreement. In this paper we introduce a comparison of the assessments produced by different organisations, in order to measure their overlap and agreement on news sources. Relying on the general term of credibility, we map each of the different assessments to a unified scale. Then we compare two different levels of credibility assessments (source level and document level) by using the data published by various organisations, including fact-checkers, to see which sources they assess more than others, how much overlap there is between them, and how much agreement there is between their verdicts. Our results show that the overlap between the different origins is generally quite low, meaning that different experts and tools provide evaluations for a rather disjoint set of sources, also when considering fact-checking. For agreement, instead we find that there are origins that agree more than others on the verdicts.",

            "abstract": "Social media platforms are often implicated in the spread of misinformation for encouraging the behaviour of rapid-sharing without adequate mechanisms for verifying information. To counter this phenomena, much related research in computer science has been focusing on developing tools to detect misinformation, to rank fact-check-worthy claims, and to understand their spread patterns, while psychosocial approaches have been focused on understanding information literacy, ideology and partisanship. In this paper, we demonstrate through a survey of nearly 100 people that the Human Values could have a significant influence on the way people perceive and share information. We argue that integrating a valuesoriented perspective into computational approaches for handling misinformation could encourage misinformation prevention, and assist in predicting and ranking misinformation.",

            "abstract": "Arabizi is an informal written form of dialectal Arabic transcribed in Latin alphanumeric characters. It has a proven popularity on chat platforms and social media, yet it suffers from a severe lack of natural language processing (NLP) resources. As such, texts written in Arabizi are often disregarded in sentiment analysis tasks for Arabic. In this paper we describe the creation of a sentiment lexicon for Arabizi that was enriched with word embeddings. The result is a new Arabizi lexicon consisting of 11.3K positive and 13.3K negative words. We evaluated this lexicon by classifying the sentiment of Arabizi tweets achieving an F1-score of 0.72. We provide a detailed error analysis to present the challenges that impact the sentiment analysis of Arabizi.",

            "abstract": "Social media plays a vital role in information sharing during disasters. Unfortunately, the overwhelming volume and variety of data generated on social media make it challenging to sieve through such content manually and determine its relevancy. Most automated approaches to classify crisis data for relevancy are based on classic statistical features. However, such approaches do not adapt well to situations when applied on a new crisis event, or to a new language that the model was not trained on. In crisis situations, training a new model for particular crises or languages is not a viable approach. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid semantic-statistical approach for classifying data with regards to relevancy to a given crisis. We demonstrate how this approach outperforms the baselines in scenarios where the model is trained on one type of crisis and language and tested on new crisis types and additional languages.",

            "abstract": "The 'manosphere' has been a recent subject of feminist scholarship on the web. Serious accusations have been levied against it for its role in encouraging misogyny and violent threats towards women online, as well as for potentially radicalising lonely or disenfranchised men. Feminist scholars evidence this through a shift in the language and interests of some men's rights activists on the manosphere, away from traditional subjects of family law or mental health and towards more sexually explicit, violent, racist and homophobic language. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by investigating the flow of extreme language across seven online communities on Reddit, with openly misogynistic members (e.g., Men Going Their Own Way, Involuntarily Celibates), and investigate if and how misogynistic ideas spread within and across these communities. Grounded on feminist critiques of language, we created nine lexicons capturing specific misogynistic rhetoric (Physical Violence, Sexual Violence, Hostility, Patriarchy, Stoicism, Racism, Homophobia, Belittling, and Flipped Narrative) and used these lexicons to explore how language evolves within and across misogynistic groups. This analysis was conducted on 6 million posts, from 300K conversations created between 2011 and December 2018. Our results shows increasing patterns on misogynistic content and users as well as violent attitudes, corroborating existing theories of feminist studies that the amount of misogyny, hostility and violence is steadily increasing in the manosphere.",

On public data from the ePB platforms of three major US cities - Cambridge, Miami and New York City-, we evaluate various methods that exploit heterogeneous sources and models of user preferences to provide personalized recommendations of citizen proposals. We show that depending on characteristics of the cities and their participatory processes, particular methods are more effective than others for each city. This result, together with open issues identified in the paper, call for further research in the area.",
