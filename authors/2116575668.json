            "abstract": "In the process of power grid monitoring, image data are mostly transmitted in segments by wireless image sensor networks (WISNs), and the external attacks or interference on a communication link easily causes the data to be retransmitted. Therefore, high quality of service (QoS) routing is essential to the secure and robust operation of the WISNs. Specifically, the QoS routing optimization in WISN is a nondeterministic polynomial hard problem, which usually cannot be solved by ordinary algorithms. Based on this motivation, a novel heuristic trust scheme (i.e., multi-objective trust routing scheme based on cloned elite slime mould algorithm (CESMA-MTRS)) is proposed to greatly improve the security and QoS of WISN. The scheme designs a novel trust difference test mechanism to enhance the identification of malicious nodes. Furthermore, a new elite archiving strategy and clone optimization strategy are designed to improve the convergence speed of grid monitoring data transmission routing search. The simulation results show that when the network scale is 100 and the attacked node scale is 30%, CESMA-MTRS reduces the delay by 8% and 15% and the packet loss rate by 24% and 27%, respectively, compared with trust-based routing protocol called the On-demand trust-based multicast routing protocol (ODTMRP) and evolutionary selfcooperative trust approach.",

            "abstract": "Compared with conventional wireless sensor networks (WSNs), industrial WSNs (IWSNs) have stricter requirements in real-time data transmission, energy consumption, and energy uniformity. To fulfill these requirements, a new energy-efficient clustering approach using quantum-related bioinspired optimization, i.e., quantum elite gray wolf optimization (QEGWO), is proposed to improve the performance of IWSNs. Innovatively, a new quantum operator, including quantum probability amplitude, quantum rotation gate, and quantum NOT gate, is designed in QEGWO to enhance its global search capability. This quantum operator need not query the quantum rotation angle table in updating quantum probability amplitude with the quantum rotation gate, which reduces the computational complexity of introducing quantum optimization into the clustering problem of IWSNs. Moreover, to enhance the convergence performance of the clustering algorithm, a multielite strategy is proposed to preserve the historical optimal individuals generated in the iterative process by establishing a dynamic elite pool. Compared with the state-of-the-art clustering approaches, extensive simulations in four different scenarios are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the proposed QEGWO outperforms other comparison approaches in delay, energy consumption, and energy uniformity.",

            "abstract": "An improved practical Byzantine fault tolerance (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm based on reputation, RPBFT) algorithm based on grouping and reputation value voting is proposed for the problems of high communication complexity, poor scalability, and random selection of master nodes of the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm of the consortium chain. First, the consistency process is optimized to take the response speed of nodes to each group leader as the basis of grouping, and the intragroup consensus is performed. The group leader then takes the result of intragroup consensus and participates in extra-group consensus to reduce the frequency and time of internode communication. Second, the reputation model and voting mechanism are proposed, and the group leader is generated by node reputation value voting, which enhances the initiative and reliability of trusted nodes and reduces the abnormal nodes as group leader. Finally, a simulation and performance testing system based on this improved scheme is built to prove the effectiveness as well as the usability of the scheme through simulation experiments. The experimental results show that when the number of network nodes is 36, the throughput of the RPBFT algorithm is six times that of PBFT. Therefore, the consensus delay is reduced by 91.7%, and the communication overhead is reduced by 37.8%.",

            "abstract": "With the widespread application of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the requirements for sensing equipment to collect data and information continue to increase, and industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) with industrial information perception capabilities have emerged as the times require. The data stream transmission of important value information requires the network to provide safe and reliable service quality assurance. Therefore, it is imperative to meet the requirements of end-to-end delay and reliable service between nodes and solve the problems of high energy consumption and poor security of the existing Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing protocols. To this end, considering the QoS constraints of end-to-end delay, security, and energy consumption, a multiobjective secure routing model based on trust awareness is designed. Subsequently, using the advantages of the proposed model, a novel QoS-secure routing algorithm based on multiobjective chaotic elite adaptive ant colony optimization (ACO) (i.e., MCEAACO-QSRP) is proposed. Specifically, a chaotic optimization strategy is designed to initialize the population, which increases the diversity of the population and enhances the ability of the algorithm to jump out of the local optimal. In addition, the adaptive optimization strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the algorithm trend, which effectively improves the algorithm convergence speed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in different scale scenarios. The simulation results show that compared with other state-of-the-art QoS routing solutions, the proposed MCEAACO-QSRP has obvious advantages, which can effectively improve routing security, reduce network energy consumption, and satisfy multi-QoS constrains for the end-to-end delay and reliable service.",

            "abstract": "Since the low cost and high flexibility, wireless automatic meter reading network (WAMRN) is widely used by utility companies to realize automatic collection and transmission of remote energy consumption information. Considering that WAMRN is composed of several wireless communication nodes, the lifetime of the network will be affected by factors such as the changeable deployment environment and the limited energy of nodes. Thus, a novel niche quantum ant colony-based WAMRN clustering optimization method is proposed in this paper to address the problem of how to make full use of the limited energy to extend network lifetime and improve data transmission efficiency. In the proposed approach, a clustering model of WAMRN is defined; moreover, an improved Niche Quantum Ant Colony Optimization (NQACO) is proposed to optimize the model therefore to obtain an optimal clustering scheme, which can help WAMRN reduce unnecessary energy loss to achieve the purpose of extending the lifetime of the entire network. To verify the performance of the proposed method, NQACO is compared with some popular clustering methods, i.e., GA and SA, under different scenarios. The results show that under the premise of ensuring network communication, NQACO is superior to the other two methods in reducing the total energy consumption and prolonging the network lifetime.",

            "title": "A Novel QoS Routing Energy Consumption Optimization Method Based on Clone Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm in IWSNs",
            "abstract": "Routing requests in industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are always restricted by QoS. Therefore, finding a high-quality routing path is a key problem. In this paper, a clone adaptive whale optimization algorithm (CAWOA) is designed for reducing the routing energy consumption of IWSNs with QoS constraints, and a novel clone operator is proposed. More importantly, CAWOA innovatively adopts a discrete binary-based routing coding method, which provides strong support for optimal routing schemes. In addition, a novel routing model of IWSNs combined with QoS constraints has been designed, which involves comprehensive consideration of bandwidth, delay, delay jitter, and packet loss rate. Subsequently, in a series of simulations, the proposed algorithm is compared with other heuristic-based routing algorithms, namely, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation results suggest that the CAWOA-based routing algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of routing energy consumption, convergence speed, and optimization ability. Compared with GA, SA, PSO, and WOA under the conditions that the number of nodes is 120, the maximum delay is 120\u2009ms, the maximum delay jitter is 25\u2009ms, the maximum bandwidth is 9\u2009Mbps, and the packet loss rate is 0.02; the energy consumption of CAWOA-based routing is reduced by 12%, 17%, 19%, and 7%, respectively.",
