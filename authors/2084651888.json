            "abstract": "Our project has a very simple aim which is to solve our daily problems which include transferring photos and different media from our phone storage to external storage. which is why we chose to work on - \"transferring phone gallary data to the cloud to reduce load on device's memory\". They are nice portable devices used for communicating but with advancement in phone technology things have taken a turn since we first used a Nokia back in 2001. People communicate and share content with each other via phones .now where does this content go ? right, in our phone's memory but what happens when you run out of space ? right, you use an external memory facility but what's next when the card is full and you don't have the luxury of a laptop around you and you just can't delete all the data you have in the name of memories . I am so glad to tell you that we have a solution .you don't need to worry about the space that is taken by your media. We intend to link this data sends to the cloud .",

            "title": "OCR for devanagari numerals using zonal histogram of angle",
            "abstract": "Abstract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system is used to generate the textual representation of handwritten or printed text. Many research works are going on in the field of OCR over the past few decades for most of the Indian scripts. Devanagari one of the most spoken languages in the world as well as India. Lack of a robust OCR system for Devanagari script is still there even after so much research. The aim of this paper is to make an OCR that could classify handwritten Devanagari numerals. This paper proposes an OCR based on Histogram of the angle made by a dark pixel with the zonal center of mass. This feature bags the angle made by each dark pixel in a zone about its center of mass. This newly extracted feature was used to train various classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Linear SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes. We reported an efficiency of each algorithm based on the new feature. Our experiment result shows that the Random Forest Model outperforms over the other algorithms and reports an efficiency of 92.57%.",

            "abstract": "paper presents the preliminary work done towards the development of a Gender Recognition System that can be incorporated into the Hindi Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System. Gender Recognition (GR) can help in the development of speaker-independent speech recognition systems. This paper presents a general approach to identifying feature vectors that effectively distinguish gender of a speaker from Hindi phoneme utterances. 10 vowels and 5 nasals of the Hindi language were studied for their effectiveness in identifying gender of the speaker. All the 10 vowel Phonemes performed well, while b) bZ) A) ,) ,s) vks and vkS showed excellent gender distinction performance. All five nasals \u00b3) \u00b4) .k) u and e which were tested, showed a recognition accuracy of almost 100%. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are widely used in ASR. The choice of MFCC as features in Gender Recognition will avoid additional computation. The effect of the MFCC feature vector dimension on the GR accuracy was studied and the findings presented.",
