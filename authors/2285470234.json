            "title": "STEMO: Early Spatio-temporal Forecasting with Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning",
            "abstract": "Accuracy and timeliness are indeed often conflicting goals in prediction tasks. Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.",

            "abstract": "Matching in two-sided markets such as ride-hailing has recently received significant attention. However, existing studies on ride-hailing mainly focus on optimising efficiency, and fairness issues in ride-hailing have been neglected. Fairness issues in ride-hailing, including significant earning differences between drivers and variance of passenger waiting times among different locations, have potential impacts on economic and ethical aspects. The recent studies that focus on fairness in ride-hailing exploit traditional optimisation methods and the Markov Decision Process to balance efficiency and fairness. However, there are several issues in these existing studies, such as myopic short-term decision-making from traditional optimisation and instability of fairness in a comparably longer horizon from both traditional optimisation and Markov Decision Process-based methods. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic Markov Decision Process model to alleviate fairness issues currently faced by ride-hailing, and seek a balance between efficiency and fairness, with two distinct characteristics: (i) a prediction module to predict the number of requests that will be raised in the future from different locations to allow the proposed method to consider long-term fairness based on the whole timeline instead of consider fairness only based on historical and current data patterns; (ii) a customised scalarisation function for multi-objective multi-agent Q Learning that aims to balance efficiency and fairness. Extensive experiments on a publicly available real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Instruments such as eye-tracking devices have contributed to understanding how users interact with screen-based search engines. However, user-system interactions in audio-only channels -- as is the case for Spoken Conversational Search (SCS) -- are harder to characterize, given the lack of instruments to effectively and precisely capture interactions. Furthermore, in this era of information overload, cognitive bias can significantly impact how we seek and consume information -- especially in the context of controversial topics or multiple viewpoints. This paper draws upon insights from multiple disciplines (including information seeking, psychology, cognitive science, and wearable sensors) to provoke novel conversations in the community. To this end, we discuss future opportunities and propose a framework including multimodal instruments and methods for experimental designs and settings. We demonstrate preliminary results as an example. We also outline the challenges and offer suggestions for adopting this multimodal approach, including ethical considerations, to assist future researchers and practitioners in exploring cognitive biases in SCS.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), is an extension of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a fundamental problem in logistics and transportation. Typically, DVRPs involve two stakeholders: service providers that deliver services to customers and customers who raise requests from different locations. Many real-world applications can be formulated as DVRP such as ridesharing and non-compliance capture. Apart from original objectives like optimising total utility or efficiency, DVRP should also consider fairness for all parties. Unfairness can induce service providers and customers to give up on the systems, leading to negative financial and social impacts. However, most existing DVRP-related applications focus on improving fairness from a single side, and there have been few works considering two-sided fairness and utility optimisation concurrently. To this end, we propose a novel framework, a Two-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (named 2FairGA), which expands the genetic algorithm from the original objective solely focusing on utility to multi-objectives that incorporate two-sided fairness. Subsequently, the impact of injecting two fairness definitions into the utility-focused model and the correlation between any pair of the three objectives are explored. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art.",

Recent advancements have sparked a growing interest in integrating spatiotemporal analysis with large-scale language models. However, spatiotemporal data often contains sensitive information, making it unsuitable for open third-party access. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph-GAN-based model for generating privacy-protected spatiotemporal data. Our approach incorporates spatial and temporal attention blocks in the discriminator and a spatiotemporal deconvolution structure in the generator. These enhancements enable efficient training under Gaussian noise to achieve differential privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets validate the efficacy of our model. Our method provides a privacy guarantee while maintaining the data utility. The prediction model trained on our generated data maintains a competitive performance compared to the model trained on the original data.",

            "abstract": "Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation considers spatio-temporal factors like distance, peak hours, and user check-ins. Given their influence on both consumer experience and POI business, it's crucial to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems often provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users and less exposure to unpopular POIs. This paper develops a post-filter method that includes provider and consumer fairness in existing models, aiming to balance fairness metrics like item exposure with performance metrics such as precision and distance. Experiments show that a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring items offers the best balance between performance and long-tail exposure, sometimes without much precision loss. Addressing consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users increased precision in some models and datasets. However, combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness resulted in the lowest precision values, highlighting that tradeoffs depend greatly on the model and dataset.",

Their adaptability to multiple mobility infrastructures introduces advantages for users, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of urban transit. However, this versatility also causes potential challenges, including increased interactions and conflicts with other road users. Previous research has primarily focused on historical trip data, leaving a gap in our understanding of real-time e-scooter user behaviours and interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel multi-modal data collection and integrated data analysis methodology, aimed at capturing the dynamic behaviours of e-scooter riders and their interactions with other road users in real-world settings.
