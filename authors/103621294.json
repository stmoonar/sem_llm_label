            "title": "Development of Simulation Models Supporting Next-Generation Airborne Weather Radar for High Ice Water Content Monitoring",
            "abstract": "In this article, a method of extending airborne weather radar modeling to incorporate high-ice-water-content (HIWC) conditions has been developed. A novel aspect is incorporating flight test measurement data, including forward-looking radar measurements and in situ microphysics probes data, into the model and part of the evaluations of modeling. The simulation models assume a dual-polarized, airborne forward-looking radar, while for single-polarized operations, the index-of-dispersion is included as a helpful indicator for HIWC detection. The radar system simulation models are useful for design evaluations for the next generation of airborne aviation hazard monitoring and incorporate HIWC hazard detection algorithms. Example applications of the simulator, such as hazard detection based on the simulated HIWC flight encounter scenarios based on specific numeric weather prediction (NWP) model outputs, are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Using ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radar for detecting and tracking fast-moving small targets over the ocean surface has been considered before with limited applications. The challenges of deploying such radar sensors on small, unmanned marine platforms are addressed in this study. The first challenge is the stringent size and weight requirement to allow a tracking radar sensor to be fitted into the payload of a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV). For the first time, we implemented a design that is based on a single chip UWB radar sensor operating at X-band, which effectively achieves the size and weight requirement for a small USV payload. The second challenge is range extension and range ambiguity resolution. With the UWB radar operating various high-PRF modes, we developed a novel approach that stitches together range profiles from multiple PRFs, to extend the effective non-ambiguous range at the cost of scan speed. The third challenge is developing a lowcost, ultra-wideband planar antenna and front-end, which is also part of the USV payload and needs to be able to perform either sector scanning, or even electronic scanning, with a very low profile. We have successfully designed and implemented one such antenna using a dipole array design. By integrating the solutions into a complete system, we have performed a series of lab and outdoor tests of the UWB radar sensor and obtained some promising target data. Simulations are also being developed for testing the potential target signatures and tracking effectiveness of moving targets over ocean surface clutter environments.",

            "title": "Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) for spatial-temporal resolution enhancement in low-cost frequency modulation radar",
            "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles have always been a field of considerable research interest. Past research have demonstrated achievements assuring that self-driving cars are, in fact the future of mobility. Self-driving cars have been made possible by sensor fusion technique, which incorporates sensors, including camera and radar. Cameras have the best resolution. Nevertheless, their ability to sense may be affected in extreme weather or night conditions. Radars are not affected by these conditions but lack the resolution when compared with radar. Most of the automotive radars are Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars whose range resolution depends on the bandwidth of the FMCW chirp, and spatial resolution depends upon the number of the receiving antennas. Having a higher number of receiving antenna elements will improve the angular resolution. Instead of increasing physical receiving antennas, it is possible to generate virtual receiving antennas by adding transmitting antennas, commonly known as the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technique. MIMO requires orthogonal signals in multiple transmitting antennas. Commercial automotive radars have implemented the capability of MIMO using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Binary Phase Modulation (BPM) in 2Tx and 4Rx systems. Although the angular resolution is improved, the maximum unambiguous velocity is reduced by half. This paper proposes the Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) Technique to achieve orthogonality. A full radar system has been simulated in MATLAB environment, which shows the possibility of using FDM in automotive radars without compromising the maximum unambiguous velocity. Frequency modulated signal with different starting frequencies for two Tx antenna is used to create 8 Rx virtual channels. FDM usually requires an increment in sampling frequency of Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). In this paper, the two starting frequencies are chosen, such that the requirement of higher sampling rate has been eliminated.",

            "abstract": "Turbulence has been one of the major concerns for aviation safety. This paper applies evolutionary machine learning (ML) technology to turbulence level classification for civil aviation. An artificial neural network ML approach based on radar observation is developed for classifying the cubed root of the Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR)1/3, an accepted measure of turbulence intensity. The approach is validated using Typhoon weather data collected by Hong Kong Observatory\u2019s Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) located near Hong Kong International Airport and comparing TDWR EDR1/3 detections and predictions with in situ EDR1/3 measured by commercial aircraft. The testing results verified that the ML approach performs reasonably well for both detecting and predicting tasks.",
