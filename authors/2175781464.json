            "title": "Improving Gradient Computation for Differentiable Physics Simulation with Contacts",
            "abstract": "Differentiable simulation enables gradients to be back-propagated through physics simulations. In this way, one can learn the dynamics and properties of a physics system by gradient-based optimization or embed the whole differentiable simulation as a layer in a deep learning model for downstream tasks, such as planning and control. However, differentiable simulation at its current stage is not perfect and might provide wrong gradients that deteriorate its performance in learning tasks. In this paper, we study differentiable rigid-body simulation with contacts. We find that existing differentiable simulation methods provide inaccurate gradients when the contact normal direction is not fixed - a general situation when the contacts are between two moving objects. We propose to improve gradient computation by continuous collision detection and leverage the time-of-impact (TOI) to calculate the post-collision velocities. We demonstrate our proposed method, referred to as TOI-Velocity, on two optimal control problems. We show that with TOI-Velocity, we are able to learn an optimal control sequence that matches the analytical solution, while without TOI-Velocity, existing differentiable simulation methods fail to do so.",

            "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a framework to build surrogate models for dynamical systems governed by differential equations. During the learning process, PINNs incorporate a physics-based regularization term within the loss function to enhance generalization performance. Since simulating dynamics controlled by partial differential equations (PDEs) can be computationally expensive, PINNs have gained popularity in learning parametric surrogates for fluid flow problems governed by Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we introduce RANS-PINN, a modified PINN framework, to predict flow fields (i.e., velocity and pressure) in high Reynolds number turbulent flow regimes. To account for the additional complexity introduced by turbulence, RANS-PINN employs a 2-equation eddy viscosity model based on a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation. Furthermore, we adopt a novel training approach that ensures effective initialization and balance among the various components of the loss function. The effectiveness of the RANS-PINN framework is then demonstrated using a parametric PINN.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, an increasing amount of work has focused on differentiable physics simulation and has produced a set of open source projects such as Tiny Differentiable Simulator, Nimble Physics, diffTaichi, Brax, Warp, Dojo and DiffCoSim. By making physics simulations end-to-end differentiable, we can perform gradient-based optimization and learning tasks. A majority of differentiable simulators consider collisions and contacts between objects, but they use different contact models for differentiability. In this paper, we overview four kinds of differentiable contact formulations - linear complementarity problems (LCP), convex optimization models, compliant models and position-based dynamics (PBD). We analyze and compare the gradients calculated by these models and show that the gradients are not always correct. We also demonstrate their ability to learn an optimal control strategy by comparing the learned strategies with the optimal strategy in an analytical form. The codebase to reproduce the experiment results is available at https://github.com/DesmondZhong/diff_sim_grads.",

In this work we propose the use of a knowledge graph based semantic data exchange layer, the Metaverse Knowledge Graph, to enable seamless transfer of information across platforms.

            "abstract": "The term metaverse was coined by author Neal Stephenson in 1992 in his science fiction novel \u201cSnow Crash.\u201d1 Metaverse is a conjunction of the Greek prefix \u201cmeta,\u201d which means beyond, and the stem \u201cverse,\u201d which implies universe, hence the meaning \u201cbeyond the universe.\u201d It is a futuristic, hyperrealistic virtual world where humans will spend time performing their day-to-day activities, such as entertaining, socializing, playing, working, and shopping. This requires that a metaverse offers a real-time virtual representation of the physical world with its entities, relationships, events, states, processes, and activities. According to the Gartner forecast report, the metaverse is among the top five emerging trends and technologies. Gartner predicts that by 2026 25% of people will spend at least one hour every day in the metaverse and 30% of organizations will have products and services developed for metaverse platforms.2 The metaverse is in an early developmental stage but has a considerable promise of occupying prominent space in the next phase of the Internet.",
