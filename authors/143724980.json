            "title": "Ontology Development Kit: a toolkit for building, maintaining and standardizing biomedical ontologies",
            "abstract": "Abstract Similar to managing software packages, managing the ontology life cycle involves multiple complex workflows such as preparing releases, continuous quality control checking and dependency management. To manage these processes, a diverse set of tools is required, from command-line utilities to powerful ontology-engineering environmentsr. Particularly in the biomedical domain, which has developed a set of highly diverse yet inter-dependent ontologies, standardizing release practices and metadata and establishing shared quality standards are crucial to enable interoperability. The Ontology Development Kit (ODK) provides a set of standardized, customizable and automatically executable workflows, and packages all required tooling in a single Docker image. In this paper, we provide an overview of how the ODK works, show how it is used in practice and describe how we envision it driving standardization efforts in our community.

            "title": "A Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM)",
            "abstract": "Abstract Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and exchanging scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for mapping between different representations of the same or similar objects in different databases poses a major impediment to data integration and interoperability. Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

As a result, inconsistencies in W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) expressions were identified and corrected, and additionally, standardized design patterns and a formalized template to maintain them were developed. We describe here this informative and productive process to describe the specific benefits and obstacles for OBI and the universal lessons for similar projects.",

The main users of the IEDB are immunologists who can easily use our web interface to search for peptidic epitopes via their simple single-letter codes. For example, \u2018A\u2019 stands for \u2018alanine\u2019. Similarly, users can easily navigate the IEDB\u2019s simplified NCBI taxonomy hierarchy to locate proteins from specific organisms. However, some epitopes are non-peptidic, such as carbohydrates, lipids, chemicals and drugs, and it is more challenging to consistently name them and search upon, making access to their data more problematic for immunologists. Therefore, we set out to improve access to non-peptidic epitope data in the IEDB through the simplification of the non-peptidic hierarchy used in our search interfaces. Here, we present these efforts and their outcomes. Database URL: http://www.iedb.org/",

            "abstract": "Biological ontologies are used to organize, curate, and interpret the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments. While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application, and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology\u2019s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data FAIR.",

Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURLs) are one common solution, introducing a mapping layer from the permanent identifier to a target URL that can change over time. Maintaining a PURL system requires long-term commitment and resources, and this can present a challenge for open projects that rely heavily on volunteers and donated resources. When the PURL system used by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) community suffered major technical problems in 2015, OBO developers had to migrate quickly to a new system. We describe that migration, the new OBO PURL system that we built, and the key factors behind our design. The OBO PURL system is low-cost and low-maintenance, built on well-established open source software, customized to the needs of the OBO community, and shows how key FAIR principles can be supported on a tight budget.",

The ability to describe consistently the details of the Immune Exposure process was needed for data resources responsible for housing scientific data related to the immune response. This need was met through the development of a structured model for Immune Exposures. This model was created during curation of the immunology literature, resulting in a robust model capable of meeting the requirements of such data.

            "abstract": "Human immunology studies typically examine how immune exposures associated with vaccinations, infectious, allergic or autoimmune diseases, or transplantations perturb the immune system with the goal to develop diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions. While there are established approaches to formally represent the experimental data generated in such studies, which often comprises gene expression data, flow cytometry data, or serology data, the description of the immune exposures themselves is not well standardized. We here present a formal approach to represent immune exposures at a high level of granularity. We capture the exposure process (e.g. \u2018vaccination\u2019 or \u2018occurrence of allergic disease\u2019), exposure material (e.g. \u2018Tdap vaccine\u2019 or \u2018House dust mite\u2019), and the associated disease name and stage (e.g. \u2018allergic rhinitis\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019). This representation scheme has been used successfully in the IEDB and an extended version has been adopted by HIPC to capture studies in ImmPort. We are reporting here on this scheme, our ongoing attempts to map the terms used to existing ontologies, and the challenges encountered. Keywords\u2014immune exposure; modeling; HIPC; ontology",

            "abstract": "Abstract The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), at www.iedb.org, has the mission to make published experimental data relating to the recognition of immune epitopes easily available to the scientific public. By presenting curated data in a searchable database, we have liberated it from the tables and figures of journal articles, making it more accessible and usable by immunologists. Recently, the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability have been formulated as goals that data repositories should meet to enhance the usefulness of their data holdings. We here examine how the IEDB complies with these principles and identify broad areas of success, but also areas for improvement. We describe short-term improvements to the IEDB that are being implemented now, as well as a long-term vision of true \u2018machine-actionable interoperability\u2019, which we believe will require community agreement on standardization of knowledge representation that can be built on top of the shared use of ontologies.",
