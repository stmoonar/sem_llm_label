            "title": "Graph Unlearning with Efficient Partial Retraining",
            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various real-world applications. However, GNNs may be trained on undesirable graph data, which can degrade their performance and reliability. To enable trained GNNs to efficiently unlearn unwanted data, a desirable solution is retraining-based graph unlearning, which partitions the training graph into subgraphs and trains sub-models on them, allowing fast unlearning through partial retraining. However, the graph partition process causes information loss in the training graph, resulting in the low model utility of sub-GNN models. In this paper, we propose GraphRevoker, a novel graph unlearning framework that better maintains the model utility of unlearnable GNNs. Specifically, we preserve the graph property with graph property-aware sharding and effectively aggregate the sub-GNN models for prediction with graph contrastive sub-model aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.",

            "title": "Linear-Time Graph Neural Networks for Scalable Recommendations",
            "abstract": "In an era of information explosion, recommender systems are vital tools to deliver personalized recommendations for users. The key of recommender systems is to forecast users' future behaviors based on previous user-item interactions. Due to their strong expressive power of capturing high-order connectivities in user-item interaction data, recent years have witnessed a rising interest in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to boost the prediction performance of recommender systems. Nonetheless, classic Matrix Factorization (MF) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches still play an important role in real-world large-scale recommender systems due to their scalability advantages. Despite the existence of GNN-acceleration solutions, it remains an open question whether GNN-based recommender systems can scale as efficiently as classic MF and DNN methods. In this paper, we propose a Linear-Time Graph Neural Network (LTGNN) to scale up GNN-based recommender systems to achieve comparable scalability as classic MF approaches while maintaining GNNs' powerful expressiveness for superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm. Our implementation based on PyTorch is available.",
