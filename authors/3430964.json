            "title": "Augmentation Techniques for Sequential Clinical Data to Improve Deep Learning Prediction Techniques",
            "abstract": "Methods based on neural networks have become more and more attractive in the medical domain as Deep Learning frameworks mature and popularize. One application in this context refers to the use of recurrent networks to predict the most probable clinical conditions of a patient, given his/her history of hospital/medical admissions. The problem is that clinical data to support machine learning is scarce, mainly due to privacy matters and to ill-structured medical databases. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to augment clinical data to improve the performance of automatic predictive systems. We introduce two methods to create synthetic clinical histories (trajectories) based on existing data; the first one extracts subsequences of trajectories to emphasize the transition in between hospital admissions; the second method benefits from the hierarchical structure of standard diagnosis codes (like ICD-9) trajectories whose characteristics resemble those of real-world clinics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in two datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of data augmentation in the clinical scenario. Our results shall inspire the augmentation of data in several other scenarios related to the medical domain.",

            "title": "The use of social tagging to support the cataloguing of learning objects",
            "abstract": "Social networks have become the main media for information dissemination in the so-called Web 2.0. The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Ko\u0308rner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.",

            "abstract": "Relational databases are rigid-structured data sources characterized by complex relationships among aset of relations (tables). Making sense of such relationships is a challenging problem because usersmust consider multiple relations, understand their ensemble of integrity constraints, interpret dozens ofattributes, and draw complex SQL queries for each desired data exploration. In this scenario, weintroduce a twofold methodology; we use a hierarchical graph representation to efficiently model thedatabase relationships and, on top of it, we designed a visualization technique for rapidly relationalexploration. Our results demonstrate that the exploration of databases is profoundly simplified as theuser is able to visually browse the data with little or no knowledge about its structure, dismissing theneed of complex SQL queries. We believe our findings will bring a novel paradigm in what concernsrelational data comprehension.",

            "title": "Computational framework to analyze agrometeorological, climate and remote sensing data: challenges and perspectives",
            "abstract": "In the past few years, improvements in the data acquisition technology have decreased the time interval of data gathering. Consequently, institutions have stored huge amounts of data such as climate time series and remote sensing images. Computational models to filter, transform, merge and analyze data from many different areas are complex and challenging. The complexity increases even more when combining several knowledge domains. Examples are research in climatic changes, biofuel production and environmental problems. A possible solution to the problem is the association of several computational techniques. Accordingly, this paper presents a framework to analyze, monitor and visualize climate and remote sensing data by employing methods based on fractal theory, data mining and visualization techniques. Initial experiments showed that the information and knowledge discovered from this framework can be employed to monitor sugar cane crops, helping agricultural entrepreneurs to make decisions in order to become more productive. Sugar cane is the main source to ethanol production in Brazil, and has a strategic importance for the country economy and to guarantee the Brazilian self-sufficiency in this important, renewable source of energy.",
