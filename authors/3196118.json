            "title": "CAFIN: Centrality Aware Fairness inducing IN-processing for Unsupervised Representation Learning on Graphs",
            "abstract": "Unsupervised Representation Learning on graphs is gaining traction due to the increasing abundance of unlabelled network data and the compactness, richness, and usefulness of the representations generated. In this context, the need to consider fairness and bias constraints while generating the representations has been well-motivated and studied to some extent in prior works. One major limitation of most of the prior works in this setting is that they do not aim to address the bias generated due to connectivity patterns in the graphs, such as varied node centrality, which leads to a disproportionate performance across nodes. In our work, we aim to address this issue of mitigating bias due to inherent graph structure in an unsupervised setting. To this end, we propose CAFIN, a centrality-aware fairness-inducing framework that leverages the structural information of graphs to tune the representations generated by existing frameworks. We deploy it on GraphSAGE (a popular framework in this domain) and showcase its efficacy on two downstream tasks - Node Classification and Link Prediction. Empirically, CAFIN consistently reduces the performance disparity across popular datasets (varying from 18 to 80% reduction in performance disparity) from various domains while incurring only a minimal cost of fairness.",

            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm in which multiple clients participate to collectively learn a global machine learning model at the central server. It is plausible that not all the data owned by each client is relevant to the server's learning objective. The updates incorporated from irrelevant data could be detrimental to the global model. The task of selecting relevant data is explored in traditional machine learning settings where the assumption is that all the data is available in one place. In FL settings, the data is distributed across multiple clients and the server can't introspect it. This precludes the application of traditional solutions to selecting relevant data here.\n In this paper, we propose an approach called Federated Learning with Relevant Data (FLRD), that facilitates clients to derive updates using relevant data. Each client learns a model called Relevant Data Selector (RDS) that is private to itself to do the selection. This in turn helps in building an effective global model.\n We perform experiments with multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. The results show (a) the capability of FLRD to identify relevant data samples at each client locally and (b) the superiority of the global model learned by FLRD over other baseline algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The paradigm of Federated learning (FL) deals with multiple clients participating in collaborative training of a machine learning model under the orchestration of a central server. In this setup, each client\u2019s data is private to itself and is not transferable to other clients or the server. Though FL paradigm has received significant interest recently from the research community, the problem of selecting the relevant clients w.r.t. the central server's learning objective is under-explored. We refer to these problems as Federated Relevant Client Selection (FRCS). Because the server doesn't have explicit control over the nature of data possessed by each client, the problem of selecting relevant clients is significantly complex in FL settings.\nIn this paper, we resolve important and related FRCS problems viz., selecting clients with relevant data, detecting clients that possess data relevant to a particular target label, and rectifying corrupted data samples of individual clients. We follow a principled approach to address the above FRCS problems and develop a new federated learning method using the Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory. Towards this end, we propose a cooperative game involving the gradients shared by the clients. Using this game, we compute Shapley values of clients and then present Shapley value based Federated Averaging (S-FedAvg) algorithm that empowers the server to select relevant clients with high probability. S-FedAvg turns out to be critical in designing specific algorithms to address the FRCS problems. We finally conduct a thorough empirical analysis on image classification and speech recognition tasks to show the superior performance of S-FedAvg than the baselines in the context of supervised federated learning settings.",

            "abstract": "To make ML systems deployment ready, one of the prominent challenges is to debug the performance issues of the trained ML models. This can be done by associating the issues with a set of Data Slices - aggregates of validation data records - to help the developers investigate these technical issues at a deeper level of granularity. Since the possible number of data slices are exponential in number, there is a need to prioritize the order (i.e. ranking) of slices before presenting to the users. However, there does not exist any work that deals with ranking these automatically generated slices and we refer to this problem as the data slice ranking problem (DSRP). This problem is challenging to address as the top ranked slices should contain significant error concentration (i.e. number of mis-classified data points), be statistically significant (i.e. having large size), and be non-redundant (i.e. contain unique mis-classified data points).In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing a novel game theoretic framework building upon Shapley value concept to derive a rank order for a given collection of data slices. In particular, we formally present a scheme that explicitly accounts only for the error concentration and we refer to this as Shapley Slice Ranking with Error concentration (SSR-E). We then prove a few useful properties of this scheme. Using thorough experimentation on 7 open source data sets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SSR mechanism vis-\u00e0-vis two baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Network representation learning has traditionally been used to find lower dimensional vector representations of the nodes in a network. However, there are very important edge driven mining tasks of interest to the classical network analysis community, which have mostly been unexplored in the network embedding space. For applications such as link prediction in homogeneous networks, vector representation (i.e., embedding) of an edge is derived heuristically just by using simple aggregations of the embeddings of the end vertices of the edge. Clearly, this method of deriving edge embedding is suboptimal and there is a need for a dedicated unsupervised approach for embedding edges by leveraging edge properties of the network. \nTowards this end, we propose a novel concept of converting a network to its weighted line graph which is ideally suited to find the embedding of edges of the original network. We further derive a novel algorithm to embed the line graph, by introducing the concept of collective homophily. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct unsupervised approach for edge embedding in homogeneous information networks, without relying on the node embeddings. We validate the edge embeddings on three downstream edge mining tasks. Our proposed optimization framework for edge embedding also generates a set of node embeddings, which are not just the aggregation of edges. Further experimental analysis shows the connection of our framework to the concept of node centrality.",

            "abstract": "Preference aggregation, and specifically rank aggregation, is a well known problem in the fields of computational social choice and preference handling with broad application including web search and recommendation systems. Inspired by the recent advances in the area of deep neural representation learning, for the first time in the literature, in this paper we leverage unsupervised deep learning techniques - especially graph embeddings - for aggregating a collection of incomplete rank lists and accordingly we develop an algorithm called DeepAggregation. It takes as input a set of incomplete rank lists and constructs a multi-layer graph wherein the nodes are the alternatives that are ranked and the edges capture information contained in the incomplete rank lists. We then compute deep neural representation vectors (i.e. embeddings) for the nodes and then derive the aggregated order using these representation vectors. Our proposed algorithm can handle incomplete rank lists with or without ties. We conduct thorough empirical analysis of the proposed DeepAggregation algorithm using various real life data sets such as TripAdvisor reviews data. We empirically observe that DeepAggregation generates impressive results in comparison with a number of well-known state-of-the-art preference aggregation methods.",

            "abstract": "Learning the emergence of cooperation in conflicting scenarios such as social dilemmas is a centerpiece of research. Many reinforcement learning based theories exist in the literature to address this problem. The well-known fact about RL based model's very slow learning capabilities coupled with large state space exhibit significant negative effects especially in repeated version of social dilemma settings such as repeated Public Goods Game (PGG) and thereby making them ineffective to model sustainability of cooperation. In this paper, we address this research challenge by augmenting the reinforcement learning based models with a notion of collaboration among the agents, motivated by the fact that humans learn not only through their own actions but also by following the actions of other agents who also continuously learn about the environment. In particular, we propose a novel model, which we refer to as Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL), wherein we define collaboration among the agents as the ability of agents to fully follow other agent's actions/decisions. This is also termed as social learning. The proposed CRL model significantly influences the speed of individual learning, which eventually has a large effect on the collective behavior as compared to that of RL only models and thereby effectively explaining the sustainability of cooperation in repeated PGG settings. We also extend the CRL model for PGGs over different generations where agents die out and new agents are born following a birth-death process.",

            "abstract": "We study the complexity of equilibrium computation in discrete preference games. These games were introduced by Chierichetti, Kleinberg, and Oren (EC '13, JCSS '18) to model decision-making by agents in a social network that choose a strategy from a finite, discrete set, balancing between their intrinsic preferences for the strategies and their desire to choose a strategy that is `similar' to their neighbours. There are thus two components: a social network with the agents as vertices, and a metric space of strategies. These games are potential games, and hence pure Nash equilibria exist. Since their introduction, a number of papers have studied various aspects of this model, including the social cost at equilibria, and arrival at a consensus. We show that in general, equilibrium computation in discrete preference games is PLS-complete, even in the simple case where each agent has a constant number of neighbours. If the edges in the social network are weighted, then the problem is PLS-complete even if each agent has a constant number of neighbours, the metric space has constant size, and every pair of strategies is at distance 1 or 2. Further, if the social network is directed, modelling asymmetric influence, an equilibrium may not even exist. On the positive side, we show that if the metric space is a tree metric, or is the product of path metrics, then the equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time.\u00a0",

            "abstract": "In social dilemma settings, such as repeated Public Goods Games (PGGs), humans often come across a dilemma whether to contribute or not based on past contributions from others. In such settings, the decision taken by an agent/human actually depends not only on the belief the agent has about other agents and the environment, but also on their beliefs about others' beliefs. To factor in these aspects, we propose a novel formulation of computational theory of mind (ToM) to model human behavior in a repeated PGG using interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs). Interactive particle filter (IPF) is a well-known algorithm used to approximately solve I-POMDP models for the agents to find their optimal contributions. Number of particles assigned to an agent in IPF can be translated into time and computational resources. Solving I-POMDPs in a time-memory efficient manner even in the case of small state spaces is a largely intractable problem. Also, maintaining a fixed number of particles assigned to each agent, over time, will be highly inefficient in terms of resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic particle allocation algorithm for different agents based on how well they could predict. We validate our proposed algorithm through real experiments involving human agents. Our results suggest that dynamic particle allocation based IPF for I-POMDPs is effective in modelling human behaviours in repeated social dilemma setting while utilizing computational resources in an effective manner.",

            "title": "A Generic Axiomatic Characterization for Measuring Influence in Social Networks",
            "abstract": "Measuring influence, through centrality measures, has been a center-piece of research in the analysis of complex social networks, such as finding coherent communities (clusters) and locating trend setters (prototypes) in viral marketing. Even though there exists a few axiomatic frameworks associated with some specific forms of influence measures in the literature, these formal frameworks are not generic in nature in terms of characterizing the space of influence measures for complex social networks. To address this research gap, we propose a generic axiomatic framework, in this paper, to capture most of the key intrinsic properties of any influence measure in networks. We further analyze certain popular centrality measures using this framework. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that none of the centrality measures considered satisfies all the desirable axioms. We finally conclude this paper by stating an appealing conjecture on a potential impossibility theorem associated with the proposed axiomatic framework.",
