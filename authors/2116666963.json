            "title": "Vague Preference Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.",

            "title": "Multi-Interest Multi-Round Conversational Recommendation System with Fuzzy Feedback based User Simulator",
            "abstract": "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) is able to obtain fine-grained and dynamic user preferences based on interactive dialogue. Previous CRS assumes that the user has a clear target item, which often deviates from the real scenario. The user may have a clear single preference for some attribute types (e.g. brand) of items, while for other attribute types (e.g. color), the user may have multiple preferences or even no clear preferences, which leads to multiple acceptable items under multiple combinations of attribute instances. Furthermore, previous works assume that users would provide clear responses to any questions asked by the system. And they also assume that users would be dedicated to the target item, that is, user would answer \u201dyes\u201d to the attribute corresponding to the target item and answer \u201dno\u201d to other attributes. However, users\u2019 responses to attributes are not completely dependent on target items, but also influenced by users\u2019 inherent interests. Besides, for some over-specific or equivocal questions, the feedback of user might not be clear (\u201dyes\u201d/\u201dno\u201d) and user might give some fuzzy response like \u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d. To address the aforementioned issues, we first propose a more realistic conversational recommendation learning setting, namely Multi-Interest Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MIMCR), where users may have multiple interests in attribute instance combinations and accept multiple items with partially overlapped combinations of attribute instances. To effectively cope with MIMCR, we propose a novel learning framework, namely Multiple Choice questions based Multi-Interest Policy Learning. Moreover, we further propose a more realistic User-centric User Simulator with Fuzzy Feedback (UUSFF), which naturally calibrates the user response with additional fuzzy feedback based on user\u2018s inherent preference. To better match the new scenario UUSFF, we propose a simple but effective adaption method for different backbones. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods for the proposed settings.",

Forecasting, in general, has led to broad impact and a diverse range of applications. However, with large-scale, high-dimensional time-series data available, more advanced techniques must be invented or improved for highly accurate predictions. Latest data mining and machine learning techniques play a crucial role in the next generation of forecasting models. In this Applied Machine Learning Methods for Time Series Forecasting (AMLTS) workshop, we focus on effective and accurate latest machine learning approaches to solve various real-world problems. With this workshop's ability to attract audiences across various domains, we invite experienced industrial practitioners and researchers to help uncover new approaches and break new ground in time-series modelings' challenging and vital settings.",

            "abstract": "With the ever-increasing malware threats, malware detection plays an indispensable role in protecting information systems. Although tremendous research efforts have been made, there are still two key challenges hindering them from being applied to accurately and robustly detect malwares. Firstly, most of them represent executables with shallow features, but ignore their semantic and structural information. Secondly, they are primarily based on representations that can be easily modified by attackers and thus cannot provide robustness against adversarial attacks. To tackle the challenges, we present MalGraph, which first represents executables with hierarchical graphs and then uses an end-to-end learning framework based on graph neural networks for malware detection. In particular, a hierarchical graph consists of a function call graph that captures the interaction semantics among different functions at the inter-function level and corresponding control-flow graphs for learning the structural semantics of each function at the intra-function level. We argue the abstraction and hierarchy nature of hierarchical graphs makes them not only easy to capture rich structural information of executables, but also be immune to adversarial attacks. Evaluations show that MalGraph not only outperforms state-of-the-art malware detection, but also exhibits stronger robustness against adversarial attacks by a large margin.",

            "abstract": "The field of graph neural networks (GNNs) has seen rapid and incredible strides over the recent years. Graph neural networks, also known as deep learning on graphs, graph representation learning, or geometric deep learning, have become one of the fastest-growing research topics in machine learning, especially deep learning. This wave of research at the intersection of graph theory and deep learning has also influenced other fields of science, including recommendation systems, computer vision, natural language processing, inductive logic programming, program synthesis, software mining, automated planning, cybersecurity, and intelligent transportation. However, as the field rapidly grows, it has been extremely challenging to gain a global perspective of the developments of GNNs. Therefore, we feel the urgency to bridge the above gap and have a comprehensive tutorial on this fast-growing yet challenging topic. This tutorial of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Foundation, Frontiers and Applications will cover a broad range of topics in graph neural networks, by reviewing and introducing the fundamental concepts and algorithms of GNNs, new research frontiers of GNNs, and broad and emerging applications with GNNs. In addition, rich tutorial materials will be included and introduced to help the audience gain a systematic understanding by using our recently published book-Graph Neural Networks (GNN): Foundation, Frontiers, and Applications [12], which can easily be accessed at https://graph-neural-networks.github.io/index.html.",

            "abstract": "Computational notebooks allow data scientists to express their ideas through a combination of code and documentation. However, data scientists often pay attention only to the code and neglect the creation of the documentation in a notebook. In this work, we present a human-centered automation system, Themisto, that can support users to easily create documentation via three approaches: 1) We have developed and reported a GNN-augmented code documentation generation algorithm in a previous paper, which can generate documentation for a given source code; 2) Themisto also implements a query-based approach to retrieve the online API documentation as the summary for certain types of source code; 3) Lastly, Themistoalso enables a user prompt approach to motivate users to write documentation for some use cases that automation does not work well.",

            "title": "2nd International Workshop on Industrial Recommendation Systems (IRS)",
            "abstract": "Recommendation systems are used widely across many industries, such as e-commerce, multimedia content platforms and social networks, to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume or connect; thus, improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry and research organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, which has resulted in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on the performance of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, it often neglects key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform in a real-world environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: business metric definition and evaluation, recommendation quality control, data and model scalability, model interpretability, model robustness and fairness, and resource limitations, such as computing and memory resources budgets, engineering workforce cost, etc. The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the broad applicability of many of academia's contributions for industrial recommendation systems. This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia and industry. Its goal is to serve as a venue through which academic researchers become aware of the additional factors that may affect the adoption of an algorithm into real production systems, and how well it will perform if deployed. Industrial researchers will also benefit from sharing the practical insights, approaches, and frameworks as well.",
