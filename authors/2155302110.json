            "abstract": "Transport infrastructure is a fundamental component of the whole infrastructure system and socio-economic development. However, it is still a challenge to identify factors affecting large-scale infrastructure due to the lack of high-quality data and inconsistent methods. To address this issue, this study developed a comparison of data- and knowledge-driven approaches in exploring factors affecting road infrastructure performance in Western Australia using network-level high-resolution road defects data. In data-driven analysis, an optimal parameters-based geographical detectors (OPGD) model, developed based on spatial heterogeneity, was developed to investigate the contributions of explanatory factors from a spatial data perspective. In knowledge-driven analysis, a questionnaire survey was performed through group interviews with regional road management teams to analyze potential explanatory factors. A spatial analytic hierarchy process (S-AHP) approach was implemented to quantify the contributions of factors based on the survey. Finally, the consistency and difference between data- and knowledge-driven approaches are evaluated based on contributions of factors and the predictions of defect risks across the road network. The results indicate that the contributions of factors tend to be similar in both approaches, and the spatial distributions of defect risks predicted by both approaches are highly correlated. The factors and risks analyzed using both methods in rural areas are more consistent than those in urban areas due to the complexity and uncertainty of road defects. Findings from this study are critical to understanding data- and knowledge-driven approaches in transport infrastructure management and determining reasonable approaches for decision-making.",

            "abstract": "In the Logistics Distribution System, in order to enhance the availability of massive data table, simplify the maintenance operations of data table, balance disk I/O and improve query performance, this system uses the range partitioning technology, interval partitioning technology, reference partitioning technology and list partitioning technology supported by Oracle 11g. Compared to retrieve the non-partitioned table and the partition table has been used time, execution plan and statistical information. Through analysis and comparison examples show that mass data table using partitioning technologies, can improve the SQL retrieval performance, and reduce execution costs. Therefore, the contribution of table partitioning technology on massive data tables is to improve the manageability and availability of data tables, and optimizing SQL retrieval performance.

            "abstract": "With the widespread application of GIS, an increasing number of industries involved in GIS result in the appearance of multi-source heterogeneous data source. Due to the deficiencies of common methods of multi-source heterogeneous data integration, we put forward the integration of multi-source heterogeneous data based on middleware. GIS middleware integrates multiple data source driver and provides a unified interface to client GIS software, client GIS software can seamlessly integrate multi-source heterogeneous data without care about the specific format of spatial data, so we can fast and sequentially achieve to load multi-source data. This article introduces the working principle and concrete realization of model about the middleware, the technology of middleware has been successfully applied in the MapGIS platform and achieved the integration of multi-source heterogeneous data.",
