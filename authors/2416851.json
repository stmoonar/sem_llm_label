            "abstract": "In recent years, visual facial forgery has reached a level of sophistication that humans cannot identify fraud, which poses a significant threat to information security. A wide range of malicious applications have emerged, such as deepfake, fake news, defamation or blackmailing of celebrities, impersonation of politicians in political warfare, and the spreading of rumours to attract views. As a result, a rich body of visual forensic techniques has been proposed in an attempt to stop this dangerous trend. However, there is no comprehensive, fair, and unified performance evaluation to enlighten the community on best performing methods. The authors present a systematic benchmark beyond traditional surveys that provides in\u2010depth insights into facial forgery and facial forensics, grounding on robustness tests such as contrast, brightness, noise, resolution, missing information, and compression. The authors also provide a practical guideline of the benchmarking results, to determine the characteristics of the methods that serve as a comparative reference in this never\u2010ending war between measures and countermeasures.

            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-hop reasoning has become an interpretable way for knowledge graph reasoning owing to its persuasive explanations for the predicted results, but the reasoning performance of these methods drops significantly over few-shot relations (only contain few triplets). To address this problem, recent studies introduce meta-learning into RL-based reasoning methods. However, the performance of these studies is still limited due to the following points: (1) the overall reasoning accuracy is impaired due to the low reasoning accuracies over some hard relations; (2) the reasoning process becomes laborious and ineffective owing to the existence of noisy data; (3) the generalizability is negatively affected due to the lack of knowledge-sharing. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel model HMLS consisting of two modules HHML (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Meta-reinforcement Learning) and HHS (Hierarchical Hardness-aware Sampling). Specifically, HHML contains the following two components: (1) a hardness-aware RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by training hardness-aware batches and reducing noise; (2) a knowledge-sharing meta-learning adapts to few-shot relations by exploiting common features in the hierarchical relation structure. The other module HHS generates hardness-aware batches from relation and relation-cluster levels. The experimental results demonstrate that this work notably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in few-shot scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Network alignment is the task of identifying topologically and semantically similar nodes across (two) different networks. It plays an important role in various applications ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatic network interactions. However, existing alignment models either cannot handle large-scale graphs or fail to leverage different types of network information or modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end alignment framework that can leverage different modalities to compare and align network nodes in an efficient way. In order to exploit the richness of the network context, our model constructs multiple embeddings for each node, each of which captures one modality or type of network information. We then design a late-fusion mechanism to combine the learned embeddings based on the importance of the underlying information. Our fusion mechanism allows our model to be adapted to various types of structure of the input network. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, while being robust against various noise factors.",

            "abstract": "A well-designed recommender system can accurately capture the attributes of users and items, reflecting the unique preferences of individuals. Traditional recommendation techniques usually focus on modeling the singular type of behaviors between users and items. However, in many practical recommendation scenarios (e.g., social media, e-commerce), there exist multi-typed interactive behaviors in user-item relationships, such as click, tag-as-favorite, and purchase in online shopping platforms. Thus, how to make full use of multi-behavior information for recommendation is of great importance to the existing system, which presents challenges in two aspects that need to be explored: (1) Utilizing users' personalized preferences to capture multi-behavioral dependencies; (2) Dealing with the insufficient recommendation caused by sparse supervision signal for target behavior. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Enhancement Multi-Behavior Contrastive Learning Recommendation (KMCLR) framework, including two Contrastive Learning tasks and three functional modules to tackle the above challenges, respectively. In particular, we design the multi-behavior learning module to extract users' personalized behavior information for user-embedding enhancement, and utilize knowledge graph in the knowledge enhancement module to derive more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, in the optimization stage, we model the coarse-grained commonalities and the fine-grained differences between multi-behavior of users to further improve the recommendation effect. Extensive experiments and ablation tests on the three real-world datasets indicate our KMCLR outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods and verify the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Latent factor models are the most popular backbones for today's recommender systems owing to their prominent performance. Latent factor models represent users and items as real-valued embedding vectors for pairwise similarity computation, and all embeddings are traditionally restricted to a uniform size that is relatively large (e.g., 256-dimensional). With the exponentially expanding user base and item catalog in contemporary e commerce, this design is admittedly becoming memory-inefficient. To facilitate lightweight recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently opened up opportunities for identifying varying embedding sizes for different users/items. However, challenged by search efficiency and learning an optimal RL policy, existing RL-based methods are restricted to highly discrete, predefined embedding size choices. This leads to a largely overlooked potential of introducing finer granularity into embedding sizes to obtain better recommendation effectiveness under a given memory budget. In this paper, we propose continuous input embedding size search (CIESS), a novel RL-based method that operates on a continuous search space with arbitrary embedding sizes to choose from. In CIESS, we further present an innovative random walk-based exploration strategy to allow the RL policy to efficiently explore more candidate embedding sizes and converge to a better decision. CIESS is also model-agnostic and hence generalizable to a variety of latent factor RSs, whilst experiments on two real-world datasets have shown state-of-the-art performance of CIESS under different memory budgets when paired with three popular recommendation models.",

            "abstract": "Imbalanced node classification widely exists in real-world networks where graph neural networks (GNNs) are usually highly inclined to majority classes and suffer from severe performance degradation on classifying minority class nodes. Various imbalanced node classification methods have been proposed recently which construct synthetic nodes and edges w.r.t. minority classes to balance the label and topology distribution. However, they are all based on the homophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the wide existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs. Thus, they uniformly aggregate features from both homophilic and heterophilic neighbors and rely on feature similarity to generate synthetic edges, which cannot be applied to imbalanced graphs in high heterophily. To address this problem, we propose a novel GraphSANN for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Firstly, we propose a unified feature mixer to generate synthetic nodes with both homophilic and heterophilic interpolation in a unified way. Next, by randomly sampling edges between synthetic nodes and existing nodes as candidate edges, we design an adaptive subgraph extractor to adaptively extract the contextual subgraphs of candidate edges with flexible ranges. Finally, we develop a multi-filter subgraph encoder that constructs different filter channels to discriminatively aggregate neighbor's information along the homophilic and heterophilic edges. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",

            "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its critical application in a wide range of domains, such as social networks, financial risk management, and traffic analysis. Existing GAD methods can be categorized into node and edge anomaly detection models based on the type of graph objects being detected. However, these methods typically treat node and edge anomalies as separate tasks, overlooking their associations and frequent co-occurrences in real-world graphs. As a result, they fail to leverage the complementary information provided by node and edge anomalies for mutual detection. Additionally, state-of-the-art GAD methods, such as CoLA and SL-GAD, heavily rely on negative pair sampling in contrastive learning, which incurs high computational costs, hindering their scalability to large graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified graph anomaly detection framework based on bootstrapped self-supervised learning (named BOURNE). We extract a subgraph (graph view) centered on each target node as node context and transform it into a dual hypergraph (hypergraph view) as edge context. These views are encoded using graph and hypergraph neural networks to capture the representations of nodes, edges, and their associated contexts. By swapping the context embeddings between nodes and edges and measuring the agreement in the embedding space, we enable the mutual detection of node and edge anomalies. Furthermore, BOURNE can eliminate the need for negative sampling, thereby enhancing its efficiency in handling large graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of BOURNE in detecting both node and edge anomalies.",

            "title": "Learning Compact Compositional Embeddings via Regularized Pruning for Recommendation",
            "abstract": "Latent factor models are the dominant backbones of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) given their performance advantages, where a unique vector embedding with a fixed dimensionality (e.g., 128) is required to represent each entity (commonly a user/item). Due to the large number of users and items on e-commerce sites, the embedding table is arguably the least memory-efficient component of RSs. For any lightweight recommender that aims to efficiently scale with the growing size of users/items or to remain applicable in resource-constrained settings, existing solutions either reduce the number of embeddings needed via hashing, or sparsify the full embedding table to switch off selected embedding dimensions. However, as hash collision arises or embeddings become overly sparse, especially when adapting to a tighter memory budget, those lightweight recommenders inevitably have to compromise their accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel compact embedding framework for RSs, namely Compositional Embedding with Regularized Pruning (CERP). Specifically, CERP represents each entity by combining a pair of embeddings from two independent, substantially smaller meta-embedding tables, which are then jointly pruned via a learnable element-wise threshold. In addition, we innovatively design a regularized pruning mechanism in CERP, such that the two sparsified meta-embedding tables are encouraged to encode information that is mutually complementary. Given the compatibility with agnostic latent factor models, we pair CERP with two popular recommendation models for extensive experiments, where results on two real-world datasets under different memory budgets demonstrate its superiority against state-of-the-art baselines. The codebase of CERP is available in https://github.com/xurong-lianyCERP.",

            "abstract": "As an indispensable personalized service in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), the next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to help people discover attractive and interesting places. Currently, most POI recommenders are based on the conventional centralized paradigm that heavily relies on the cloud to train the recommendation models with large volumes of collected users' sensitive check-in data. Although a few recent works have explored on-device frameworks for resilient and privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they invariably hold the assumption of model homogeneity for parameters/gradients aggregation and collaboration. However, users' mobile devices in the real world have various hardware configurations (e.g., compute resources), leading to heterogeneous on-device models with different architectures and sizes. In light of this, We propose a novel on-device POI recommendation framework, namely Model-Agnostic Collaborative learning for on-device POI recommendation (MAC), allowing users to customize their own model structures (e.g., dimension & number of hidden layers). To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data, we propose to pre-select neighbors for collaboration based on physical distances, category-level preferences, and social networks. To assimilate knowledge from the above-selected neighbors in an efficient and secure way, we adopt the knowledge distillation framework with mutual information maximization. Instead of sharing sensitive models/gradients, clients in MAC only share their soft decisions on a preloaded reference dataset. To filter out low-quality neighbors, we propose two sampling strategies, performance-triggered sampling and similarity-based sampling, to speed up the training process and obtain optimal recommenders. In addition, we design two novel approaches to generate more effective reference datasets while protecting users' privacy. Extensive experiments on two datasets have shown the superiority of MAC over advanced baselines.",

            "title": "Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning for On-Device Recommendation",
            "abstract": "To address privacy concerns and reduce network latency, there has been a recent trend of compressing cumbersome recommendation models trained on the cloud and deploying compact recommender models to resource-limited devices for the real-time recommendation. Existing solutions generally overlook device heterogeneity and user heterogeneity. They require devices with the same budget to share the same model and assume the available device resources (e.g., memory) are constant, which is not reflective of reality. Considering device and user heterogeneities as well as dynamic resource constraints, this article proposes a Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning framework (PEEL) for the on-device recommendation, which generates Personalized Elastic Embeddings (PEEs) for devices with various memory budgets in a once-for-all manner, adapting to new or dynamic budgets, and addressing user preference diversity by assigning personalized embeddings for different groups of users. Specifically, it pretrains a global embedding table with collected user-item interaction instances and clusters users into groups. Then, it refines the embedding tables with local interaction instances within each group. PEEs are generated from the group-wise embedding blocks and their weights that indicate the contribution of each embedding block to the local recommendation performance. Given a memory budget, PEEL efficiently generates PEEs by selecting embedding blocks with the largest weights, making it adaptable to dynamic memory budgets on devices. Furthermore, a diversity-driven regularizer is implemented to encourage the expressiveness of embedding blocks, and a controller is utilized to optimize the weights. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, and the results show that PEEL yields superior performance on devices with heterogeneous and dynamic memory budgets.",
