            "abstract": "The performance of indoor small-cell networks (SCNs) is affected by the indoor environment, such as walls, blockages, etc. In this article, we investigate the effect of interior wall attenuation on the performance of an indoor SCN. Specifically, the spatial distribution of interior walls is modeled based on the random shape theory, and the indoor base stations (BSs) are distributed following a homogeneous Poisson point process. The channel model includes the path loss, Rayleigh fading, and wall attenuation. We analytically derive the downlink coverage probability under the strongest received signal user association strategy, which is validated by Monte Carlo simulations for three typical interior wall layouts (i.e., random layout, binary orientation layout, and Manhattan grid). The analytical results show that for a given density of interior walls and signal strength attenuation per wall, there is an optimal BS density that maximizes the coverage probability, and the optimal BS density increases as the wall attenuation increases.",

            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.",

            "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is envisioned to meet high data rate requirements of cooperative environment perception of autonomous vehicles, thereby improving traffic safety and efficiency to a new level. By using stochastic geometry (SG), some works have investigated effects of vehicular mobility on mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. However, they only consider two-dimensional (2D) beamforming rather than three-dimensional (3D) beamforming. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework using SG to resolve the effect of 3D beamforming on the throughput performance of dynamic mmWave V2I networks, by separately analyzing horizontal and vertical beam sojourn times. An integrated 3D system model containing the channel, blockage and antenna models is introduced, and the exact expression of effective throughput is derived, which characterizes the average data rate of the typical vehicle during one beam tracking period. Simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results, and reveal that an optimal roadside unit (RSU) density to maximize the effective throughput exists. What\u2019s more, ignoring the vertical beam of the antenna array overly underestimates both the optimal RSU density and the effective throughput under some conditions, which indicates that the effect of 3D beamforming is non-negligible when evaluating the throughput performance of dynamic mmWave V2I networks.",

            "abstract": "Interior wall blockage affects the performance of indoor cellular networks but has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, by modelling the spatial distribution of interior walls using the random shape theory and incorporating the attenuation caused by wall blockages into the path loss model, we develop a tractable approach to analyse the performance of indoor small cell networks under the influence of interior wall blockages. Then, the proposed analytical approach is applied to study the downlink coverage probability of two user association strategies: the closest line-of-sight (LOS) base station (BS) strategy, and the closest non-line-of-sight (NLOS) BS strategy. The analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations in comparison with those obtained under the existing wall blockage model that assumes impenetrable walls. Our results reveal the importance of considering the wall attenuation for the accurate analysis of indoor cellular networks. The coverage probability is more sensitive to wall attenuation under the closest NLOS BS user association strategy than under the closest LOS BS user association strategy, and that there is an optimal BS density that maximizes the coverage probability under the closest LOS BS user association strategy, but the coverage probability under the closest NLOS BS user association strategy monotonically decreases with the increase of BS density.",

In this paper, an analytical framework is developed based on stochastic geometry to characterize the uplink V2I transmission performances, in terms of the outage probability, the average vehicle throughput and the average spatial throughput, particularly resolving two important but not well-understood factors in such networks: the spatial correlation in the interference powers among the cooperative roadside units (RSUs) as caused by the shared set of co-channel vehicles, and the combined vertical distance (CVD) owing to the lane width and the antenna height difference between the vehicle and the RSUs. Exact analytical expressions of the outage probability are derived for the general multiple association cases, a far-distance approximation method is introduced to reduce the computational complexity, and lower and upper bounds are obtained corresponding to two extreme assumptions of the spatial interference correlation. We show that the impacts of the spatial interference correlation can be significant and ignoring the correlation can lead to non-optimal system deployment, and that the far-distance approximation can approach well with the exact results.

            "abstract": "The current decades have witnessed the explosive increase of traffic-data demand. It is predicted that indoor wireless communications will be one of the fastest growing markets, since the vast majority (over 80%) of data demand occurs in indoors. Facing such a huge data demand, the dense deployment of small cells (SCs) in indoor environments is boosted, which brings breakthroughs of throughput for in-building communications. However, the densification of indoor small-cell (SC) networks also poses new challenges, such as complex propagating environments, severe blockage effects and short link distances, which significantly influence the evaluation of network performance. This thesis mainly investigates the performance analysis of indoor dense SC networks. \n \nFirstly, the probability of Line-of-Sight (LOS) propagation is crucial to model the real signal propagation channels and to evaluate the performance of cellular networks. However, existing LOS probability models are oversimplified to provide the exact LOS probability in indoor scenarios. By considering the realistic layout of building structures, this thesis proposes a novel and analytical LOS probability model for downlink radio propagations in typical indoor scenarios, which have rectangular rooms and corridors. Through the proposed model, the LOS probability can be calculated directly without the measurement and simulation. \n \nNext, in terms of the impact of LOS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) transmissions, the traditional works do not distinguish them, which is not practical for dense cellular networks. Thus, a tractable path loss model considering both LOS and NLOS propagations is proposed for the performance analysis of indoor dense SC networks. Based on the theory of stochastic geometry, the performance metrics, such as coverage probability, spectral \nefficiency (SE) and area spectral efficiency (ASE), are analytically derived. The analytical results provide insights into the design of indoor dense SC networks in the future. \n \nThirdly, regarding the severe effects of blockages in indoor environments, the traditional approach that simply considers it as a log-normal shadowing is too simple. Therefore, a wall blockage model is developed to characterize the impact of blockages based on the stochastic geometry. Furthermore, the mathematical expression of coverage probability for the case of impenetrable blockages is derived, which employs a path loss model incorporating both the blockage-based and distance-based path loss.",

However, previous works either ignore or simplify such effects for analysing the networks. On the basis of stochastic geometry, this paper proposes a mathematically tractable approach to analyse ultra-dense networks in indoors, which considers both the effects of wall blockages and the distance-based path loss. The effects of wall blockages are firstly investigated by modelling the walls as a Boolean scheme of straight lines on a finite plane. Then a path loss model incorporating both the blockage-based and distance-based path loss is applied to analyse the performance of indoor networks. Finally, the analytical result is validated by comparing it with Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results also show that the optimum transmitter density is finite for indoor ultra-dense networks with blockages, although the coverage probability benefits from the increase of transmitter density.",

            "abstract": "The probability of line-of-sight (LOS) propagation is crucial for channel modeling and small-cell network evaluation. In this letter, by taking the layout of building structures into account, an analytical LOS probability model is proposed for typical indoor scenarios, which have rectangular rooms and corridors. The proposed model is validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results show that the proposed model estimates the network performance accurately and efficiently.",
