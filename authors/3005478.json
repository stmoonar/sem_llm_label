            "title": "Interactive Decision-Making With Switchable Game Modes for Automated Vehicles at Intersections",
            "abstract": "Interactive decision-making between multiple automated vehicles under unsigned intersections is a high-level dynamic decision-making scenario, greatly increasing the complexity of decision-making. In this situation, making the decision-making manner in accordance with the logic of human and guaranteeing driving safety is technically challenging. A multi-factor-enabled interactive decision-making method is proposed in this paper to realize such behavior, which employs multiple complementary factors and switchable modes in a dynamic game. More specifically, these factors are driving performance requirements, e.g., moving safety, smoothness comfort, fast passing, and surrounding space, as well as diversified driving styles suitable for different driver groups. Meanwhile, to improve the reasonability of automated driving and reduce the complexity of multi-vehicle games, switchable game modes are established to realize the dynamic adjustment mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed method in resolving conflicts in a continuous interactive way is verified through extensive simulations. The results indicate the proposed method can reflect the interaction process between multi-agents, and improve compliance between intelligent decision-making and the logic of human.",

            "abstract": "This article is focused on bibliographic analysis and collaboration pattern analysis of the textpapers published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) from January 2019 to January 2023. We have identified the authors, institutions, and countries/regions that are the most productive and have the highest impact. It is found that research on intelligent vehicles is dominated by researchers and institutions from China. Researchers from the US are the second largest contributor to the transaction, whilst those from Germany rank the third. It is also found that, Fei-Yue Wang, Mohan Manubhai Trivedi, and J. Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.",

            "abstract": "Engine modelling is an important step in predicting the fuel consumption of a vehicle. Existing methods in the literature require dedicated tests on a test track or on a chassis dynamometer or they require measurements from several days of vehicle operation. This article proposes a new method to model fuel flow rate of a diesel engine and a compressed gas engine using prediction error identification and on-road data collection. The model inputs are the engine torque and speed. The on-road vehicle data was collected during normal transport operations. The identification data set was approximately 99% shorter than the baseline method. The proposed method is applicable for other types of vehicles, including electric vehicles. The identified engine models have less than 1.3% mean error and 2.5% RMS error.",

Although a number of surveys have reviewed research achievements in this field, they are still limited in specific tasks, lack of systematic summary and research directions in the future. Here we propose a Survey of Surveys (SoS) for total technologies of AD and IVs that reviews the history, summarizes the milestones, and provides the perspectives, ethics, and future research directions. To our knowledge, this article is the first SoS with milestones in AD and IVs, which constitutes our complete research work together with two other technical surveys. We anticipate that this article will bring novel and diverse insights to researchers and abecedarians, and serve as a bridge between past and future.",

We first defined short- and long-term driving styles and then described the input data used by the recognition models and related data-processing techniques. Furthermore, we also revisited existing evaluation metrics for different recognition algorithms.

            "abstract": "This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.",

            "abstract": "As driving scenarios and autonomous vehicles (AVs) become increasingly intricating, there is an increasing need for innovative frameworks that can enhance and test AV capabilities across diverse scenarios. At present, the design and validation for AVs predominantly rely on simulation software or real-road testing methodologies. However, these approaches possess inherent limitations, leading to inaccuracy, reduced efficiency, and potential hazards during the development process. This letter reports our first DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), that aims to calibrate and validate AV modules through advanced scenarios. Specifically, the DHW discusses combining SE with existing simulation software and real-road testing strategies, enabling developers to maximize the advantages of each approach while ensuring the safety and efficacy in the development of autonomous vehicles. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of enhancing realism of simulation scenarios in the aspects of both content and appearance. Furthermore, the use of scenarios engineering is explored in order to enhance the diversity and safety of real-road testing by means of integrating virtual and physical components.",
