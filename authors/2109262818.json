            "title": "Focal Cosine Metric and Adaptive Attention Module for Remote Sensing Scene Classification With Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks",
            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in remote sensing (RS) scene classification tasks due to their remarkable feature representation and inference capability. The complexity of RS images not only brings the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class diversity, but also introduces the problem that category-relevant regions are insufficiently prominent in feature extraction. Siamese CNNs with feature similarity measurement are chosen in some applications to overcome the former issue, but most ignore the randomness of input sample pairs. This makes the Siamese CNNs not focus enough on challenging samples, which limits the training efficiency. We propose the focal cosine metric (FCM) block that combines the cosine similarity metric and the threshold control to achieve sample selection, thereby completing network learning more efficiently. FCM only permits the misclassified focal samples to participate in similarity measurement based on Siamese CNN. It flexibly mitigates the misclassification caused by the high inter-class similarity and large intra-class diversity. Moreover, the adaptive attention (AA) module is designed to stress the pivotal target regions and assist in the similarity measurement of Siamese CNN. This is realized by adaptively assigning high weights to key targets with learnable guided vectors. It enables the model to focus on the details of intra-class similarities or inter-class differences in sample pairs, and thus reduces the difficulty of model optimization. Encouraging experimental results on three public data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel Siamese CNN-based method with FCM and AA and show its superiority compared to other state-of-the-art scene classification methods.",

            "title": "Gradient Enhanced Dual Regression Network: Perception-Preserving Super-Resolution for Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Imagery",
            "abstract": "Most existing learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods mainly focus on improving reconstruction accuracy, but they always generate overly smoothed results that fail to match the visual perception. Although perceptual quality can be greatly improved via introducing adversarial loss, image fidelity may decrease to some extent. Moreover, most methods are trained and evaluated on simulated datasets and their performance would drop significantly on real remote sensing imagery. To solve the above problems, we propose a new SISR algorithm named gradient enhanced dual regression network (GEDRN). Based on the dual regression framework, we use share-source residual structure and non-local operation to learn abundant low-frequency information and long-distance spatial correlations. Besides, we not only introduce additional gradient information to avoid blurry results but also apply gradient loss and perceptual loss to further improve the perceptual quality. Our GEDRN is trained and tested on real-world multi-sensor satellite images. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving much better perceptual quality and ensuring high fidelity.",

            "title": "Image Reconstruction Using Variable Exponential Function Regularization for Wide-Field Polarization Modulation Imaging",
            "abstract": "Polarization modulation imaging technology plays an important role in microscopic super-resolution imaging. However, the specimen medium contains retardancy, while charge-coupled devices may provide discrete under-sampling, and the coupled wavefronts consisting of the polarization state of the light and the anisotropic distribution of the specimen can lead to vectorial phase fitting degradation. Considering that the point spread function (PSF) of the main degradation parts can be regarded as an asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution with uncertain parameters, an adaptive image reconstruction method is proposed based on variable exponential function regularization. The proposed method concentrates on the diversity of the PSF and uses a variable exponent regularization to improve flexibility of the kernel. Moreover, it can balance image edge preservation and provide staircase artifact suppression, which reduces the over- and under-reconstruction of the microscopic images effectively. By optimizing the Split\u2013Bregman algorithm, we create an efficient method that minimizes the iterative loss function under the premise of achieving high estimation accuracy. Compared with other methods, the experimental results reveal better effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, with improvements of 18% in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, 21% in the structural similarity index measurement, and 337% in the mean structural similarity index measurement.",

The challenge addresses the problem of learning a model capable of predicting the space of plausible super-resolution (SR) images, from a single low-resolution image. The model must thus be capable of sampling diverse outputs, rather than just generating a single SR image. The goal of the challenge is to spur research into developing learning formulations and models better suited for the highly ill-posed SR problem. And thereby advance the state-of-the-art in the broader SR field. In order to evaluate the quality of the predicted SR space, we propose a new evaluation metric and perform a comprehensive analysis of the participating methods. The challenge contains two tracks: 4\u00d7 and 8 scale factor. In total, 11 teams competed in the final testing\u00d7 phase.",
