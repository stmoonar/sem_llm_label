            "title": "Transfer Learning Strategies for Anomaly Detection in IoT Vibration Data",
            "abstract": "An increasing number of industrial assets are equipped with IoT sensor platforms and the industry now expects data-driven maintenance strategies with minimal deployment costs. However, gathering labeled training data for supervised tasks such as anomaly detection is costly and often difficult to implement in operational environments. Therefore, this work aims to design and implement a solution that reduces the required amount of data for training anomaly classification models on time series sensor data and thereby brings down the overall deployment effort of IoT anomaly detection sensors. We set up several in-lab experiments using three peristaltic pumps and investigated approaches for transferring trained anomaly detection models across assets of the same type. Our experiments achieved promising effectiveness and provide initial evidence that transfer learning could be a suitable strategy for using pre-trained anomaly classification models across industrial assets of the same type with minimal prior labeling and training effort. This work could serve as a starting point for more general, pre-trained sensor data embeddings, applicable to a wide range of assets.",

            "abstract": "The increasing deployment of low-cost IoT sensor platforms in industry boosts the demand for anomaly detection solutions that fulfill two key requirements: minimal configuration effort and easy transferability across equipment. Recent advances in deep learning, especially long-short-term memory (LSTM) and autoencoders, offer promising methods for detecting anomalies in sensor data recordings. We compared autoencoders with various architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), LSTMs and convolutional neural networks (CNN) using a simple benchmark dataset, which we generated by operating a peristaltic pump under various operating conditions and inducing anomalies manually. Our preliminary results indicate that a single model can detect anomalies under various operating conditions on a four-dimensional data set without any specific feature engineering for each operating condition. We consider this work as being the first step towards a generic anomaly detection method, which is applicable for a wide range of industrial equipment.",
