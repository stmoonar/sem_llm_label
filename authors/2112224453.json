            "abstract": "Computational experiments have emerged as a valuable method for studying complex systems, involving the algorithmization of counterfactuals. However, accurately representing real social systems in Agent-based Modeling (ABM) is challenging due to the diverse and intricate characteristics of humans, including bounded rationality and heterogeneity. To address this limitation, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been proposed, enabling agents to possess anthropomorphic abilities such as complex reasoning and autonomous learning. These agents, known as LLM-based Agent, offer the potential to enhance the anthropomorphism lacking in ABM. Nonetheless, the absence of explicit explainability in LLMs significantly hinders their application in the social sciences. Conversely, computational experiments excel in providing causal analysis of individual behaviors and complex phenomena. Thus, combining computational experiments with LLM-based Agent holds substantial research potential. This paper aims to present a comprehensive exploration of this fusion. Primarily, it outlines the historical development of agent structures and their evolution into artificial societies, emphasizing their importance in computational experiments. Then it elucidates the advantages that computational experiments and LLM-based Agents offer each other, considering the perspectives of LLM-based Agent for computational experiments and vice versa. Finally, this paper addresses the challenges and future trends in this research domain, offering guidance for subsequent related studies.",

            "abstract": "Powered by advanced information industry and intelligent technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). And human factors have become crucial in the operations of complex social systems. Traditional mechanical analysis and social simulations alone are powerless for analyzing complex social systems. Against this backdrop, computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of complex social systems by combining social simulation (e.g., ABM), complexity science, and domain knowledge. However, in the process of applying computational experiments, the construction of experiment system not only considers a large number of artificial society models, but also involves a large amount of data and knowledge. As a result, how to integrate various data, model and knowledge to achieve a running experiment system has become a key challenge. This paper proposes an integrated design framework of computational experiment system, which is composed of four parts: generation of digital subject, generation of digital object, design of operation engine, and construction of experiment system. Finally, this paper outlines a typical case study of coal mine emergency management to verify the validity of the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "Powered by advanced information technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). In this context, computational experiments method has emerged as a novel approach for the design, analysis, management, control, and integration of CPSS, which can realize the causal analysis of complex systems by means of \u201calgorithmization\u201d of \u201ccounterfactuals\u201d. However, because CPSS involve human and social factors (e.g., autonomy, initiative, and sociality), it is difficult for traditional design of experiment (DOE) methods to achieve the generative explanation of system emergence. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated approach to the design of computational experiments, incorporating three key modules: 1) Descriptive module: Determining the influencing factors and response variables of the system by means of the modeling of an artificial society; 2) Interpretative module: Selecting factorial experimental design solution to identify the relationship between influencing factors and macro phenomena; 3) Predictive module: Building a meta-model that is equivalent to artificial society to explore its operating laws. Finally, a case study of crowd-sourcing platforms is presented to illustrate the application process and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can reveal the social impact of algorithmic behavior on \u201crider race\u201d.",

In this article, the docking framework between the domain model and the artificial society model was proposed in this article, and the model docking specification is given from three aspects: the agent model, the environmental model, and the rules model. In addition, the effectiveness of the framework was verified by two classic cases: artificial stock market and epidemic prevention and control.

            "abstract": "With the development of ICT (information and communications technology) and service economy, service ecosystem is emerging in a lot of fields, including E-commerce, O2O(Online To Offline) life service, healthcare service, cloud manufacturing, and so on. As a complex socio-technical system, the evolution of service ecosystem is the joint result of the interaction of the three heterogeneous networks, including social network, service network and value network. Under such circumstances, the traditional SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)-based analysis model is powerless. As a result, how to analyze the laws behind the evolution of service ecosystem is still a serious challenge in the field. This paper proposes a value oriented analysis framework (VOA) of service ecosystem, which can use value as a clue to describe the interaction of the three heterogeneous networks. In addition, a computational experiment system is established to verify the effectiveness of the VOA framework, which stimulates the effect of different intervention strategies on service ecosystem. The result shows that our analysis framework can provide new means and ideas for the analysis of service ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "As a new form of manufacturing in the industrial Internet era, cloud manufacturing service ecosystem (CMSE) can meet complex customization needs through a dynamic collaborative network between cloud manufacturing services. The source of cloud manufacturing service is social, and such sociality aggravates the uncertainty and dynamics of CMSE. This poses new challenges to the analysis of CMSE's evolution. The existing model social learning evolution (SLE) model only analyzes manufacturing service ecosystem from the perspective of individuals and lacks research on the organizational structure among individuals. In this article, we propose the improved model (SLE2) from a system perspective, which reconstructed the three layers of the SLE model: the individual layer describes the learning and evolution characteristics of service agents; the organization layer describes the competition and cooperation among service agents; and the social layer describes the value-driven social network operation mode. Finally, the article verifies that the SLE2 model is effective through computational experimental results.",

            "abstract": "Computational experiments have emerged as a new method for quantitative analysis of complex social systems. It has been applied to many interdisciplinary research fields, such as economics, finance, and epidemiology. Though the representation form of computational experiments is relatively flexible, the real system is more complex. Therefore, it is important to seek a balance between the flexibility of computational modeling and the credibility of conclusion. This article proposes a customized design framework for computational experiment models, so as to meet the diverse application demands of computational experiments in different fields. Finally, this article outlines some typical applications of computational experiments to provide a roadmap for its rapid development and widespread application.",

            "abstract": "With the development of cloud computing, service computing, IoT(Internet of Things) and mobile Internet, the diversity and sociality of services are increasingly apparent. To meet the customized user demands, Service Ecosystem is emerging as a complex social-technology system, which is formed with various IT services through cross-border integration. However, how to analyze and promote the evolution mechanism of service ecosystem is still a serious challenge in the field, which is of great significance to achieve the expected system evolution trends. Based on this, this paper proposes a value-driven analysis framework of service ecosystem, including value creation, value operation, value realization and value distribution. In addition, a computational experiment system is established to verify the effectiveness of the analysis framework, which stimulates the effect of different operation strategies on the value network in the service ecosystem. The result shows that our analysis framework can provide new means and ideas for the analysis of service ecosystem evolution, and can also support the design of operation strategies. Index",
