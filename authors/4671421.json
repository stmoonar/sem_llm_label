            "title": "P-NAL: an Effective and Interpretable Entity Alignment Method",
            "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) aims to find equivalent entities between two Knowledge Graphs. Existing embedding-based EA methods usually encode entities as embeddings, triples as embeddings' constraint and learn to align the embeddings. The structural and side information are usually utilized via embedding propagation, aggregation or interaction. However, the details of the underlying logical inference steps among the alignment process are usually omitted, resulting in inadequate inference process. In this paper, we introduce P-NAL, an entity alignment method that captures two types of logical inference paths with Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL). Type 1 is the bridge-like inference path between to-be-aligned entity pairs, consisting of two relation/attribute triples and a similarity sentence between the other two entities. Type 2 links the entity pair by their embeddings. P-NAL iteratively aligns entities and relations by integrating the conclusions of the inference paths. Moreover, our method is logically interpretable and extensible due to the expressiveness of NAL. Our proposed method is suitable for various EA settings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hits@1, achieving 0.98+ on all three datasets of DBP15K with both supervised and unsupervised settings. To our knowledge, we present the first in-depth analysis of entity alignment's basic principles from a unified logical perspective.",

            "abstract": "Currently, named entity recognition (NER) is mainly evaluated on standard and well\u2010annotated data sets. However, the construction of a well\u2010annotated data set will consume a lot of manpower and time. In lots of applications of NER, data sets may contain a lot of noise, and a large part of noise comes from unlabeled entities. At present, the training process of most models treat unlabeled entities as nonentities, which causes these models to lean toward predicting most words of an input context as nonentities and greatly affects their performances. In this paper, as the first attempt, we innovatively propose an adaptive positive\u2010unlabeled (adaPU) learning technology, and integrate the adaPU into a machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework for NER, which can still perform well on data sets with a large proportion of unlabeled entities. In our framework, to leverage the above problem that a model may predict most words of an input context as nonentities, we propose an adaPU learning technology by adjusting a loss coefficient of positive and negative samples. Moreover, instead of just constructing a fixed query for each entity type as input to MRC, we propose a new method of dynamically constructing multiple queries for each entity type, which also brings slight performance improvement for NER. Accordingly, we explore new training and entity inference strategies for our learning framework. The experimental results show that our framework is effective on data sets that contain a large number of unlabeled entities. When the proportion of unlabeled entities reaches 50%, our framework still can keep from losing effectiveness and maintain more than 80 F1\u2010scores on several data sets. Also, the experiments show that our framework can achieve better or competitive performance on standard data sets. The ablation experiments further fully demonstrate our MRC framework with adaPU learning and dynamic query construction method can improve the performance of NER.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of the information age, excessive information collection leads to information overload. Automatic text summarization technology has become an effective way to solve information overload. This paper proposes an automatic text summarization model, which extends traditional sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural text summarization model by using a syntax-augmented encoder and a headline-aware decoder. The encoder encodes both syntactic structure and word information of a sentence in the sentence embedding. A hierarchical attention mechanism is proposed to pay attentions to syntactic units. The decoder is improved by a headline attention mechanism and a Dual-memory-cell LSTM network to achieve a higher quality of generated summaries. We designed experiments to compare the proposed method with baseline models on the CNN/DM datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is superior to abstractive baseline models in terms of the scores on ROUGE evaluation metrics, and achieve a summary generation performance comparable to the extractive baseline method. Though qualitative analysis, the summary quality of the propose method is more readable and less redundant, which agrees well with our intuition.",

            "abstract": "A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a directed graph with nodes as entities and edges as relations. KG representation learning (KGRL) aims to embed entities and relations in a KG into continuous low-dimensional vector spaces, so as to simplify the manipulation while preserving the inherent structure of the KG. In this paper, we propose a KG embedding framework, namely MCapsEED (Multi-Scale Capsule-based Embedding Model Incorporating Entity Descriptions). MCapsEED employs a Transformer in combination with a relation attention mechanism to identify the relation-specific part of an entity description and obtain the description representation of an entity. The structured and description representations of an entity are integrated into a synthetic representation. A 3-column matrix with each column a synthetic representation of an element of a triple is fed into a Multi-Scale Capsule-based Embedding model to produce final representations of the head entity, the tail entity and the relation. Experiments show that MCapsEED achieves better performance than state-of-the-art embedding models for the task of link prediction on four benchmark datasets.

Resource description framework (RDF), as the standard data and knowledge description language of the semantic web, has been widely used to represent various domain data. Aiming at the representation and querying of temporal data, this paper proposes a temporal data representation model based on RDF and its corresponding querying method. First, a representation model called RDFt is proposed, which can represent temporal data with both the time information and the update count information, and the syntax and semantics of the RDFt model are given. Then, we propose a query language called SPARQL[t] for RDFt, and we give the query syntax and operations of SPARQL[t] in detail. In addition, a querying transformation algorithm from SPARQL[t] to SPARQL is proposed, in order to achieve compatibility with the existing RDF query engines. Finally, we implemented a prototype system that can support RDFt temporal data representation and querying, and the case studies and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.",
