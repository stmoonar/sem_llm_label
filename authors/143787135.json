            "abstract": "Classical benchmark problems utilize multiple transformation techniques to increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape\u2019s \"shape\", but rather than change the \"view point\". For instance, after rotated, ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The detection of 3D interest points is a central problem in computer graphics, computer vision, and pattern recognition. It is also an important preprocessing step in the analysis of 3D model matching. Although studied for decades, detecting 3D interest points remains a challenge. In this study, a novel multiscale bilateral filtering method is presented to detect 3D interest points. This method first simplifies repeatedly the input 3D mesh to form k\n multiresolution meshes. For each mesh, on the basis of the computed saliency of the mesh vertex, the bilateral filtering is used to remove the noise of the mesh saliencies and the global contrast to normalise the saliencies, and then the interest points are extracted on the basis of the normalised saliency. The proposed method then gathers and clusters all interest points detected on the k\n multiresolution meshes, and the centres of these clusters are treated as the final interest points. In this method, both the spatial closeness and the geometric similarities of the mesh vertices are considered during the bilateral filtering process. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method to detect 3D interest points. This method is also tested the potential to distinguish 3D models.",

            "abstract": "Network traffic analysis has been widely used for detecting malware at a large-scale network. Nevertheless, the emerging malware variants and zero-day exploits keep posing significant challenges to malware detection systems. In this paper, we propose DART, a framework for detecting malicious network traffic based on Adaptation Regularization Transfer Learning (ARTL), which effectively copes with the unseen malware variants problem. Specifically, DART trains the adaptive classifier by simultaneously optimizing three factors: (i) the structural risk functions; (ii) the joint distribution between the known malware and unseen malware variants domains; and (iii) the manifold consistency underlying marginal distribution. In addition, DART also works with encrypted network traffic since it does not leverage information related to the packet content. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal with a thorough set of experiments. DART achieves over 90% F-measure and 91% recall, outperforming conventional traffic classification methods and other state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems.",

            "abstract": "As an important building-based material, cement has a wide range of applications. Since the micro structure of cement has significant effect on its comprehensive performance, the research on cement microstructure evolution has become extremely important [1]. As the basis of the research of cement micro structure evolution, the surface fitting of cement image is of great significance. The cement micro structure image has features with multi-scale and multi-object, thus its surface fitting becomes difficult. The moving least squares (MLS) has unique advantages for surface fitting with large amount of discrete data and complex shapes. Therefore, this paper adopts the moving least squares method to achieve the surface fitting of cement images. Through the reasonable selection of the basis function and the weight function, a great fitting effect is achieved, which provides a foundation of exploration on complex surface fitting of cement images.",

In this study, we devise a method that uses the URLs visited by applications to identify malicious apps. A multi-view neural network is used to create a malware detection model that emphasizes depth and width. This neural network can create multiple views of the input automatically and distribute soft attention weights to focus on different features of input. Multiple views preserve rich semantic information from input for classification without requiring complicated feature engineering. In addition, we conduct comprehensive experiments to compare the proposed method with others and verify the validity of the detection model. The experimental results show that our method has a certain timeliness. It can not only effectively detect malware discovered in different months of a certain year, but also detect potentially malicious apps in the third-party app market. We also compare the detection results of the proposed method on wild apps with 10 popular anti-virus scanners, and the final result shows that our approach ranks second in terms of detection performance.",

However, the problem of optimizing the neural network continues to restrict the further improvement of FCM. Traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) sometimes converges to a local optimal solution in multimodal landscape, particularly for optimizing neural networks. Therefore, the dynamic multilayer PSO (DMLPSO) is proposed to optimize the neural network for improving the performance of FCM. DMLPSO adopts the basic concepts of multi-layer PSO to introduce a dynamic reorganizing strategy, which achieves that valuable information dynamically interacts among different subswarms. This strategy increases population diversity to promote the performance of DMLPSO when optimizing multimodal functions.

Therefore, the investigation of cement compressive strength is helpful in improving the cement properties. Traditionally, chemical composition, curing condition, and water-cement ratio are used to estimate the strength of cement paste. However, this approach is limited by the extreme complexity of physical changes and chemical reactions during cement hydration. Considering the cement microstructure contains information related to strength microscopically, microtomography, which can image three-dimensional microstructure, provides scientists with another way to study cement compressive strength nondestructively. This study estimates cement compressive strength using microstructure features extracted from microtomography images and gene expression programming. A probabilistic polarized similarity weight tournament selection operator is also proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation. Experimental results corroborate that the obtained relationship possesses higher estimation accuracy, good interpretability and the evolutionary capability performs well.",

            "title": "Optimization of stream\u2010based live data migration strategy in the cloud",
            "abstract": "Live data migration in the cloud is responsible to migrate blocks of data from one emigration node to several immigration nodes. However, live data migration strategy is a NP\u2010hard problem like task scheduling. Recently, in\u2010stream processing is a new technique to process large\u2010scale data nearly instantaneously. This framework works fast that all decisions are made without a continuous stream of events. In this paper, we explore a real\u2010time live data migration strategy with stream processing paradigm. First, the nonlinear migration cost model and balance model are introduced as the metrics to evaluate the data migration strategy. Subsequently, a live data migration strategy with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. Two improvement measures called loop context and particle grouping are proposed. As an improvement of stream processing framework, nested loop context structure is a feedback to support iterative optimization algorithm. As an improvement of PSO, grouping particles before in\u2010stream processing are to speed up the convergence rate of PSO. Afterwards, we rebuild stream processing framework to implement these methods. The experimental results show the best performance of our method.",
