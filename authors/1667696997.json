To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts.

            "abstract": "Forecasting of geopolitical events is a notoriously difficult task, with experts failing to significantly outperform a random baseline across many types of forecasting events. One successful way to increase the performance of forecasting tasks is to turn to crowdsourcing: leveraging many forecasts from non-expert users. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning have led to models that can produce reasonable, although not perfect, forecasts for many tasks. Recent efforts have shown that forecasts can be further improved by ``hybridizing'' human forecasters: pairing them with the machine models in an effort to combine the unique advantages of both. In this demonstration, we present Synergistic Anticipation of Geopolitical Events (SAGE), a platform for human/computer interaction that facilitates human reasoning with machine models.",

This contrasts with a traditional experimental approach in which an experimenter has complete control over the participant\u2019s experience. Considering these two situations jointly provides an opportunity to understand why participants opt in to some stimuli or tasks but not to others. We present here a Bayesian model of cognitive and metacognitive processes that uses latent contextual knowledge to model how learners use knowledge to make opt-in decisions. We leverage the model to describe how performance on selfselected stimuli relates to performance on true experimental tasks that deny learners the opportunity for self-selection. We illustrate the utility of the approach with an application to a general-knowledge answering task.",

Often, there are many ways of achieving the same ends, some more complex than others and some which are not obvious. This book contains hundreds of useful tips to help you obtain the results you desire. It describes how to perform standard studio techniques such as drum editing and replacement and parallel compression as well as tips to improve your workflow. The book covers the new features introduced Logic Pro 9. Manipulate audio timing and tempo with the Flex tool, take advantage of the new latency compensation during recording and mixing, and learn about the new plug-ins like Pedalboard and Amp Designer. These tips and tricks are culled from the author's long familiarity with Logic in music production, multimedia work and audio restoration, from his columns for several music technology magazines and from the results of research arising from the many questions he receives from Logic users. Logic Pro 9 Tips and Tricks will help you utilize the software to the max.",

Using a computer and suitable software, it's possible for anyone to produce high-quality results that can be used for music CDs, film and TV scores - or even as a basis of a recording session using orchestral players. Many musicians would like to add synthetic orchestral colour to their work but are often left feeling frustrated that their first attempts don't sound very realistic or that the techniques needed will be too difficult to learn. This book is aimed at those with little or not understanding of music notation. It gives the reader a basic understanding or the principles of orchestration and offers tips and techniques to help get the best simulated orchestral performance out of their equipment.",
