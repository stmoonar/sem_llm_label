            "abstract": "Opinions evolve rapidly on the Internet, where adverse opinion evolution such as echo chamber could occur. To facilitate group consensus formation, many studies on opinion guidance strategy have been conducted. However, previous guidance strategies are to impose target opinions on the public, without considering the individuals\u2019 acceptance of the target opinions. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an opinion dynamics model based on a moderate opinion guidance strategy. Through the simulation result, we illustrate the effect of guidance ratio and guidance strength on group consensus level. Moreover, we explain the counterintuitive result of increasing guidance strength by analyzing the opinion formation process. Then, we verify the stability of the moderate guidance in multiple networks and compare it with the traditional degree guidance in various network environments. The results show that the moderate guidance can not only effectively guide most individuals\u2019 opinion to reach a consensus in the short term, but also guide an individual who has a large deviation to target opinion through long-term guidance.",

Reconfigurable tail-resistor (RTR) technology is proposed to achieve exceptional odd-order harmonic distortion while maintaining excellent energy-efficiency to meet the different application needs of sensors.

            "abstract": "PurposeEndorsement marketing has been widely used to generate consumer attention, interest and purchase decisions among targeted audiences. Internet celebrities who become famous on the Internet are dependent on strategic intimacy to appeal to their followers. Our study aims to examine how multiple exposures to Internet celebrity endorsements influence consumers\u2019 click and purchase decisions in the context of influencer marketing.Design/methodology/approachBased on a unique and representative dataset, the authors first model consumers\u2019 choices for clicks and purchases with two panel fixed-effect logit models linking clicks and purchases with the frequency of exposure to Internet celebrity endorsement. To further control the endogeneity produced by the intercorrelation between the click and purchase models, the authors also adopt the two-stage Heckman probit structure to jointly estimate the two models using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Robustness checks confirm the effectiveness of the models.FindingsThe results suggest that Internet celebrity endorsement plays a significant role in bringing referral traffic to e-commerce sites but is less helpful in affecting conversion to sales. The impact of repetitive Internet celebrity endorsements on consumers\u2019 click decisions is U-shaped, but the role of Internet celebrities as online retailers will \u201cshape-flip\u201d this relationship to a negative linear relation.Originality/valueOur study is the first to investigate the repetitive exposure effect of Internet celebrity endorsement. The results show a contradictory pattern with a wear-out effect of repetition in the advertising literature. This is the first study to show how the endorsing self, which is a common business model in influencer marketing, moderates the effectiveness of influencer marketing.",

Then we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for simultaneously matching any given mean vector, covariance matrix, Kollo skewness, and Kollo kurtosis. The specification of a suitable orthonormal basis greatly simplifies these moment-matching conditions. We offer semi-closed-form solutions to increase computational efficiency. In this respect, we compare our approach to two competing methods, which anyway can only match Kollo skewness and not the kurtosis at the same time. Ours is the first method for exactly matching all four multivariate moments simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of logistics and navigation has led to increasing demand for solving route optimization problems in real-time. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) tends to require fast and reliable online solutions, which may not be met by traditional iterative optimization algorithms. In this work, a real-time solution policy is proposed for TSP. The idea is to build a mapping between city information and optimal solutions using deep neural networks. Therefore, when given a new set of city coordinates, the optimal route can be directly and quickly calculated without iteration. Considering the recent advancement in computer vision with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), an image representation is proposed to convert TSP to a computer vision problem. A problem decomposition method is introduced to reduce the mapping complexity. Taking advantage of the powerful fitting capabilities of DCNN, a deep reinforcement learning method is designed without any labeling requirement. The proposed method is superior for real-time applications compared with other algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Thermal loading, especially in fire scenarios, challenges the safety and long-term durability of concrete structures. The resulting heat propagation within the structure is governed by the heat conduction equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically because of the nonlinearity related to the thermophysical properties of concrete. A semi-analytical approach for the transient nonlinear heat conduction problem in concrete structures was established in the present work. The nonlinearity related to the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, mass density, and specific heat capacity of heated concrete was taken into consideration. A Taylor series approximate solution was first established within a small neighborhood, employing the Boltzmann transformation in combination with the mean value theorem. Thereafter, it was extended to the whole domain by utilizing the Bernstein polynomial. The semi-analytical approach was validated by comparing it with the numerical results of two independent Finite Element simulations of nonlinear heat conduction along concrete plates, subjected to either moderate or fierce thermal loading. Absolute values of the relative errors are smaller than 5%. The validated semi-analytical approach was further applied to prediction of the temporal evolution of the temperature field of a scaled model of a subway station, subjected to fire disaster. The nonlinearities, related to the time-dependent surface temperature and the temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of concrete, were taken into consideration. The predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The established semi-analytical approach exhibits good accuracy and stability, providing insight into the interaction between the thermophysical properties of concrete in the heat conduction process.",

We start by presenting a method to calculate the counterfactual of removing a fragment from the aggregated data matrix. Based on the counterfactual calculation, we further propose 2D-Shapley, a theoretical framework for fragmented data valuation that uniquely satisfies some appealing axioms in the fragmented data context. 2D-Shapley empowers a range of new use cases, such as selecting useful data fragments, providing interpretation for sample-wise data values, and fine-grained data issue diagnosis.",

For the oriented object detection task, this paper proposes a point-based weakly semi-supervised training strategy, which only requires the training set with an extremely small number (10%) of fully labeled images with OBB and the other with points. Specifically, following the common self-training pipeline, we propose Point to OBB Network (P2ONet) as the teacher model to generate the high-quality pseudo OBB for each point-annotated object. Inspired by channel attention, we introduce Group Attention to P2ONet to better tackle the opposite assignment for similar proposals in the training task leading by the point label assignment strategy. Furthermore, by exploring the constraint in normal self-training pipeline, we propose Confidence-Aware Loss to alleviate the impact of inaccurate pseudo-boxes. Experiments on the DOTA dataset show the close performance between our method and normal oriented object detection training methods with remarkably lower labeling costs.",

            "abstract": "Whenever a shipped package crosses the border, logistic companies have to declare importer information for the clearance process. This information is not always provided by the customer, causing delays and additional expenses. Fortunately, importer information can often be inferred from historical shipments. The current technical standard, even in big companies, is to use a feature-weighted nearest neighbor approach based on domain knowledge. Nearest neighbors assume that each sample point is represented independently and is fixed in some high dimensional space. This makes it difficult to integrate higher-order pair-wise relationships such as transaction frequency from shipper to receiver transaction, because the features are now changing dependent on the pairs. This would require a complex ad-hoc feature engineering and metric learning to capture pairwise relationships properly with nearest neighbors. In this paper, we propose a framework for importer prediction based on a pair-wise classification approach that allows us to capture higher order pair-wise relationships. We also incorporate an auxiliary neural network that can reliably reject shipments that our model could not predict well such as shipments with new importers that are not in the historical data. This allows us to pass the difficult cases to a human agent instead of naively making an incorrect prediction. Our proposed pair-wise solution outperforms the industry standard by a significant margin of precision across a wide range of recall values.",
