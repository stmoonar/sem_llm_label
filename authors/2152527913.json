            "title": "EnMatch: Matchmaking for Better Player Engagement via Neural Combinatorial Optimization",
            "abstract": "Matchmaking is a core task in e-sports and online games, as it contributes to player engagement and further influences the game's lifecycle. Previous methods focus on creating fair games at all times. They divide players into different tiers based on skill levels and only select players from the same tier for each game. Though this strategy can ensure fair matchmaking, it is not always good for player engagement. In this paper, we propose a novel Engagement-oriented Matchmaking (EnMatch) framework to ensure fair games and simultaneously enhance player engagement. Two main issues need to be addressed. First, it is unclear how to measure the impact of different team compositions and confrontations on player engagement during the game considering the variety of player characteristics. Second, such a detailed consideration on every single player during matchmaking will result in an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with non-linear objectives. In light of these challenges, we turn to real-world data analysis to reveal engagement-related factors. The resulting insights guide the development of engagement modeling, enabling the estimation of quantified engagement before a match is completed. To handle the combinatorial optimization problem, we formulate the problem into a reinforcement learning framework, in which a neural combinatorial optimization problem is built and solved. The performance of EnMatch is finally demonstrated through the comparison with other state-of-the-art methods based on several real-world datasets and online deployments on two games.",

            "abstract": "Self-attention models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommender systems by capturing the sequential dependencies among user\u2013item interactions. However, they rely on adding positional embeddings to the item sequence to retain the sequential information, which may break the semantics of item embeddings due to the heterogeneity between these two types of embeddings. In addition, most existing works assume that such dependencies exist solely in the item embeddings, but neglect their existence among the item features. In our previous study, we proposed a novel sequential recommendation model, i.e., MLP4Rec, based on the recent advances of MLP-Mixer architectures, which is naturally sensitive to the order of items in a sequence because matrix elements related to different positions of a sequence will be given different weights in training. We developed a tri-directional fusion scheme to coherently capture sequential, cross-channel, and cross-feature correlations with linear computational complexity as well as much fewer model parameters than existing self-attention methods. However, the cascading mixer structure, the large number of normalization layers between different mixer layers, and the noise generated by these operations limit the efficiency of information extraction and the effectiveness of MLP4Rec. In this extended version, we propose a novel framework \u2013 SMLP4Rec for sequential recommendation to address the aforementioned issues. The new framework changes the flawed cascading structure to a parallel mode, and integrates normalization layers to minimize their impact on the model\u2019s efficiency while maximizing their effectiveness. As a result, the training speed and prediction accuracy of SMLP4Rec are vastly improved in comparison to MLP4Rec. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems aim to predict users\u2019 next interested item given their historical interactions. However, a long-standing issue is how to distinguish between users\u2019 long/short-term interests, which may be heterogeneous and contribute differently to the next recommendation. Existing approaches usually set pre-defined short-term interest length by exhaustive search or empirical experience, which is either highly inefficient or yields subpar results. The recent advanced transformer-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performances despite the aforementioned issue, but they have a quadratic computational complexity to the length of the input sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming for better modeling users\u2019 long/short-term interests from their historical interactions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm for preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization. Through extensive experiments, we show that AutoMLP has competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining linear computational complexity.",

            "abstract": "Online games make up the largest segment of the booming global game market in terms of revenue as well as players. Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Our work has been implemented and deployed in many online games released from NetEase Games. Online A/B testing in production shows that perCLTV achieves a prominent improvement in two precision marketing applications of popup recommendation and churn intervention.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the great accuracy performance of graph-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) models for recommender systems. By taking the user-item interaction behavior as a graph, these graph-based CF models borrow the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and iteratively perform neighborhood aggregation to propagate the collaborative signals. While conventional CF models are known for facing the challenges of the popularity bias that favors popular items, one may wonder \"Whether the existing graph-based CF models alleviate or exacerbate the popularity bias of recommender systems?\" To answer this question, we first investigate the two-fold performances w.r.t. accuracy and novelty for existing graph-based CF methods. The empirical results show that symmetric neighborhood aggregation adopted by most existing graph-based CF models exacerbates the popularity bias and this phenomenon becomes more serious as the depth of graph propagation increases. Further, we theoretically analyze the cause of popularity bias for graph-based CF. Then, we propose a simple yet effective plugin, namely r-AdjNorm, to achieve an accuracy-novelty trade-off by controlling the normalization strength in the neighborhood aggregation process. Meanwhile, r-AdjNorm can be smoothly applied to the existing graph-based CF backbones without additional computation. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can improve novelty without sacrificing accuracy under various graph-based CF backbones.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, advances in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have given new insights into the development of social recommendation. However, many existing GCN-based social recommendation methods often directly apply GCN to capture user-item and user-user interactions, which probably have two main limitations: (a) Due to the power-law property of the degree distribution, the vanilla GCN with static normalized adjacency matrix has limitations in learning node representations, especially for the long-tail nodes; (b) multi-typed social relationships between users that are ubiquitous in the real world are rarely considered. In this article, we propose a novel Bilateral Filtering Heterogeneous Attention Network (BFHAN), which improves long-tail node representations and leverages multi-typed social relationships between user nodes. First, we propose a novel graph convolutional filter for the user-item bipartite network and extend it to the user-user homogeneous network. Further, we theoretically analyze the correlation between the convergence values of different graph convolutional filters and node degrees after stacking multiple layers. Second, we model multi-relational social interactions between users as the multiplex network and further propose a multiplex attention network to capture distinctive inter-layer influences for user representations. Last but not least, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art GCN-based methods for social recommendation tasks.",

            "abstract": "In the business domain,bundling is one of the most important marketing strategies to conduct product promotions, which is commonly used in online e-commerce and offline retailers. Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items that users may be interested in, such as the considerable research work on collaborative filtering that directly models the interaction between users and items. In this paper, we target at a practical but less explored recommendation problem named personalized bundle composition, which aims to offer an optimal bundle (i.e., a combination of items) to the target user. To tackle this specific recommendation problem, we formalize it as a combinatorial optimization problem on a set of candidate items and solve it within a neural combinatorial optimization framework. Extensive experiments on public datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RL-based RS) aims at learning a good policy from a batch of collected data, by casting sequential recommendation to multi-step decision-making tasks. However, current RL-based RS benchmarks commonly have a large reality gap, because they involve arti\ufb01cial RL datasets or semi-simulated RS datasets, and the trained policy is directly evaluated in the simulation environment. In real-world situations, not all recommendation problems are suitable to be transformed into reinforcement learning problems. Unlike previous academic RL research, RL-based RS su\ufb00ers from extrapolation error and the di\ufb03culties of being well-validated before deployment. In this paper, we introduce the RL4RS (Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems) benchmark - a new resource fully collected from industrial applications to train and evaluate RL algorithms with special concerns on the above issues. It contains two datasets, tuned simulation environments, related advanced RL baselines, data understanding tools, and counterfactual policy evaluation algorithms. The RL4RS suit can be found at https://github.com/fuxiAIlab/RL4RS. In addition to the RL-based recommender systems, we expect the resource to contribute to research in reinforcement learning and neural combinatorial optimization.",
