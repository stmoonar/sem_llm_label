            "title": "Variational User Modeling with Slow and Fast Features",
            "abstract": "Recommender systems play a key role in helping users find their favorite music to play among an often extremely large catalog of items on online streaming services. To correctly identify users' interests, recommendation algorithms rely on past user behavior and feedback to aim at learning users' preferences through the logged interactions. User modeling is a fundamental part of this large-scale system as it enables the model to learn an optimal representation for each user. For instance, in music recommendation, the focus of this paper, users' interests at any time is shaped by their general preferences for music as well as their recent or momentary interests in a particular type of music. In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning user representation based on general and slow-changing user interests as well as fast-moving current preferences. We propose a variational autoencoder-based model that takes fast and slow-moving features and learns an optimal user representation. Our model, which we call FS-VAE, consists of sequential and non-sequential encoders to capture patterns in user-item interactions and learn users' representations. We evaluate FS-VAE on a real-world music streaming dataset. Our experimental results show a clear improvement in learning optimal representations compared to state-of-the-art baselines on the next item recommendation task. We also demonstrate how each of the model components, slow input feature, and fast ones play a role in achieving the best results in next item prediction and learning users' representations.",

            "title": "A Comparative Evaluation of Anomaly Explanation Algorithms",
            "abstract": "Detection of anomalies (i.e., outliers ) in multi-dimensional data is a well-studied subject in machine learning. Unfortunately, un-supervised detectors provide no explanation about why a data point was considered as abnormal or which of its features (i.e. subspaces) exhibit at best its outlyingness. Such outlier explanations are crucial to diagnose the root cause of data anomalies and enable corrective actions to prevent or remedy their effect in downstream data processing. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for comparing different unsupervised outlier explanation algorithms that are domain and detector-agnostic. Using real and synthetic datasets, we assess the effectiveness and efficiency of two point explanation algorithms (Beam [28] and RefOut [18]) ranking subspaces that best explain the outlyingness of individual data points and two explanation summarization algorithms (LookOut [15] and HiCS [17]) ranking subspaces that best exhibit as many outlier points from inliers as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed evaluation of existing explanation algorithms aiming to uncover several missing insights from the literature such as: (a) Is it effective to combine any explanation algorithm with any off-the-shelf outlier detector? (b) How is the behavior of an outlier detection and explanation pipeline affected by the number or the correlation of features in a dataset? and (c) What is the quality of summaries in the presence of outliers explained by subspaces of different dimensionality?",

            "abstract": "Finding a set of users of interest serves several applications in behavioral analytics. Often times, identifying users requires to explore the data and gradually choose potential targets. This is a special case of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), an iterative and tedious process. In this paper, we formalize and solve the problem of guided exploration of user groups whose purpose is to find target users. We model exploration as an iterative decision-making process, where an agent is shown a set of groups, chooses users from those groups, and selects the best action to move to the next step. To solve our problem, we apply reinforcement learning to discover an efficient exploration strategy from a simulated agent experience, and propose to use the learned strategy to recommend an exploration policy that can be applied to the same task for any dataset. Our framework accepts a wide class of exploration actions and does not need to gather exploration logs. Our experiments show that the agent naturally captures manual exploration by human analysts, and succeeds to learn an interpretable and transferable exploration policy.",

AutoML aims to fully automate the machine learning process end-to-end, democratizing Machine Learning to non-experts and drastically increasing the productivity of expert analysts. So far, most comparisons of AutoML systems focus on quantitative criteria such as predictive performance and execution time. In this paper, we examine AutoML services for predictive modeling tasks from a user\u2019s perspective, going beyond predictive performance. We present a wide palette of criteria and dimensions on which to evaluate and compare these services as a user. This qualitative comparative methodology is applied on seven AutoML systems, namely Auger.AI, BigML, H2O\u2019s Driverless AI, Darwin, Just Add Data Bio, Rapid-Miner, and Watson. The comparison indicates the strengths and weaknesses of each service, the needs that it covers, the segment of users that is most appropriate for, and the possibilities for improvements.",

            "abstract": "The increasing availability of user data constitutes new opportunities in various applications ranging from behavioral analytics to recommendations. A common way of analyzing user data is through \"user group analytics\" whose purpose is to breakdown users into groups to gain a more focused understanding of their collective behavior. The process consists of group discovery, group exploration, and group visualization. To date, user group analytics is done using separate tools which makes it fragmented and burdensome for analysts. In this paper, we describe UserDEV, a full-fledged user group analytics pipeline which combines discovery, exploration, and visualization of user groups, in a fully-connected fashion. UserDEV contributes a star-like architecture as well as a common data exchange model to tighten connections between the analytics components. We provide a realistic use case to show how UserDEV helps analysts perform analytical tasks on user groups. While we report a preliminary user study, we also discuss opportunities for an end-to-end evaluation of a group analytics framework.",
