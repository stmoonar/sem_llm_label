            "abstract": "FengYun-3G satellite was launched in April 2023, carrying onboard a precipitation measurement radar (PMR). In this study, FY-3G PMR data at Ku and Ka bands are assessed for retrieving cloud hydrometeor contents. A novel algorithm is developed to simultaneously retrieve the liquid and ice water contents (IWCs) and solid particle shapes at varying heights. For Typhoon Khanun, the hydrometeor content retrieved using this algorithm is close to the ERA5 rainwater and snow water at its developing and mature stages. The results show that the PMR minimum detectable reflectivity factor at Ku and Ka bands exceeds the design specifications, with values of 10 and 6 dBz, respectively. Furthermore, PMR signals primarily originate from the backscatter of larger particles, including rain, hail, and graupel. Using a prior relationship between the reflectivity and hydrometeor content at different temperatures, IWC and liquid water content (LWC) are retrieved and validated. It is found that Typhoon Khanun during the mature stage, compared to the development stage, IWC decreases while LWC increases. Moreover, based on Ku and Ka retrieval result, the most frequent shapes of typhoon solid particles are large column aggregate, Evans snow aggregate, gem graupel, and six-bullet rosette. Graupel particles are mainly concentrated in areas with high values of hydrometeor content. In some areas with high values of hydrometeors, large column aggregate is more prevalent, while Evans snow aggregate is mainly distributed in the areas with low values of hydrometeors.",

            "title": "Recalibration and Reprocessing of the Long-Term FY-3 MERSI Historical Data",
            "abstract": "The MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) series satellites can provide the long-term series data with favorable spectral and spatial resolution on the global scale since 2008. Such datasets are valuable for the studies of climate change. However, due to the lack of stable and reliable onboard calibration equipment and inconsistent in-orbit calibration methods, the MRESI historical data have poor long-term stability and unreliable accuracy, which affects the quantitative application of the data. This study reveals the overall status of the FY-3A/B/C MERSI-I historical data and proposes the recalibration methods for the reflective solar bands (RSBs) and thermal emission bands (TEBs). For the RSBs, by using FY-3A as the radiative transfer reference, an integrated transfer calibration method is developed for the calibration of FY-3B, which is then used to recalibrate FY-3C. The degradation tracking model of FY-3 MERSI-I is established first in the recalibration process by integrating multiple calibration methods. Then, based on the overlapping observations over the Libyan Desert, the linear consistency transfer model of the reference and target satellites is established, and the consistent correction coefficient between them is obtained. For the TEBs, a retrospective transfer recalibration scheme is proposed to achieve the reevaluation of the in-orbit radiometric calibration parameters based on intercalibration and to conduct the recalibration of historical data without permanent dependence on reference instruments. All the historical data of FY-A/B/C MERSI-I (from February 2008 to March 2017) are reprocessed with the same calibration method. The reprocessed datasets show remarkable improvements in calibration accuracy and stability compared with the operational datasets. The overall radiometric biases are found to be small and highly stable during the entire mission cycle of the instrument. The calibration biases of reprocessed data are less than 3% and 0.5 K for the RSBs and TEBs, respectively, much better than those of the operational datasets. There are also substantial improvements in the seasonal fluctuations and deviation discontinuities. This reprocessed long-term MERSI data with high intersensor consistency can provide valuable insights into global climate monitoring and model assessment.",

            "abstract": "The Ozone Monitoring Suite-Nadir (OMS-N) instrument is the first hyperspectral remote sensor in the ultraviolet band of China\u2019s Fengyun series satellites. It can be used to detect several kinds of atmospheric constituents. This paper describes the prelaunch spectral calibration of the OMS-N onboard FengYun 3F. Several critical spectral parameters including the spectral resolution, spectral dispersion, and the instrument spectral response function were determined through laser-based measurements. A secondary peak of the instrument spectral response function from the short wavelength side of the ultraviolet band was found, and the possible influence on data applications was analyzed using a reference solar model and radiative transfer model. The results indicate that the spectral resolution and spectral accuracy of OMS-N meet the mission requirements. However, the asymmetries in the instrument spectral response function in the ultraviolet band were found near nadir rows, which are expressed as the \u201casymmetric central peak\u201d and \u201csecondary peak\u201d. The analysis results show that if the influences of the instrument spectral response function \u201casymmetric central peak\u201d and \u201csecondary peak\u201d in the ultraviolet band are ignored, they will bring an error as large as 5% at the center of the absorption line.",

            "abstract": "Accurate radiometric calibration is crucial for satellite sensors, ensuring reliable remote sensing data. However, current calibration methods often rely on a limited number of samples, leading to uncertainties in calibration process. In this study, we presented a comprehensive approach for calibrating FY-3D MERSI-II sensor by leveraging an extensive dataset of over 110 000 dark pixel samples collected from three diverse oceanic regions. Through a meticulous data screening process, we identified suitable calibration samples to enhance the robustness of our approach. Employing a radiative transfer model, we conducted forward modeling to calibrate the sensor's observations. Notably, our coefficients of determination ($\\mathit{{R}}^{2}$) establish the efficacy of the Rayleigh scattering method for channels CH09, CH10, and CH11, demonstrating a strong correlation between the spectral range of 443 and 555 nm. The calibration results revealed improved accuracy, with mean absolute BIAS values ranging from 1.329% to 11.265% across different seas, highlighting the wavelength-dependent uncertainty. Our approach effectively addresses the limitations associated with a limited number of referenced points, thereby enhancing the reliability of calibrated results. This research significantly contributes to advancing radiometric calibration for the FY-3D MERSI II sensor by explicitly emphasizing usage of over 110 000 dark pixels during the calibration process. These findings not only enhance the accuracy of satellite-based oceanic observations but also provide valuable insights into calibration methodologies for future studies.",

            "abstract": "The optical components of space-borne sensors are subject to environmental degradation, resulting in changing response characteristics, especially at different wavelengths. Consequently, the implementation of radiometric calibration is imperative to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the sensors. Calibration requires the capability to provide known excitations across the sensor\u2019s spectral range, which is difficult to achieve with the existing means. Thus, this letter proposes a ground-based multiwavelengths active light source for nighttime absolute radiometric calibration (ANARC), capable of generating light with a uniform intensity distribution, three monochromatic wavelengths, and variable intensity within the satellite detection field of view. The absolute intensity of ANARC is precalibrated by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an optical power meter. The atmospheric transmittance during satellite overpasses is measured by co-located lidar systems. We conducted two test experiments targeting the NOAA-20 satellite. The deviations of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) ANARC emissivity from the measured emissivity from the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day Night Band were \u22128.06% and 1.02%, respectively. At the same time, ANARC can cover the dynamic range of the high gain stage in the low light band (LLB) of the moderate resolution spectral imager-low light (MERSI-LL) in FengYun-3 E. This preliminary verification suggests the feasibility of using ANARC for nighttime sensor calibration, which provides a new opportunity to improve radiometric calibration accuracy. It could also facilitate hyperspectral sensor calibration due to three monochromatic wavelengths of ANARC.",

            "abstract": "Due to the continuous degradation of onboard satellite instruments over time, satellite images undergo degradation, necessitating calibration for tasks reliant on satellite data. The previous relative radiometric calibration methods are mainly categorized into traditional methods and deep learning methods. The traditional methods involve complex computations for each calibration, while deep-learning-based approaches tend to oversimplify the calibration process, utilizing generic computer vision models without tailored structures for calibration tasks. In this paper, we address the unique challenges of calibration by introducing a novel approach: a multi-task convolutional neural network calibration model leveraging temporal information. This pioneering method is the first to integrate temporal dynamics into the architecture of neural network calibration models. Extensive experiments conducted on the FY3A/B/C VIRR datasets showcase the superior performance of our approach compared to the existing state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning methods. Furthermore, tests with various backbones confirm the broad applicability of our framework across different convolutional neural networks.",

Consistency of the spatial distribution of the PIPs selected by IR-MAD with pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICSs) given by other scientists demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. The long-term time series trending of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) VIRR reflectance over LIBYA1 and LIBYA4 after intercalibration correction shows that the intercalibrated VIRR has good agreement with MERSI, with a mean bias of less than 1% and an uncertainty of less than 2% for most channels. The approach requires no prior knowledge of the intercalibration targets and extends PICS to the pixel-level targets, which results in more diverse samples, broader dynamic ranges, and lower uncertainty, yielding consistent and reliable long-term intercalibration results.",

            "abstract": "The MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) on board the Fengyun-3D satellite is an advanced imaging instrument with 250/1000 m spatial resolution. This instrument is a valuable resource for terrestrial remote sensing, such as clear-sky surface reflectance products. Clear sky composites are typically generated using fixed and empirical threshold values based on specific land surface type, climate, and weather conditions. Moreover, existing methods usually require cloud masks, which can be inaccurate and affect clear sky composites. We took inspiration from natural language processing and viewed the time-series reflectance data as per-pixel temporal sequences. A new self-tuning approach transforms the temporal reflectance data to contextualized embeddings in a high-dimensional feature space through pretraining, followed by a classification layer that is fine-tuned by a few labeled data to identify scene ID mask (cloud shadow, clear sky, thin cloud, and thick cloud). We then proposed a compositing strategy that takes into account the spatial connectivity and temporal consistency of clear-sky pixels. Comprehensive evaluations, including visual assessment, annual temporal profiles of NDVI/NDWI at a site scale, and NDVI spatial distribution at a national scale, of the proposed approach applied on 250 m bands were conducted by comparing it with four typical compositing methods (CCRS-BH, CCRS-FH, MaxNDVI, and MinRed), as well as the MODIS clear sky products. The proposed approach outperforms the four typical compositing methods and achieves a similar product level to MODIS composited products but with a higher spatial resolution.",

            "abstract": "This study explores a new scheme to retrieve the global aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land for the advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II) aboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite based on the dark target (DT) algorithm. The main improvement is that the global surface reflectance (SR) model nonlinearly varies with the solar zenith angle and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIswir) is made, which is more complex relative to that of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) operational algorithm. Our AOD retrievals are compared with an aerosol robotic network (AERONET) AOD and cross evaluated with Aqua/MODIS, respectively. Overall, the MERSI-II retrieved results over the global scale have good consistency with the AERONET observations; on the same condition, the percentage of matchups within the expected error (EE: \u00b10.05 \u00b1 0.15AOD) is 67.06%, which is slightly lower than the percentage of MODIS (79.84%). On a spatial scale, the coverage of MERSI-II retrievals at one granule is significantly higher than that of MODIS, which is related to successful inversion of haze pixels and has retrieval ability in urban, grassland, and other surface types. The monthly mean AOD values retrieved by MERSI-II are close to those of MODIS, indicating that MERS-II has similar quantitative capability and application potential as its international counterparts.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, medium-resolution satellites have played a pivotal role in ecosystem research, providing global daily coverage. The Moderate-Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI), a key component of Fengyun-3 (FY-3) series, exhibits excellent data continuity over three generations, delivering large-scale spatial-continuous documents. However, images from sensors with wide view angles often exhibit considerable artifacts due to restriction of multidetector parallel scanning system and multi-interferences from space. Furthermore, MERSI introduces known observation redundancy across pixels and tracks, presenting significant yet untapped potential for image quality optimization and restoration from Level-1 (L1) to downstream products. We proposed a spatial quality enhancement (SPQE) algorithm for MERSI-like sensors. It has demonstrated effectiveness in generating detailed spatial information images without artifacts while retaining spectral information with four main procedures: 1) atmospheric correction inspired by Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); 2) optimization of geolocation sample methods through linear extrapolation, elimination of bow-tie effect through empirical screening; 3) utilization of observation redundancy from adjacent pixels through a restoration algorithm based on Thomas method; and 4) exploitation of observation redundancy from adjacent tracks via relative registration and information stack sampling. To illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of SPQE, the widely used MERSI-II images are tested. Examples of SPQE-derived surface reflectance (SR) imagery across global scenarios are provided. We evaluate the potential effect of SPQE on reflectance and ecological applications. Extensive validation demonstrates that downstream products generated by SPQE-derived images exhibit a stronger correlation with classic products and public datasets compared to nonenhanced images. Given its performance and versatility, we anticipate the widespread use of SPQE for similar sensors.",
