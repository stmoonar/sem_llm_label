            "title": "Sequence Learning with Side Dependencies",
            "abstract": "Numerous sequence learning models have been proposed to capture the sequential dependencies and have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of applications. In addition to sequential dependencies, real sequential data also exhibits side dependencies. For example, in session-based recommender systems, items are naturally related because of their intrinsic attributes such as brand, category, and function; and in document modeling, words are inherently related since they can share similar syntactic functions. Intuitively, such side dependencies provide rich information beyond the sequence (or sequential dependencies); thus they have great potential to advance traditional sequence modeling. However, research on exploring side dependencies for sequence learning is rather limited. In this paper, we study the problem of sequence learning with side dependencies. In particular, we propose a novel sequence learning framework SEE, which can simultaneously capture both sequential and side dependencies. Extensive experiments on real sequential data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework SEE and the advantages of integrating side dependencies.",

            "abstract": "Mobile applications for weight loss are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost-effective and wide-reaching characteristics. The self-monitoring function in these applications plays a crucial role in gaining success of weight loss intervention, as it can give tailored feedback and motivation enhancement to users. Thus, by shortening such self-reinforcement cycle and providing timely feedback at much earlier stage, precisely predicting user\u2019s future weight will significantly improve the effectiveness of existing applications. In this paper, we investigate the weight loss prediction problem by leveraging social-temporal information, which is abundant and ubiquitous in weight loss applications. The study is based on a large-scale dataset from a weight loss application BOOHEE, which contains more than 9 million users with a timespan of multiple years (from 2012 to 2015). Our analysis validates the existence of social-temporal correlations in weight loss and modeling these correlations leads to a novel weight LOss prediction framework in Social-Temporal context LOST. The experimental results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments have been conducted to understand the importance of social-temporal correlations in weight loss prediction.",

            "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proven to be effective in modeling sequential data and they have been applied to boost a variety of tasks such as document classification, speech recognition and machine translation. Most of existing RNN models have been designed for sequences assumed to be identically and independently distributed (i.i.d). However, in many real-world applications, sequences are naturally linked. For example, web documents are connected by hyperlinks; and genes interact with each other. On the one hand, linked sequences are inherently not i.i.d., which poses tremendous challenges to existing RNN models. On the other hand, linked sequences offer link information in addition to the sequential information, which enables unprecedented opportunities to build advanced RNN models. In this paper, we study the problem of RNN for linked sequences. In particular, we introduce a principled approach to capture link information and propose a linked Recurrent Neural Network (LinkedRNN), which models sequential and link information coherently. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets from multiple domains and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

            "title": "Opinions Power Opinions: Joint Link and Interaction Polarity Predictions in Signed Networks",
            "abstract": "Social media has been widely adopted by online users to share their opinions. Among users in signed networks, two types of opinions can be expressed. They can directly specify opinions to others via establishing positive or negative links; and they also can give opinions to content generated by others via a variety of social interactions such as commenting and rating. Intuitively these two types of opinions should be related. For example, users are likely to give positive (or negative) opinions to content from those with positive (or negative) links; and users tend to create positive (or negative) links with those that they frequently positively (or negatively) interact with. Therefore we can leverage one type of opinions to power the other. Meanwhile, they can enrich each other that can help mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start problems in the corresponding predictive tasks - link and interaction polarity predictions, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint link and interaction polarity predictions in signed networks. We first understand the correlation between these two types of opinions; and then propose a framework that can predict signed links and the polarities of interactions simultaneously. The experimental results on a real-world signed network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

            "abstract": "It has become increasingly popular to use mobile social networking applications for weight loss and management. Users can not only create profiles and maintain their records but also perform a variety of social activities that shatter the barrier to share or seek information. Due to the open and connected nature, these applications produce massive data that consists of rich weight-related information which offers immense opportunities for us to enable advanced research on weight loss. In this paper, we conduct the initial investigation to understand weight loss with a large-scale mobile social networking dataset with near 10 million users. In particular, we study individual and social factors related to weight loss and reveal a number of interesting findings that help us build a meaningful model to predict weight loss automatically. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the significance of social factors in weight loss.",

            "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are ubiquitous around the world, and to make matters worse, many fatal diseases are related to obesity. Consequently, an increasing effort have been made to help people lose weight. Due to the cost-effective, convenient and wide-reaching features of mobile applications, smart phone weight loss applications have gained great public attention. Such weight loss applications typically allow users to track their weight change, serving as an important positive reinforcement factor to motivate more effort to lose weight. In addition, social networking functions in the weight loss applications make it very convenient for users to share or seek information as well as support from peers. Past studies have proven the effectiveness of mobile applications in weight loss intervention. However, such intervention cannot perform in a timely manner as users can only adjust their weight loss behaviors according to the history weight records. Thus, the effectiveness of weight loss applications will be largely improved if users' future weight can be automatically predicted. Although future weight prediction is challenging, the results of our previous work based on a large-scale dataset with near 10 million users have shown that by leveraging the abundant social information available in most weight loss applications, we can build a prediction model demonstrating a strong performance. However, due to the nature of pilot study, the model built in our previous work is relatively simple as it can only capture linear mappings from a small portion of users who provide complete information. Thus, in our ongoing research, we aim to build a stronger non-linear model which is able to incorporate users who only provide partial information. As a large portion of users in the dataset only provide partial information, we believe the new model that utilizes much more data will achieve significantly better performance than the previous one.",
