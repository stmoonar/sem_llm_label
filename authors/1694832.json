            "title": "ReCLIP: Refine Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training with Source Free Domain Adaptation",
            "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) such as CLIP [32] have demonstrated noteworthy zero-shot classification capability, achieving 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without seeing any examples. However, while applying CLIP to a downstream target domain, the presence of visual and text domain gaps and cross-modality misalignment can greatly impact the model performance. To address such challenges, we propose ReCLIP, a novel source-free domain adaptation method for VLMs, which does not require any source data or target labeled data. ReCLIP first learns a projection space to mitigate the misaligned visual-text embeddings and learns pseudo labels. Then, it deploys cross-modality self-training with the pseudo labels to update visual and text encoders, refine labels and reduce domain gaps and misalignment iteratively. With extensive experiments, we show that ReCLIP outperforms all the baselines significantly and improves the average accuracy of CLIP from 69.83% to 74.94% on 22 image classification benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VidQA) evaluation metrics have been limited to a single-word answer or selecting a phrase from a fixed set of phrases. These metrics limit the VidQA models\u2019 application scenario. In this work, we leverage semantic roles derived from video descriptions to mask out certain phrases, to introduce VidQAP which poses VidQA as a fill-in-the-phrase task. To enable evaluation of answer phrases, we compute the relative improvement of the predicted answer compared to an empty string. To reduce the influence of language bias in VidQA datasets, we retrieve a video having a different answer for the same question. To facilitate research, we construct ActivityNet-SRL-QA and Charades-SRL-QA and benchmark them by extending three vision-language models. We perform extensive analysis and ablative studies to guide future work. Code and data are public.",

            "abstract": "Phrase grounding models localize an object in the image given a referring expression. The annotated language queries available during training are limited, which also limits the variations of language combinations that a model can see during training. In this paper, we study the case applying objects without labeled queries for training the semi-supervised phrase grounding. We propose to use learned location and subject embedding predictors (LSEP) to generate the corresponding language embeddings for objects lacking annotated queries in the training set. With the assistance of the detector, we also apply LSEP to train a grounding model on images without any annotation. We evaluate our method based on MAttNet on three public datasets: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg. We show that our predictors allow the grounding system to learn from the objects without labeled queries and improve accuracy by 34.9% relatively with the detection results.",

            "abstract": "Abstract : The VEIL (Vision Environment Integrating Loom) project integrated advanced Knowledge Representation (KR) technology (Loom) with image understanding technology. The major innovations are as follows: 1) Use of declarative knowledge (as opposed to procedural knowledge) in vision systems made extending the recognition capabilities of the software easier. 2) Facilitated integrating high-level vision routines (recognizing sequences of scenes) with low-level routines that recognize picture elements. 3) Declarative knowledge enabled interaction with the system at a level of abstraction appropriate to the domain task. This included associating collateral information with the objects recognized by low-level image understanding programs. Loom is a powerful tool incorporating strong, frame-based representation capabilities, explicit term subsumption, and several powerful reasoning paradigms (including logical deduction, object-oriented methods, and production rules). Loom also provides knowledge representation integrity through consistency checking and truth maintenance. Infusing these facilities into the vision problem area, where strong KR capabilities have not yet been developed, significantly altered and improved the methodology for constructing vision systems. Finally, Loom was interfaced to a variety of vision processing elements to provide a new tool of extended capabilities. The result is a powerful software environment for the development of vision systems.",

First, VEIL reasons at a semantic level about scene information, using a knowledge base that augments an original image understanding (IU) model (representing the output of a lower level IU system) with structural and functional information. VEIL can apply both spatial and temporal reasoning to detect event sequences that span multiple images. Second, VEIL provides users with an intelligent interface that relies on a library of domainspecific terms and queries to provide a domain-specific browsing and query facility. The library, implemented in Loom as an extensible ontology of domain specific definitions and queries, can be easily customized by a user to facilitate analysis activities.",

Oblique views present new difficulties over the more conventional nadir views that are now handled by our system. A hierarchical perceptual grouping process is used to generate 2-D roof hypotheses from fragmented linear features of the input image. Good hypotheses are selected and then verified by the corresponding shadow and walls. The 3-D description of a building is reconstructed from the roof hypothesis and the associated shadow and wall evidence. Results on several oblique view images are shown and the evaluation of the results is presented also.",

The primary reasons for this restriction are the uniformity of computation within the selected application and the availability of machines on which to perform the research. But, restriction one is artificial in that a multitude of applications exist that require nonuniform processing. The computer vision community provides an abundance of nice examples. Furthermore, with the current onslaught of building block components and architectures, restriction two is slowly being pushed aside. The authors describe an approach to analyzing an application with the goal of specifying an appropriate parallel processor architecture that will facilitate efficient application development (hardware and software), execution, and maintenance. Various typical computer vision tasks to illustrate the techniques are also discussed.",
