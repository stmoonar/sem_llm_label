            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have been pivotal in supporting downstream applications like search, recommendation, and question answering, among others. Therefore, knowledge graphs have naturally become key enabling technologies in e-Commerce platforms. Developing a high coverage product knowledge graph is more challenging than generic knowledge graphs. The highly specific and complex domain, the sparsity of training data, along with the dynamic taxonomies and product types, can constrain the resulting knowledge graphs. In this tutorial we present best practices and ML innovations in industry towards building a scalable product knowledge graph. Contributions in this domain benefit from the general literature in areas including information extraction and data mining, tailored to address the specific characteristics of e-Commerce platforms.",

            "title": "PAM: Understanding Product Images in Cross Product Category Attribute Extraction",
            "abstract": "Understanding product attributes plays an important role in improving online shopping experience for customers and serves asan integral part for constructing a product knowledge graph. Most existing methods focus on attribute extraction from text description or utilize visual information from product images such as shape and color. Compared to the inputs considered in prior works, a product image in fact contains more information, represented by a rich mixture of words and visual clues with a layout carefully designed to impress customers. This work proposes a more inclusive framework that fully utilizes these different modalities for attribute extraction.Inspired by recent works in visual question answering, we use a transformer based sequence to sequence model to fuse representations of product text, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tokens and visual objects detected in the product image. The framework is further extended with the capability to extract attribute value across multiple product categories with a single model, by training the decoder to predict both product category and attribute value and conditioning its output on product category. The model provides a unified attribute extraction solution desirable at an e-commerce platform that offers numerous product categories with a diverse body of product attributes. We evaluated the model on two product attributes, one with many possible values and one with a small set of possible values, over 14 product categories and found the model could achieve 15% gain on the Recall and 10% gain on the F1 score compared to existing methods using text-only features.",

            "title": "AutoKnow: Self-Driving Knowledge Collection for Products of Thousands of Types",
            "abstract": "Can one build a knowledge graph (KG) for all products in the world? Knowledge graphs have firmly established themselves as valuable sources of information for search and question answering, and it is natural to wonder if a KG can contain information about products offered at online retail sites. There have been several successful examples of generic KGs, but organizing information about products poses many additional challenges, including sparsity and noise of structured data for products, complexity of the domain with millions of product types and thousands of attributes, heterogeneity across large number of categories, as well as large and constantly growing number of products. We describe AutoKnow, our automatic (self-driving) system that addresses these challenges. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. AutoKnow is (a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, (b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions (many domains, many products, and many attributes), and (c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs. AutoKnow has been operational in collecting product knowledge for over 11K product types.",
