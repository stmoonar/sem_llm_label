            "title": "Rumor Detection with Hierarchical Representation on Bipartite Adhoc Event Trees",
            "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has caused tremendous effects on information propagation, raising extreme challenges in detecting rumors. Existing rumor detection methods typically exploit the reposting propagation of a rumor candidate for detection by regarding all reposts to a rumor candidate as a temporal sequence and learning semantics representations of the repost sequence. However, extracting informative support from the topological structure of propagation and the influence of reposting authors for debunking rumors is crucial, which generally has not been well addressed by existing methods. In this article, we organize a claim post in circulation as an ad hoc event tree, extract event elements, and convert it into bipartite ad hoc event trees in terms of both posts and authors, i.e., author tree and post tree. Accordingly, we propose a novel rumor detection model with hierarchical representation on the bipartite ad hoc event trees called BAET. Specifically, we introduce word embedding and feature encoder for the author and post tree, respectively, and design a root-aware attention module to perform node representation. Then we adopt the tree-like RNN model to capture the structural correlations and propose a tree-aware attention module to learn tree representation for the author tree and post tree, respectively. Extensive experimental results on two public Twitter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BAET in exploring and exploiting the rumor propagation structure and the superior detection performance of BAET over state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

            "abstract": "Twitter is a popular platform for disseminating health information. Unfortunately, there is no clear way to monitor how information reaches the intended audiences. This research examined how health information spreads on Twitter and identified factors that affect the spreading within the Philippines. We created a process whose goal is to generate results that experts can deeply analyze to reveal insights into information spread. The process consists of crawling Twitter data, transforming the data and applying sentiment identification and topic modeling, and performing Social Network Analysis (SNA). The SNA graphs allow for the study of the interactions between Twitter users and tweets while giving insights on influential users and topics discussed across clusters. The study explored and utilized tuberculosis-related tweets. Though the algorithms were meant to process tweets written in Filipino, the process is mostly language-agnostic and can be applied to Twitter data. The results also help in identifying strategies that can improve health information spread on Twitter in the Philippines.",

The present study employed a mathematical model among firms engaging in subcontracting in search of an optimal schedule in the manufacture of the product and distribution of production time involved with an objective of obtaining a maximum profit. The constraints in the mathematical formulation included the total demand, processing capacity, available supply, processing rate, and time.

            "abstract": "We propose a process graph (P-graph) approach to develop ecosystem networks from knowledge of the properties of the component species. Originally developed as a process engineering tool for designing industrial plants, the P-graph framework has key advantages over conventional ecological network analysis (ENA) techniques. A P-graph is a bipartite graph consisting of two types of nodes, which we propose to represent components of an ecosystem. Compartments within ecosystems (e.g., organism species) are represented by one class of nodes, while the roles or functions that they play relative to other compartments are represented by a second class of nodes. This bipartite graph representation enables a powerful, unambiguous representation of relationships among ecosystem compartments, which can come in tangible (e.g., mass flow in predation) or intangible form (e.g., symbiosis). For example, within a P-graph, the distinct roles of bees as pollinators for some plants and as prey for some animals can be explicitly represented, which would not otherwise be possible using conventional ENA. After a discussion of the mapping of ecosystems into P-graph, we also discuss how this framework can be used to guide understanding of complex networks that exist in nature. Two component algorithms of P-graph, namely maximal structure generation (MSG) and solution structure generation (SSG), are shown to be particularly useful for ENA. This method can be used to determine the (a) effects of loss of specific ecosystem compartments due to extinction, (b) potential efficacy of ecosystem reconstruction efforts, and (c) maximum sustainable exploitation of human ecosystem services by humans. We illustrate the use of P-graph for the analysis of ecosystem compartment loss using a small-scale stylized case study, and further propose a new criticality index that can be easily derived from SSG results. Author summary In this study, we propose the novel application of the process graph (P-graph) methodology to the analysis of ecological networks. P-graph was originally developed for engineering design problems; in our work, we show how its five axioms and two algorithms \u2013 maximal structure generation (MSG) and solution structure generation (SSG) can be adapted to the problem of understanding complex interactions in ecosystems. The methodology allows multiple types of interactions among ecosystem components to be handled simultaneously based on representation as a bipartite graph. Complete network structures can be deduced from knowledge of local interactions of components using MSG. Finally, all structurally feasible networks of viable ecosystems can be identified with SSG. We illustrate the features of the P-graph methodology with a stylized illustrative example.",

Each subsystem, in the form of S-system, is represented by an embedded chemical reaction network (CRN), defined by a species subset and a reaction subset induced by the set of digraph vertices of the subsystem. For the embedded networks of S-system, we showed interesting structural properties and proved that all S-system CRNs (with at least two species) are discordant. Analyzing the subsystems as subnetworks, where arcs between vertices belonging to different subsystems are retained, we formed a digraph homomorphism from the corresponding subnetworks to the embedded networks. Lastly, we explored the modularity concept of CRN in the context of the digraph.",
