            "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers \u2018knowledge-guided\u2019 data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive \u2018Knowledge Network\u2019. KnowEnG adheres to \u2018FAIR\u2019 principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

            "abstract": "Abstract InvertNet, one of the three Thematic Collection Networks (TCNs) funded in the first round of the U.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections (ADBC) program, is tasked with providing digital access to ~60 million specimens housed in 22 arthropod (primarily insect) collections at institutions distributed throughout the upper midwestern USA. The traditional workflow for insect collection digitization involves manually keying information from specimen labels into a database and attaching a unique identifier label to each specimen. This remains the dominant paradigm, despite some recent attempts to automate various steps in the process using more advanced technologies. InvertNet aims to develop improved semi-automated, high-throughput workflows for digitizing and providing access to invertebrate collections that balance the need for speed and cost-effectiveness with long-term preservation of specimens and accuracy of data capture. The proposed workflows build on recent methods for digitizing and providing access to high-quality images of multiple specimens (e.g., entire drawers of pinned insects) simultaneously. Limitations of previous approaches are discussed and possible solutions are proposed that incorporate advanced imaging and 3-D reconstruction technologies. InvertNet couples efficient digitization workflows with a highly robust network infrastructure capable of managing massive amounts of image data and related metadata and delivering high-quality images, including interactive 3-D reconstructions in real time via the Internet.",

            "abstract": "We obtained the output characteristics in wurtzite Al0.15Ga0.85N/GaN MODFETs with the full band Monte Carlo method. The gate lengthLg and the channel lengthLDS in the device are 0.2 \u00b5m and 0.4 \u00b5m, respectively. In the output characteristics we found a differential negative resistance effect. That is, asVGS is a constant, initially,IDS increases with increasingVDS. WhenVDS exceeds a certain critical value,IDS decreases with increasingVDS. The analysis for velocity-field characteristics in wurtzite GaN, the distributions of the electric field and the electron velocity in the two dimensional electron gas channel indicates that the differential negative resistance effect of the electron average velocity results in the differential negative resistance effect of the output characteristics. The transient transport also is related to the differential negative resistance effect of the output characteristics. This effect only can be observed in the devices with very short channel.",

            "abstract": "In typical particle simulations applied to device problems, it is desirable to simulate regions having widely different carrier concentration with similar resolution of the energy distribution function. Standard Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms use variance reduction techniques to limit the statistical error in regions of low carrier density. Here, we describe an alternative approach, based on a local iterative MC algorithm, where the carrier distribution is calculated by an iterative application of short MC steps for test particles that represent the local density. The information obtained from the local MC procedure is used to compute directly the evolution of the energy distribution function from an initial distribution until a steady state is reached. This local iterative procedure treats the charge density, represented by the MC, with arbitrary weight, independently of the actual number of physical particles corresponding to a given density. In this way, the computation time is the same for low- or high-density regions, leading to a more efficient use of computational resources and uniform statistical error. The computation time can be reduced also by tabulating and using more than once the results from the local MC steps in the overall iteration process. While the local iterative MC approach does not have the generality of the standard MC technique, much faster calculations and greatly reduced statistical noise are possible when applied to steady-state problems. We present a number of simulation examples for silicon devices, which illustrate the capabilities of the approach.",

            "abstract": "We present a fast and robust method for the full-band solution of Schrodinger's equation on a grid, with the goal of achieving a more complete description of high energy states and realistic temperatures. Using Fast Fourier Transforms, Schrodinger's equation in the one band approximation can be expressed as an iterative eigenvalue problem for arbitrary shapes of the conduction band. The resulting eigenvalue problem can then be solved using Krylov subspace methods as Arnoldi iteration. We demonstrate the algorithm by presenting an example concerning non-parabolic effects in an ultra-small Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor quantum cavity at room-temperature. For this structure, we show that the non-parabolicity of the conduction band results in a significant lowering of high-energy electronic states.",

            "abstract": "The recent increase in the performance of commodity computer hardware, along with the constant cost reductions, has created a very favorable medium for building cluster based distributed parallel machines. Such machines have been demonstrated to reach performance levels of supercomputers designed just a few years ago. During the same period, the developments in parallel programming techniques, standardization of message passing libraries and their interfaces with high-level programming languages made it possible to use distributed parallel computers for solving computationally very intensive problems. The uninterrupted reduction of device dimensions has highlighted issues such as granularity of doping, actual shape of device boundaries in the third dimension, and proper modeling of carrier-carrier interactions due to very high fields in such devices. Also a new interest in development of inherently 3-D dimensional devices, due to performance and integration density considerations has been created. We have designed and implemented a cluster based parallel 3-D Monte Carlo simulation core for Si semiconductor devices. The main focus has been on enabling the simulator to perform well on a cluster of commodity computers. The networking hardware used on such a distributed computer typically leads to a significantly larger communications cost (larger latency and reduce bandwidth) than that of a specially built parallel computer. For this reason code has been designed in such a way to minimize unstructured communication requirements among nodes.",
