            "title": "An Assistant Diagnosis System for Parkinson Disease Based on Mutual Information and Genetic Algorithm",
            "abstract": "With an aggravated aging population, Parkinson disease has become a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of elderly people, therefore, it is crucial to establish a companion diagnostic system that can provide timely and accurate diagnostic results for patients with Parkinson disease. To address the problems of misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis of Parkinson disease, an auxiliary diagnosis system for Parkinson disease (MI-GA) based on mutual information and genetic algorithm is proposed. In the feature extraction process, genetic algorithm is used to approximate the unimportant features in the clinical features of patients. And the mutual information is introduced to assign weights for each clinical feature, and then the weights are applied to the KNN algorithm to achieve the accuracy of the diagnosis results. The experimental performance indicated that the method can significantly alleviate the noise data disturbance of the clinical features of Parkinson disease and improve the accuracy of Parkinson's disease diagnosis.",

            "title": "Deep Knowledge Tracking Based on Double Attention Mechanism and Cognitive Difficulty",
            "abstract": "Knowledge tracking is a key technique of artificial intelligence-assisted education to predict learners' future answers based on their historical learning interaction data. Current studies on knowledge-tracking models are well-established, but often with limited accuracy in tracking learners' knowledge acquisition. This paper proposes a knowledge tracking model based on double attention mechanism and cognitive difficulty, to achieve a better understanding of the relationships among knowledge concepts, their influence on learners' knowledge acquisition and the impact of absolute difficulty and the relative difficulty of the exercises based on learners' cognitive levels. We designed a mechanism to explore the correlation between exercises-knowledge concepts and knowledge concepts-knowledge concepts, and dynamically analyze the cognitive difficulty of exercises. The model also introduces a multi-headed self-attentive mechanism to capture the long-term dependence of learners' knowledge acquisition. The results suggest that the model can effectively track learners' knowledge acquisition.",
