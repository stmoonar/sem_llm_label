            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022.",

            "abstract": "The Superfacility model is designed to leverage HPC for experimental science. It is more than simply a model of connected experiment, network, and HPC facilities; it encompasses the full ecosystem of infrastructure, software, tools, and expertise needed to make connected facilities easy to use. The three-year Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Superfacility project was initiated in 2019 to coordinate work being performed at LBNL to support this model, and to provide a coherent and comprehensive set of science requirements to drive existing and new work. A key component of the project was the in-depth engagements with eight science teams that represent challenging use cases across the DOE Office of Science. By the close of the project, we met our project goal by enabling our science application engagements to demonstrate automated pipelines that analyze data from remote facilities at large scale, without routine human intervention. In several cases, we have gone beyond demonstrations and now provide production-level services. To achieve this goal, the Superfacility team developed tools, infrastructure, and policies for near-real-time computing support, dynamic high-performance networking, data management and movement tools, API-driven automation, HPC-scale notebooks via Jupyter, authentication using Federated Identity and container-based edge services supported. The lessons we learned during this project provide a valuable model for future large, complex, cross-disciplinary collaborations. There is a pressing need for a coherent computing infrastructure across national facilities, and LBNL's Superfacility project is a unique model for success in tackling the challenges that will be faced in hardware, software, policies, and services across multiple science domains.",

            "abstract": "HMMER3 is biological sequence search suite used in significant volume on systems hosted at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. This heavy usage has revealed ways that HMMER3 underutilizes the resources available in an HPC environment such as the Manycore architecture Knights Landing processors available in the Cori supercomputer. After rigorous performance analysis it was determined that the thread architecture of HMMER3 is the most promising optimization target to increase throughput and efficiency. A refactoring effort introduced an OpenMP task based threading design, the ability to respond to imbalanced computation with work stealing, and input buffering to eliminate a large amount of redundant parsing. These efforts have been implemented and in production on Cori for over a year. In that time they have simplified the best practice for use of HMMER3 in workflows and conserved hundreds of thousands of CPU hours.",

            "abstract": "The HMMER website, available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/, provides access to the protein homology search algorithms found in the HMMER software suite. Since the first release of the website in 2011, the search repertoire has been expanded to include the iterative search algorithm, jackhmmer. The continued growth of the target sequence databases means that traditional tabular representations of significant sequence hits can be overwhelming to the user. Consequently, additional ways of presenting homology search results have been developed, allowing them to be summarised according to taxonomic distribution or domain architecture. The taxonomy and domain architecture representations can be used in combination to filter the results according to the needs of a user. Searches can also be restricted prior to submission using a new taxonomic filter, which not only ensures that the results are specific to the requested taxonomic group, but also improves search performance. The repertoire of profile hidden Markov model libraries, which are used for annotation of query sequences with protein families and domains, has been expanded to include the libraries from CATH-Gene3D, PIRSF, Superfamily and TIGRFAMs. Finally, we discuss the relocation of the HMMER webserver to the European Bioinformatics Institute and the potential impact that this will have.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of using resampling methods on phylogenetic data is to estimate the confidence value of branches. In recent years, bootstrapping and jackknifing are the two most popular resampling schemes which are widely used in biological reserach. However, for gene order data, traditional bootstrap procedures can not be applied because gene order data is viewed as one character with various states. Experience in the biological community has shown that jackknifing is a useful means of determining the confidence value of a gene order phylogeny. When genomes are distant, however, applying jackknifing tends to give low confidence values to many valid branches, causing them to be mistakenly removed. In this paper, we propose a new method that overcomes this disadvantage of jackknifing and achieves better accuracy and confidence values for gene order data. Compared to jackknifing, our experimental results show that the proposed method can produce phylogenies with lower error rates and much stronger support for good branches. We also establish a theoretic lower bound regarding how many genes should be isolated, which is confirmed empirically.",

            "abstract": "Great advancements have been achieved in phylogenetic reconstruction from genome rearrangement events but difficult problems still remain. One challenge is to deal with more complex events such as gene insertions and deletions such that we can analyze both gene order and gene content changes in tandem. We propose the concept of prosthetic chromosomes to incorporate these events into the standard double-cut-and-join (DCJ) distance metric widely used for genome scale rearrangement analysis. In this paper, we also introduce our new software package Egchel (Extended Gene Content HEuristic Layer) which implements this prosthetic chromosome model. Egchel can modify unequal content gene order data sets such that they are able to be analyzed by existing phylogenetic tree builders specifically designed to work with equal content gene order data sets. When compared to existing pair wise analysis of unequal content data sets, Egcheluses a global approach, produces substantially more accurate phylogenetic trees, and is significantly more likely to generate the best available tree.",

            "title": "Improving Reversal Median Computation Using Commuting Reversals and Cycle Information",
            "abstract": "In the past decade, genome rearrangements have attracted increasing attention from both biologists and computer scientists as a new type of data for phylogenetic analysis. Methods for reconstructing phylogeny from genome rearrangements include distance-based methods, MCMC methods, and direct optimization methods. The latter, pioneered by Sankoff and extended with the software suites GRAPPA and MGR, is the most accurate approach, but is very limited due to the difficulty of its scoring procedure--it must solve multiple instances of the reversal median problem to compute the score of a given tree. The reversal median problem is known to be NP-hard and all existing solvers are extremely slow when the genomes are distant. In this paper, we present a new reversal median heuristic for unichromosomal genomes. The new method works by applying sets of reversals in a batch where all such reversals both commute and do not break the cycle of any other. Our testing using simulated datasets shows that this method is much faster than the leading solver for difficult datasets with only a slight accuracy penalty, yet retains better accuracy than other heuristics with comparable speed, and provides the additional option of searching for multiple medians. This method dramatically increases the speed of current direct optimization methods and enables us to extend the range of their applicability to organellar and small nuclear genomes with more than 50 reversals along each edge.",

            "abstract": "The \"double-cut-and-join\" (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement proposed by Yancopoulos et al. uses the single DCJ operation to account for all genome rearrangement events. Given three signed permutations, the DCJ median problem is to find a fourth permutation that minimizes the sum of the pairwise DCJ distances between it and the three others. In this paper, we present a branch-and-bound method that provides accurate solution to the multichromosomal DCJ median problems. We conduct extensive simulations and the results show that the DCJ median solver performs better than other median solvers for most of the test cases. These experiments also suggest that DCJ model is more suitable for real datasets where both reversals and transpositions occur.",
