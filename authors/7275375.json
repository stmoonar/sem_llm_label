            "abstract": "Long-tailed data distribution (i.e., minority classes occupy most of the data, while most classes have very few samples) is a common problem in image classification. The existing deferred re-balancing methods suffer from low accuracy for tail classes due to their bias towards head classes. In this paper, we find that properly adjusting the momentum can significantly improve the performance for class-imbalanced tasks, which provides a novel perspective to solve this thorny problem. Based on this finding, we propose a new way to calculate a distribution-aware momentum (DAM) based on the data distribution to avoid bias towards head classes. Furthermore, we design a multi-expert network (MEN) to designate each expert to focus on different tail classes. We achieve new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018 for image classification.",

            "abstract": "In recommender systems, knowledge graph (KG) can offer critical information that is lacking in the original user-item interaction graph (IG). Recent process has explored this direction and shows that contrastive learning is a promising way to integrate both. However, we observe that existing KG-enhanced recommenders struggle in balancing between the two contrastive views of IG and KG, making them sometimes even less effective than simply applying contrastive learning on IG without using KG. In this paper, we propose a new contrastive learning framework for KG-enhanced recommendation. Specifically, to make full use of the knowledge, we construct two separate contrastive views for KG and IG, and maximize their mutual information; to ease the contrastive learning on the two views, we further fuse KG information into IG in a one-direction manner.Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, compared to the state-of-the-art.

            "abstract": "In the real world, the data collected naturally are often long-tailed, which inevitably leads to class-imbalanced prediction and performance degradation. As a simple and effective data augmentation method, Mixup has been proven to be beneficial for the tail class in recent long-tail learning studies. However, samples selected by Mixup are still imbalanced, which could exacerbate the imbalance problem. Existing work always considers adjusting the input distribution to alleviate this problem, while this may lead to over-fitting in the tail class. In this paper, we detail the theoretical analysis of the data imbalance caused by Mixup, and propose a novel Balanced Mixup (BaMix) loss function from the output perspective. By adding a balance term, we theoretically prove the BaMix loss can overcome the imbalance caused by Mixup. In the experiments, our solution achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.",

            "abstract": "Neural graph collaborative filtering has received great recent attention due to its power of encoding the high-order neighborhood via the backbone graph neural networks. However, their robustness against noisy user-item interactions remains largely unexplored. Existing work on robust collaborative filtering mainly improves the robustness by denoising the graph structure, while recent progress in other fields has shown that directly adding adversarial perturbations in the embedding space can significantly improve the model robustness. In this work, we propose to improve the robustness of neural graph collaborative filtering via both denoising in the structure space and perturbing in the embedding space. Specifically, in the structure space, we measure the reliability of interactions and further use it to affect the message propagation process of the backbone graph neural networks; in the embedding space, we add in-distribution perturbations by mimicking the behavior of adversarial attacks and further combine it with contrastive learning to improve the performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the recent neural graph collaborative filtering methods especially when there are injected noisy interactions in the training data.",

            "abstract": "Active learning tries to learn an effective model with lowest labeling cost. Most existing active learning methods work in a synchronous way, which implies that the label querying can be performed only after the model updating in each iteration. While training models is usually time-consuming, it may lead to serious latency between two queries, especially in the crowdsourcing environments where there are many online annotators working simultaneously. This will significantly decrease the labeling efficiency and strongly limit the application of active learning in real tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-server multi-worker framework for asynchronous active learning in the distributed environment. By maintaining two shared pools of candidate queries and labeled data respectively, the servers, the workers and the annotators efficiently corporate with each other without synchronization. Moreover, diverse sampling strategies from distributed workers are incorporated to select the most useful instances for model improving. Both theoretical analysis and experimental study validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Sina Weibo, an online social network site, has gained popularity but lost it in recent years. Now we are still curious on the number of posts in Sina Weibo in its golden age. Besides checking this number in Sina's operating results, we aim to estimate and verify this number through measurement by using statistical techniques. Existing approaches on measurement always rely on the supported streaming application programming interface (API) which provides proportional sampling. However no such API is available for Sina Weibo. Instead, Sina provides a public timeline API which provides non-proportional sampling but always returns a (nearly) fixed number of samples. In this paper, we present a novel method utilizing this API and estimate the number of posts in Sina Weibo in its golden age.",

            "abstract": "Since first appeared in the Google Galaxy Nexus in 2011, the barometer sensor now becomes a very common sensor on smartphones. Although the barometer is originally used to improve the efficiency of GPS positioning, developers and users have gradually discovered that it is very useful in many other applications, such as localization/navigation, sport/activity and weather/travel. Unfortunately, the current smartphone barometer measurement is not accurate, and efficiently calibrating a large number of smartphone barometers is rather challenging. In this paper, we proposed CBSC, an effective and accurate approach to calibrate a large number of barometer sensors automatically. CBSC makes use of low-power barometer on smartphone and does not require reference points or human assistant. We concentrate on the user encounter detection based on sensor data correlation, peer to peer calibration based on encounter event, and calibrate all barometers by solving a minimum dominating set problem. The field studies show that CBSC can get an accuracy of within 0.1 hpa in 82% cases. Compared to the traditional works, CBSC is more practical and the accuracy is enough for most application scenarios.",

However, with the increasing pervasiveness of smartphones and abundant mobile applications, developers and users have gradually discovered that the height is more useful than altitude in many situations. The height is often a relative value, which is the vertical distance to the ground rather than the vertical distance to sea level, and we believe that it is useful in many applications, such as localization/navigation, sport/health and tourism/travel. In this paper, we first carried out a nation-wide online survey to confirm the desirability for the height information in mobile applications, and the result is positive. Then, we proposed HiMeter, an effective and accurate approach to calculating the height of the smartphone. HiMeter makes use of a low-power barometer on the smartphone and does not require GPS or back-server support. We concentrate on the vertical moving pattern of the user and designed several novel techniques, resulting in HiMeter not needing any reference points, and the complex process of calculating the absolute altitude can be avoided. The field studies show that HiMeter can achieve an accuracy of within 5 m in 90% of cases indoors and an accuracy of 10 m in 83% of cases outdoors. Compared to the existing works, HiMeter is more accurate and practical and is more suitable for usage in many mobile applications.",
