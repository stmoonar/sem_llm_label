            "title": "Modular ontology modeling",
            "abstract": "Reusing ontologies for new purposes, or adapting them to new use-cases, is frequently difficult. In our experiences, we have found this to be the case for several reasons: (i) differing representational granularity in ontologies and in use-cases, (ii)\u00a0lacking conceptual clarity in potentially reusable ontologies, (iii) lack and difficulty of adherence to good modeling principles, and (iv) a lack of reuse emphasis and process support available in ontology engineering tooling. In order to address these concerns, we have developed the Modular Ontology Modeling (MOMo) methodology, and its supporting tooling infrastructure, CoModIDE (the Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE \u2013 \u201ccommodity\u201d). MOMo builds on the established eXtreme Design methodology, and like it emphasizes modular development and design pattern reuse; but crucially adds the extensive use of graphical schema diagrams, and tooling that support them, as vehicles for knowledge elicitation from experts. In this paper, we present the MOMo workflow in detail, and describe several useful resources for executing it. In particular, we provide a thorough and rigorous evaluation of CoModIDE in its role of supporting the MOMo methodology\u2019s graphical modeling paradigm. We find that CoModIDE significantly improves approachability of such a paradigm, and that it displays a high usability.",

            "abstract": ". This position paper presents a set of design principles for ontology engineering for model-driven applications. Ontologies sometimes need to be translated into less expressive languages and be used by software developers with limited ontology experience. In such scenarios, one may wish to refrain from using OWL features or design patterns that increase interpretation or software implementation complexity. I introduce practical considerations inherent in those scenarios, and discuss their modeling consequences.",

            "title": "CoModIDE - The Comprehensive Modular Ontology Engineering IDE",
            "abstract": "Ontology engineering is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring an intimate knowledge of description logic and predicting non-local effects of different ontological commitments. Acquiring such expertise is a major hurdle in the adoption of semantic web technologies. As proliferating our techniques and technologies is a major goal of the semantic web community [4], there have been many attempts to improve the accessibility of ontology engineering through intuitive methodologies and robust tooling. Pattern-based modular ontology engineering coupled with a graphical modelling paradigm can help bridge this gap [6,9]. A pattern-based modular ontology is an ontology that retains the patterning metadata associated with the modules that comprise it. An ontology design pattern (ODP) is a small, reusable set of concepts and axioms that solve a problem that is invariant across many domains. To create such ontologies, some methodologies have been developed (e.g. Extreme Design [2,3] and the eponymous Modular Ontology Modelling [5]). Unfortunately, neither methodology focuses on the retention of pattern metadata, but how to identify and instantiate patterns. Over the years, there have been various approaches for representing ontologies visually and enabling their development through a graphical modelling interface, e.g., VOWL, the visual syntax for OWL and its WebVOWL editor [7,11]; OWLGrEd, a graph editor that displays a UML inspired subsumption hierarchy [1]; Gra.fo, an online, collaborative platform that supports ontology development via lightweight semantics and a modified VOWL syntax.; and OWLAx [8] and SDOnt [10], Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 plugins that enable axiom generation from schema diagrams, and diagram generation from axioms, respectively. However, none of these tools offer any support for graphical pattern discovery or instantiation. To combine pattern-based modular ontology engineering with the graphical modelling paradigm, we have developed the Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE (CoModIDE, pronounced \u2018commodity\u2019), a plug-in for the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 platform.",
