            "abstract": "Current centralized e-commerce platforms have lock-in effects. These platform-binding effects are constructed towards the content creator and the consumer in the process of purchasing digital content. The lock-in effects originate from the situation in which a centralized platform offers a variety of value propositions towards content creators and consumers. In this article, we propose an approach to decentralize the value propositions and distribute them among different actors. Therefore, we develop a decentralized application based on smart contracts and the blockchain technology. With that application as a base, we offer an alternative to the current centralized marketplaces without lock-in effects.",

In this context, we propose to apply Process Mining as a means to understand and quantify how a Distributed Ledger is de facto utilized. This paper introduces a heuristic Process Mining approach for extracting high level process structures from Distributed Ledgers and Decentralized Applications, which can also represent changes over time. The universal approach is demonstrated on the basis of the complete set of all transactions that happened on the Ethereum Blockchain during its first three years. Events, cases, and activities allow to compile an evolutionary time line, which shows the Blockchain evolving from its early stages to broader adoption. Furthermore, measures of activity significance, confidence, and process complexity are used to compile dependency graphs, which represent process transitions.",

At the center of the method lies the comparison of subsequences. To achieve this, they first get assigned to their Hidden Markov Models using the Baum-Welch algorithm. Next, those models are described by an approximating representation of the probability distributions they define. Finally, this representation is then analyzed with the help of some clustering technique or other outlier detection tool and anomalies are detected. Clearly, HMMs could be substituted by some other appropriate model, e.g. some other dynamic Bayesian network. Our learning algorithm is unsupervised, so it doesn't require the labeling of large amounts of data. The usability of this method is demonstrated by applying it to synthetic and real-world syslog data.",

            "abstract": "Ubiquitous computing and location-based services are key enablers for gaining novel insights into human movement behavior on a large scale. When searching for patterns in movement behavior, several approaches have been proposed to compare location trajectories or semantic overlaps. This paper introduces the notion of mobility prototypes, which describe human mobility behavior at a macroscopic level and express its most significant characteristics. Based on a dataset of coarse spatiotemporal data from almost 4000 mobile users of a location-based service over a period of 14 days, we outline a comprehensive and systematic pipeline for processing and exploiting mobility traces and provide insights into the mobility behavior in the city of Berlin. We present a framework to characterize individual users precisely by employing a novel combination of discriminative features capturing the macroscopic mobility behavior, without revealing their identity or actual whereabouts, and define mobility prototypes by constructing clusters of users. The results yield valuable insights into the variety of human mobility and open up new possibilities for future mobile services.",

Similar to web analytics systems, positioning data can be utilized to count, for example, returning visitors in venues, calculate visit frequencies for certain time intervals, or to identify typical movement paths for different groups of visitors inside and outside buildings. However, a major challenge for location analytics is still to deal with the heterogeneity of data from various positioning systems. In thispaper we present a platform that enables location analytics as a service and copes with the heterogeneous spatiotemporal data of diverse accuracy, frequency, and coverage. Furthermore, it allows to query large positioning datasets according to various data dimensions and metrics. In an additional four-month field trial the applicability of our approach was reviewed using the example of WLAN positioning data from an office environment.",

            "abstract": "A new approach is presented that allows a user agent to compute a compact browser cookie-like character string (called Geocookie) for a third party, whereby for any given geographic location the third party can either infer that the location is definitely not covered by the Geocookie, or it can infer that the location is probably covered by the Geocookie, depending on whether the user agent has or has not included the location beforehand. The approach extends the concept of a Bloom filter and combines it with Geohashes, thus making it possible to store information about visited geographic locations in the filter. Geocookies can be used in many different scenarios for location-based queries and location-based services, whenever a user agent wants to inform a third party about a set of visited locations such that the third party can compile a result that either favors or excludes these locations. In contrast to existing approaches such as session cookies that are mapped to server-sided stored location trajectories, Geocookies provide a compact and privacy-preserving structure which does not reveal the actual set of all visited locations, but provides a one-way check function which can be used by the third party to evaluate given locations against the Geocookie. In addition, Geocookies provide plausible deniability in case of location matches. This paper introduces a formal definition for Geocookies together with a discussion on practical applications and embedding into HTTP headers.",

            "abstract": "Positioning, being one of the main factors shaping services that deliver information to users based on their location, has experienced huge advancements over the past years. Today, the combination of device-centric positioning approaches, such as GPS, and device-assisted approaches, such as Cell-Id and WiFi positioning technologies, has proved to be very popular among mobile platforms. Nevertheless, network-centric positioning approaches have remarkably evolved, and the recently introduced 4G networks offer promising new functionalities supporting the next generation of Location-based Services (LBS). This paper introduces a novel positioning model, X-centric Positioning, which is managed by mobile network operators and is based on a Positioning Enabler platform that dynamically combines both aforementioned positioning approaches. The underlying paradigm of X-centric Positioning facilitates a dynamic utilization of an optimal set of positioning systems, which satisfy the current requirements of operated LBS. X-centric Positioning represents the next positioning generation, enabling realization of a wide range of services such as background tracking, geofencing and location-based messaging. Hence, it overcomes the barriers that have previously restricted the efficient realization of such services. The X-centric Positioning role model is discussed, and the Positioning Enabler architecture is presented.",

A geofence service comprises one or several geographic areas, so called geofences which are associated with actions to be performed, corresponding conditions and related metadata. Our approach defines a formalism of geofence services and their interfaces. Providers can benefit from simple service creation with almost no programming experience and even without the need to provide own infrastructure, because the services are executed mainly on the mobile device and are deployed on the marketplace. From a user\u2019s perspective, the concept provides ease of use e.g. finding services in their local surroundings and running serveral services in one single application, which leads to scale effects through combined processing of position and context. Therefore, we developed a concept for a marketplace providing geofence services that can be implemented by everyone, thus helping to increase the overall usage and integration of proactive location-based services in our daily lives.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Indoor Location-based Services (I-LBS) provide information that is compiled by taking into account the current locations of targets as well as models of surrounding buildings. Beside navigation applications there are lots of other examples on the field of workflow optimization or logistics. A key role among the value chain of I-LBS is a location model provider that delivers topological and geometric information about a building. This includes for example computing the walking distance between two locations, finding certain points of interest or looking up the room name for a target's coordinate, which has been measured by an arbitrary indoor positioning system. Building models have already been studied in the past. However, existing approaches focus either on the visualization of a building or they are intended to support architects in the process of constructing the building. In this paper we identify requirements for future I-LBS and we present a new location model that allows to store both topological and geometric properties of buildings. The model is specified as an application schema for the Geography Markup Language (GML). It enables a location model provider to utilize automatically generated waypoint graphs that can be individually adapted to the requirements of the specific I-LBS. Further more the waypoint graphs can easily be replaced leaving the remaining geometrical and topological properties unchanged. The feasibility of the model for I-LBS as well as different approaches for automated model generation are also demonstrated by a working prototype.",
