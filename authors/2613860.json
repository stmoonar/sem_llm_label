            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph representation learning. Unfortunately, current weight assignment schemes in standard GNNs, such as the calculation based on node degrees or pair-wise representations, can hardly be effective in processing the networks with heterophily, in which the connected nodes usually possess different labels or features. Existing heterophilic GNNs tend to ignore the modeling of heterophily of each edge, which is also a vital part in tackling the heterophily problem. In this paper, we firstly propose a heterophily-aware attention scheme and reveal the benefits of modeling the edge heterophily, i.e., if a GNN assigns different weights to edges according to different heterophilic types, it can learn effective local attention patterns, which enable nodes to acquire appropriate information from distinct neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Heterophily-Aware Graph Attention Network (HA-GAT) by fully exploring and utilizing the local distribution as the underlying heterophily, to handle the networks with different homophily ratios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HA-GAT, we analyze the proposed heterophily-aware attention scheme and local distribution exploration, by seeking for an interpretation from their mechanism. Extensive results demonstrate that our HA-GAT achieves state-of-the-art performances on eight datasets with different homophily ratios in both the supervised and semi-supervised node classification tasks.",

            "title": "Graph Neural Networks without Propagation",
            "abstract": "Due to the simplicity, intuition and explanation, most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed by following the pipeline of message passing. Although they achieve superior performances in many tasks, propagation-based GNNs possess three essential drawbacks. Firstly, the propagation tends to produce smooth effect, which meets the inductive bias of homophily, and causes two serious issues: over-smoothing issue and performance drop on networks with heterophily. Secondly, the propagations to each node are irrelevant, which prevents GNNs from modeling high-order relation, and cause the GNNs fragile to the attributes noises. Thirdly, propagation-based GNNs may be fragile to topology noise, since they heavily relay on propagation over the topology. Therefore, the propagation, as the key component of most GNNs, may be the essence of some serious issues in GNNs. To get to the root of these issue, this paper attempts to replace the propagation with a novel local operation. Quantitative experimental analysis reveals: 1) the existence of low-rank characteristic in the node attributes from ego-networks and 2) the performance improvement by reducing its rank. Motivated by this finding, this paper propose the Low-Rank GNNs, whose key component is the low-rank attribute matrix approximation in ego-network. The graph topology is employed to construct the ego-networks instead of message propagation, which is sensitive to topology noises. The proposed Low-Rank GNNs posses some attractive characteristics, including robust to topology and attribute noises, parameter-free and parallelizable. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance, robustness to noises and universality of the proposed Low-Rank GNNs.",

            "abstract": "This paper focuses on an important type of black-box attacks, i.e., transfer-based adversarial attacks, where the adversary generates adversarial examples by a substitute (source) model and utilize them to attack an unseen target model, without knowing its information. Existing methods tend to give unsatisfactory adversarial transferability when the source and target models are from different types of DNN architectures (e.g. ResNet-18 and Swin Transformer). In this paper, we observe that the above phenomenon is induced by the output inconsistency problem. To alleviate this problem while effectively utilizing the existing DNN models, we propose a common knowledge learning (CKL) framework to learn better network weights to generate adversarial examples with better transferability, under fixed network architectures. Specifically, to reduce the model-specific features and obtain better output distributions, we construct a multi-teacher framework, where the knowledge is distilled from different teacher architectures into one student network. By considering that the gradient of input is usually utilized to generated adversarial examples, we impose constraints on the gradients between the student and teacher models, to further alleviate the output inconsistency problem and enhance the adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed work can significantly improve the adversarial transferability.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of the image generation technologies, the malicious abuses of the GAN-generated fingerprint images poses a significant threat to the public safety in certain circumstances. Although the existing universal deep forgery detection approach can be applied to detect the fake fingerprint images, they are easily attacked and have poor robustness. Meanwhile, there is no specifically designed deep forgery detection method for fingerprint images. In this paper, we propose the first deep forgery detection approach for fingerprint images, which combines unique ridge features of fingerprint and generation artifacts of the GAN-generated images, to the best of our knowledge. Specifically, we firstly construct a ridge stream, which exploits the grayscale variations along the ridges to extract unique fingerprint-specific features. Then, we construct a generation artifact stream, in which the FFT-based spectrums of the input fingerprint images are exploited, to extract more robust generation artifact features. At last, the unique ridge features and generation artifact features are fused for binary classification (i.e., real or fake). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and robust with low complexities.",

            "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial examples is the key property in practical black-box scenarios. Currently, numerous methods improve the transferability across different models trained on the same modality of data. The investigation of generating video adversarial examples with imagebased substitute models to attack the target video models, i.e., cross-modal transferability of adversarial examples, is rarely explored. A few works on cross-modal transferability directly apply image attack methods for each frame and no factors especial for video data are considered, which limits the cross-modal transferability of adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose an effective cross-modal attack method which considers both the global and local characteristics of video data. Firstly, from the global perspective, we introduce inter-frame interaction into attack process to induce more diverse and stronger gradients rather than perturb each frame separately. Secondly, from the local perspective, we disrupt the inherently local correlation of frames within a video, which prevents black-box video model from capturing valuable temporal clues. Extensive experiments on the UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 validate the proposed method significantly improves cross-modal transferability and even surpasses strong baseline using video models as substitute model.

            "abstract": "By interpreting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the message passing from the spatial perspective, their success is attributed to Laplacian smoothing. However, it also leads to serious over-smoothing issue by stacking many layers. Recently, many efforts have been paid to overcome this issue in semi-supervised learning. Unfortunately, it is more serious in unsupervised node representation learning task due to the lack of supervision information. Thus, most of the unsupervised or self-supervised GNNs often employ \\textit{one-layer GCN} as the encoder. Essentially, the over-smoothing issue is caused by the over-simplification of the existing message passing, which possesses two intrinsic limits: blind message and uniform passing. In this paper, a novel Diverse and Interactive Message Passing (DIMP) is proposed for self-supervised learning by overcoming these limits. Firstly, to prevent the message from blindness and make it interactive between two connected nodes, the message is determined by both the two connected nodes instead of the attributes of one node. Secondly, to prevent the passing from uniformness and make it diverse over different attribute channels, different propagation weights are assigned to different elements in the message. To this end, a natural implementation of the message in DIMP is the element-wise product of the representations of two connected nodes. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the proposed DIMP is equivalent to performing an overlapping community detection via expectation-maximization (EM). Both the objective function of the community detection and the convergence of EM algorithm guarantee that DMIP can prevent from over-smoothing issue. Extensive evaluations on node-level and graph-level tasks demonstrate the superiority of DIMP on improving performance and overcoming over-smoothing issue.",

            "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks have been widely employed for multimodal fusion and embedding. To overcome over-smoothing issue, residual connections, which are designed for alleviating vanishing gradient problem in NNs, are adopted in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to incorporate local node information. However, these simple residual connections are ineffective on networks with heterophily, since the roles of both convolutional operations and residual connections in GNNs are significantly different from those in classic NNs. By considering the specific smoothing characteristic of graph convolutional operation, deep layers in GNNs are expected to focus on the data which can't be properly handled in shallow layers. To this end, a novel and universal Difference Residual Connections (DRC), which feed the difference of the output and input of previous layer as the input of the next layer, is proposed. Essentially, Difference Residual Connections is equivalent to inserting layers with opposite effect (e.g., sharpening) into the network to prevent the excessive effect (e.g., over-smoothing issue) induced by too many layers with the similar role (e.g., smoothing) in GNNs. From the perspective of optimization, DRC is the gradient descent method to minimize an objective function with both smoothing and sharpening terms. The analytic solution to this objective function is determined by both graph topology and node attributes, which theoretically proves that DRC can prevent over-smoothing issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DRC on real networks with both homophily and heterophily, and show that DRC can automatically determine the model depth and be adaptive to both shallow and deep models with two complementary components.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph learning has drawn significant attentions in recent years, due to the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) and the broad applications of heterogeneous information networks. Various heterogeneous graph neural networks have been proposed to generalize GNNs for processing the heterogeneous graphs. Unfortunately, these approaches model the heterogeneity via various complicated modules. This paper aims to propose a simple yet efficient framework to make the homogeneous GNNs have adequate ability to handle heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we propose Relation Embedding based Graph Neural Networks (RE-GNNs), which employ only one parameter per relation to embed the importance of edge type relations and self-loop connections. To optimize these relation embeddings and the other parameters simultaneously, a gradient scaling factor is proposed to constrain the embeddings to converge to suitable values. Besides, we theoretically demonstrate that our RE-GNNs have more expressive power than the meta-path based heterogeneous GNNs. Extensive experiments on the node classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "The current success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) usually relies on loading the entire attributed graph for processing, which may not be satisfied with limited memory resources, especially when the attributed graph is large. This paper pioneers to propose a Binary Graph Convolutional Network (Bi-GCN), which binarizes both the network parameters and input node attributes and exploits binary operations instead of floating-point matrix multiplications for network compression and acceleration. Meanwhile, we also propose a new gradient approximation based back-propagation method to properly train our Bi-GCN. According to the theoretical analysis, our Bi-GCN can reduce the memory consumption by an average of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wang-ieq1-3342224.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>31x for both the network parameters and input data, and accelerate the inference speed by an average of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wang-ieq2-3342224.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>51x, on three citation networks, i.e., Cora, PubMed, and CiteSeer. Besides, we introduce a general approach to generalize our binarization method to other variants of GNNs, and achieve similar efficiencies. Although the proposed Bi-GCN and Bi-GNNs are simple yet efficient, these compressed networks may also possess a potential <italic>capacity problem</italic>, i.e., they may not have enough storage capacity to learn adequate representations for specific tasks. To tackle this <italic>capacity problem</italic>, an Entropy Cover Hypothesis is proposed to predict the lower bound of the width of Bi-GNN hidden layers. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our Bi-GCN and Bi-GNNs can give comparable performances to the corresponding full-precision baselines on seven node classification datasets and verified the effectiveness of our Entropy Cover Hypothesis for solving the <italic>capacity problem</italic>.",
