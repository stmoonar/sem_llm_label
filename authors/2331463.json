            "abstract": "GNNs are powerful models based on node representation learning that perform particularly well in many machine learning problems related to graphs. The major obstacle to the deployment of GNNs is mostly a problem of societal acceptability and trustworthiness, properties which require making explicit the internal functioning of such models. Here, we propose to mine activation rules in the hidden layers to understand how the GNNs perceive the world. The problem is not to discover activation rules that are individually highly discriminating for an output of the model. Instead, the challenge is to provide a small set of rules that cover all input graphs. To this end, we introduce the subjective activation pattern domain. We define an effective and principled algorithm to enumerate activations rules in each hidden layer. The proposed approach for quantifying the interest of these rules is rooted in information theory and is able to account for background knowledge on the input graph data. The activation rules can then be redescribed thanks to pattern languages involving interpretable features. We show that the activation rules provide insights on the characteristics used by the GNN to classify the graphs. Especially, this allows to identify the hidden features built by the GNN through its different layers. Also, these rules can subsequently be used for explaining GNN decisions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show highly competitive performance, with up to 200% improvement in fidelity on explaining graph classification over the SOTA methods.",

            "abstract": "Activation of the autonomic nervous system is a primary characteristic of human hedonic responses to sensory stimuli. For smells, general tendencies of physiological reactions have been described using classical statistics. However, these physiological variations are generally not quantified precisely; each psychophysiological parameter has very often been studied separately and individual variability was not systematically considered. The current study presents an innovative approach based on data mining, whose goal is to extract knowledge from a dataset. This approach uses a subgroup discovery algorithm which allows extraction of rules that apply to as many olfactory stimuli and individuals as possible. These rules are described by intervals on a set of physiological attributes. Results allowed both quantifying how each physiological parameter relates to odor pleasantness and perceived intensity but also describing the participation of each individual to these rules. This approach can be applied to other fields of affective sciences characterized by complex and heterogeneous datasets.",

            "abstract": "Software applications, particularly Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, are crucial to the day-to-day operations of many industries, where it is essential to maintain these systems effectively and reliably. In response, Artificial Intelligence for Operations Systems (AIOps) has emerged as a dynamic framework, harnessing cutting-edge analytical technologies like machine learning and big data to enhance incident management procedures by detecting, predicting, and resolving issues while pinpointing their root causes. In this paper, we leverage a promising data-driven strategy, dubbed Subgroup Discovery (SD), a data mining method that can automatically mine incident datasets and extract discriminant patterns to identify the root causes. However, current SD solutions have limitations in handling complex target concepts with multiple attributes organized hierarchically. We illustrate this scenario by examining the case of Java out-of-memory incidents among several possible applications. We have a dataset that describes these incidents, including their topology and the types of Java objects occupying memory when it reaches saturation, with these types arranged hierarchically. This scenario inspires us to propose a novel Subgroup Discovery approach that can handle complex target concepts with hierarchies. To achieve this, we design a new Subgroup Discovery framework along with a pattern syntax and a quality measure that ensure the identified subgroups are relevant, non-redundant, and resilient to noise. To achieve the desired quality measure, we use the Subjective Interestingness model that incorporates prior knowledge about the data and promotes patterns that are both informative and surprising relative to that knowledge. We apply this framework to investigate out-of-memory errors and demonstrate its usefulness in root-cause diagnosis. Notably, this paper stands out as a contribution to both Data Mining and Java memory analysis research. To validate the effectiveness of our approach and the quality of the retrieved patterns, we present an empirical study conducted on a real-world scenario from our ERP system.",

            "abstract": "We consider day-ahead electricity price forecasting on the European market. In this market, participants can offer electricity for sale or purchase for a specific price by submitting overnight orders. Market operators determine the market clearing price \u2013 the price at which the amount of electricity supplied equals the amount of electricity demanded \u2013 using the Euphemia balancing algorithm. EUPHEMIA is a quadratic optimization problem that maximizes the social welfare defined as the sum of the supplier surplus and consumer surplus while ensuring a null energy balance. This mechanism deeply influences the price calculation, but has so far been little considered in electricity price forecasting algorithms. Existing models are generally based on identifying relationships between exogenous characteristics (consumption and production forecasts) and the market clearing price to be predicted. A few studies have examined the EUPHEMIA mechanism during prediction, by doing costly manual transformations on order books. In this article, we overcome this limitation by considering the pricing mechanism during model training. For this, we use a predict-and-optimize strategy with differentiable optimization. We design a fully differentiable and scalable solving method for the EUPHEMIA optimization problem and apply it on real-life data from the European Power Exchange (EPEX). We design different model architectures using our differentiable solver and empirically study the impact of taking into account the optimal calculation of prices within the training of the neural network.",

            "abstract": "The need of predictive maintenance comes with an increasing number of incidents reported by monitoring systems and equipment/software users. In the front line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of severity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective actions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been proposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly limiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model based on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and emphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively reported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent developments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing global explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local explanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with an explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an important number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an original data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining technique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar explanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each group. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give us good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach provides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome explanation.",

            "abstract": "Explainable AI has received a lot of attention over the past decade, with the proposal of many methods explaining black box classifiers such as neural networks. Despite the ubiquity of recommender systems in the digital world, only few researchers have attempted to explain their functioning, whereas it raises e.g., ethical issues. Indeed, recommender systems direct user choices to a large extent and their impact is important as they give access to only a small part of the range of items (e.g., products and/or services), as the submerged part of the iceberg. Consequently, they limit access to other resources. The potentially negative effects of these systems have been pointed out as phenomena like echo chambers and winner-take-all effects, because the internal logic of these systems is to likely enclose the consumer in a \"dej\u00b4 a vu\" loop. Therefore, it is crucial to provide explanations` of such recommender systems and to identify the user data that led the system to make a specific recommendation. This makes it possible to evaluate recommender systems not only regarding their efficiency (i.e., their capability to recommend an item that was actually chosen by the user), but also w.r.t. the diversity, relevance and timeliness of the active data used to make the recommendation. In this paper, we propose a deep analysis of 7 state-of-the-art models learnt on 6 datasets based on the identification of the items or the sequences of items actively used by the models. The proposed method, which is based on subgroup discovery with different pattern languages (i.e., itemsets and sequences), provides interpretable explanations of the recommendations \u2013 useful to compare different models and explain the reasons behind the recommendation to the user.",

            "abstract": "Concepts are often described in terms of positive integer-valued attributes that are organized in a hierarchy. For example, cities can be described in terms of how many places there are of various types (e.g. nightlife spots, residences, food venues), and these places are organized in a hierarchy (e.g. a Portuguese restaurant is a type of food venue). This hierarchy imposes particular constraints on the values of related attributes---e.g. there cannot be more Portuguese restaurants than food venues. Moreover, knowing that a city has many food venues makes it less surprising that it also has many Portuguese restaurants, and vice versa. In the present paper, we attempt to characterize such concepts in terms of so-called contrastive antichains: particular kinds of subsets of their attributes and their values. We address the question of when a contrastive antichain is interesting, in the sense that it concisely describes the unique aspects of the concept, and this while duly taking into account the known attribute dependencies implied by the hierarchy. Our approach is capable of accounting for previously identified contrastive antichains, making iterative mining possible. Besides the interestingness measure, we also present an algorithm that scales well in practice, and demonstrate the usefulness of the method in an extensive empirical results section.",

            "abstract": "Event detection is one of the most important research topics in social media analysis. Despite this interest, few researchers have addressed the problem of identifying geolocated events in an unsupervised way, and none includes user interests during the process. In this paper, we tackle the problem of local event detection from social media data. We present a method to automatically identify events by evaluating the burstiness of hashtags in a geographical area and a time interval, and at the same time integrating user feedback. We devise two algorithms to discover user-driven events. The first one relies on an exact enumeration process, while the other directly samples the space of events. In our empirical study, we provide evidence that geolocated events cannot be detected by non location-aware methods. We also show that our methods (i) outperform by a factor of two to several orders of magnitude state-of-the-art methods designed to discover geolocated events, (ii) are more robust to noise, and (iii) produce high quality events with respect to user interests.",

            "abstract": "An important goal in researching the biology of olfaction is to link the perception of smells to the chemistry of odorants. In other words, why do some odorants smell like fruits and others like flowers? While the so-called stimulus-percept issue was resolved in the field of color vision some time ago, the relationship between the chemistry and psycho-biology of odors remains unclear up to the present day. Although a series of investigations have demonstrated that this relationship exists, the descriptive and explicative aspects of the proposed models that are currently in use require greater sophistication. One reason for this is that the algorithms of current models do not consistently consider the possibility that multiple chemical rules can describe a single quality despite the fact that this is the case in reality, whereby two very different molecules can evoke a similar odor. Moreover, the available datasets are often large and heterogeneous, thus rendering the generation of multiple rules without any use of a computational approach overly complex. We considered these two issues in the present paper. First, we built a new database containing 1689 odorants characterized by physicochemical properties and olfactory qualities. Second, we developed a computational method based on a subgroup discovery algorithm that discriminated perceptual qualities of smells on the basis of physicochemical properties. Third, we ran a series of experiments on 74 distinct olfactory qualities and showed that the generation and validation of rules linking chemistry to odor perception was possible. Taken together, our findings provide significant new insights into the relationship between stimulus and percept in olfaction. In addition, by automatically extracting new knowledge linking chemistry of odorants and psychology of smells, our results provide a new computational framework of analysis enabling scientists in the field to test original hypotheses using descriptive or predictive modeling.",

            "abstract": "Subgroup discovery (SD) is the task of discovering interpretable patterns in the data that stand out w.r.t. some property of interest. Discovering patterns that accurately discriminate a class from the others is one of the most common SD tasks. Standard approaches of the literature are based on local pattern discovery, which is known to provide an overwhelmingly large number of redundant patterns. To solve this issue, pattern set mining has been proposed: instead of evaluating the quality of patterns separately, one should consider the quality of a pattern set as a whole. The goal is to provide a small pattern set that is diverse and well-discriminant to~the target class. In this work, we introduce a novel formulation of the task of diverse subgroup set discovery where both discriminative power and diversity of the subgroup set are incorporated in the same quality measure. We propose an efficient and parameter-free algorithm dubbed FSSD and based on a greedy scheme. FSSD uses several optimization strategies that enable to efficiently provide a high quality pattern set in a short amount of time.",

            "abstract": "Pattern mining over data streams is critical to a variety of applications such as understanding and predicting weather phenomena or outdoor surveillance. Most of the current techniques attempt to discover relationships between time-point events but are not practical for discovering dependencies over interval-based events. In this work, we present a new approach to mine dependencies between streams of interval-based \nevents that links two events if they occur in a similar manner, one being often followed by the other one after a certain time interval in the \ndata. The proposed method is robust to temporal variability of events and determines the most appropriate time intervals whose validity is assessed by a Chi2 test. As several intervals may redundantly describe the same dependency, the approach retrieves only the most speci c intervals with respect to a dominance relationship over temporal dependencies, and thus avoids the classical problem of pattern flooding in data mining. The TEDDY algorithm, TEmporal Dependency DiscoverY, prunes the search space while guaranteeing the discovery of all valid and signifi cant temporal dependencies. We present empirical results on simulated and real-life data to show the scalability and the robustness of our approach. The \ndependency relationships defi ne a graph that supports intelligent analysis as illustrated by two case studies: Outdoor surveillance of a building via \nvideo camera and motion sensors, and assistance for road deicing operations based on the humidity and temperature measurements at the urban \nscale. These applications demonstrate the e\u000eficiency and the e\u000bfectiveness of our approach.",

We define an efficient algorithm devoted to the extraction of \u03b4-free sequential patterns.

Such descriptors are of two types: 1) the vertex attributes that convey the information of the vertices themselves and 2) some topological properties used to describe the connectivity of the vertices. These descriptors are mostly of numerical or ordinal types and their similarity can be captured by quantifying their covariation. Mining topological patterns relies on frequent pattern mining and graph topology analysis to reveal the links that exist between the relation encoded by the graph and the vertex attributes. We propose three interestingness measures of topological patterns that differ by the pairs of vertices considered while evaluating up and down co-variations between vertex descriptors. An efficient algorithm that combines search and pruning strategies to look for the most relevant topological patterns is presented. Besides a classical empirical study, we report case studies on four real-life networks showing that our approach provides valuable knowledge.",

We consider the so-called relational dynamic oriented graphs that can be encoded as n-ary relations with n \u2265 3 and thus represented by Boolean tensors. Two dimensions are used to encode the graph adjacency matrices and at least one other denotes time. We design the pattern domain of multi-dimensional association rules, i.e., non trivial extensions of the popular association rules that may involve subsets of any dimensions in their antecedents and their consequents. First, we design new objective interestingness measures for such rules and it leads to different approaches for measuring the rule confidence. Second, we must compute collections of a priori interesting rules. It is considered here as a post-processing of the closed patterns that can be extracted efficiently from Boolean tensors. We propose optimizations to support both rule extraction scalability and non redundancy. We illustrate the added-value of this new data mining task to discover patterns from a real-life relational dynamic graph.",

It relies on a new pattern detection method that crucially needs for sophisticated post processing and visualization. A topological pattern is defined as a set of vertex attributes and topological properties (i.e., properties that characterize the role of a vertex within a graph) that strongly co-vary over the vertices of the graph. For instance, such a pattern in a co-authorship attributed graph where vertices represent authors, edges encode coauthor ship, and vertex attributes reveal the number of publications in several journals, could be \"the higher the number of publications in IEEE ICDM, the higher the closeness centrality of the vertex within the graph\". Two different ways of navigation through the topological patterns and the related graph data are provided to the end-user. We exploit graph visualization and exploration techniques from the open platform Gephi. As an illustrative scenario, we consider a co-autorship attributed graph built from DBLP digital library and a video has been produced that describe the main possibilities of the TopGraphVisualizer software.",

We build upon such a formalization to design more expressive local patterns in this special case of dynamic graph where the set of vertices remains unchanged though edges that connect them may appear or disappear at the different timestamps. To design the pattern domain of the so-called disjunctive rules, we have to design (a) the pattern language, (b) interestingness measures which serve as the counterpart of the popular support and confidence measures in standard association rules, and (c) an efficient algorithm that may compute every rule that satisfies some primitive constraints like minimal frequencies or minimal confidences. The approach is tested on real datasets and we discuss the expressivity and the relevancy of some computed disjunctive rules.",

Nevertheless, the extremely large collection of generated patterns hampers the end-user interpretation and the deep understanding of the knowledge revealed by the whole collection of patterns. The key idea of this paper is to summarize the contrasts of a dataset in order to provide understandable characterizations of data classes. We first introduce a novel framework, called recursive pattern mining, for only discovering few as well as relevant patterns. We demonstrate that this approach encompasses usual pattern mining framework and we study its key properties. Then, we use recursive pattern mining for extracting k recursive emerging patterns. Taken together, these patterns form a REP k-summary which summarizes the contrasts of the dataset. Finally, we validate our approach on benchmarks and real-world applications on the biological domain, showing the efficiency and the usefulness of the approach.",

            "abstract": "Pattern discovery is at the core of numerous data mining tasks. Although many methods focus on efficiency in pattern mining, they still suffer from the problem of choosing a threshold that influences the final extraction result. The goal of our study is to make the results of pattern mining useful from a user-preference point of view. To this end, we integrate into the pattern discovery process the idea of skyline queries in order to mine skyline patterns in a threshold-free manner. Because the skyline patterns satisfy a formal property of dominations, they not only have a global interest but also have semantics that are easily understood by the user. In this work, we first establish theoretical relationships between pattern condensed representations and skyline pattern mining. We also show that it is possible to compute automatically a subset of measures involved in the user query which allows the patterns to be condensed and thus facilitates the computation of the skyline patterns. This forms the basis for a novel approach to mining skyline patterns. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach over several data sets including a use case from chemo informatics and show that small sets of dominant patterns are produced under various measures.",

We study the generalization of association rule mining within arbitrary n-ary relations and thus Boolean tensors instead of Boolean matrices. Indeed, many datasets of interest correspond to relations whose number of dimensions is greater or equal to 3. However, just a few proposals deal with rule discovery when both the head and the body can involve subsets of any dimensions. A challenging problem is to provide a semantics to such generalized rules by means of objective interestingness measures that have to be carefully designed. Therefore, we discuss the need for different generalizations of the classical confidence measure. We also present the first algorithm that computes, in such a general framework, every rule that satisfies both a minimal frequency constraint and minimal confidence constraints. The approach is tested on real datasets (ternary and 4-ary relations). We report on a case study that deals with analyzing a dynamic graph thanks to rules.",

            "abstract": "Data mining methods that exploit graph/network have become quite popular and a timely challenge is to consider the discovery of dynamic properties in evolving graphs or networks. In this paper, we consider the dynamic oriented graphs that can be encoded as n-ary relations with n \u2264 3 such that we have a least 3 dimensions: the dimensions of departure (tail) and arrival (head) vertices plus the time dimension. In other terms, it encodes the sequence of adjacency matrices of the graph. In such datasets, we propose a new semantics for inter-dimensional rules in dynamic graphs. We define rules that may involve subsets of any dimensions in their antecedents and their consequents and we propose the new objective interestingness measure called the exclusive confidence.We introduce a first algorithm for computing such inter-dimensional rules and we illustrate the added-value of exclusive confidence for supporting the discovery of relevant rules from a real-life dynamic graph.",

            "abstract": "Multidimensional databases have been designed to provide decision makers with the necessary tools to help them understand their data. This framework is different from transactional data as the datasets contain huge volumes of historicized and aggregated data defined over a set of dimensions that can be arranged through multiple levels of granularities. Many tools have been proposed to query the data and navigate through the levels of granularity. However, automatic tools are still missing to mine this type of data in order to discover regular specific patterns. In this article, we present a method for mining sequential patterns from multidimensional databases, at the same time taking advantage of the different dimensions and levels of granularity, which is original compared to existing work. The necessary definitions and algorithms are extended from regular sequential patterns to this particular case. Experiments are reported, showing the significance of this approach.",

A typical example concerns the social network of collaborating researchers where additional information concern the main publication targets (preferred conferences or journals) for each author. We investigate the extraction of sets of dense subgraphs such that the vertices in all subgraphs of a set share a large enough set of labels. As a first step, we consider here the special case of dense subgraphs that are cliques. We proposed a method to compute all maximal homogeneous clique sets that satisfy user-defined constraints on the number of separated cliques, on the size of the cliques, and on the number of labels shared by all the vertices. The empirical validation illustrates the scalability of our approach and it provides experimental feedback on two real datasets, more precisely an annotated social network derived from the DBLP database and an enriched biological network concerning protein-protein interactions. In both cases, we discuss the relevancy of extracted patterns thanks to available domain knowledge.",
