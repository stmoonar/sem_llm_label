            "title": "3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)",
            "abstract": "The International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023) is now running its third edition. The Sci-K workshop is a venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines (including, but not limited to, Digital Libraries, Information Extraction, Machine Learning, Semantic Web, Knowledge Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Science of Science, Scientometrics and Bibliometrics), as well as professionals from the industry, to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the production and consumption of Scientific Knowledge Graphs and assessing the research impact. The workshop has called for high-quality submissions around the three main themes of research, related to scientific knowledge: representation, discovery, and assessment. In response to the call for papers, the workshop has received outstanding submissions from researchers in 15 different countries: United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, India, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ethiopia, and Norway. Each paper was reviewed at least by three members of the programme committee. Given the quality and the interesting topics covered by the submissions, we accepted 10 papers. Sci-K 2023 builds on two previous successful editions and keeps attracting a combined pool of attendees. The first edition (Sci-K 2021), was held on 13 April 2021 in conjunction with The Web Conference 2021. Its program consisted of two keynote talks, and the presentation of 11 research papers. The second edition (Sci-K 2022) took place on the 26 April 2022 at The Web Conference 2022. The program included the presentation of 5 long papers, 4 short papers, 2 vision papers, 2 keynote speeches and a panel on \u201cWhat\u2019s next after Microsoft Academic Graph?\u201d. The full program as well as the list of accepted papers can be found on the Sci-K website: https://sci-k.github.io/2023/.",

            "abstract": "COVID-19 resulted in an infodemic, which could erode public trust, impede virus containment, and outlive the pandemic itself. The evolving and fragmented media landscape is a key driver of the spread of misinformation. Using misinformation identified by the fact-checking platform by Tencent and posts on Weibo, our results showed that the evolution of misinformation follows an issue-attention cycle, pertaining to topics such as city lockdown, cures, and preventions, and school reopening. Sources of authority weigh in on these topics, but their influence is complicated by peoples' pre-existing beliefs and cultural practices. Finally, social media has a complicated relationship with established or legacy media systems. Sometimes they reinforce each other, but in general, social media may have a topic cycle of its own making. Our findings shed light on the distinct characteristics of misinformation during the COVID-19 and offer insights into combating misinformation in China and across the world at large.",

            "abstract": "Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models have had limited success in predicting Coronoavirus-19 (COVID-19) outcomes using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data partially due to not effectively capturing the inter-connectivity patterns between various data modalities. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes relational learning based on a heterogeneous graph model (HGM) for predicting mortality at different time windows in COVID-19 patients within the intensive care unit (ICU). We utilize the EHRs of one of the largest and most diverse patient populations across five hospitals in major health system in New York City. In our model, we use an LSTM for processing time varying patient data and apply our proposed relational learning strategy in the final output layer along with other static features. Here, we replace the traditional softmax layer with a Skip-Gram relational learning strategy to compare the similarity between a patient and outcome embedding representation. We demonstrate that the construction of a HGM can robustly learn the patterns classifying patient representations of outcomes through leveraging patterns within the embeddings of similar patients. Our experimental results show that our relational learning-based HGM model achieves higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) than both comparator models in all prediction time windows, with dramatic improvements to recall.",

            "title": "Understanding Drug Repurposing From the Perspective of Biomedical Entities and Their Evolution: Bibliographic Research Using Aspirin",
            "abstract": "Background Drug development is still a costly and time-consuming process with a low rate of success. Drug repurposing (DR) has attracted significant attention because of its significant advantages over traditional approaches in terms of development time, cost, and safety. Entitymetrics, defined as bibliometric indicators based on biomedical entities (eg, diseases, drugs, and genes) studied in the biomedical literature, make it possible for researchers to measure knowledge evolution and the transfer of drug research. Objective The purpose of this study was to understand DR from the perspective of biomedical entities (diseases, drugs, and genes) and their evolution. Methods In the work reported in this paper, we extended the bibliometric indicators of biomedical entities mentioned in PubMed to detect potential patterns of biomedical entities in various phases of drug research and investigate the factors driving DR. We used aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as the subject of the study since it can be repurposed for many applications. We propose 4 easy, transparent measures based on entitymetrics to investigate DR for aspirin: Popularity Index (P1), Promising Index (P2), Prestige Index (P3), and Collaboration Index (CI). Results We found that the maxima of P1, P3, and CI are closely associated with the different repurposing phases of aspirin. These metrics enabled us to observe the way in which biomedical entities interacted with the drug during the various phases of DR and to analyze the potential driving factors for DR at the entity level. P1 and CI were indicative of the dynamic trends of a specific biomedical entity over a long time period, while P2 was more sensitive to immediate changes. P3 reflected the early signs of the practical value of biomedical entities and could be valuable for tracking the research frontiers of a drug. Conclusions In-depth studies of side effects and mechanisms, fierce market competition, and advanced life science technologies are driving factors for DR. This study showcases the way in which researchers can examine the evolution of DR using entitymetrics, an approach that can be valuable for enhancing decision making in the field of drug discovery and development.",

            "abstract": "Autism represents a broad group of developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions. It has attracted widespread concern in academia and media. The reported causes of autism have an enormous impact on the people's opinion about autistic patients and various treatments from scientific literature and media news. In this study, we use open information extraction (OIE), a machine reading technique, to automatically extract causal relationships from autism researches and news reports. We explored the differences between the scientific literature and news about the reported etiologies with respect to autism. As a result, we find that scientific papers clearly emphasize physical and biological factors, while the media emphasizes social factors as the perceived cause of autism.",
